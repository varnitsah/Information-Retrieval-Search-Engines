13522705	the country of the blind  and other stories  h g wells        illustration he stopped and then made a dash to escape from their closing ranks       introduction  the enterprise of messrs t nelson  sons and the friendly accommodation of messrs macmillan render possible this collection in one cover of all the short stories by me that i care for any one to read again except for the two series of linked incidents that make up the bulk of the book called tales of space and time no short story of mine of the slightest merit is excluded from this volume many of very questionable merit find a place it is an inclusive and not an exclusive gathering and the task of selection and revision brings home to me with something of the effect of discovery that i was once an industrious writer of short stories and that i am no longer anything of the kind i have not written one now for quite a long time and in the past five or six years i have made scarcely one a year the bulk of the fifty or sixty tales from which this present threeandthirty have been chosen dates from the last century this edition is more definitive than i supposed when first i arranged for it in the presence of so conclusive an ebb and cessation an almost obituary manner seems justifiable  i find it a little difficult to disentangle the causes that have restricted the flow of these inventions it has happened i remark to others as well as to myself and in spite of the kindliest encouragement to continue from editors and readers there was a time when life bubbled with short stories they were always coming to the surface of my mind and it is no deliberate change of will that has thus restricted my production it is rather i think a diversion of attention to more sustained and more exacting forms it was my friend mr cl hind who set that spring going he urged me to write short stories for the pall mall budget and persuaded me by his simple and buoyant conviction that i could do what he desired there existed at the time only the little sketch the jilting of jane included in this volumeat least that is the only tolerable fragment of fiction i find surviving from my prelewishind period but i set myself so encouraged to the experiment of inventing moving and interesting things that could be given vividly in the little space of eight or ten such pages as this and for a time i found it a very entertaining pursuit indeed mr hinds indicating finger had shown me an amusing possibility of the mind i found that taking almost anything as a startingpoint and letting my thoughts play about it there would presently come out of the darkness in a manner quite inexplicable some absurd or vivid little incident more or less relevant to that initial nucleus little men in canoes upon sunlit oceans would come floating out of nothingness incubating the eggs of prehistoric monsters unawares violent conflicts would break out amidst the flowerbeds of suburban gardens i would discover i was peering into remote and mysterious worlds ruled by an order logical indeed but other than our common sanity  the nineties was a good and stimulating period for a shortstory writer mr kipling had made his astonishing advent with a series of little bluegrey books whose covers opened like windowshutters to reveal the dusty sunglare and blazing colours of the east mr barrie had demonstrated what could be done in a little space through the panes of his window in thrums the national observer was at the climax of its career of heroic insistence upon lyrical brevity and a vivid finish and mr frank harris was not only printing good short stories by other people but writing still better ones himself in the dignified pages of the fortnightly review longmans magazine too represented a clientèle of appreciative shortstory readers that is now scattered then came the generous opportunities of the yellow book and the national observer died only to give birth to the new review no short story of the slightest distinction went for long unrecognised the sixpenny popular magazines had still to deaden down the conception of what a short story might be to the imaginative limitation of the common readerand a maximum length of six thousand words short stories broke out everywhere kipling was writing short stories barrie stevenson frankharris max beerbohm wrote at least one perfect one the happy hypocrite henry james pursued his wonderful and inimitable bent and among other names that occur to me like a mixed handful of jewels drawn from a bag are george street morley roberts george gissing ella darcy murray gilchrist e nesbit stephen crane joseph conrad edwin pugh jerome k jerome kenneth graham arthur morrison marriott watson george moore grant allen george egerton henry harland pett ridge w w jacobs who alone seems inexhaustible i dare say i could recall as many more names with a little effort i may be succumbing to the infirmities of middle age but i do not think the present decade can produce any parallel to this list or what is more remarkable that the later achievements in this field of any of the survivors from that time with the sole exception of joseph conrad can compare with the work they did before 1900 it seems to me this outburst of short stories came not only as a phase in literary development but also as a phase in the development of the individual writers concerned  it is now quite unusual to see any adequate criticism of short stories in english i do not know how far the decline in shortstory writing may not be due to that every sort of artist demands human responses and few men can contrive to write merely for a publishers cheque and silence however reassuring that cheque may be a mad millionaire who commissioned masterpieces to burn would find it impossible to buy them scarcely any artist will hesitate in the choice between money and attention and it was primarily for that last and better sort of pay that the short stories of the nineties were written people talked about them tremendously compared them and ranked them that was the thing that mattered  it was not of course all good talk and we suffered then as now from the à priori critic just as nowadays he goes about declaring that the work of suchandsuch a dramatist is all very amusing and delightful but it isnt a play so we had a great deal of talk about the short story and found ourselves measured by all kinds of arbitrary standards there was a tendency to treat the short story as though it was as definable a form as the sonnet instead of being just exactly what any one of courage and imagination can get told in twenty minutes reading or so it was either mr edward garnett or mr george moore in a violently antikipling mood who invented the distinction between the short story and the anecdote the short story was maupassant the anecdote was damnable it was a quite infernal comment in its way because it permitted no defence fools caught it up and used it freely nothing is so destructive in a field of artistic effort as a stock term of abuse anyone could say of any short story a mere anecdote just as anyone can say incoherent of any novel or of any sonata that isnt studiously monotonous the recession of enthusiasm for this compact amusing form is closely associated in my mind with that discouraging imputation one felt hopelessly open to a paralysing and unanswerable charge and ones ease and happiness in the garden of ones fancies was more and more marred by the dread of it it crept into ones mind a distress as vague and inexpugnable as a sea fog on a spring morning and presently one shivered and wanted to go indoorsit is the absurd fate of the imaginative writer that he should be thus sensitive to atmospheric conditions  but after one has died as a maker one may still live as a critic and i will confess i am all for laxness and variety in this as in every field of art insistence upon rigid forms and austere unities seems to me the instinctive reaction of the sterile against the fecund it is the tired man with a headache who values a work of art for what it does not contain i suppose it is the lot of every critic nowadays to suffer from indigestion and a fatigued appreciation and to develop a selfprotective tendency towards rules that will reject as it were automatically the more abundant and irregular forms but this world is not for the weary and in the longrun it is the new and variant that matter i refuse altogether to recognise any hard and fast type for the short story any more than i admit any limitation upon the liberties of the small picture the short story is a fiction that may be read in something under an hour and so that it is moving and delightful it does not matter whether it is as trivial as a japanese print of insects seen closely between grass stems or as spacious as the prospect of the plain of italy from monte mottarone it does not matter whether it is human or inhuman or whether it leaves you thinking deeply or radiantly but superficially pleased some things are more easily done as short stories than others and more abundantly done but one of the many pleasures of shortstory writing is to achieve the impossible  at any rate that is the present writers conception of the art of the short story as the jolly art of making something very bright and moving it may be horrible or pathetic or funny or beautiful or profoundly illuminating having only this essential that it should take from fifteen to fifty minutes to read aloud all the rest is just whatever invention and imagination and the mood can givea vision of buttered slides on a busy day or of unprecedented worlds in that spirit of miscellaneous expectation these stories should be received each is intended to be a thing by itself and if it is not too ungrateful to kindly and enterprising publishers i would confess i would much prefer to see each printed expensively alone and left in a little brownpaper cover to lie about a room against the needs of a quite casual curiosity and i would rather this volume were found in the bedrooms of convalescents and in dentists parlours and railway trains than in gentlemens studies i would rather have it dipped in and dipped in again than read severely through essentially it is a miscellany of inventions many of which were very pleasant to write and its end is more than attained if some of them are refreshing and agreeable to read i have now reread them all and i am glad to think i wrote them i like them but i cannot tell how much the associations of old happinesses gives them a flavour for me i make no claims for them and no apology they will be read as long as people read them things written either live or die unless it be for a place of judgment upon academic impostors there is no apologetic intermediate state  i may add that i have tried to set a date to most of these stories but that they are not arranged in strictly chronological order  h

the jilting of jane   as i sit writing in my study i can hear our jane bumping her way downstairs with a brush and dustpan she used in the old days to sing hymn tunes or the british national song for the time being to these instruments but latterly she has been silent and even careful over her work time was when i prayed with fervour for such silence and my wife with sighs for such care but now they have come we are not so glad as we might have anticipated we should be indeed i would rejoice secretly though it may be unmanly weakness to admit it even to hear jane sing daisy or by the fracture of any plate but one of euphemias best green ones to learn that the period of brooding has come to an end  yet how we longed to hear the last of janes young man before we heard the last of him jane was always very free with her conversation to my wife and discoursed admirably in the kitchen on a variety of topicsso well indeed that i sometimes left my study door openour house is a small oneto partake of it but after william came it was always william nothing but william william this and william that and when we thought william was worked out and exhausted altogether then william all over again the engagement lasted altogether three years yet how she got introduced to william and so became thus saturated with him was always a secret for my part i believe it was at the street corner where the rev barnabas baux used to hold an openair service after evensong on sundays young cupids were wont to flit like moths round the paraffin flare of that centre of high church hymnsinging i fancy she stood singing hymns there out of memory and her imagination instead of coming home to get supper and william came up beside her and said hello hello yourself she said and etiquette being satisfied they proceeded to talk together  as euphemia has a reprehensible way of letting her servants talk to her she soon heard of him he is such a respectable young man maam said jane you dont know ignoring the slur cast on her acquaintance my wife inquired further about this william  he is second porter at maynards the drapers said jane and gets eighteen shillingsnearly a pounda week mm and when the head porter leaves he will be head porter his relatives are quite superior people mm not labouring people at all his father was a greengrosher mm and had a churnor and he was bankrup twice and one of his sisters is in a home for the dying it will be a very good match for me mm said jane me being an orphan girl  then you are engaged to him asked my wife  not engaged maam but he is saving money to buy a ringhammyfist  well jane when you are properly engaged to him you may ask him round here on sunday afternoons and have tea with him in the kitchen for my euphemia has a motherly conception of her duty towards her maidservants and presently the amethystine ring was being worn about the house even with ostentation and jane developed a new way of bringing in the joint so that this gage was evident the elder miss maitland was aggrieved by it and told my wife that servants ought not to wear rings but my wife looked it up in enquire within and mrs motherlys book of household management and found no prohibition so jane remained with this happiness added to her love  the treasure of janes heart appeared to me to be what respectable people call a very deserving young man william maam said jane one day suddenly with illconcealed complacency as she counted out the beer bottles william maam is a teetotaller yes mm and he dont smoke smoking maam said jane as one who reads the heart do make such a dust about beside the waste of money and the smell however i suppose they got to do itsome of them  william was at first a rather shabby young man of the readymade black coat school of costume he had watery gray eyes and a complexion appropriate to the brother of one in a home for the dying euphemia did not fancy him very much even at the beginning his eminent respectability was vouched for by an alpaca umbrella from which he never allowed himself to be parted  he goes to chapel said jane his papa maam  his what jane  his papa maam was church but mr maynard is a plymouth brother and william thinks it policy maam to go there too mr maynard comes and talks to him quite friendly when they aint busy about using up all the ends of string and about his soul he takes a lot of notice do mr maynard of william and the way he saves his soul maam  presently we heard that the head porter at maynards had left and that william was head porter at twentythree shillings a week he is really kind of over the man who drives the van said jane and him married with three children and she promised in the pride of her heart to make interest for us with william to favour us so that we might get our parcels of drapery from maynards with exceptional promptitude  after this promotion a rapidlyincreasing prosperity came upon janes young man one day we learned that mr maynard had given william a book smiles elp yourself its called said jane but it aint comic it tells you how to get on in the world and some what william read to me was lovely maam  euphemia told me of this laughing and then she became suddenly grave do you know dear she said jane said one thing i did not like she had been quiet for a minute and then she suddenly remarked william is a lot above me maam aint he  i dont see anything in that i said though later my eyes were to be opened  one sunday afternoon about that time i was sitting at my writingdesk possibly i was reading a good bookwhen a something went by the window i heard a startled exclamation behind me and saw euphemia with her hands clasped together and her eyes dilated george she said in an awestricken whisper did you see  then we both spoke to one another at the same moment slowly and solemnly a silk hat yellow gloves a new umbrella  it may be my fancy dear said euphemia but his tie was very like yours i believe jane keeps him in ties she told me a little while ago in a way that implied volumes about the rest of your costume the master do wear pretty ties maam and he echoes all your novelties  the young couple passed our window again on their way to their customary walk they were arm in arm jane looked exquisitely proud happy and uncomfortable with new white cotton gloves and william in the silk hat singularly genteel  that was the culmination of janes happiness when she returned mr maynard has been talking to william maam she said and he is to serve customers just like the young shop gentlemen during the next sale and if he gets on he is to be made an assistant maam at the first opportunity he has got to be as gentlemanly as he can maam and if he aint maam he says it wont be for want of trying mr maynard has took a great fancy to him  he is getting on jane said my wife  yes maam said jane thoughtfully he is getting on  and she sighed  that next sunday as i drank my tea i interrogated my wife how is this sunday different from all other sundays little woman what has happened have you altered the curtains or rearranged the furniture or where is the indefinable difference of it are you wearing your hair in a new way without warning me i perceive a change clearly and i cannot for the life of me say what it is  then my wife answered in her most tragic voice george she said that william has not come near the place today and jane is crying her heart out upstairs  there followed a period of silence jane as i have said stopped singing about the house and began to care for our brittle possessions which struck my wife as being a very sad sign indeed the next sunday and the next jane asked to go out to walk with william and my wife who never attempts to extort confidences gave her permission and asked no questions on each occasion jane came back looking flushed and very determined at last one day she became communicative  william is being led away she remarked abruptly with a catching of the breath apropos of tablecloths yes mm she is a milliner and she can play on the piano  i thought said my wife that you went out with him on sunday  not out with him mmafter him i walked along by the side of them and told her he was engaged to me  dear me jane did you what did they do  took no more notice of me than if i was dirt so i told her she should suffer for it  it could not have been a very agreeable walk jane  not for no parties maam  i wish said jane i could play the piano maam but anyhow i dont mean to let her get him away from me shes older than him and her hair aint gold to the roots maam  it was on the august bank holiday that the crisis came we do not clearly know the details of the fray but only such fragments as poor jane let fall she came home dusty excited and with her heart hot within her  the milliners mother the milliner and william had made a party to the art museum at south kensington i think anyhow jane had calmly but firmly accosted them somewhere in the streets and asserted her right to what in spite of the consensus of literature she held to be her inalienable property she did i think go so far as to lay hands on him they dealt with her in a crushingly superior way they called a cab there was a scene william being pulled away into the fourwheeler by his future wife and motherinlaw from the reluctant hands of our discarded jane there were threats of giving her in charge  my poor jane said my wife mincing veal as though she was mincing william its a shame of them i would think no more of him he is not worthy of you  no mm said jane he is weak  but its that woman has done it said jane she was never known to bring herself to pronounce that womans name or to admit her girlishness i cant think what minds some women must haveto try and get a girls young man away from her but there it only hurts to talk about it said jane  thereafter our house rested from william but there was something in the manner of janes scrubbing the front doorstep or sweeping out the rooms a certain viciousness that persuaded me that the story had not yet ended  please mm may i go and see a wedding tomorrow said jane one day  my wife knew by instinct whose wedding do you think it is wise jane she said  i would like to see the last of him said jane  my dear said my wife fluttering into my room about twenty minutes after jane had started jane has been to the boothole and taken all the leftoff boots and shoes and gone off to the wedding with them in a bag surely she cannot mean  jane i said is developing character let us hope for the best  jane came back with a pale hard face all the boots seemed to be still in her bag at which my wife heaved a premature sigh of relief we heard her go upstairs and replace the boots with considerable emphasis  quite a crowd at the wedding maam she said presently in a purely conversational style sitting in our little kitchen and scrubbing the potatoes and such a lovely day for them she proceeded to numerous other details clearly avoiding some cardinal incident  it was all extremely respectable and nice maam but her father didnt wear a black coat and looked quite out of place maam mr piddingquirk  who  mr piddingquirkwilliam that was maamhad white gloves and a coat like a clergyman and a lovely chrysanthemum he looked so nice maam and there was red carpet down just like for gentlefolks and they say he gave the clerk four shillings maam it was a real kerridge they hadnot a fly when they came out of church there was ricethrowing and her two little sisters dropping dead flowers and someone threw a slipper and then i threw a boot  threw a boot jane  yes maam aimed at her but it hit him yes maam hard gev him a black eye i should think i only threw that one i hadnt the heart to try again all the little boys cheered when it hit him  after an intervali am sorry the boot hit him  another pause the potatoes were being scrubbed violently he always was a bit above me you know maam and he was led away  the potatoes were more than finished jane rose sharply with a sigh and rapped the basin down on the table  i dont care she said i dont care a rap he will find out his mistake yet it serves me right i was stuck up about him i ought not to have looked so high and i am glad things are as things are  my wife was in the kitchen seeing to the higher cookery after the confession of the bootthrowing she must have watched poor jane fuming with a certain dismay in those brown eyes of hers but i imagine they softened again very quickly and then janes must have met them  oh maam said jane with an astonishing change of note think of all that might have been oh maam i could have been so happy i ought to have known but i didnt knowyoure very kind to let me talk to you maamfor its hard on me maamits harrrrd  and i gather that euphemia so far forgot herself as to let jane sob out some of the fullness of her heart on a sympathetic shoulder my euphemia thank heaven has never properly grasped the importance of keeping up her position and since that fit of weeping much of the accent of bitterness has gone out of janes scrubbing and brush work  indeed something passed the other day with the butcherboybut that scarcely belongs to this story however jane is young still and time and change are at work with her we all have our sorrows but i do not believe very much in the existence of sorrows that never heal       ii    the cone   the night was hot and overcast the sky redrimmed with the lingering sunset of midsummer they sat at the open window trying to fancy the air was fresher there the trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff and dark beyond in the roadway a gaslamp burnt bright orange against the hazy blue of the evening farther were the three lights of the railway signal against the lowering sky the man and woman spoke to one another in low tones  he does not suspect said the man a little nervously  not he she said peevishly as though that too irritated her he thinks of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel he has no imagination no poetry  none of these men of iron have he said sententiously they have no hearts  he has not she said she turned her discontented face towards the window the distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and grew in volume the house quivered one heard the metallic rattle of the tender as the train passed there was a glare of light above the cutting and a driving tumult of smoke one two three four five six seven eight black oblongseight truckspassed across the dim grey of the embankment and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the throat of the tunnel which with the last seemed to swallow down train smoke and sound in one abrupt gulp  this country was all fresh and beautiful once he said and nowit is gehenna down that waynothing but potbanks and chimneys belching fire and dust into the face of heavenbut what does it matter an end comes an end to all this crueltytomorrow he spoke the last word in a whisper  tomorrow she said speaking in a whisper too and still staring out of the window  dear he said putting his hand on hers  she turned with a start and their eyes searched one anothers hers softened to his gaze my dear one she said and then it seems so strangethat you should have come into my life like thisto open she paused  to open he said  all this wonderful worldshe hesitated and spoke still more softly this world of love to me  then suddenly the door clicked and closed they turned their heads and he started violently back in the shadow of the room stood a great shadowy figuresilent they saw the face dimly in the halflight with unexpressive dark patches under the penthouse brows every muscle in rauts body suddenly became tense when could the door have opened what had he heard had he heard all what had he seen a tumult of questions  the newcomers voice came at last after a pause that seemed interminable well he said  i was afraid i had missed you horrocks said the man at the window gripping the windowledge with his hand his voice was unsteady  the clumsy figure of horrocks came forward out of the shadow he made no answer to rauts remark for a moment he stood above them  the womans heart was cold within her i told mr raut it was just possible you might come back she said in a voice that never quivered  horrocks still silent sat down abruptly in the chair by her little worktable his big hands were clenched one saw now the fire of his eyes under the shadow of his brows he was trying to get his breath his eyes went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had trusted and then back to the woman  by this time and for the moment all three half understood one another yet none dared say a word to ease the pentup things that choked them  it was the husbands voice that broke the silence at last  you wanted to see me he said to raut  raut started as he spoke i came to see you he said resolved to lie to the last  yes said horrocks  you promised said raut to show me some fine effects of moonlight and smoke  i promised to show you some fine effects of moonlight and smoke repeated horrocks in a colourless voice  and i thought i might catch you tonight before you went down to the works proceeded raut and come with you  there was another pause did the man mean to take the thing coolly did he after all know how long had he been in the room yet even at the moment when they heard the door their attitudes  horrocks glanced at the profile of the woman shadowy pallid in the halflight then he glanced at raut and seemed to recover himself suddenly of course he said i promised to show you the works under their proper dramatic conditions its odd how i could have forgotten  if i am troubling you began raut  horrocks started again a new light had suddenly come into the sultry gloom of his eyes not in the least he said  have you been telling mr raut of all these contrasts of flame and shadow you think so splendid said the woman turning now to her husband for the first time her confidence creeping back again her voice just one halfnote too highthat dreadful theory of yours that machinery is beautiful and everything else in the world ugly i thought he would not spare you mr raut its his great theory his one discovery in art  i am slow to make discoveries said horrocks grimly damping her suddenly but what i discover  he stopped  well she said  nothing and suddenly he rose to his feet  i promised to show you the works he said to raut and put his big clumsy hand on his friends shoulder and you are ready to go  quite said raut and stood up also  there was another pause each of them peered through the indistinctness of the dusk at the other two  horrocks hand still rested on rauts shoulder raut half fancied still that the incident was trivial after all but mrs horrocks knew her husband better knew that grim quiet in his voice and the confusion in her mind took a vague shape of physical evil very well said horrocks and dropping his hand turned towards the door  my hat raut looked round in the halflight  thats my workbasket said mrs horrocks with a gust of hysterical laughter their hands came together on the back of the chair here it is he said she had an impulse to warn him in an undertone but she could not frame a word dont go and beware of him struggled in her mind and the swift moment passed  got it said horrocks standing with the door half open  raut stepped towards him better say goodbye to mrs horrocks said the ironmaster even more grimly quiet in his tone than before  raut started and turned goodevening mrs horrocks he said and their hands touched  horrocks held the door open with a ceremonial politeness unusual in him towards men raut went out and then after a wordless look at her her husband followed she stood motionless while rauts light footfall and her husbands heavy tread like bass and treble passed down the passage together the front door slammed heavily she went to the window moving slowly and stood watching leaning forward the two men appeared for a moment at the gateway in the road passed under the street lamp and were hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery the lamplight fell for a moment on their faces showing only unmeaning pale patches telling nothing of what she still feared and doubted and craved vainly to know then she sank down into a crouching attitude in the big armchair her eyeswide open and staring out at the red lights from the furnaces that flickered in the sky an hour after she was still there her attitude scarcely changed  the oppressive stillness of the evening weighed heavily upon raut they went side by side down the road in silence and in silence turned into the cindermade byway that presently opened out the prospect of the valley  a blue haze half dust half mist touched the long valley with mystery beyond were hanley and etruria grey and dark masses outlined thinly by the rare golden dots of the street lamps and here and there a gaslit window or the yellow glare of some lateworking factory or crowded publichouse out of the masses clear and slender against the evening sky rose a multitude of tall chimneys many of them reeking a few smokeless during a season of play here and there a pallid patch and ghostly stunted beehive shapes showed the position of a potbank or a wheel black and sharp against the hot lower sky marked some colliery where they raise the iridescent coal of the place nearer at hand was the broad stretch of railway and halfinvisible trains shunteda steady puffing and rumbling with every run a ringing concussion and a rhymthic series of impacts and a passage of intermittent puffs of white steam across the further view and to the left between the railway and the dark mass of the low hill beyond dominating the whole view colossal inkyblack and crowned with smoke and fitful flames stood the great cylinders of the jeddah company blast furnaces the central edifices of the big ironworks of which horrocks was the manager they stood heavy and threatening full of an incessant turmoil of flames and seething molten iron and about the feet of them rattled the rollingmills and the steamhammer beat heavily and splashed the white iron sparks hither and thither even as they looked a truckful of fuel was shot into one of the giants and the red flames gleamed out and a confusion of smoke and black dust came boiling upwards towards the sky  certainly you get some colour with your furnaces said raut breaking a silence that had become apprehensive  horrocks grunted he stood with his hands in his pockets frowning down at the dim steaming railway and the busy ironworks beyond frowning as if he were thinking out some knotty problem  raut glanced at him and away again at present your moonlight effect is hardly ripe he continued looking upward the moon is still smothered by the vestiges of daylight  horrocks stared at him with the expression of a man who has suddenly awakened vestiges of daylight  of course of course he too looked up at the moon pale still in the midsummer sky come along he said suddenly and gripping rauts arm in his hand made a move towards the path that dropped from them to the railway  raut hung back their eyes met and saw a thousand things in a moment that their lips came near to say horrockss hand tightened and then relaxed he let go and before raut was aware of it they were arm in arm and walking one unwillingly enough down the path  you see the fine effect of the railway signals towards burslem said horrocks suddenly breaking into loquacity striding fast and tightening the grip of his elbow the whilelittle green lights and red and white lights all against the haze you have an eye for effect raut its fine and look at those furnaces of mine how they rise upon us as we come down the hill that to the right is my petseventy feet of him i packed him myself and hes boiled away cheerfully with iron in his guts for five long years ive a particular fancy for him that line of red therea lovely bit of warm orange youd call it rautthats the puddlers furnaces and there in the hot light three black figuresdid you see the white splash of the steamhammer thenthats the rolling mills come along clang clatter how it goes rattling across the floor sheet tin rautamazing stuff glass mirrors are not in it when that stuff comes from the mill and squelch there goes the hammer again come along  he had to stop talking to catch at his breath his arm twisted into rauts with benumbing tightness he had come striding down the black path towards the railway as though he was possessed raut had not spoken a word had simply hung back against horrockss pull with all his strength  i say he said now laughing nervously but with an undertone of snarl in his voice why on earth are you nipping my arm off horrocks and dragging me along like this  at length horrocks released him his manner changed again nipping your arm off he said sorry but its you taught me the trick of walking in that friendly way  you havent learnt the refinements of it yet then said raut laughing artificially again by jove im black and blue horrocks offered no apology they stood now near the bottom of the hill close to the fence that bordered the railway the ironworks had grown larger and spread out with their approach they looked up to the blast furnaces now instead of down the further view of etruria and hanley had dropped out of sight with their descent before them by the stile rose a noticeboard bearing still dimly visible the words beware of the trains half hidden by splashes of coaly mud  fine effects said horrocks waving his arm here comes a train the puffs of smoke the orange glare the round eye of light in front of it the melodious rattle fine effects but these furnaces of mine used to be finer before we shoved cones in their throats and saved the gas  how said raut cones  cones my man cones ill show you one nearer the flames used to flare out of the open throats greatwhat is itpillars of cloud by day red and black smoke and pillars of fire by night now we run it offin pipes and burn it to heat the blast and the top is shut by a cone youll be interested in that cone  but every now and then said raut you get a burst of fire and smoke up there  the cones not fixed its hung by a chain from a lever and balanced by an equipoise you shall see it nearer else of course thered be no way of getting fuel into the thing every now and then the cone dips and out comes the flare  i see said raut he looked over his shoulder the moon gets brighter he said  come along said horrocks abruptly gripping his shoulder again and moving him suddenly towards the railway crossing and then came one of those swift incidents vivid but so rapid that they leave one doubtful and reeling halfway across horrockss hand suddenly clenched upon him like a vice and swung him backward and through a halfturn so that he looked up the line and there a chain of lamplit carriage windows telescoped swiftly as it came towards them and the red and yellow lights of an engine grew larger and larger rushing down upon them as he grasped what this meant he turned his face to horrocks and pushed with all his strength against the arm that held him back between the rails the struggle did not last a moment just as certain as it was that horrocks held him there so certain was it that he had been violently lugged out of danger  out of the way said horrocks with a gasp as the train came rattling by and they stood panting by the gate into the ironworks  i did not see it coming said raut still even in spite of his own apprehensions trying to keep up an appearance of ordinary intercourse  horrocks answered with a grunt the cone he said and then as one who recovers himself i thought you did not hear  i didnt said raut  i wouldnt have had you run over then for the world said horrocks  for a moment i lost my nerve said raut  horrocks stood for half a minute then turned abruptly towards the ironworks again see how fine these great mounds of mine these clinkerheaps look in the night that truck yonder up above there up it goes and outtilts the slag see the palpitating red stuff go sliding down the slope as we get nearer the heap rises up and cuts the blast furnaces see the quiver up above the big one not that way this way between the heaps that goes to the puddling furnaces but i want to show you the canal first he came and took raut by the elbow and so they went along side by side raut answered horrocks vaguely what he asked himself had really happened on the line was he deluding himself with his own fancies or had horrocks actually held him back in the way of the train had he just been within an ace of being murdered  suppose this slouching scowling monster did know anything for a minute or two then raut was really afraid for his life but the mood passed as he reasoned with himself after all horrocks might have heard nothing at any rate he had pulled him out of the way in time his odd manner might be due to the mere vague jealousy he had shown once before he was talking now of the ashheaps and the canal eigh said horrocks  what said raut rather the haze in the moonlight fine  our canal said horrocks stopping suddenly our canal by moonlight and firelight is immense youve never seen it fancy that youve spent too many of your evenings philandering up in newcastle there i tell you for real florid qualitybut you shall see boiling water   as they came out of the labyrinth of clinkerheaps and mounds of coal and ore the noises of the rollingmill sprang upon them suddenly loud near and distinct three shadowy workmen went by and touched their caps to horrocks their faces were vague in the darkness raut felt a futile impulse to address them and before he could frame his words they passed into the shadows horrocks pointed to the canal close before them now a weirdlooking place it seemed in the bloodred reflections of the furnaces the hot water that cooled the tuyères came into it some fifty yards upa tumultuous almost boiling affluent and the steam rose up from the water in silent white wisps and streaks wrapping damply about them an incessant succession of ghosts coming up from the black and red eddies a white uprising that made the head swim the shining black tower of the larger blastfurnace rose overhead out of the mist and its tumultuous riot filled their ears raut kept away from the edge of the water and watched horrocks  here it is red said horrocks bloodred vapour as red and hot as sin but yonder there where the moonlight falls on it and it drives across the clinkerheaps it is as white as death  raut turned his head for a moment and then came back hastily to his watch on horrocks come along to the rollingmills said horrocks the threatening hold was not so evident that time and raut felt a little reassured but all the same what on earth did horrocks mean about white as death and red as sin coincidence perhaps  they went and stood behind the puddlers for a little while and then through the rollingmills where amidst an incessant din the deliberate steamhammer beat the juice out of the succulent iron and black halfnaked titans rushed the plastic bars like hot sealingwax between the wheels come on said horrocks in rauts ear and they went and peeped through the little glass hole behind the tuyères and saw the tumbled fire writhing in the pit of the blastfurnace it left one eye blinded for a while then with green and blue patches dancing across the dark they went to the lift by which the trucks of ore and fuel and lime were raised to the top of the big cylinder  and out upon the narrow rail that overhung the furnace rauts doubts came upon him again was it wise to be here if horrocks did knoweverything do what he would he could not resist a violent trembling right under foot was a sheer depth of seventy feet it was a dangerous place they pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing that crowned the thing the reek of the furnace a sulphurous vapour streaked with pungent bitterness seemed to make the distant hillside of hanley quiver the moon was riding out now from among a drift of clouds halfway up the sky above the undulating wooded outlines of newcastle the steaming canal ran away from below them under an indistinct bridge and vanished into the dim haze of the flat fields towards burslem  thats the cone ive been telling you of shouted horrocks and below that sixty feet of fire and molten metal with the air of the blast frothing through it like gas in sodawater  raut gripped the handrail tightly and stared down at the cone the heat was intense the boiling of the iron and the tumult of the blast made a thunderous accompaniment to horrockss voice but the thing had to be gone through now perhaps after all  in the middle bawled horrocks temperature near a thousand degrees if you were dropped into it  flash into flame like a pinch of gunpowder in a candle put your hand out and feel the heat of his breath why even up here ive seen the rainwater boiling off the trucks and that cone there its a damned sight too hot for roasting cakes the top side of its three hundred degrees  three hundred degrees said raut  three hundred centigrade mind said horrocks it will boil the blood out of you in no time  eigh said raut and turned  boil the blood out of you in  no you dont  let me go screamed raut let go my arm  with one hand he clutched at the handrail then with both for a moment the two men stood swaying then suddenly with a violent jerk horrocks had twisted him from his hold he clutched at horrocks and missed his foot went back into empty air in midair he twisted himself and then cheek and shoulder and knee struck the hot cone together  he clutched the chain by which the cone hung and the thing sank an infinitesimal amount as he struck it a circle of glowing red appeared about him and a tongue of flame released from the chaos within flickered up towards him an intense pain assailed him at the knees and he could smell the singeing of his hands he raised himself to his feet and tried to climb up the chain and then something struck his head black and shining with the moonlight the throat of the furnace rose about him  horrocks he saw stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel on the rail the gesticulating figure was bright and white in the moonlight and shouting fizzle you fool fizzle you hunter of women you hotblooded hound boil boil boil  suddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck and flung it deliberately lump after lump at raut  horrocks cried raut horrocks  he clung crying to the chain pulling himself up from the burning of the cone each missile horrocks flung hit him his clothes charred and glowed and as he struggled the cone dropped and a rush of hot suffocating gas whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of flame  his human likeness departed from him when the momentary red had passed horrocks saw a charred blackened figure its head streaked with blood still clutching and fumbling with the chain and writhing in agonya cindery animal an inhuman monstrous creature that began a sobbing intermittent shriek  abruptly at the sight the ironmasters anger passed a deadly sickness came upon him the heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting up to his nostrils his sanity returned to him  god have mercy upon me he cried o god what have i done  he knew the thing below him save that it still moved and felt was already a dead manthat the blood of the poor wretch must be boiling in his veins an intense realisation of that agony came to his mind and overcame every other feeling for a moment he stood irresolute and then turning to the truck he hastily tilted its contents upon the struggling thing that had once been a man the mass fell with a thud and went radiating over the cone with the thud the shriek ended and a boiling confusion of smoke dust and flame came rushing up towards him as it passed he saw the cone clear again  then he staggered back and stood trembling clinging to the rail with both hands his lips moved but no words came to them  down below was the sound of voices and running steps the clangour of rolling in the shed ceased abruptly       iii    the stolen bacillus   this again said the bacteriologist slipping a glass slide under the microscope is wella preparation of the bacillus of cholerathe cholera germ  the palefaced man peered down the microscope he was evidently not accustomed to that kind of thing and held a limp white hand over his disengaged eye i see very little he said  touch this screw said the bacteriologist perhaps the microscope is out of focus for you eyes vary so much just the fraction of a turn this way or that  ah now i see said the visitor not so very much to see after all little streaks and shreds of pink and yet those little particles those mere atomies might multiply and devastate a city wonderful  he stood up and releasing the glass slip from the microscope held it in his hand towards the window scarcely visible he said scrutinising the preparation he hesitated are thesealive are they dangerous now  those have been stained and killed said the bacteriologist i wish for my own part we could kill and stain every one of them in the universe  i suppose the pale man said with a slight smile that you scarcely care to have such things about you in the livingin the active state  on the contrary we are obliged to said the bacteriologist here for instance he walked across the room and took up one of several sealed tubes here is the living thing this is a cultivation of the actual living disease bacteria he hesitated bottled cholera so to speak  a slight gleam of satisfaction appeared momentarily in the face of the pale man its a deadly thing to have in your possession he said devouring the little tube with his eyes the bacteriologist watched the morbid pleasure in his visitors expression this man who had visited him that afternoon with a note of introduction from an old friend interested him from the very contrast of their dispositions the lank black hair and deep grey eyes the haggard expression and nervous manner the fitful yet keen interest of his visitor were a novel change from the phlegmatic deliberations of the ordinary scientific worker with whom the bacteriologist chiefly associated it was perhaps natural with a hearer evidently so impressionable to the lethal nature of his topic to take the most effective aspect of the matter  he held the tube in his hand thoughtfully yes here is the pestilence imprisoned only break such a little tube as this into a supply of drinkingwater say to these minute particles of life that one must needs stain and examine with the highest powers of the microscope even to see and that one can neither smell nor tastesay to them go forth increase and multiply and replenish the cisterns and deathmysterious untraceable death death swift and terrible death full of pain and indignitywould be released upon this city and go hither and thither seeking his victims here he would take the husband from the wife here the child from its mother here the statesman from his duty and here the toiler from his trouble he would follow the watermains creeping along streets picking out and punishing a house here and a house there where they did not boil their drinkingwater creeping into the wells of the mineral water makers getting washed into salad and lying dormant in ices he would wait ready to be drunk in the horsetroughs and by unwary children in the public fountains he would soak into the soil to reappear in springs and wells at a thousand unexpected places once start him at the water supply and before we could ring him in and catch him again he would have decimated the metropolis  he stopped abruptly he had been told rhetoric was his weakness  but he is quite safe here you knowquite safe  the palefaced man nodded his eyes shone he cleared his throat these anarchistrascals said he are fools blind foolsto use bombs when this kind of thing is attainable i think  a gentle rap a mere light touch of the fingernails was heard at the door the bacteriologist opened if just a minute dear whispered his wife  when he reentered the laboratory his visitor was looking at his watch i had no idea i had wasted an hour of your time he said twelve minutes to four i ought to have left here by halfpast three but your things were really too interesting no positively i cannot stop a moment longer i have an engagement at four  he passed out of the room reiterating his thanks and the bacteriologist accompanied him to the door and then returned thoughtfully along the passage to his laboratory he was musing on the ethnology of his visitor certainly the man was not a teutonic type nor a common latin one a morbid product anyhow i am afraid said the bacteriologist to himself how he gloated over those cultivations of disease germs a disturbing thought struck him he turned to the bench by the vapour bath and then very quickly to his writingtable then he felt hastily in his pockets and then rushed to the door i may have put it down on the hall table he said  minnie he shouted hoarsely in the hall  yes dear came a remote voice  had i anything in my hand when i spoke to you dear just now  pause  nothing dear because i remember  blue ruin cried the bacteriologist and incontinently ran to the front door and down the steps of his house to the street  minnie hearing the door slam violently ran in alarm to the window down the street a slender man was getting into a cab the bacteriologist hatless and in his carpet slippers was running and gesticulating wildly towards this group one slipper came off but he did not wait for it he has gone mad said minnie its that horrid science of his and opening the window would have called after him the slender man suddenly glancing round seemed struck with the same idea of mental disorder he pointed hastily to the bacteriologist said something to the cabman the apron of the cab slammed the whip swished the horses feet clattered and in a moment cab and bacteriologist hotly in pursuit had receded up the vista of the roadway and disappeared round the corner  minnie remained straining out of the window for a minute then she drew her head back into the room again she was dumbfounded of course he is eccentric she meditated but running about londonin the height of the season tooin his socks a happy thought struck her she hastily put her bonnet on seized his shoes went into the hall took down his hat and light overcoat from the pegs emerged upon the doorstep and hailed a cab that opportunely crawled by drive me up the road and round havelock crescent and see if we can find a gentleman running about in a velveteen coat and no hat  velveteen coat maam and no at very good maam and the cabman whipped up at once in the most matteroffact way as if he drove to this address every day in his life  some few minutes later the little group of cabmen and loafers that collects round the cabmans shelter at haverstock hill were startled by the passing of a cab with a gingercoloured screw of a horse driven furiously  they were silent as it went by and then as it recededthats arry icks wots he got said the stout gentleman known as old tootles  hes ausing his whip he is to rights said the ostler boy  hullo said poor old tommy byles heres another bloomin loonatic blowed if there aint  its old george said old tootles and hes drivin a loonatic as you say aint he aclawin out of the keb wonder if hes after arry icks  the group round the cabmans shelter became animated chorus go it george its a race youll ketch em whip up  shes a goer she is said the ostler boy  strike me giddy cried old tootles here im agoin to begin in a minute heres another comin if all the cabs in hampstead aint gone mad this morning  its a fieldmale this time said the ostler boy  shes afollowin him said old tootles usually the other way about  whats she got in her and  looks like a igh at  what a bloomin lark it is three to one on old george said the ostler boy nexst  minnie went by in a perfect roar of applause she did not like it but she felt that she was doing her duty and whirled on down haverstock hill and camden town high street with her eyes ever intent on the animated back view of old george who was driving her vagrant husband so incomprehensibly away from her  the man in the foremost cab sat crouched in the corner his arms tightly folded and the little tube that contained such vast possibilities of destruction gripped in his hand his mood was a singular mixture of fear and exultation chiefly he was afraid of being caught before he could accomplish his purpose but behind this was a vaguer but larger fear of the awfulness of his crime but his exultation far exceeded his fear no anarchist before him had ever approached this conception of his ravachol vaillant all those distinguished persons whose fame he had envied dwindled into insignificance beside him he had only to make sure of the water supply and break the little tube into a reservoir how brilliantly he had planned it forged the letter of introduction and got into the laboratory and how brilliantly he had seized his opportunity the world should hear of him at last all those people who had sneered at him neglected him preferred other people to him found his company undesirable should consider him at last death death death they had always treated him as a man of no importance all the world had been in a conspiracy to keep him under he would teach them yet what it is to isolate a man what was this familiar street great saint andrews street of course how fared the chase he craned out of the cab the bacteriologist was scarcely fifty yards behind that was bad he would be caught and stopped yet he felt in his pocket for money and found half a sovereign this he thrust up through the trap in the top of the cab into the mans face more he shouted if only we get away  the money was snatched out of his hand right you are said the cabman and the trap slammed and the lash lay along the glistening side of the horse the cab swayed and the anarchist halfstanding under the trap put the hand containing the little glass tube upon the apron to preserve his balance he felt the brittle thing crack and the broken half of it rang upon the floor of the cab he fell back into the seat with a curse and stared dismally at the two or three drops of moisture on the apron  he shuddered  well i suppose i shall be the first phew anyhow i shall be a martyr thats something but it is a filthy death nevertheless i wonder if it hurts as much as they say  presently a thought occurred to himhe groped between his feet a little drop was still in the broken end of the tube and he drank that to make sure it was better to make sure at any rate he would not fail  then it dawned upon him that there was no further need to escape the bacteriologist in wellington street he told the cabman to stop and got out he slipped on the step and his head felt queer it was rapid stuff this cholera poison he waved his cabman out of existence so to speak and stood on the pavement with his arms folded upon his breast awaiting the arrival of the bacteriologist there was something tragic in his pose the sense of imminent death gave him a certain dignity he greeted his pursuer with a defiant laugh  vive lanarchie you are too late my friend i have drunk it the cholera is abroad  the bacteriologist from his cab beamed curiously at him through his spectacles you have drunk it an anarchist i see now he was about to say something more and then checked himself a smile hung in the corner of his mouth he opened the apron of his cab as if to descend at which the anarchist waved him a dramatic farewell and strode off towards waterloo bridge carefully jostling his infected body against as many people as possible the bacteriologist was so preoccupied with the vision of him that he scarcely manifested the slightest surprise at the appearance of minnie upon the pavement with his hat and shoes and overcoat very good of you to bring my things he said and remained lost in contemplation of the receding figure of the anarchist  you had better get in he said still staring minnie felt absolutely convinced now that he was mad and directed the cabman home on her own responsibility put on my shoes certainly dear said he as the cab began to turn and hid the strutting black figure now small in the distance from his eyes then suddenly something grotesque struck him and he laughed then he remarked it is really very serious though  you see that man came to my house to see me and he is an anarchist nodont faint or i cannot possibly tell you the rest and i wanted to astonish him not knowing he was an anarchist and took up a cultivation of that new species of bacterium i was telling you of that infest and i think cause the blue patches upon various monkeys and like a fool i said it was asiatic cholera and he ran away with it to poison the water of london and he certainly might have made things look blue for this civilised city and now he has swallowed it of course i cannot say what will happen but you know it turned that kitten blue and the three puppiesin patches and the sparrowbright blue but the bother is i shall have all the trouble and expense of preparing some more  put on my coat on this hot day why because we might meet mrs jabber my dear mrs jabber is not a draught but why should i wear a coat on a hot day because of mrs oh very well       iv    the flowering of the strange orchid   the buying of orchids always has in it a certain speculative flavour you have before you the brown shrivelled lump of tissue and for the rest you must trust your judgment or the auctioneer or your good luck as your taste may incline the plant may be moribund or dead or it may be just a respectable purchase fair value for your money or perhapsfor the thing has happened again and againthere slowly unfolds before the delighted eyes of the happy purchaser day after day some new variety some novel richness a strange twist of the labellum or some subtler colouration or unexpected mimicry pride beauty and profit blossom together on one delicate green spike and it may be even immortality for the new miracle of nature may stand in need of a new specific name and what so convenient as that of its discoverer johnsmithia there have been worse names  it was perhaps the hope of some such happy discovery that made winter wedderburn such a frequent attendant at these salesthat hope and also maybe the fact that he had nothing else of the slightest interest to do in the world he was a shy lonely rather ineffectual man provided with just enough income to keep off the spur of necessity and not enough nervous energy to make him seek any exacting employments he might have collected stamps or coins or translated horace or bound books or invented new species of diatoms but as it happened he grew orchids and had one ambitious little hothouse  i have a fancy he said over his coffee that something is going to happen to me today he spokeas he moved and thoughtslowly  oh dont say that said his housekeeperwho was also his remote cousin for something happening was a euphemism that meant only one thing to her  you misunderstand me i mean nothing unpleasantthough what i do mean i scarcely know  today he continued after a pause peters are going to sell a batch of plants from the andamans and the indies i shall go up and see what they have it may be i shall buy something good unawares that may be it  he passed his cup for his second cupful of coffee  are these the things collected by that poor young fellow you told me of the other day asked his cousin as she filled his cup  yes he said and became meditative over a piece of toast  nothing ever does happen to me he remarked presently beginning to think aloud i wonder why things enough happen to other people there is harvey only the other week on monday he picked up sixpence on wednesday his chicks all had the staggers on friday his cousin came home from australia and on saturday he broke his ankle what a whirl of excitementcompared to me  i think i would rather be without so much excitement said his housekeeper it cant be good for you  i suppose its troublesome still  you see nothing ever happens to me when i was a little boy i never had accidents i never fell in love as i grew up never married i wonder how it feels to have something happen to you something really remarkable  that orchidcollector was only thirtysixtwenty years younger than myselfwhen he died and he had been married twice and divorced once he had had malarial fever four times and once he broke his thigh he killed a malay once and once he was wounded by a poisoned dart and in the end he was killed by jungleleeches it must have all been very troublesome but then it must have been very interesting you knowexcept perhaps the leeches  i am sure it was not good for him said the lady with conviction  perhaps not and then wedderburn looked at his watch twentythree minutes past eight i am going up by the quarter to twelve train so that there is plenty of time i think i shall wear my alpaca jacketit is quite warm enoughand my grey felt hat and brown shoes i suppose  he glanced out of the window at the serene sky and sunlit garden and then nervously at his cousins face  i think you had better take an umbrella if you are going to london she said in a voice that admitted of no denial theres all between here and the station coming back  when he returned he was in a state of mild excitement he had made a purchase it was rare that he could make up his mind quickly enough to buy but this time he had done so  there are vandas he said and a dendrobe and some palaeonophis he surveyed his purchases lovingly as he consumed his soup they were laid out on the spotless tablecloth before him and he was telling his cousin all about them as he slowly meandered through his dinner it was his custom to live all his visits to london over again in the evening for her and his own entertainment  i knew something would happen today and i have bought all these some of themsome of themi feel sure do you know that some of them will be remarkable i dont know how it is but i feel just as sure as if some one had told me that some of these will turn out remarkable  that one he pointed to a shrivelled rhizomewas not identified it may be a palaeonophisor it may not it may be a new species or even a new genus and it was the last that poor batten ever collected  i dont like the look of it said his housekeeper its such an ugly shape  to me it scarcely seems to have a shape  i dont like those things that stick out said his housekeeper  it shall be put away in a pot tomorrow  it looks said the housekeeper like a spider shamming dead  wedderburn smiled and surveyed the root with his head on one side it is certainly not a pretty lump of stuff but you can never judge of these things from their dry appearance it may turn out to be a very beautiful orchid indeed how busy i shall be tomorrow i must see tonight just exactly what to do with these things and tomorrow i shall set to work  they found poor batten lying dead or dying in a mangrove swampi forget which he began again presently with one of these very orchids crushed up under his body he had been unwell for some days with some kind of native fever and i suppose he fainted these mangrove swamps are very unwholesome every drop of blood they say was taken out of him by the jungleleeches it may be that very plant that cost him his life to obtain  i think none the better of it for that  men must work though women may weep said wedderburn with profound gravity  fancy dying away from every comfort in a nasty swamp fancy being ill of fever with nothing to take but chlorodyne and quinineif men were left to themselves they would live on chlorodyne and quinineand no one round you but horrible natives they say the andaman islanders are most disgusting wretchesand anyhow they can scarcely make good nurses not having the necessary training and just for people in england to have orchids  i dont suppose it was comfortable but some men seem to enjoy that kind of thing said wedderburn anyhow the natives of his party were sufficiently civilised to take care of all his collection until his colleague who was an ornithologist came back again from the interior though they could not tell the species of the orchid and had let it wither and it makes these things more interesting  it makes them disgusting i should be afraid of some of the malaria clinging to them and just think there has been a dead body lying across that ugly thing i never thought of that before there i declare i cannot eat another mouthful of dinner  i will take them off the table if you like and put them in the windowseat i can see them just as well there  the next few days he was indeed singularly busy in his steamy little hothouse fussing about with charcoal lumps of teak moss and all the other mysteries of the orchid cultivator he considered he was having a wonderfully eventful time in the evening he would talk about these new orchids to his friends and over and over again he reverted to his expectation of something strange  several of the vandas and the dendrobium died under his care but presently the strange orchid began to show signs of life he was delighted and took his housekeeper right away from jammaking to see it at once directly he made the discovery  that is a bud he said and presently there will be a lot of leaves there and those little things coming out here are aerial rootlets  they look to me like little white fingers poking out of the brown said his housekeeper i dont like them  why not  i dont know they look like fingers trying to get at you i cant help my likes and dislikes  i dont know for certain but i dont think there are any orchids i know that have aerial rootlets quite like that it may be my fancy of course you see they are a little flattened at the ends  i dont like em said his housekeeper suddenly shivering and turning away i know its very silly of meand im very sorry particularly as you like the thing so much but i cant help thinking of that corpse  but it may not be that particular plant that was merely a guess of mine  his housekeeper shrugged her shoulders anyhow i dont like it she said  wedderburn felt a little hurt at her dislike to the plant but that did not prevent his talking to her about orchids generally and this orchid in particular whenever he felt inclined  there are such queer things about orchids he said one day such possibilities of surprises you know darwin studied their fertilisation and showed that the whole structure of an ordinary orchid flower was contrived in order that moths might carry the pollen from plant to plant well it seems that there are lots of orchids known the flower of which cannot possibly be used for fertilisation in that way some of the cypripediums for instance there are no insects known that can possibly fertilise them and some of them have never been found with seed  but how do they form new plants  by runners and tubers and that kind of outgrowth that is easily explained the puzzle is what are the flowers for  very likely he added my orchid may be something extraordinary in that way if so i shall study it i have often thought of making researches as darwin did but hitherto i have not found the time or something else has happened to prevent it the leaves are beginning to unfold now i do wish you would come and see them  but she said that the orchidhouse was so hot it gave her the headache she had seen the plant once again and the aerial rootlets which were now some of them more than a foot long had unfortunately reminded her of tentacles reaching out after something and they got into her dreams growing after her with incredible rapidity so that she had settled to her entire satisfaction that she would not see that plant again and wedderburn had to admire its leaves alone they were of the ordinary broad form and a deep glossy green with splashes and dots of deep red towards the base he knew of no other leaves quite like them the plant was placed on a low bench near the thermometer and close by was a simple arrangement by which a tap dripped on the hotwater pipes and kept the air steamy and he spent his afternoons now with some regularity meditating on the approaching flowering of this strange plant  and at last the great thing happened directly he entered the little glass house he knew that the spike had burst out although his great paloeonophis lowii hid the corner where his new darling stood there was a new odour in the air a rich intensely sweet scent that overpowered every other in that crowded steaming little greenhouse  directly he noticed this he hurried down to the strange orchid and behold the trailing green spikes bore now three great splashes of blossom from which this overpowering sweetness proceeded he stopped before them in an ecstasy of admiration  the flowers were white with streaks of golden orange upon the petals the heavy labellum was coiled into an intricate projection and a wonderful bluish purple mingled there with the gold he could see at once that the genus was altogether a new one and the insufferable scent how hot the place was the blossoms swam before his eyes  he would see if the temperature was right he made a step towards the thermometer suddenly everything appeared unsteady the bricks on the floor were dancing up and down then the white blossoms the green leaves behind them the whole greenhouse seemed to sweep sideways and then in a curve upward                                      at halfpast four his cousin made the tea according to their invariable custom but wedderburn did not come in for his tea  he is worshipping that horrid orchid she told herself and waited ten minutes his watch must have stopped i will go and call him  she went straight to the hothouse and opening the door called his name there was no reply she noticed that the air was very close and loaded with an intense perfume then she saw something lying on the bricks between the hotwater pipes  for a minute perhaps she stood motionless  he was lying face upward at the foot of the strange orchid the tentaclelike aerial rootlets no longer swayed freely in the air but were crowded together a tangle of grey ropes and stretched tight with their ends closely applied to his chin and neck and hands  she did not understand then she saw from under one of the exultant tentacles upon his cheek there trickled a little thread of blood  with an inarticulate cry she ran towards him and tried to pull him away from the leechlike suckers she snapped two of these tentacles and their sap dripped red  then the overpowering scent of the blossom began to make her head reel how they clung to him she tore at the tough ropes and he and the white inflorescence swam about her she felt she was fainting knew she must not she left him and hastily opened the nearest door and after she had panted for a moment in the fresh air she had a brilliant inspiration she caught up a flowerpot and smashed in the windows at the end of the greenhouse then she reentered she tugged now with renewed strength at wedderburns motionless body and brought the strange orchid crashing to the floor it still clung with the grimmest tenacity to its victim in a frenzy she lugged it and him into the open air  then she thought of tearing through the sucker rootlets one by one and in another minute she had released him and was dragging him away from the horror  he was white and bleeding from a dozen circular patches  the oddjob man was coming up the garden amazed at the smashing of glass and saw her emerge hauling the inanimate body with redstained hands for a moment he thought impossible things  bring some water she cried and her voice dispelled his fancies when with unnatural alacrity he returned with the water he found her weeping with excitement and with wedderburns head upon her knee wiping the blood from his face  whats the matter said wedderburn opening his eyes feebly and closing them again at once  go and tell annie to come out here to me and then go for dr haddon at once she said to the oddjob man so soon as he brought the water and added seeing he hesitated i will tell you all about it when you come back  presently wedderburn opened his eyes again and seeing that he was troubled by the puzzle of his position she explained to him you fainted in the hothouse  and the orchid  i will see to that she said  wedderburn had lost a good deal of blood but beyond that he had suffered no very great injury they gave him brandy mixed with some pink extract of meat and carried him upstairs to bed his housekeeper told her incredible story in fragments to dr haddon come to the orchidhouse and see she said  the cold outer air was blowing in through the open door and the sickly perfume was almost dispelled most of the torn aerial rootlets lay already withered amidst a number of dark stains upon the bricks the stem of the inflorescence was broken by the fall of the plant and the flowers were growing limp and brown at the edges of the petals the doctor stooped towards it then saw that one of the aerial rootlets still stirred feebly and hesitated  the next morning the strange orchid still lay there black now and putrescent the door banged intermittently in the morning breeze and all the array of wedderburns orchids was shrivelled and prostrate but wedderburn himself was bright and garrulous upstairs in the glory of his strange adventure       v    in the avu observatory   the observatory at avu in borneo stands on the spur of the mountain to the north rises the old crater black at night against the unfathomable blue of the sky from the little circular building with its mushroom dome the slopes plunge steeply downward into the black mysteries of the tropical forest beneath the little house in which the observer and his assistant live is about fifty yards from the observatory and beyond this are the huts of their native attendants  thaddy the chief observer was down with a slight fever his assistant woodhouse paused for a moment in silent contemplation of the tropical night before commencing his solitary vigil the night was very still now and then voices and laughter came from the native huts or the cry of some strange animal was heard from the midst of the mystery of the forest nocturnal insects appeared in ghostly fashion out of the darkness and fluttered round his light he thought perhaps of all the possibilities of discovery that still lay in the black tangle beneath him for to the naturalist the virgin forests of borneo are still a wonderland full of strange questions and halfsuspected discoveries woodhouse carried a small lantern in his hand and its yellow glow contrasted vividly with the infinite series of tints between lavenderblue and black in which the landscape was painted his hands and face were smeared with ointment against the attacks of the mosquitoes  even in these days of celestial photography work done in a purely temporary erection and with only the most primitive appliances in addition to the telescope still involves a very large amount of cramped and motionless watching he sighed as he thought of the physical fatigues before him stretched himself and entered the observatory  the reader is probably familiar with the structure of an ordinary astronomical observatory the building is usually cylindrical in shape with a very light hemispherical roof capable of being turned round from the interior the telescope is supported upon a stone pillar in the centre and a clockwork arrangement compensates for the earths rotation and allows a star once found to be continuously observed besides this there is a compact tracery of wheels and screws about its point of support by which the astronomer adjusts it there is of course a slit in the movable roof which follows the eye of the telescope in its survey of the heavens the observer sits or lies on a sloping wooden arrangement which he can wheel to any part of the observatory as the position of the telescope may require within it is advisable to have things as dark as possible in order to enhance the brilliance of the stars observed  the lantern flared as woodhouse entered his circular den and the general darkness fled into black shadows behind the big machine from which it presently seemed to creep back over the whole place again as the light waned the slit was a profound transparent blue in which six stars shone with tropical brilliance and their light lay a pallid gleam along the black tube of the instrument woodhouse shifted the roof and then proceeding to the telescope turned first one wheel and then another the great cylinder slowly swinging into a new position then he glanced through the finder the little companion telescope moved the roof a little more made some further adjustments and set the clockwork in motion he took off his jacket for the night was very hot and pushed into position the uncomfortable seat to which he was condemned for the next four hours then with a sigh he resigned himself to his watch upon the mysteries of space  there was no sound now in the observatory and the lantern waned steadily outside there was the occasional cry of some animal in alarm or pain or calling to its mate and the intermittent sounds of the malay and dyak servants presently one of the men began a queer chanting song in which the others joined at intervals after this it would seem that they turned in for the night for no further sound came from their direction and the whispering stillness became more and more profound  the clockwork ticked steadily the shrill hum of a mosquito explored the place and grew shriller in indignation at woodhouses ointment then the lantern went out and all the observatory was black  woodhouse shifted his position presently when the slow movement of the telescope had carried it beyond the limits of his comfort  he was watching a little group of stars in the milky way in one of which his chief had seen or fancied a remarkable colour variability it was not a part of the regular work for which the establishment existed and for that reason perhaps woodhouse was deeply interested he must have forgotten things terrestrial all his attention was concentrated upon the great blue circle of the telescope fielda circle powdered so it seemed with an innumerable multitude of stars and all luminous against the blackness of its setting as he watched he seemed to himself to become incorporeal as if he too were floating in the ether of space infinitely remote was the faint red spot he was observing  suddenly the stars were blotted out a flash of blackness passed and they were visible again  queer said woodhouse must have been a bird  the thing happened again and immediately after the great tube shivered as though it had been struck then the dome of the observatory resounded with a series of thundering blows the stars seemed to sweep aside as the telescopewhich had been unclampedswung round and away from the slit in the roof  great scott cried woodhouse whats this  some huge vague black shape with a flapping something like a wing seemed to be struggling in the aperture of the roof in another moment the slit was clear again and the luminous haze of the milky way shone warm and bright  the interior of the roof was perfectly black and only a scraping sound marked the whereabouts of the unknown creature  woodhouse had scrambled from the seat to his feet he was trembling violently and in a perspiration with the suddenness of the occurrence was the thing whatever it was inside or out it was big whatever else it might be something shot across the skylight and the telescope swayed he started violently and put his arm up it was in the observatory then with him it was clinging to the roof apparently what the devil was it could it see him  he stood for perhaps a minute in a state of stupefaction the beast whatever it was clawed at the interior of the dome and then something flapped almost into his face and he saw the momentary gleam of starlight on a skin like oiled leather his waterbottle was knocked off his little table with a smash  the sense of some strange birdcreature hovering a few yards from his face in the darkness was indescribably unpleasant to woodhouse as his thought returned he concluded that it must be some nightbird or large bat at any risk he would see what it was and pulling a match from his pocket he tried to strike it on the telescope seat there was a smoking streak of phosphorescent light the match flared for a moment and he saw a vast wing sweeping towards him a gleam of greybrown fur and then he was struck in the face and the match knocked out of his hand the blow was aimed at his temple and a claw tore sideways down to his cheek he reeled and fell and he heard the extinguished lantern smash another blow followed as he fell he was partly stunned he felt his own warm blood stream out upon his face instinctively he felt his eyes had been struck at and turning over on his face to save them tried to crawl under the protection of the telescope  he was struck again upon the back and he heard his jacket rip and then the thing hit the roof of the observatory he edged as far as he could between the wooden seat and the eyepiece of the instrument and turned his body round so that it was chiefly his feet that were exposed with these he could at least kick he was still in a mystified state the strange beast banged about in the darkness and presently clung to the telescope making it sway and the gear rattle once it flapped near him and he kicked out madly and felt a soft body with his feet he was horribly scared now it must be a big thing to swing the telescope like that he saw for a moment the outline of a head black against the starlight with sharplypointed upstanding ears and a crest between them it seemed to him to be as big as a mastiffs then he began to bawl out as loudly as he could for help  at that the thing came down upon him again as it did so his hand touched something beside him on the floor he kicked out and the next moment his ankle was gripped and held by a row of keen teeth he yelled again and tried to free his leg by kicking with the other then he realised he had the broken waterbottle at his hand and snatching it he struggled into a sitting posture and feeling in the darkness towards his foot gripped a velvety ear like the ear of a big cat he had seized the waterbottle by its neck and brought it down with a shivering crash upon the head of the strange beast he repeated the blow and then stabbed and jabbed with the jagged end of it in the darkness where he judged the face might be  the small teeth relaxed their hold and at once woodhouse pulled his leg free and kicked hard he felt the sickening feel of fur and bone giving under his boot there was a tearing bite at his arm and he struck over it at the face as he judged and hit damp fur  there was a pause then he heard the sound of claws and the dragging of a heavy body away from him over the observatory floor then there was silence broken only by his own sobbing breathing and a sound like licking everything was black except the parallelogram of the blue skylight with the luminous dust of stars against which the end of the telescope now appeared in silhouette he waited as it seemed an interminable time  was the thing coming on again he felt in his trouserpocket for some matches and found one remaining he tried to strike this but the floor was wet and it spat and went out he cursed he could not see where the door was situated in his struggle he had quite lost his bearings the strange beast disturbed by the splutter of the match began to move again time called woodhouse with a sudden gleam of mirth but the thing was not coming at him again he must have hurt it he thought with the broken bottle he felt a dull pain in his ankle probably he was bleeding there he wondered if it would support him if he tried to stand up the night outside was very still there was no sound of any one moving the sleepy fools had not heard those wings battering upon the dome nor his shouts it was no good wasting strength in shouting the monster flapped its wings and startled him into a defensive attitude he hit his elbow against the seat and it fell over with a crash he cursed this and then he cursed the darkness  suddenly the oblong patch of starlight seemed to sway to and fro was he going to faint it would never do to faint he clenched his fists and set his teeth to hold himself together where had the door got to it occurred to him he could get his bearings by the stars visible through the skylight the patch of stars he saw was in sagittarius and southeastward the door was northor was it north by west he tried to think if he could get the door open he might retreat it might be the thing was wounded the suspense was beastly look here he said if you dont come on i shall come at you  then the thing began clambering up the side of the observatory and he saw its black outline gradually blot out the skylight was it in retreat he forgot about the door and watched as the dome shifted and creaked somehow he did not feel very frightened or excited now he felt a curious sinking sensation inside him the sharplydefined patch of light with the black form moving across it seemed to be growing smaller and smaller that was curious he began to feel very thirsty and yet he did not feel inclined to get anything to drink he seemed to be sliding down a long funnel  he felt a burning sensation in his throat and then he perceived it was broad daylight and that one of the dyak servants was looking at him with a curious expression then there was the top of thaddys face upside down funny fellow thaddy to go about like that then he grasped the situation better and perceived that his head was on thaddys knee and thaddy was giving him brandy and then he saw the eyepiece of the telescope with a lot of red smears on it he began to remember  youve made this observatory in a pretty mess said thaddy  the dyak boy was beating up an egg in brandy woodhouse took this and sat up he felt a sharp twinge of pain his ankle was tied up so were his arm and the side of his face the smashed glass redstained lay about the floor the telescope seat was overturned and by the opposite wall was a dark pool the door was open and he saw the grey summit of the mountain against a brilliant background of blue sky  pah said woodhouse whos been killing calves here take me out of it  then he remembered the thing and the fight he had had with it  what was it he said to thaddythe thing i fought with  you know that best said thaddy but anyhow dont worry yourself now about it have some more to drink  thaddy however was curious enough and it was a hard struggle between duty and inclination to keep woodhouse quiet until he was decently put away in bed and had slept upon the copious dose of meat extract thaddy considered advisable they then talked it over together  it was said woodhouse more like a big bat than anything else in the world it had sharp short ears and soft fur and its wings were leathery its teeth were little but devilish sharp and its jaw could not have been very strong or else it would have bitten through my ankle  it has pretty nearly said thaddy  it seemed to me to hit out with its claws pretty freely that is about as much as i know about the beast our conversation was intimate so to speak and yet not confidential  the dyak chaps talk about a big colugo a klangutangwhatever that may be it does not often attack man but i suppose you made it nervous they say there is a big colugo and a little colugo and a something else that sounds like gobble they all fly about at night for my own part i know there are flying foxes and flying lemurs about here but they are none of them very big beasts  there are more things in heaven and earth said woodhouseand thaddy groaned at the quotationand more particularly in the forests of borneo than are dreamt of in our philosophies on the whole if the borneo fauna is going to disgorge any more of its novelties upon me i should prefer that it did so when i was not occupied in the observatory at night and alone       vi    aepyornis island   the man with the scarred face leant over the table and looked at my bundle  orchids he asked  a few i said  cypripediums he said  chiefly said i  anything new i thought not i did these islands twentyfive twentyseven years ago if you find anything new herewell its brand new i didnt leave much  im not a collector said i  i was young then he went on lord how i used to fly round he seemed to take my measure i was in the east indies two years and in brazil seven then i went to madagascar  i know a few explorers by name i said anticipating a yarn whom did you collect for  dawsons i wonder if youve heard the name of butcher ever  butcherbutcher the name seemed vaguely present in my memory then i recalled butcher v dawson why said i you are the man who sued them for four years salarygot cast away on a desert island  your servant said the man with the scar bowing funny case wasnt it here was me making a little fortune on that island doing nothing for it neither and them quite unable to give me notice it often used to amuse me thinking over it while i was there i did calculations of itbigall over the blessed atoll in ornamental figuring  how did it happen said i i dont rightly remember the case  well youve heard of the aepyornis  rather andrews was telling me of a new species he was working on only a month or so ago just before i sailed theyve got a thigh bone it seems nearly a yard long monster the thing must have been  i believe you said the man with the scar it was a monster sindbads roc was just a legend of em but when did they find these bones  three or four years ago91 i fancy why  why because i found themlordits nearly twenty years ago if dawsons hadnt been silly about that salary they might have made a perfect ring in em i couldnt help the infernal boat going adrift  he paused i suppose its the same place a kind of swamp about ninety miles north of antananarivo do you happen to know you have to go to it along the coast by boats you dont happen to remember perhaps  i dont i fancy andrews said something about a swamp  it must be the same its on the east coast and somehow theres something in the water that keeps things from decaying like creosote it smells it reminded me of trinidad did they get any more eggs some of the eggs i found were a footandahalf long the swamp goes circling round you know and cuts off this bit its mostly salt too well what a time i had of it i found the things quite by accident we went for eggs me and two native chaps in one of those rum canoes all tied together and found the bones at the same time we had a tent and provisions for four days and we pitched on one of the firmer places to think of it brings that odd tarry smell back even now its funny work you go probing into the mud with iron rods you know usually the egg gets smashed i wonder how long it is since these aepyornises really lived the missionaries say the natives have legends about when they were alive but i never heard any such stories myself but certainly those eggs we got were as fresh as if they had been new laid fresh carrying them down to the boat one of my nigger chaps dropped one on a rock and it smashed how i lammed into the beggar but sweet it was as if it was new laid not even smelly and its mother dead these four hundred years perhaps said a centipede had bit him however im getting off the straight with the story it had taken us all day to dig into the slush and get these eggs out unbroken and we were all covered with beastly black mud and naturally i was cross so far as i knew they were the only eggs that have ever been got out not even cracked i went afterwards to see the ones they have at the natural history museum in london all of them were cracked and just stuck together like a mosaic and bits missing mine were perfect and i meant to blow them when i got back naturally i was annoyed at the silly duffer dropping three hours work just on account of a centipede i hit him about rather  footnote  no european is known to have seen a live aepyornis with the doubtful exception of macandrew who visited madagascar in 1745hgw  the man with the scar took out a clay pipe i placed my pouch before him he filled up absentmindedly  how about the others did you get those home i dont remember  thats the queer part of the story i had three others perfectly fresh eggs well we put em in the boat and then i went up to the tent to make some coffee leaving my two heathens down by the beachthe one fooling about with his sting and the other helping him it never occurred to me that the beggars would take advantage of the peculiar position i was in to pick a quarrel but i suppose the centipede poison and the kicking i had given him had upset the onehe was always a cantankerous sortand he persuaded the other  i remember i was sitting and smoking and boiling up the water over a spiritlamp business i used to take on these expeditions incidentally i was admiring the swamp under the sunset all black and bloodred it was in streaksa beautiful sight and up beyond the land rose grey and hazy to the hills and the sky behind them red like a furnace mouth and fifty yards behind the back of me was these blessed heathenquite regardless of the tranquil air of thingsplotting to cut off with the boat and leave me all alone with three days provisions and a canvas tent and nothing to drink whatsoever beyond a little keg of water i heard a kind of yelp behind me and there they were in this canoe affairit wasnt properly a boatand perhaps twenty yards from land i realised what was up in a moment my gun was in the tent and besides i had no bulletsonly duck shot they knew that but i had a little revolver in my pocket and i pulled that out as i ran down to the beach  come back says i flourishing it  they jabbered something at me and the man that broke the egg jeered i aimed at the otherbecause he was unwounded and had the paddle and i missed they laughed however i wasnt beat i knew i had to keep cool and i tried him again and made him jump with the whang of it he didnt laugh that time the third time i got his head and over he went and the paddle with him it was a precious lucky shot for a revolver i reckon it was fifty yards he went right under i dont know if he was shot or simply stunned and drowned then i began to shout to the other chap to come back but he huddled up in the canoe and refused to answer so i fired out my revolver at him and never got near him  i felt a precious fool i can tell you there i was on this rotten black beach flat swamp all behind me and the flat sea cold after the sun set and just this black canoe drifting steadily out to sea i tell you i damned dawsons and jamrachs and museums and all the rest of it just to rights i bawled to this nigger to come back until my voice went up into a scream  there was nothing for it but to swim after him and take my luck with the sharks so i opened my claspknife and put it in my mouth and took off my clothes and waded in as soon as i was in the water i lost sight of the canoe but i aimed as i judged to head it off i hoped the man in it was too bad to navigate it and that it would keep on drifting in the same direction presently it came up over the horizon again to the southwestward about the afterglow of sunset was well over now and the dim of night creeping up the stars were coming through the blue i swum like a champion though my legs and arms were soon aching  however i came up to him by the time the stars were fairly out as it got darker i began to see all manner of glowing things in the water phosphorescence you know at times it made me giddy i hardly knew which was stars and which was phosphorescence and whether i was swimming on my head or my heels the canoe was as black as sin and the ripple under the bows like liquid fire i was naturally chary of clambering up into it i was anxious to see what he was up to first he seemed to be lying cuddled up in a lump in the bows and the stern was all out of water the thing kept turning round slowly as it driftedkind of waltzing dont you know i went to the stern and pulled it down expecting him to wake up then i began to clamber in with my knife in my hand and ready for a rush but he never stirred so there i sat in the stern of the little canoe drifting away over the calm phosphorescent sea and with all the host of the stars above me waiting for something to happen  after a long time i called him by name but he never answered i was too tired to take any risks by going along to him so we sat there i fancy i dozed once or twice when the dawn came i saw he was as dead as a doornail and all puffed up and purple my three eggs and the bones were lying in the middle of the canoe and the keg of water and some coffee and biscuits wrapped in a cape argus by his feet and a tin of methylated spirit underneath him there was no paddle nor in fact anything except the spirittin that i could use as one so i settled to drift until i was picked up i held an inquest on him brought in a verdict against some snake scorpion or centipede unknown and sent him overboard  after that i had a drink of water and a few biscuits and took a look round i suppose a man low down as i was dont see very far leastways madagascar was clean out of sight and any trace of land at all i saw a sail going southwestwardlooked like a schooner but her hull never came up presently the sun got high in the sky and began to beat down upon me lord it pretty near made my brains boil i tried dipping my head in the sea but after a while my eye fell on the cape argus and i lay down flat in the canoe and spread this over me wonderful things these newspapers i never read one through thoroughly before but its odd what you get up to when youre alone as i was i suppose i read that blessed old cape argus twenty times the pitch in the canoe simply reeked with the heat and rose up into big blisters  i drifted ten days said the man with the scar its a little thing in the telling isnt it every day was like the last except in the morning and the evening i never kept a lookout eventhe blaze was so infernal i didnt see a sail after the first three days and those i saw took no notice of me about the sixth night a ship went by scarcely half a mile away from me with all its lights ablaze and its ports open looking like a big firefly there was music aboard i stood up and shouted and screamed at it the second day i broached one of the aepyornis eggs scraped the shell away at the end bit by bit and tried it and i was glad to find it was good enough to eat a bit flavourynot bad i meanbut with something of the taste of a ducks egg there was a kind of circular patch about six inches across on one side of the yoke and with streaks of blood and a white mark like a ladder in it that i thought queer but i did not understand what this meant at the time and i wasnt inclined to be particular the egg lasted me three days with biscuits and a drink of water i chewed coffee berries tooinvigorating stuff the second egg i opened about the eighth day and it scared me  the man with the scar paused yes he said developing  i daresay you find it hard to believe i did with the thing before me there the egg had been sunk in that cold black mud perhaps three hundred years but there was no mistaking it there was thewhat is itembryo with its big head and curved back and its heart beating under its throat and the yolk shrivelled up and great membranes spreading inside of the shell and all over the yolk here was i hatching out the eggs of the biggest of all extinct birds in a little canoe in the midst of the indian ocean if old dawson had known that it was worth four years salary what do you think  however i had to eat that precious thing up every bit of it before i sighted the reef and some of the mouthfuls were beastly unpleasant i left the third one alone i held it up to the light but the shell was too thick for me to get any notion of what might be happening inside and though i fancied i heard blood pulsing it might have been the rustle in my own ears like what you listen to in a seashell  then came the atoll came out of the sunrise as it were suddenly close up to me i drifted straight towards it until i was about half a mile from shore not more and then the current took a turn and i had to paddle as hard as i could with my hands and bits of the aepyornis shell to make the place however i got there it was just a common atoll about four miles round with a few trees growing and a spring in one place and the lagoon full of parrotfish i took the egg ashore and put it in a good place well above the tide lines and in the sun to give it all the chance i could and pulled the canoe up safe and loafed about prospecting its rum how dull an atoll is as soon as i had found a spring all the interest seemed to vanish when i was a kid i thought nothing could be finer or more adventurous than the robinson crusoe business but that place was as monotonous as a book of sermons i went round finding eatable things and generally thinking but i tell you i was bored to death before the first day was out it shows my luckthe very day i landed the weather changed a thunderstorm went by to the north and flicked its wing over the island and in the night there came a drencher and a howling wind slap over us it wouldnt have taken much you know to upset that canoe  i was sleeping under the canoe and the egg was luckily among the sand higher up the beach and the first thing i remember was a sound like a hundred pebbles hitting the boat at once and a rush of water over my body id been dreaming of antananarivo and i sat up and holloaed to intoshi to ask her what the devil was up and clawed out at the chair where the matches used to be then i remembered where i was there were phosphorescent waves rolling up as if they meant to eat me and all the rest of the night as black as pitch the air was simply yelling the clouds seemed down on your head almost and the rain fell as if heaven was sinking and they were baling out the waters above the firmament one great roller came writhing at me like a fiery serpent and i bolted then i thought of the canoe and ran down to it as the water went hissing back again but the thing had gone i wondered about the egg then and felt my way to it it was all right and well out of reach of the maddest waves so i sat down beside it and cuddled it for company lord what a night that was  the storm was over before the morning there wasnt a rag of cloud left in the sky when the dawn came and all along the beach there were bits of plank scatteredwhich was the disarticulated skeleton so to speak of my canoe however that gave me something to do for taking advantage of two of the trees being together i rigged up a kind of stormshelter with these vestiges and that day the egg hatched  hatched sir when my head was pillowed on it and i was asleep i heard a whack and felt a jar and sat up and there was the end of the egg pecked out and a rum little brown head looking out at me lord i said youre welcome and with a little difficulty he came out  he was a nice friendly little chap at first about the size of a small henvery much like most other young birds only bigger his plumage was a dirty brown to begin with with a sort of grey scab that fell off it very soon and scarcely feathersa kind of downy hair i can hardly express how pleased i was to see him i tell you robinson crusoe dont make near enough of his loneliness but here was interesting company he looked at me and winked his eye from the front backwards like a hen and gave a chirp and began to peck about at once as though being hatched three hundred years too late was just nothing glad to see you man friday says i for i had naturally settled he was to be called man friday if ever he was hatched as soon as ever i found the egg in the canoe had developed i was a bit anxious about his feed so i gave him a lump of raw parrotfish at once he took it and opened his beak for more i was glad of that for under the circumstances if hed been at all fanciful i should have had to eat him after all  youd be surprised what an interesting bird that aepyornis chick was he followed me about from the very beginning he used to stand by me and watch while i fished in the lagoon and go shares in anything i caught and he was sensible too there were nasty green warty things like pickled gherkins used to lie about on the beach and he tried one of these and it upset him he never even looked at any of them again  and he grew you could almost see him grow and as i was never much of a society man his quiet friendly ways suited me to a t for nearly two years we were as happy as we could be on that island i had no business worries for i knew my salary was mounting up at dawsons we would see a sail now and then but nothing ever came near us i amused myself too by decorating the island with designs worked in seaurchins and fancy shells of various kinds i put aepyornis island all round the place very nearly in big letters like what you see done with coloured stones at railway stations in the old country and mathematical calculations and drawings of various sorts and i used to lie watching the blessed bird stalking round and growing growing and think how i could make a living out of him by showing him about if i ever got taken off after his first moult he began to get handsome with a crest and a blue wattle and a lot of green feathers at the behind of him and then i used to puzzle whether dawsons had any right to claim him or not stormy weather and in the rainy season we lay snug under the shelter i had made out of the old canoe and i used to tell him lies about my friends at home and after a storm we would go round the island together to see if there was any drift it was a kind of idyll you might say if only i had had some tobacco it would have been simply just like heaven  it was about the end of the second year our little paradise went wrong friday was then about fourteen feet high to the bill of him with a big broad head like the end of a pickaxe and two huge brown eyes with yellow rims set together like a mansnot out of sight of each other like a hens his plumage was finenone of the halfmourning style of your ostrichmore like a cassowary as far as colour and texture go and then it was he began to cock his comb at me and give himself airs and show signs of a nasty temper   at last came a time when my fishing had been rather unlucky and he began to hang about me in a queer meditative way i thought he might have been eating seacucumbers or something but it was really just discontent on his part i was hungry too and when at last i landed a fish i wanted it for myself tempers were short that morning on both sides he pecked at it and grabbed it and i gave him a whack on the head to make him leave go and at that he went for me lord   he gave me this in the face the man indicated his scar then he kicked me it was like a carthorse i got up and seeing he hadnt finished i started off full tilt with my arms doubled up over my face but he ran on those gawky legs of his faster than a racehorse and kept landing out at me with sledgehammer kicks and bringing his pickaxe down on the back of my head i made for the lagoon and went in up to my neck he stopped at the water for he hated getting his feet wet and began to make a shindy something like a peacocks only hoarser he started strutting up and down the beach ill admit i felt small to see this blessed fossil lording it there and my head and face were all bleeding andwell my body just one jelly of bruises  i decided to swim across the lagoon and leave him alone for a bit until the affair blew over i shinned up the tallest palmtree and sat there thinking of it all i dont suppose i ever felt so hurt by anything before or since it was the brutal ingratitude of the creature id been more than a brother to him id hatched him educated him a great gawky outofdate bird and me a human beingheir of the ages and all that  i thought after a time hed begin to see things in that light himself and feel a little sorry for his behaviour i thought if i was to catch some nice little bits of fish perhaps and go to him presently in a casual kind of way and offer them to him he might do the sensible thing it took me some time to learn how unforgiving and cantankerous an extinct bird can be malice  i wont tell you all the little devices i tried to get that bird round again i simply cant it makes my cheek burn with shame even now to think of the snubs and buffets i had from this infernal curiosity i tried violence i chucked lumps of coral at him from a safe distance but he only swallowed them i shied my open knife at him and almost lost it though it was too big for him to swallow i tried starving him out and struck fishing but he took to picking along the beach at low water after worms and rubbed along on that half my time i spent up to my neck in the lagoon and the rest up the palmtrees one of them was scarcely high enough and when he caught me up it he had a regular bank holiday with the calves of my legs it got unbearable i dont know if you have ever tried sleeping up a palmtree it gave me the most horrible nightmares think of the shame of it too here was this extinct animal mooning about my island like a sulky duke and me not allowed to rest the sole of my foot on the place i used to cry with weariness and vexation i told him straight that i didnt mean to be chased about a desert island by any damned anachronisms i told him to go and peck a navigator of his own age but he only snapped his beak at me great ugly bird all legs and neck  i shouldnt like to say how long that went on altogether id have killed him sooner if id known how however i hit on a way of settling him at last it is a south american dodge i joined all my fishinglines together with stems of seaweed and things and made a stoutish string perhaps twelve yards in length or more and i fastened two lumps of coral rock to the ends of this it took me some time to do because every now and then i had to go into the lagoon or up a tree as the fancy took me this i whirled rapidly round my head and then let it go at him the first time i missed but the next time the string caught his legs beautifully and wrapped round them again and again over he went i threw it standing waistdeep in the lagoon and as soon as he went down i was out of the water and sawing at his neck with my knife   i dont like to think of that even now i felt like a murderer while i did it though my anger was hot against him when i stood over him and saw him bleeding on the white sand and his beautiful great legs and neck writhing in his last agony  pah  with that tragedy loneliness came upon me like a curse good lord you cant imagine how i missed that bird i sat by his corpse and sorrowed over him and shivered as i looked round the desolate silent reef i thought of what a jolly little bird he had been when he was hatched and of a thousand pleasant tricks he had played before he went wrong i thought if id only wounded him i might have nursed him round into a better understanding if id had any means of digging into the coral rock id have buried him i felt exactly as if he was human as it was i couldnt think of eating him so i put him in the lagoon and the little fishes picked him clean i didnt even save the feathers then one day a chap cruising about in a yacht had a fancy to see if my atoll still existed  he didnt come a moment too soon for i was about sick enough of the desolation of it and only hesitating whether i should walk out into the sea and finish up the business that way or fall back on the green things  i sold the bones to a man named winslowa dealer near the british museum and he says he sold them to old havers it seems havers didnt understand they were extra large and it was only after his death they attracted attention they called em aepyorniswhat was it  aepyornis vastus said i its funny the very thing was mentioned to me by a friend of mine when they found an aepyornis with a thigh a yard long they thought they had reached the top of the scale and called him aepyornis maximus then some one turned up another thighbone four feet six or more and that they called aepyornis titan then your vastus was found after old havers died in his collection and then a vastissimus turned up  winslow was telling me as much said the man with the scar if they get any more aepyornises he reckons some scientific swell will go and burst a bloodvessel but it was a queer thing to happen to a man wasnt it altogether       vii    the remarkable case of davidsons eyes  i  the transitory mental aberration of sidney davidson remarkable enough in itself is still more remarkable if wades explanation is to be credited it sets one dreaming of the oddest possibilities of intercommunication in the future of spending an intercalary five minutes on the other side of the world or being watched in our most secret operations by unsuspected eyes it happened that i was the immediate witness of davidsons seizure and so it falls naturally to me to put the story upon paper  when i say that i was the immediate witness of his seizure i mean that i was the first on the scene the thing happened at the harlow technical college just beyond the highgate archway he was alone in the larger laboratory when the thing happened i was in a smaller room where the balances are writing up some notes the thunderstorm had completely upset my work of course it was just after one of the louder peals that i thought i heard some glass smash in the other room i stopped writing and turned round to listen for a moment i heard nothing the hail was playing the devils tattoo on the corrugated zinc of the roof then came another sound a smashno doubt of it this time something heavy had been knocked off the bench i jumped up at once and went and opened the door leading into the big laboratory  i was surprised to hear a queer sort of laugh and saw davidson standing unsteadily in the middle of the room with a dazzled look on his face my first impression was that he was drunk he did not notice me he was clawing out at something invisible a yard in front of his face he put out his hand slowly rather hesitatingly and then clutched nothing whats come to it he said he held up his hands to his face fingers spread out great scott he said the thing happened three or four years ago when every one swore by that personage then he began raising his feet clumsily as though he had expected to find them glued to the floor  davidson cried i whats the matter with you he turned round in my direction and looked about for me he looked over me and at me and on either side of me without the slightest sign of seeing me waves he said and a remarkably neat schooner id swear that was bellows voice hullo he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice  i thought he was up to some foolery then i saw littered about his feet the shattered remains of the best of our electrometers whats up man said i youve smashed the electrometer  bellows again said he friends left if my hands are gone something about electrometers which way are you bellows he suddenly came staggering towards me the damned stuff cuts like butter he said he walked straight into the bench and recoiled none so buttery that he said and stood swaying  i felt scared davidson said i what on earths come over you  he looked round him in every direction i could swear that was bellows why dont you show yourself like a man bellows  it occurred to me that he must be suddenly struck blind i walked round the table and laid my hand upon his arm i never saw a man more startled in my life he jumped away from me and came round into an attitude of selfdefence his face fairly distorted with terror good god he cried what was that  its ibellows confound it davidson  he jumped when i answered him and staredhow can i express itright through me he began talking not to me but to himself here in broad daylight on a clear beach not a place to hide in he looked about him wildly here im off he suddenly turned and ran headlong into the big electromagnetso violently that as we found afterwards he bruised his shoulder and jawbone cruelly at that he stepped back a pace and cried out with almost a whimper what in heavens name has come over me he stood blanched with terror and trembling violently with his right arm clutching his left where that had collided with the magnet  by that time i was excited and fairly scared davidson said i dont be afraid  he was startled at my voice but not so excessively as before i repeated my words in as clear and as firm a tone as i could assume bellows he said is that you  cant you see its me  he laughed i cant even see its myself where the devil are we  here said i in the laboratory  the laboratory he answered in a puzzled tone and put his hand to his forehead i was in the laboratorytill that flash came but im hanged if im there now what ship is that  theres no ship said i do be sensible old chap  no ship he repeated and seemed to forget my denial forthwith i suppose said he slowly were both dead but the rummy part is i feel just as though i still had a body dont get used to it all at once i suppose the old shop was struck by lightning i suppose jolly quick thing bellowseigh  dont talk nonsense youre very much alive you are in the laboratory blundering about youve just smashed a new electrometer i dont envy you when boyce arrives  he stared away from me towards the diagrams of cryohydrates i must be deaf said he theyve fired a gun for there goes the puff of smoke and i never heard a sound  i put my hand on his arm again and this time he was less alarmed we seem to have a sort of invisible bodies said he by jove theres a boat coming round the headland its very much like the old life after allin a different climate  i shook his arm davidson i cried wake up    ii  it was just then that boyce came in so soon as he spoke davidson exclaimed old boyce dead too what a lark i hastened to explain that davidson was in a kind of somnambulistic trance boyce was interested at once we both did all we could to rouse the fellow out of his extraordinary state he answered our questions and asked us some of his own but his attention seemed distracted by his hallucination about a beach and a ship he kept interpolating observations concerning some boat and the davits and sails filling with the wind it made one feel queer in the dusky laboratory to hear him saying such things  he was blind and helpless we had to walk him down the passage one at each elbow to boyces private room and while boyce talked to him there and humoured him about this ship idea i went along the corridor and asked old wade to come and look at him the voice of our dean sobered him a little but not very much he asked where his hands were and why he had to walk about up to his waist in the ground wade thought over him a long timeyou know how he knits his browsand then made him feel the couch guiding his hands to it thats a couch said wade the couch in the private room of professor boyce horsehair stuffing  davidson felt about and puzzled over it and answered presently that he could feel it all right but he couldnt see it  what do you see asked wade davidson said he could see nothing but a lot of sand and brokenup shells wade gave him some other things to feel telling him what they were and watching him keenly  the ship is almost hull down said davidson presently apropos of nothing  never mind the ship said wade listen to me davidson do you know what hallucination means  rather said davidson  well everything you see is hallucinatory  bishop berkeley said davidson  dont mistake me said wade you are alive and in this room of boyces but something has happened to your eyes you cannot see you can feel and hear but not see do you follow me  it seems to me that i see too much davidson rubbed his knuckles into his eyes well he said  thats all dont let it perplex you bellows here and i will take you home in a cab  wait a bit davidson thought help me to sit down said he presently and nowim sorry to trouble youbut will you tell me all that over again  wade repeated it very patiently davidson shut his eyes and pressed his hands upon his forehead yes said he its quite right now my eyes are shut i know youre right thats you bellows sitting by me on the couch im in england again and were in the dark  then he opened his eyes and there said he is the sun just rising and the yards of the ship and a tumbled sea and a couple of birds flying i never saw anything so real and im sitting up to my neck in a bank of sand  he bent forward and covered his face with his hands then he opened his eyes again dark sea and sunrise and yet im sitting on a sofa in old boyces room god help me    iii  that was the beginning for three weeks this strange affection of davidsons eyes continued unabated it was far worse than being blind he was absolutely helpless and had to be fed like a newlyhatched bird and led about and undressed if he attempted to move he fell over things or struck himself against walls or doors after a day or so he got used to hearing our voices without seeing us and willingly admitted he was at home and that wade was right in what he told him my sister to whom he was engaged insisted on coming to see him and would sit for hours every day while he talked about this beach of his holding her hand seemed to comfort him immensely he explained that when we left the college and drove homehe lived in hampstead villageit appeared to him as if we drove right through a sandhillit was perfectly black until he emerged againand through rocks and trees and solid obstacles and when he was taken to his own room it made him giddy and almost frantic with the fear of falling because going upstairs seemed to lift him thirty or forty feet above the rocks of his imaginary island he kept saying he should smash all the eggs the end was that he had to be taken down into his fathers consulting room and laid upon a couch that stood there  he described the island as being a bleak kind of place on the whole with very little vegetation except some peaty stuff and a lot of bare rock there were multitudes of penguins and they made the rocks white and disagreeable to see the sea was often rough and once there was a thunderstorm and he lay and shouted at the silent flashes once or twice seals pulled up on the beach but only on the first two or three days he said it was very funny the way in which the penguins used to waddle right through him and how he seemed to lie among them without disturbing them  i remember one odd thing and that was when he wanted very badly to smoke we put a pipe in his handshe almost poked his eye out with itand lit it but he couldnt taste anything ive since found its the same with mei dont know if its the usual casethat i cannot enjoy tobacco at all unless i can see the smoke  but the queerest part of his vision came when wade sent him out in a bathchair to get fresh air the davidsons hired a chair and got that deaf and obstinate dependant of theirs widgery to attend to it widgerys ideas of healthy expeditions were peculiar my sister who had been to the dogs home met them in camden town towards kings cross widgery trotting along complacently and davidson evidently most distressed trying in his feeble blind way to attract widgerys attention  he positively wept when my sister spoke to him oh get me out of this horrible darkness he said feeling for her hand i must get out of it or i shall die he was quite incapable of explaining what was the matter but my sister decided he must go home and presently as they went uphill towards hampstead the horror seemed to drop from him he said it was good to see the stars again though it was then about noon and a blazing day  it seemed he told me afterwards as if i was being carried irresistibly towards the water i was not very much alarmed at first of course it was night therea lovely night  of course i asked for that struck me as odd  of course said he its always night there when it is day here well we went right into the water which was calm and shining under the moonlightjust a broad swell that seemed to grow broader and flatter as i came down into it the surface glistened just like a skinit might have been empty space underneath for all i could tell to the contrary very slowly for i rode slanting into it the water crept up to my eyes then i went under and the skin seemed to break and heal again about my eyes the moon gave a jump up in the sky and grew green and dim and fish faintly glowing came darting round meand things that seemed made of luminous glass and i passed through a tangle of seaweeds that shone with an oily lustre and so i drove down into the sea and the stars went out one by one and the moon grew greener and darker and the seaweed became a luminous purplered it was all very faint and mysterious and everything seemed to quiver and all the while i could hear the wheels of the bathchair creaking and the footsteps of people going by and a man in the distance selling the special pall mall  i kept sinking down deeper and deeper into the water it became inky black about me not a ray from above came down into that darkness and the phosphorescent things grew brighter and brighter the snaky branches of the deeper weeds flickered like the flames of spiritlamps but after a time there were no more weeds the fishes came staring and gaping towards me and into me and through me i never imagined such fishes before they had lines of fire along the sides of them as though they had been outlined with a luminous pencil and there was a ghastly thing swimming backwards with a lot of twining arms and then i saw coming very slowly towards me through the gloom a hazy mass of light that resolved itself as it drew nearer into multitudes of fishes struggling and darting round something that drifted i drove on straight towards it and presently i saw in the midst of the tumult and by the light of the fish a bit of splintered spar looming over me and a dark hull tilting over and some glowing phosphorescent forms that were shaken and writhed as the fish bit at them then it was i began to try to attract widgerys attention a horror came upon me ugh i should have driven right into those halfeatenthings if your sister had not come they had great holes in them bellows and  never mind but it was ghastly   iv  for three weeks davidson remained in this singular state seeing what at the time we imagined was an altogether phantasmal world and stone blind to the world around him then one tuesday when i called i met old davidson in the passage he can see his thumb the old gentleman said in a perfect transport he was struggling into his overcoat he can see his thumb bellows he said with the tears in his eyes the lad will be all right yet  i rushed in to davidson he was holding up a little book before his face and looking at it and laughing in a weak kind of way  its amazing said he theres a kind of patch come there he pointed with his finger im on the rocks as usual and the penguins are staggering and flapping about as usual and theres been a whale showing every now and then but its got too dark now to make him out but put something there and i see iti do see it its very dim and broken in places but i see it all the same like a faint spectre of itself i found it out this morning while they were dressing me its like a hole in this infernal phantom world just put your hand by mine nonot there ah yes i see it the base of your thumb and a bit of cuff it looks like the ghost of a bit of your hand sticking out of the darkling sky just by it theres a group of stars like a cross coming out  from that time davidson began to mend his account of the change like his account of the vision was oddly convincing over patches of his field of vision the phantom world grew fainter grew transparent as it were and through these translucent gaps he began to see dimly the real world about him the patches grew in size and number ran together and spread until only here and there were blind spots left upon his eyes he was able to get up and steer himself about feed himself once more read smoke and behave like an ordinary citizen again at first it was very confusing to him to have these two pictures overlapping each other like the changing views of a lantern but in a little while he began to distinguish the real from the illusory  at first he was unfeignedly glad and seemed only too anxious to complete his cure by taking exercise and tonics but as that odd island of his began to fade away from him he became queerly interested in it he wanted particularly to go down into the deep sea again and would spend half his time wandering about the lowlying parts of london trying to find the waterlogged wreck he had seen drifting the glare of real daylight very soon impressed him so vividly as to blot out everything of his shadowy world but of a nighttime in a darkened room he could still see the whitesplashed rocks of the island and the clumsy penguins staggering to and fro but even these grew fainter and fainter and at last soon after he married my sister he saw them for the last time   v  and now to tell of the queerest thing of all about two years after his cure i dined with the davidsons and after dinner a man named atkins called in he is a lieutenant in the royal navy and a pleasant talkative man he was on friendly terms with my brotherinlaw and was soon on friendly terms with me it came out that he was engaged to davidsons cousin and incidentally he took out a kind of pocket photograph case to show us a new rendering of his fiancée and bytheby said he heres the old fulmar  davidson looked at it casually then suddenly his face lit up good heavens said he i could almost swear  what said atkins  that i had seen that ship before  dont see how you can have she hasnt been out of the south seas for six years and before then  but began davidson and then yesthats the ship i dreamt of im sure thats the ship i dreamt of she was standing off an island that swarmed with penguins and she fired a gun  good lord said atkins who had now heard the particulars of the seizure how the deuce could you dream that  and then bit by bit it came out that on the very day davidson was seized hms fulmar had actually been off a little rock to the south of antipodes island a boat had landed overnight to get penguins eggs had been delayed and a thunderstorm drifting up the boats crew had waited until the morning before rejoining the ship atkins had been one of them and he corroborated word for word the descriptions davidson had given of the island and the boat there is not the slightest doubt in any of our minds that davidson has really seen the place in some unaccountable way while he moved hither and thither in london his sight moved hither and thither in a manner that corresponded about this distant island how is absolutely a mystery  that completes the remarkable story of davidsons eyes its perhaps the best authenticated case in existence of real vision at a distance explanation there is none forthcoming except what professor wade has thrown out but his explanation invokes the fourth dimension and a dissertation on theoretical kinds of space to talk of there being a kink in space seems mere nonsense to me it may be because i am no mathematician when i said that nothing would alter the fact that the place is eight thousand miles away he answered that two points might be a yard away on a sheet of paper and yet be brought together by bending the paper round the reader may grasp his argument but i certainly do not his idea seems to be that davidson stooping between the poles of the big electromagnet had some extraordinary twist given to his retinal elements through the sudden change in the field of force due to the lightning  he thinks as a consequence of this that it may be possible to live visually in one part of the world while one lives bodily in another he has even made some experiments in support of his views but so far he has simply succeeded in blinding a few dogs i believe that is the net result of his work though i have not seen him for some weeks latterly i have been so busy with my work in connection with the saint pancras installation that i have had little opportunity of calling to see him but the whole of his theory seems fantastic to me the facts concerning davidson stand on an altogether different footing and i can testify personally to the accuracy of every detail i have given       viii    the lord of the dynamos   the chief attendant of the three dynamos that buzzed and rattled at camberwell and kept the electric railway going came out of yorkshire and his name was james holroyd he was a practical electrician but fond of whisky a heavy redhaired brute with irregular teeth he doubted the existence of the deity but accepted carnots cycle and he had read shakespeare and found him weak in chemistry his helper came out of the mysterious east and his name was azumazi but holroyd called him poohbah holroyd liked a nigger help because he would stand kickinga habit with holroydand did not pry into the machinery and try to learn the ways of it certain odd possibilities of the negro mind brought into abrupt contact with the crown of our civilisation holroyd never fully realised though just at the end he got some inkling of them  to define azumazi was beyond ethnology he was perhaps more negroid than anything else though his hair was curly rather than frizzy and his nose had a bridge moreover his skin was brown rather than black and the whites of his eyes were yellow his broad cheekbones and narrow chin gave his face something of the viperine v his head too was broad behind and low and narrow at the forehead as if his brain had been twisted round in the reverse way to a europeans he was short of stature and still shorter of english in conversation he made numerous odd noises of no known marketable value and his infrequent words were carved and wrought into heraldic grotesqueness holroyd tried to elucidate his religious beliefs andespecially after whiskylectured to him against superstition and missionaries azumazi however shirked the discussion of his gods even though he was kicked for it  azumazi had come clad in white but insufficient raiment out of the stokehole of the lord clive from the straits settlements and beyond into london he had heard even in his youth of the greatness and riches of london where all the women are white and fair and even the beggars in the streets are white and he had arrived with newlyearned gold coins in his pocket to worship at the shrine of civilisation the day of his landing was a dismal one the sky was dun and a windworried drizzle filtered down to the greasy streets but he plunged boldly into the delights of shadwell and was presently cast up shattered in health civilised in costume penniless and except in matters of the direst necessity practically a dumb animal to toil for james holroyd and to be bullied by him in the dynamo shed at camberwell and to james holroyd bullying was a labour of love  there were three dynamos with their engines at camberwell the two that have been there since the beginning are small machines the larger one was new the smaller machines made a reasonable noise their straps hummed over the drums every now and then the brushes buzzed and fizzled and the air churned steadily whoo whoo whoo between their poles one was loose in its foundations and kept the shed vibrating but the big dynamo drowned these little noises altogether with the sustained drone of its iron core which somehow set part of the ironwork humming the place made the visitors head reel with the throb throb throb of the engines the rotation of the big wheels the spinning ballvalves the occasional spittings of the steam and over all the deep unceasing surging note of the big dynamo this last noise was from an engineering point of view a defect but azumazi accounted it unto the monster for mightiness and pride  if it were possible we would have the noises of that shed always about the reader as he reads we would tell all our story to such an accompaniment it was a steady stream of din from which the ear picked out first one thread and then another there was the intermittent snorting panting and seething of the steam engines the suck and thud of their pistons the dull beat on the air as the spokes of the great driving wheels came round a note the leather straps made as they ran tighter and looser and a fretful tumult from the dynamos and over all sometimes inaudible as the ear tired of it and then creeping back upon the senses again was this trombone note of the big machine the floor never felt steady and quiet beneath ones feet but quivered and jarred it was a confusing unsteady place and enough to send anyones thoughts jerking into odd zigzags and for three months while the big strike of the engineers was in progress holroyd who was a blackleg and azumazi who was a mere black were never out of the stir and eddy of it but slept and fed in the little wooden shanty between the shed and the gates  holroyd delivered a theological lecture on the text of his big machine soon after azumazi came he had to shout to be heard in the din look at that said holroyd wheres your eathen idol to match im and azumazi looked for a moment holroyd was inaudible and then azumazi heard kill a hundred men twelve per cent on the ordinary shares said holroyd and thats something like a gord  holroyd was proud of his big dynamo and expatiated upon its size and power to azumazi until heaven knows what odd currents of thought that and the incessant whirling and shindy set up within the curly black cranium he would explain in the most graphic manner the dozen or so ways in which a man might be killed by it and once he gave azumazi a shock as a sample of its quality after that in the breathingtimes of his labourit was heavy labour being not only his own but most of holroydsazumazi would sit and watch the big machine now and then the brushes would sparkle and spit blue flashes at which holroyd would swear but all the rest was as smooth and rhythmic as breathing the band ran shouting over the shaft and ever behind one as one watched was the complacent thud of the piston so it lived all day in this big airy shed with him and holroyd to wait upon it not prisoned up and slaving to drive a ship as the other engines he knewmere captive devils of the british solomonhad been but a machine enthroned those two smaller dynamos azumazi by force of contrast despised the large one he privately christened the lord of the dynamos they were fretful and irregular but the big dynamo was steady how great it was how serene and easy in its working greater and calmer even than the buddhas he had seen at rangoon and yet not motionless but living the great black coils spun spun spun the rings ran round under the brushes and the deep note of its coil steadied the whole it affected azumazi queerly  azumazi was not fond of labour he would sit about and watch the lord of the dynamos while holroyd went away to persuade the yard porter to get whisky although his proper place was not in the dynamo shed but behind the engines and moreover if holroyd caught him skulking he got hit for it with a rod of stout copper wire he would go and stand close to the colossus and look up at the great leather band running overhead there was a black patch on the band that came round and it pleased him somehow among all the clatter to watch this return again and again odd thoughts spun with the whirl of it scientific people tell us that savages give souls to rocks and treesand a machine is a thousand times more alive than a rock or a tree and azumazi was practically a savage still the veneer of civilisation lay no deeper than his slop suit his bruises and the coal grime on his face and hands his father before him had worshipped a meteoric stone kindred blood it may be had splashed the broad wheels of juggernaut  he took every opportunity holroyd gave him of touching and handling the great dynamo that was fascinating him he polished and cleaned it until the metal parts were blinding in the sun he felt a mysterious sense of service in doing this he would go up to it and touch its spinning coils gently the gods he had worshipped were all far away the people in london hid their gods  at last his dim feelings grew more distinct and took shape in thoughts and at last in acts when he came into the roaring shed one morning he salaamed to the lord of the dynamos and then when holroyd was away he went and whispered to the thundering machine that he was its servant and prayed it to have pity on him and save him from holroyd as he did so a rare gleam of light came in through the open archway of the throbbing machineshed and the lord of the dynamos as he whirled and roared was radiant with pale gold then azumazi knew that his service was acceptable to his lord after that he did not feel so lonely as he had done and he had indeed been very much alone in london and even when his worktime was over which was rare he loitered about the shed  then the next time holroyd maltreated him azumazi went presently to the lord of the dynamos and whispered thou seest o my lord and the angry whirr of the machinery seemed to answer him thereafter it appeared to him that whenever holroyd came into the shed a different note came into the sounds of the dynamo my lord bides his time said azumazi to himself the iniquity of the fool is not yet ripe and he waited and watched for the day of reckoning one day there was evidence of short circuiting and holroyd making an unwary examinationit was in the afternoongot a rather severe shock azumazi from behind the engine saw him jump off and curse at the peccant coil  he is warned said azumazi to himself surely my lord is very patient  holroyd had at first initiated his nigger into such elementary conceptions of the dynamos working as would enable him to take temporary charge of the shed in his absence but when he noticed the manner in which azumazi hung about the monster he became suspicious he dimly perceived his assistant was up to something and connecting him with the anointing of the coils with oil that had rotted the varnish in one place he issued an edict shouted above the confusion of the machinery dont ee go nigh that big dynamo any more poohbah or all take thy skin off besides if it pleased azumazi to be near the big machine it was plain sense and decency to keep him away from it  azumazi obeyed at the time but later he was caught bowing before the lord of the dynamos at which holroyd twisted his arm and kicked him as he turned to go away as azumazi presently stood behind the engine and glared at the back of the hated holroyd the noises of the machinery took a new rhythm and sounded like four words in his native tongue  it is hard to say exactly what madness is i fancy azumazi was mad the incessant din and whirl of the dynamo shed may have churned up his little store of knowledge and big store of superstitious fancy at last into something akin to frenzy at any rate when the idea of making holroyd a sacrifice to the dynamo fetich was thus suggested to him it filled him with a strange tumult of exultant emotion  that night the two men and their black shadows were alone in the shed together the shed was lit with one big arc light that winked and flickered purple the shadows lay black behind the dynamos the ball governors of the engines whirled from light to darkness and their pistons beat loud and steady the world outside seen through the open end of the shed seemed incredibly dim and remote it seemed absolutely silent too since the riot of the machinery drowned every external sound far away was the black fence of the yard with grey shadowy houses behind and above was the deep blue sky and the pale little stars azumazi suddenly walked across the centre of the shed above which the leather bands were running and went into the shadow by the big dynamo holroyd heard a click and the spin of the armature changed  what are you dewin with that switch he bawled in surprise hant i told you  then he saw the set expression of azumazis eyes as the asiatic came out of the shadow towards him  in another moment the two men were grappling fiercely in front of the great dynamo  you coffeeheaded fool gasped holroyd with a brown hand at his throat keep off those contact rings in another moment he was tripped and reeling back upon the lord of the dynamos he instinctively loosened his grip upon his antagonist to save himself from the machine  the messenger sent in furious haste from the station to find out what had happened in the dynamo shed met azumazi at the porters lodge by the gate azumazi tried to explain something but the messenger could make nothing of the blacks incoherent english and hurried on to the shed the machines were all noisily at work and nothing seemed to be disarranged there was however a queer smell of singed hair then he saw an oddlooking crumpled mass clinging to the front of the big dynamo and approaching recognised the distorted remains of holroyd  the man stared and hesitated a moment then he saw the face and shut his eyes convulsively he turned on his heel before he opened them so that he should not see holroyd again and went out of the shed to get advice and help  when azumazi saw holroyd die in the grip of the great dynamo he had been a little scared about the consequences of his act yet he felt strangely elated and knew that the favour of the lord dynamo was upon him his plan was already settled when he met the man coming from the station and the scientific manager who speedily arrived on the scene jumped at the obvious conclusion of suicide this expert scarcely noticed azumazi except to ask a few questions did he see holroyd kill himself azumazi explained he had been out of sight at the engine furnace until he heard a difference in the noise from the dynamo it was not a difficult examination being untinctured by suspicion  the distorted remains of holroyd which the electrician removed from the machine were hastily covered by the porter with a coffeestained tablecloth somebody by a happy inspiration fetched a medical man the expert was chiefly anxious to get the machine at work again for seven or eight trains had stopped midway in the stuffy tunnels of the electric railway azumazi answering or misunderstanding the questions of the people who had by authority or impudence come into the shed was presently sent back to the stokehole by the scientific manager of course a crowd collected outside the gates of the yarda crowd for no known reason always hovers for a day or two near the scene of a sudden death in londontwo or three reporters percolated somehow into the engineshed and one even got to azumazi but the scientific expert cleared them out again being himself an amateur journalist  presently the body was carried away and public interest departed with it azumazi remained very quietly at his furnace seeing over and over again in the coals a figure that wriggled violently and became still an hour after the murder to any one coming into the shed it would have looked exactly as if nothing remarkable had ever happened there peeping presently from his engineroom the black saw the lord dynamo spin and whirl beside his little brothers and the driving wheels were beating round and the steam in the pistons went thud thud exactly as it had been earlier in the evening after all from the mechanical point of view it had been a most insignificant incidentthe mere temporary deflection of a current but now the slender form and slender shadow of the scientific manager replaced the sturdy outline of holroyd travelling up and down the lane of light upon the vibrating floor under the straps between the engines and the dynamos  have i not served my lord said azumazi inaudibly from his shadow and the note of the great dynamo rang out full and clear as he looked at the big whirling mechanism the strange fascination of it that had been a little in abeyance since holroyds death resumed its sway  never had azumazi seen a man killed so swiftly and pitilessly the big humming machine had slain its victim without wavering for a second from its steady beating it was indeed a mighty god  the unconscious scientific manager stood with his back to him scribbling on a piece of paper his shadow lay at the foot of the monster  was the lord dynamo still hungry his servant was ready  azumazi made a stealthy step forward then stopped the scientific manager suddenly ceased his writing walked down the shed to the endmost of the dynamos and began to examine the brushes  azumazi hesitated and then slipped across noiselessly into the shadow by the switch there he waited presently the managers footsteps could be heard returning he stopped in his old position unconscious of the stoker crouching ten feet away from him then the big dynamo suddenly fizzled and in another moment azumazi had sprung out of the darkness upon him  first the scientific manager was gripped round the body and swung towards the big dynamo then kicking with his knee and forcing his antagonists head down with his hands he loosened the grip on his waist and swung round away from the machine then the black grasped him again putting a curly head against his chest and they swayed and panted as it seemed for an age or so then the scientific manager was impelled to catch a black ear in his teeth and bite furiously the black yelled hideously  they rolled over on the floor and the black who had apparently slipped from the vice of the teeth or parted with some earthe scientific manager wondered which at the timetried to throttle him the scientific manager was making some ineffectual efforts to claw something with his hands and to kick when the welcome sound of quick footsteps sounded on the floor the next moment azumazi had left him and darted towards the big dynamo there was a splutter amid the roar  the officer of the company who had entered stood staring as azumazi caught the naked terminals in his hands gave one horrible convulsion and then hung motionless from the machine his face violently distorted  im jolly glad you came in when you did said the scientific manager still sitting on the floor  he looked at the still quivering figure it is not a nice death to die apparentlybut it is quick  the official was still staring at the body he was a man of slow apprehension  there was a pause  the scientific manager got up on his feet rather awkwardly he ran his fingers along his collar thoughtfully and moved his head to and fro several times  poor holroyd i see now then almost mechanically he went towards the switch in the shadow and turned the current into the railway circuit again as he did so the singed body loosened its grip upon the machine and fell forward on its face the core of the dynamo roared out loud and clear and the armature beat the air  so ended prematurely the worship of the dynamo deity perhaps the most shortlived of all religions yet withal it could at least boast a martyrdom and a human sacrifice      ix    the moth   probably you have heard of hapleynot w t hapley the son but the celebrated hapley the hapley of periplaneta hapliia hapley the entomologist  if so you know at least of the great feud between hapley and professor pawkins though certain of its consequences may be new to you for those who have not a word or two of explanation is necessary which the idle reader may go over with a glancing eye if his indolence so incline him  it is amazing how very widely diffused is the ignorance of such really important matters as this hapleypawkins feud those epochmaking controversies again that have convulsed the geological society are i verily believe almost entirely unknown outside the fellowship of that body i have heard men of fair general education even refer to the great scenes at these meetings as vestrymeeting squabbles yet the great hate of the english and scotch geologists has lasted now half a century and has left deep and abundant marks upon the body of the science and this hapleypawkins business though perhaps a more personal affair stirred passions as profound if not profounder your common man has no conception of the zeal that animates a scientific investigator the fury of contradiction you can arouse in him it is the odium theologicum in a new form there are men for instance who would gladly burn professor ray lankester at smithfield for his treatment of the mollusca in the encyclopaedia that fantastic extension of the cephalopods to cover the pteropods  but i wander from hapley and pawkins  it began years and years ago with a revision of the microlepidoptera whatever these may be by pawkins in which he extinguished a new species created by hapley hapley who was always quarrelsome replied by a stinging impeachment of the entire classification of pawkinsa pawkins in his rejoinderb suggested that hapleys microscope was as defective as his power of observation and called him an irresponsible meddler hapley was not a professor at that time hapley in his retortc spoke of blundering collectors and described as if inadvertently pawkins revision as a miracle of ineptitude it was war to the knife however it would scarcely interest the reader to detail how these two great men quarrelled and how the split between them widened until from the microlepidoptera they were at war upon every open question in entomology there were memorable occasions at times the royal entomological society meetings resembled nothing so much as the chamber of deputies on the whole i fancy pawkins was nearer the truth than hapley but hapley was skilful with his rhetoric had a turn for ridicule rare in a scientific man was endowed with vast energy and had a fine sense of injury in the matter of the extinguished species while pawkins was a man of dull presence prosy of speech in shape not unlike a waterbarrel over conscientious with testimonials and suspected of jobbing museum appointments so the young men gathered round hapley and applauded him it was a long struggle vicious from the beginning and growing at last to pitiless antagonism the successive turns of fortune now an advantage to one side and now to anothernow hapley tormented by some success of pawkins and now pawkins outshone by hapley belong rather to the history of entomology than to this story  footnote a remarks on a recent revision of microlepidoptera quart journ entomological soc 1863  footnote b rejoinder to certain remarks etc ibid 1864  footnote c further remarks etc ibid  but in 1891 pawkins whose health had been bad for some time published some work upon the mesoblast of the deaths head moth what the mesoblast of the deaths head moth may be does not matter a rap in this story but the work was far below his usual standard and gave hapley an opening he had coveted for years he must have worked night and day to make the most of his advantage  in an elaborate critique he rent pawkins to tattersone can fancy the mans disordered black hair and his queer dark eyes flashing as he went for his antagonistand pawkins made a reply halting ineffectual with painful gaps of silence and yet malignant there was no mistaking his will to wound hapley nor his incapacity to do it but few of those who heard himi was absent from that meetingrealised how ill the man was  hapley got his opponent down and meant to finish him he followed with a simply brutal attack upon pawkins in the form of a paper upon the development of moths in general a paper showing evidence of a most extraordinary amount of mental labour and yet couched in a violently controversial tone violent as it was an editorial note witnesses that it was modified it must have covered pawkins with shame and confusion of face it left no loophole it was murderous in argument and utterly contemptuous in tone an awful thing for the declining years of a mans career  the world of entomologists waited breathlessly for the rejoinder from pawkins he would try one for pawkins had always been game but when it came it surprised them for the rejoinder of pawkins was to catch influenza proceed to pneumonia and die  it was perhaps as effectual a reply as he could make under the circumstances and largely turned the current of feeling against hapley the very people who had most gleefully cheered on those gladiators became serious at the consequence there could be no reasonable doubt the fret of the defeat had contributed to the death of pawkins there was a limit even to scientific controversy said serious people another crushing attack was already in the press and appeared on the day before the funeral i dont think hapley exerted himself to stop it people remembered how hapley had hounded down his rival and forgot that rivals defects scathing satire reads ill over fresh mould the thing provoked comment in the daily papers this it was that made me think that you had probably heard of hapley and this controversy but as i have already remarked scientific workers live very much in a world of their own half the people i dare say who go along piccadilly to the academy every year could not tell you where the learned societies abide many even think that research is a kind of happyfamily cage in which all kinds of men lie down together in peace  in his private thoughts hapley could not forgive pawkins for dying in the first place it was a mean dodge to escape the absolute pulverisation hapley had in hand for him and in the second it left hapleys mind with a queer gap in it for twenty years he had worked hard sometimes far into the night and seven days a week with microscope scalpel collectingnet and pen and almost entirely with reference to pawkins the european reputation he had won had come as an incident in that great antipathy he had gradually worked up to a climax in this last controversy it had killed pawkins but it had also thrown hapley out of gear so to speak and his doctor advised him to give up work for a time and rest so hapley went down into a quiet village in kent and thought day and night of pawkins and good things it was now impossible to say about him  at last hapley began to realise in what direction the preoccupation tended he determined to make a fight for it and started by trying to read novels but he could not get his mind off pawkins white in the face and making his last speechevery sentence a beautiful opening for hapley he turned to fictionand found it had no grip on him he read the island nights entertainments until his sense of causation was shocked beyond endurance by the bottle imp then he went to kipling and found he proved nothing besides being irreverent and vulgar these scientific people have their limitations then unhappily he tried besants inner house and the opening chapter set his mind upon learned societies and pawkins at once  so hapley turned to chess and found it a little more soothing he soon mastered the moves and the chief gambits and commoner closing positions and began to beat the vicar but then the cylindrical contours of the opposite king began to resemble pawkins standing up and gasping ineffectually against checkmate and hapley decided to give up chess  perhaps the study of some new branch of science would after all be better diversion the best rest is change of occupation hapley determined to plunge at diatoms and had one of his smaller microscopes and halibuts monograph sent down from london he thought that perhaps if he could get up a vigorous quarrel with halibut he might be able to begin life afresh and forget pawkins and very soon he was hard at work in his habitual strenuous fashion at these microscopic denizens of the wayside pool  it was on the third day of the diatoms that hapley became aware of a novel addition to the local fauna he was working late at the microscope and the only light in the room was the brilliant little lamp with the special form of green shade like all experienced microscopists he kept both eyes open it is the only way to avoid excessive fatigue one eye was over the instrument and bright and distinct before that was the circular field of the microscope across which a brown diatom was slowly moving with the other eye hapley saw as it were without seeing he was only dimly conscious of the brass side of the instrument the illuminated part of the tablecloth a sheet of notepaper the foot of the lamp and the darkened room beyond  suddenly his attention drifted from one eye to the other the tablecloth was of the material called tapestry by shopmen and rather brightly coloured the pattern was in gold with a small amount of crimson and pale blue upon a greyish ground at one point the pattern seemed displaced and there was a vibrating movement of the colours at this point  hapley suddenly moved his head back and looked with both eyes his mouth fell open with astonishment  it was a large moth or butterfly its wings spread in butterfly fashion  it was strange it should be in the room at all for the windows were closed strange that it should not have attracted his attention when fluttering to its present position strange that it should match the tablecloth stranger far that to him hapley the great entomologist it was altogether unknown there was no delusion it was crawling slowly towards the foot of the lamp  new genus by heavens and in england said hapley staring  then he suddenly thought of pawkins nothing would have maddened pawkins moreand pawkins was dead  something about the head and body of the insect became singularly suggestive of pawkins just as the chess king had been  confound pawkins said hapley but i must catch this and looking round him for some means of capturing the moth he rose slowly out of his chair suddenly the insect rose struck the edge of the lampshadehapley heard the pingand vanished into the shadow  in a moment hapley had whipped off the shade so that the whole room was illuminated the thing had disappeared but soon his practised eye detected it upon the wallpaper near the door he went towards it poising the lampshade for capture before he was within striking distance however it had risen and was fluttering round the room after the fashion of its kind it flew with sudden starts and turns seeming to vanish here and reappear there once hapley struck and missed then again  the third time he hit his microscope the instrument swayed struck and overturned the lamp and fell noisily upon the floor the lamp turned over on the table and very luckily went out hapley was left in the dark with a start he felt the strange moth blunder into his face  it was maddening he had no lights if he opened the door of the room the thing would get away in the darkness he saw pawkins quite distinctly laughing at him pawkins had ever an oily laugh he swore furiously and stamped his foot on the floor  there was a timid rapping at the door  then it opened perhaps a foot and very slowly the alarmed face of the landlady appeared behind a pink candle flame she wore a nightcap over her grey hair and had some purple garment over her shoulders what was that fearful smash she said has anything the strange moth appeared fluttering about the chink of the door shut that door said hapley and suddenly rushed at her  the door slammed hastily hapley was left alone in the dark then in the pause he heard his landlady scuttle upstairs lock her door and drag something heavy across the room and put against it  it became evident to hapley that his conduct and appearance had been strange and alarming confound the moth and pawkins however it was a pity to lose the moth now he felt his way into the hall and found the matches after sending his hat down upon the floor with a noise like a drum with the lighted candle he returned to the sittingroom no moth was to be seen yet once for a moment it seemed that the thing was fluttering round his head hapley very suddenly decided to give up the moth and go to bed but he was excited all night long his sleep was broken by dreams of the moth pawkins and his landlady twice in the night he turned out and soused his head in cold water  one thing was very clear to him his landlady could not possibly understand about the strange moth especially as he had failed to catch it no one but an entomologist would understand quite how he felt she was probably frightened at his behaviour and yet he failed to see how he could explain it he decided to say nothing further about the events of last night after breakfast he saw her in her garden and decided to go out and talk to reassure her he talked to her about beans and potatoes bees caterpillars and the price of fruit she replied in her usual manner but she looked at him a little suspiciously and kept walking as he walked so that there was always a bed of flowers or a row of beans or something of the sort between them after a while he began to feel singularly irritated at this and to conceal his vexation went indoors and presently went out for a walk  the moth or butterfly trailing an odd flavour of pawkins with it kept coming into that walk though he did his best to keep his mind off it once he saw it quite distinctly with its wings flattened out upon the old stone wall that runs along the west edge of the park but going up to it he found it was only two lumps of grey and yellow lichen this said hapley is the reverse of mimicry instead of a butterfly looking like a stone here is a stone looking like a butterfly once something hovered and fluttered round his head but by an effort of will he drove that impression out of his mind again  in the afternoon hapley called upon the vicar and argued with him upon theological questions they sat in the little arbour covered with briar and smoked as they wrangled look at that moth said hapley suddenly pointing to the edge of the wooden table  where said the vicar  you dont see a moth on the edge of the table there said hapley  certainly not said the vicar  hapley was thunderstruck he gasped the vicar was staring at him clearly the man saw nothing the eye of faith is no better than the eye of science said hapley awkwardly  i dont see your point said the vicar thinking it was part of the argument  that night hapley found the moth crawling over his counterpane he sat on the edge of the bed in his shirt sleeves and reasoned with himself was it pure hallucination he knew he was slipping and he battled for his sanity with the same silent energy he had formerly displayed against pawkins so persistent is mental habit that he felt as if it were still a struggle with pawkins he was well versed in psychology he knew that such visual illusions do come as a result of mental strain but the point was he did not only see the moth he had heard it when it touched the edge of the lampshade and afterwards when it hit against the wall and he had felt it strike his face in the dark  he looked at it it was not at all dreamlike but perfectly clear and solidlooking in the candlelight he saw the hairy body and the short feathery antennae the jointed legs even a place where the down was rubbed from the wing he suddenly felt angry with himself for being afraid of a little insect  his landlady had got the servant to sleep with her that night because she was afraid to be alone in addition she had locked the door and put the chest of drawers against it they listened and talked in whispers after they had gone to bed but nothing occurred to alarm them about eleven they had ventured to put the candle out and had both dozed off to sleep they woke up with a start and sat up in bed listening in the darkness  then they heard slippered feet going to and fro in hapleys room a chair was overturned and there was a violent dab at the wall then a china mantel ornament smashed upon the fender suddenly the door of the room opened and they heard him upon the landing they clung to one another listening he seemed to be dancing upon the staircase now he would go down three or four steps quickly then up again then hurry down into the hall they heard the umbrella stand go over and the fanlight break then the bolt shot and the chain rattled he was opening the door  they hurried to the window it was a dim grey night an almost unbroken sheet of watery cloud was sweeping across the moon and the hedge and trees in front of the house were black against the pale roadway they saw hapley looking like a ghost in his shirt and white trousers running to and fro in the road and beating the air now he would stop now he would dart very rapidly at something invisible now he would move upon it with stealthy strides at last he went out of sight up the road towards the down then while they argued who should go down and lock the door he returned he was walking very fast and he came straight into the house closed the door carefully and went quietly up to his bedroom then everything was silent  mrs colville said hapley calling down the staircase next morning i hope i did not alarm you last night  you may well ask that said mrs colville  the fact is i am a sleepwalker and the last two nights i have been without my sleeping mixture there is nothing to be alarmed about really i am sorry i made such an ass of myself i will go over the down to shoreham and get some stuff to make me sleep soundly i ought to have done that yesterday  but halfway over the down by the chalk pits the moth came upon hapley again he went on trying to keep his mind upon chess problems but it was no good the thing fluttered into his face and he struck at it with his hat in selfdefence then rage the old ragethe rage he had so often felt against pawkinscame upon him again he went on leaping and striking at the eddying insect suddenly he trod on nothing and fell headlong  there was a gap in his sensations and hapley found himself sitting on the heap of flints in front of the opening of the chalkpits with a leg twisted back under him the strange moth was still fluttering round his head he struck at it with his hand and turning his head saw two men approaching him one was the village doctor it occurred to hapley that this was lucky then it came into his mind with extraordinary vividness that no one would ever be able to see the strange moth except himself and that it behoved him to keep silent about it  late that night however after his broken leg was set he was feverish and forgot his selfrestraint he was lying flat on his bed and he began to run his eyes round the room to see if the moth was still about he tried not to do this but it was no good he soon caught sight of the thing resting close to his hand by the nightlight on the green tablecloth the wings quivered with a sudden wave of anger he smote at it with his fist and the nurse woke up with a shriek he had missed it  that moth he said and then it was fancy nothing  all the time he could see quite clearly the insect going round the cornice and darting across the room and he could also see that the nurse saw nothing of it and looked at him strangely he must keep himself in hand he knew he was a lost man if he did not keep himself in hand but as the night waned the fever grew upon him and the very dread he had of seeing the moth made him see it about five just as the dawn was grey he tried to get out of bed and catch it though his leg was afire with pain the nurse had to struggle with him  on account of this they tied him down to the bed at this the moth grew bolder and once he felt it settle in his hair then because he struck out violently with his arms they tied these also at this the moth came and crawled over his face and hapley wept swore screamed prayed for them to take it off him unavailingly  the doctor was a blockhead a justqualified general practitioner and quite ignorant of mental science he simply said there was no moth had he possessed the wit he might still perhaps have saved hapley from his fate by entering into his delusion and covering his face with gauze as he prayed might be done but as i say the doctor was a blockhead and until the leg was healed hapley was kept tied to his bed and with the imaginary moth crawling over him it never left him while he was awake and it grew to a monster in his dreams while he was awake he longed for sleep and from sleep he awoke screaming  so now hapley is spending the remainder of his days in a padded room worried by a moth that no one else can see the asylum doctor calls it hallucination but hapley when he is in his easier mood and can talk says it is the ghost of pawkins and consequently a unique specimen and well worth the trouble of catching       x    the treasure in the forest   the canoe was now approaching the land the bay opened out and a gap in the white surf of the reef marked where the little river ran out to the sea the thicker and deeper green of the virgin forest showed its course down the distant hill slope the forest here came close to the beach far beyond dim and almost cloudlike in texture rose the mountains like suddenly frozen waves the sea was still save for an almost imperceptible swell the sky blazed  the man with the carved paddle stopped it should be somewhere here he said he shipped the paddle and held his arms out straight before him  the other man had been in the fore part of the canoe closely scrutinising the land he had a sheet of yellow paper on his knee  come and look at this evans he said  both men spoke in low tones and their lips were hard and dry  the man called evans came swaying along the canoe until he could look over his companions shoulder  the paper had the appearance of a rough map by much folding it was creased and worn to the pitch of separation and the second man held the discoloured fragments together where they had parted on it one could dimly make out in almost obliterated pencil the outline of the bay  here said evans is the reef and here is the gap he ran his thumbnail over the chart  this curved and twisting line is the riveri could do with a drink nowand this star is the place  you see this dotted line said the man with the map it is a straight line and runs from the opening of the reef to a clump of palmtrees the star comes just where it cuts the river we must mark the place as we go into the lagoon  its queer said evans after a pause what these little marks down here are for it looks like the plan of a house or something but what all these little dashes pointing this way and that may mean i cant get a notion and whats the writing  chinese said the man with the map  of course he was a chinee said evans  they all were said the man with the map  they both sat for some minutes staring at the land while the canoe drifted slowly then evans looked towards the paddle  your turn with the paddle now hooker said he  and his companion quietly folded up his map put it in his pocket passed evans carefully and began to paddle his movements were languid like those of a man whose strength was nearly exhausted  evans sat with his eyes half closed watching the frothy breakwater of the coral creep nearer and nearer the sky was like a furnace for the sun was near the zenith though they were so near the treasure he did not feel the exaltation he had anticipated the intense excitement of the struggle for the plan and the long night voyage from the mainland in the unprovisioned canoe had to use his own expression taken it out of him he tried to arouse himself by directing his mind to the ingots the chinamen had spoken of but it would not rest there it came back headlong to the thought of sweet water rippling in the river and to the almost unendurable dryness of his lips and throat the rhythmic wash of the sea upon the reef was becoming audible now and it had a pleasant sound in his ears the water washed along the side of the canoe and the paddle dripped between each stroke presently he began to doze  he was still dimly conscious of the island but a queer dream texture interwove with his sensations once again it was the night when he and hooker had hit upon the chinamens secret he saw the moonlit trees the little fire burning and the black figures of the three chinamensilvered on one side by moonlight and on the other glowing from the firelightand heard them talking together in pigeonenglishfor they came from different provinces hooker had caught the drift of their talk first and had motioned to him to listen fragments of the conversation were inaudible and fragments incomprehensible a spanish galleon from the philippines hopelessly aground and its treasure buried against the day of return lay in the background of the story a shipwrecked crew thinned by disease a quarrel or so and the needs of discipline and at last taking to their boats never to be heard of again then changhi only a year since wandering ashore had happened upon the ingots hidden for two hundred years had deserted his junk and reburied them with infinite toil singlehanded but very safe he laid great stress on the safetyit was a secret of his now he wanted help to return and exhume them presently the little map fluttered and the voices sank a fine story for two stranded british wastrels to hear evans dream shifted to the moment when he had changhis pigtail in his hand the life of a chinaman is scarcely sacred like a europeans the cunning little face of changhi first keen and furious like a startled snake and then fearful treacherous and pitiful became overwhelmingly prominent in the dream at the end changhi had grinned a most incomprehensible and startling grin abruptly things became very unpleasant as they will do at times in dreams changhi gibbered and threatened him he saw in his dream heaps and heaps of gold and changhi intervening and struggling to hold him back from it he took changhi by the pigtailhow big the yellow brute was and how he struggled and grinned he kept growing bigger too then the bright heaps of gold turned to a roaring furnace and a vast devil surprisingly like changhi but with a huge black tail began to feed him with coals they burnt his mouth horribly another devil was shouting his name evans evans you sleepy foolor was it hooker  he woke up they were in the mouth of the lagoon  there are the three palmtrees it must be in a line with that clump of bushes said his companion mark that if we go to those bushes and then strike into the bush in a straight line from here we shall come to it when we come to the stream  they could see now where the mouth of the stream opened out at the sight of it evans revived hurry up man he said or by heaven i shall have to drink sea water he gnawed his hand and stared at the gleam of silver among the rocks and green tangle  presently he turned almost fiercely upon hooker give me the paddle he said  so they reached the river mouth a little way up hooker took some water in the hollow of his hand tasted it and spat it out a little further he tried again this will do he said and they began drinking eagerly  curse this said evans suddenly its too slow and leaning dangerously over the fore part of the canoe he began to suck up the water with his lips  presently they made an end of drinking and running the canoe into a little creek were about to land among the thick growth that overhung the water  we shall have to scramble through this to the beach to find our bushes and get the line to the place said evans  we had better paddle round said hooker  so they pushed out again into the river and paddled back down it to the sea and along the shore to the place where the clump of bushes grew here they landed pulled the light canoe far up the beach and then went up towards the edge of the jungle until they could see the opening of the reef and the bushes in a straight line evans had taken a native implement out of the canoe it was lshaped and the transverse piece was armed with polished stone hooker carried the paddle it is straight now in this direction said he we must push through this till we strike the stream then we must prospect  they pushed through a close tangle of reeds broad fronds and young trees and at first it was toilsome going but very speedily the trees became larger and the ground beneath them opened out the blaze of the sunlight was replaced by insensible degrees by cool shadow the trees became at last vast pillars that rose up to a canopy of greenery far overhead dim white flowers hung from their stems and ropy creepers swung from tree to tree the shadow deepened on the ground blotched fungi and a redbrown incrustation became frequent  evans shivered it seems almost cold here after the blaze outside  i hope we are keeping to the straight said hooker  presently they saw far ahead a gap in the sombre darkness where white shafts of hot sunlight smote into the forest there also was brilliant green undergrowth and coloured flowers then they heard the rush of water  here is the river we should be close to it now said hooker  the vegetation was thick by the river bank great plants as yet unnamed grew among the roots of the big trees and spread rosettes of huge green fans towards the strip of sky many flowers and a creeper with shiny foliage clung to the exposed stems on the water of the broad quiet pool which the treasureseekers now overlooked there floated big oval leaves and a waxen pinkishwhite flower not unlike a waterlily further as the river bent away from them the water suddenly frothed and became noisy in a rapid  well said evans  we have swerved a little from the straight said hooker that was to be expected  he turned and looked into the dim cool shadows of the silent forest behind them if we beat a little way up and down the stream we should come to something  you said began evans  he said there was a heap of stones said hooker  the two men looked at each other for a moment  let us try a little downstream first said evans  they advanced slowly looking curiously about them suddenly evans stopped what the devils that he said  hooker followed his finger something blue he said it had come into view as they topped a gentle swell of the ground then he began to distinguish what it was  he advanced suddenly with hasty steps until the body that belonged to the limp hand and arm had become visible his grip tightened on the implement he carried the thing was the figure of a chinaman lying on his face the abandon of the pose was unmistakable  the two men drew closer together and stood staring silently at this ominous dead body it lay in a clear space among the trees near by was a spade after the chinese pattern and further off lay a scattered heap of stones close to a freshly dug hole  somebody has been here before said hooker clearing his throat  then suddenly evans began to swear and rave and stamp upon the ground  hooker turned white but said nothing he advanced towards the prostrate body he saw the neck was puffed and purple and the hands and ankles swollen pah he said and suddenly turned away and went towards the excavation he gave a cry of surprise he shouted to evans who was following him slowly  you fool its all right its here still then he turned again and looked at the dead chinaman and then again at the hole  evans hurried to the hole already half exposed by the illfated wretch beside them lay a number of dull yellow bars he bent down in the hole and clearing off the soil with his bare hands hastily pulled one of the heavy masses out as he did so a little thorn pricked his hand he pulled the delicate spike out with his fingers and lifted the ingot  only gold or lead could weigh like this he said exultantly  hooker was still looking at the dead chinaman he was puzzled  he stole a march on his friends he said at last he came here alone and some poisonous snake has killed him i wonder how he found the place  evans stood with the ingot in his hands what did a dead chinaman signify we shall have to take this stuff to the mainland piecemeal and bury it there for a while how shall we get it to the canoe  he took his jacket off and spread it on the ground and flung two or three ingots into it presently he found that another little thorn had punctured his skin  this is as much as we can carry said he then suddenly with a queer rush of irritation what are you staring at  hooker turned to him i cant stand him  he nodded towards the corpse its so like  rubbish said evans all chinamen are alike  hooker looked into his face im going to bury that anyhow before i lend a hand with this stuff  dont be a fool hooker said evans let that mass of corruption bide  hooker hesitated and then his eye went carefully over the brown soil about them it scares me somehow he said  the thing is said evans what to do with these ingots shall we rebury them over here or take them across the strait in the canoe  hooker thought his puzzled gaze wandered among the tall treetrunks and up into the remote sunlit greenery overhead he shivered again as his eye rested upon the blue figure of the chinaman he stared searchingly among the grey depths between the trees  whats come to you hooker said evans have you lost your wits  lets get the gold out of this place anyhow said hooker  he took the ends of the collar of the coat in his hands and evans took the opposite corners and they lifted the mass which way said evans to the canoe  its queer said evans when they had advanced only a few steps but my arms ache still with that paddling  curse it he said but they ache i must rest  they let the coat down evans face was white and little drops of sweat stood out upon his forehead its stuffy somehow in this forest  then with an abrupt transition to unreasonable anger what is the good of waiting here all the day lend a hand i say you have done nothing but moon since we saw the dead chinaman  hooker was looking steadfastly at his companions face he helped raise the coat bearing the ingots and they went forward perhaps a hundred yards in silence evans began to breathe heavily cant you speak he said  whats the matter with you said hooker  evans stumbled and then with a sudden curse flung the coat from him he stood for a moment staring at hooker and then with a groan clutched at his own throat  dont come near me he said and went and leant against a tree then in a steadier voice ill be better in a minute  presently his grip upon the trunk loosened and he slipped slowly down the stem of the tree until he was a crumpled heap at its foot his hands were clenched convulsively his face became distorted with pain hooker approached him  dont touch me dont touch me said evans in a stifled voice put the gold back on the coat  cant i do anything for you said hooker  put the gold back on the coat  as hooker handled the ingots he felt a little prick on the ball of his thumb he looked at his hand and saw a slender thorn perhaps two inches in length  evans gave an inarticulate cry and rolled over  hookers jaw dropped he stared at the thorn for a moment with dilated eyes then he looked at evans who was now crumpled together on the ground his back bending and straightening spasmodically then he looked through the pillars of the trees and network of creeper stems to where in the dim grey shadow the blueclad body of the chinaman was still indistinctly visible he thought of the little dashes in the corner of the plan and in a moment he understood  god help me he said for the thorns were similar to those the dyaks poison and use in their blowingtubes he understood now what changhis assurance of the safety of his treasure meant he understood that grin now  evans he cried  but evans was silent and motionless save for a horrible spasmodic twitching of his limbs a profound silence brooded over the forest  then hooker began to suck furiously at the little pink spot on the ball of his thumbsucking for dear life presently he felt a strange aching pain in his arms and shoulders and his fingers seemed difficult to bend then he knew that sucking was no good  abruptly he stopped and sitting down by the pile of ingots and resting his chin upon his hands and his elbows upon his knees stared at the distorted but still quivering body of his companion changhis grin came into his mind again the dull pain spread towards his throat and grew slowly in intensity far above him a faint breeze stirred the greenery and the white petals of some unknown flower came floating down through the gloom       xi    the story of the late mr elvesham   i set this story down not expecting it will be believed but if possible to prepare a way of escape for the next victim he perhaps may profit by my misfortune my own case i know is hopeless and i am now in some measure prepared to meet my fate  my name is edward george eden i was born at trentham in staffordshire my father being employed in the gardens there i lost my mother when i was three years old and my father when i was five my uncle george eden then adopting me as his own son he was a single man selfeducated and wellknown in birmingham as an enterprising journalist he educated me generously fired my ambition to succeed in the world and at his death which happened four years ago left me his entire fortune a matter of about five hundred pounds after all outgoing charges were paid i was then eighteen he advised me in his will to expend the money in completing my education i had already chosen the profession of medicine and through his posthumous generosity and my good fortune in a scholarship competition i became a medical student at university college london at the time of the beginning of my story i lodged at 11a university street in a little upper room very shabbily furnished and draughty overlooking the back of shoolbreds premises i used this little room both to live in and sleep in because i was anxious to eke out my means to the very last shillingsworth  i was taking a pair of shoes to be mended at a shop in the tottenham court road when i first encountered the little old man with the yellow face with whom my life has now become so inextricably entangled he was standing on the kerb and staring at the number on the door in a doubtful way as i opened it his eyesthey were dull grey eyes and reddish under the rimsfell to my face and his countenance immediately assumed an expression of corrugated amiability  you come he said apt to the moment i had forgotten the number of your house how do you do mr eden  i was a little astonished at his familiar address for i had never set eyes on the man before i was a little annoyed too at his catching me with my boots under my arm he noticed my lack of cordiality  wonder who the deuce i am eh a friend let me assure you i have seen you before though you havent seen me is there anywhere where i can talk to you  i hesitated the shabbiness of my room upstairs was not a matter for every stranger perhaps said i we might walk down the street im unfortunately prevented my gesture explained the sentence before i had spoken it  the very thing he said and faced this way and then that the street which way shall we go i slipped my boots down in the passage look here he said abruptly this business of mine is a rigmarole come and lunch with me mr eden im an old man a very old man and not good at explanations and what with my piping voice and the clatter of the traffic  he laid a persuasive skinny hand that trembled a little upon my arm  i was not so old that an old man might not treat me to a lunch yet at the same time i was not altogether pleased by this abrupt invitation i had rather i began but i had rather he said catching me up and a certain civility is surely due to my grey hairs  and so i consented and went with him  he took me to blavitiskis i had to walk slowly to accommodate myself to his paces and over such a lunch as i had never tasted before he fended off my leading question and i took a better note of his appearance his cleanshaven face was lean and wrinkled his shrivelled lips fell over a set of false teeth and his white hair was thin and rather long he seemed small to methough indeed most people seemed small to meand his shoulders were rounded and bent and watching him i could not help but observe that he too was taking note of me running his eyes with a curious touch of greed in them over me from my broad shoulders to my suntanned hands and up to my freckled face again and now said he as we lit our cigarettes i must tell you of the business in hand  i must tell you then that i am an old man a very old man he paused momentarily and it happens that i have money that i must presently be leaving and never a child have i to leave it to i thought of the confidence trick and resolved i would be on the alert for the vestiges of my five hundred pounds he proceeded to enlarge on his loneliness and the trouble he had to find a proper disposition of his money i have weighed this plan and that plan charities institutions and scholarships and libraries and i have come to this conclusion at lasthe fixed his eyes on my facethat i will find some young fellow ambitious pureminded and poor healthy in body and healthy in mind and in short make him my heir give him all that i have he repeated give him all that i have so that he will suddenly be lifted out of all the trouble and struggle in which his sympathies have been educated to freedom and influence  i tried to seem disinterested with a transparent hypocrisy i said and you want my help my professional services maybe to find that person  he smiled and looked at me over his cigarette and i laughed at his quiet exposure of my modest pretence  what a career such a man might have he said it fills me with envy to think how i have accumulated that another man may spend  but there are conditions of course burdens to be imposed he must for instance take my name you cannot expect everything without some return and i must go into all the circumstances of his life before i can accept him he must be sound i must know his heredity how his parents and grandparents died have the strictest inquiries made into his private morals  this modified my secret congratulations a little  and do i understand said i that i  yes he said almost fiercely you you  i answered never a word my imagination was dancing wildly my innate scepticism was useless to modify its transports there was not a particle of gratitude in my mindi did not know what to say nor how to say it but why me in particular i said at last  he had chanced to hear of me from professor haslar he said as a typically sound and sane young man and he wished as far as possible to leave his money where health and integrity were assured  that was my first meeting with the little old man he was mysterious about himself he would not give his name yet he said and after i had answered some questions of his he left me at the blavitiski portal i noticed that he drew a handful of gold coins from his pocket when it came to paying for the lunch his insistence upon bodily health was curious in accordance with an arrangement we had made i applied that day for a life policy in the loyal insurance company for a large sum and i was exhaustively overhauled by the medical advisers of that company in the subsequent week even that did not satisfy him and he insisted i must be reexamined by the great doctor henderson  it was friday in whitsun week before he came to a decision he called me down quite late in the eveningnearly nine it wasfrom cramming chemical equations for my preliminary scientific examination he was standing in the passage under the feeble gaslamp and his face was a grotesque interplay of shadows he seemed more bowed than when i had first seen him and his cheeks had sunk in a little  his voice shook with emotion everything is satisfactory mr eden he said everything is quite quite satisfactory and this night of all nights you must dine with me and celebrate youraccession he was interrupted by a cough you wont have long to wait either he said wiping his handkerchief across his lips and gripping my hand with his long bony claw that was disengaged certainly not very long to wait  we went into the street and called a cab i remember every incident of that drive vividly the swift easy motion the vivid contrast of gas and oil and electric light the crowds of people in the streets the place in regent street to which we went and the sumptuous dinner we were served with there i was disconcerted at first by the welldressed waiters glances at my rough clothes bothered by the stones of the olives but as the champagne warmed my blood my confidence revived at first the old man talked of himself he had already told me his name in the cab he was egbert elvesham the great philosopher whose name i had known since i was a lad at school it seemed incredible to me that this man whose intelligence had so early dominated mine this great abstraction should suddenly realise itself as this decrepit familiar figure i daresay every young fellow who has suddenly fallen among celebrities has felt something of my disappointment he told me now of the future that the feeble streams of his life would presently leave dry for me houses copyrights investments i had never suspected that philosophers were so rich he watched me drink and eat with a touch of envy what a capacity for living you have he said and then with a sigh a sigh of relief i could have thought it it will not be long  ay said i my head swimming now with champagne i have a future perhapsof a passing agreeable sort thanks to you i shall now have the honour of your name but you have a past such a past as is worth all my future  he shook his head and smiled as i thought with half sad appreciation of my flattering admiration that future he said would you in truth change it the waiter came with liqueurs you will not perhaps mind taking my name taking my position but would you indeedwillinglytake my years  with your achievements said i gallantly  he smiled again kummelboth he said to the waiter and turned his attention to a little paper packet he had taken from his pocket this hour said he this afterdinner hour is the hour of small things here is a scrap of my unpublished wisdom he opened the packet with his shaking yellow fingers and showed a little pinkish powder on the paper this said hewell you must guess what it is but kummelput but a dash of this powder in itis himmel  his large greyish eyes watched mine with an inscrutable expression  it was a bit of a shock to me to find this great teacher gave his mind to the flavour of liqueurs however i feigned an interest in his weakness for i was drunk enough for such small sycophancy  he parted the powder between the little glasses and rising suddenly with a strange unexpected dignity held out his hand towards me i imitated his action and the glasses rang to a quick succession said he and raised his glass towards his lips  not that i said hastily not that  he paused with the liqueur at the level of his chin and his eyes blazing into mine  to a long life said i  he hesitated to a long life said he with a sudden bark of laughter and with eyes fixed on one another we tilted the little glasses his eyes looked straight into mine and as i drained the stuff off i felt a curiously intense sensation the first touch of it set my brain in a furious tumult i seemed to feel an actual physical stirring in my skull and a seething humming filled my ears i did not notice the flavour in my mouth the aroma that filled my throat i saw only the grey intensity of his gaze that burnt into mine the draught the mental confusion the noise and stirring in my head seemed to last an interminable time curious vague impressions of halfforgotten things danced and vanished on the edge of my consciousness at last he broke the spell with a sudden explosive sigh he put down his glass  well he said  its glorious said i though i had not tasted the stuff  my head was spinning i sat down my brain was chaos then my perception grew clear and minute as though i saw things in a concave mirror his manner seemed to have changed into something nervous and hasty he pulled out his watch and grimaced at it elevenseven and tonight i must seventwentyfive waterloo i must go at once he called for the bill and struggled with his coat officious waiters came to our assistance in another moment i was wishing him goodbye over the apron of a cab and still with an absurd feeling of minute distinctness as thoughhow can i express iti not only saw but felt through an inverted operaglass  that stuff he said he put his hand to his forehead i ought not to have given it to you it will make your head split tomorrow wait a minute here he handed me out a little flat thing like a seidlitzpowder take that in water as you are going to bed the other thing was a drug not till youre ready to go to bed mind it will clear your head thats all one more shakefuturus  i gripped his shrivelled claw goodbye he said and by the droop of his eyelids i judged he too was a little under the influence of that braintwisting cordial  he recollected something else with a start felt in his breastpocket and produced another packet this time a cylinder the size and shape of a shavingstick here said he id almost forgotten dont open this until i come tomorrowbut take it now  it was so heavy that i wellnigh dropped it all ri said i and he grinned at me through the cab window as the cabman flicked his horse into wakefulness it was a white packet he had given me with red seals at either end and along its edge if this isnt money said i its platinum or lead  i stuck it with elaborate care into my pocket and with a whirling brain walked home through the regent street loiterers and the dark back streets beyond portland road i remember the sensations of that walk very vividly strange as they were i was still so far myself that i could notice my strange mental state and wonder whether this stuff i had had was opiuma drug beyond my experience it is hard now to describe the peculiarity of my mental strangenessmental doubling vaguely expresses it as i was walking up regent street i found in my mind a queer persuasion that it was waterloo station and had an odd impulse to get into the polytechnic as a man might get into a train i put a knuckle in my eye and it was regent street how can i express it you see a skilful actor looking quietly at you he pulls a grimace and loanother person is it too extravagant if i tell you that it seemed to me as if regent street had for the moment done that then being persuaded it was regent street again i was oddly muddled about some fantastic reminiscences that cropped up thirty years ago thought i it was here that i quarrelled with my brother then i burst out laughing to the astonishment and encouragement of a group of night prowlers thirty years ago i did not exist and never in my life had i boasted a brother the stuff was surely liquid folly for the poignant regret for that lost brother still clung to me along portland road the madness took another turn i began to recall vanished shops and to compare the street with what it used to be confused troubled thinking is comprehensible enough after the drink i had taken but what puzzled me were these curiously vivid phantasm memories that had crept into my mind and not only the memories that had crept in but also the memories that had slipped out i stopped opposite stevens the natural history dealers and cudgelled my brains to think what he had to do with me a bus went by and sounded exactly like the rumbling of a train i seemed to be dipping into some dark remote pit for the recollection of course said i at last he has promised me three frogs tomorrow odd i should have forgotten  do they still show children dissolving views in those i remember one view would begin like a faint ghost and grow and oust another in just that way it seemed to me that a ghostly set of new sensations was struggling with those of my ordinary self  i went on through euston road to tottenham court road puzzled and a little frightened and scarcely noticed the unusual way i was taking for commonly i used to cut through the intervening network of back streets i turned into university street to discover that i had forgotten my number only by a strong effort did i recall 11a and even then it seemed to me that it was a thing some forgotten person had told me i tried to steady my mind by recalling the incidents of the dinner and for the life of me i could conjure up no picture of my hosts face i saw him only as a shadowy outline as one might see oneself reflected in a window through which one was looking in his place however i had a curious exterior vision of myself sitting at a table flushed brighteyed and talkative  i must take this other powder said i this is getting impossible  i tried the wrong side of the hall for my candle and the matches and had a doubt of which landing my room might be on im drunk i said thats certain and blundered needlessly on the staircase to sustain the proposition  at the first glance my room seemed unfamiliar what rot i said and stared about me i seemed to bring myself back by the effort and the odd phantasmal quality passed into the concrete familiar there was the old glass still with my notes on the albumens stuck in the corner of the frame my old everyday suit of clothes pitched about the floor and yet it was not so real after all i felt an idiotic persuasion trying to creep into my mind as it were that i was in a railway carriage in a train just stopping that i was peering out of the window at some unknown station i gripped the bedrail firmly to reassure myself its clairvoyance perhaps i said i must write to the psychical research society  i put the rouleau on my dressingtable sat on my bed and began to take off my boots it was as if the picture of my present sensations was painted over some other picture that was trying to show through curse it said i my wits are going or am i in two places at once halfundressed i tossed the powder into a glass and drank it off it effervesced and became a fluorescent amber colour before i was in bed my mind was already tranquillised i felt the pillow at my cheek and thereupon i must have fallen asleep                                       i awoke abruptly out of a dream of strange beasts and found myself lying on my back probably every one knows that dismal emotional dream from which one escapes awake indeed but strangely cowed there was a curious taste in my mouth a tired feeling in my limbs a sense of cutaneous discomfort i lay with my head motionless on my pillow expecting that my feeling of strangeness and terror would pass away and that i should then doze off again to sleep but instead of that my uncanny sensations increased at first i could perceive nothing wrong about me there was a faint light in the room so faint that it was the very next thing to darkness and the furniture stood out in it as vague blots of absolute darkness i stared with my eyes just over the bedclothes  it came into my mind that some one had entered the room to rob me of my rouleau of money but after lying for some moments breathing regularly to simulate sleep i realised this was mere fancy nevertheless the uneasy assurance of something wrong kept fast hold of me with an effort i raised my head from the pillow and peered about me at the dark what it was i could not conceive i looked at the dim shapes around me the greater and lesser darknesses that indicated curtains table fireplace bookshelves and so forth then i began to perceive something unfamiliar in the forms of the darkness had the bed turned round yonder should be the bookshelves and something shrouded and pallid rose there something that would not answer to the bookshelves however i looked at it it was far too big to be my shirt thrown on a chair  overcoming a childish terror i threw back the bedclothes and thrust my leg out of bed instead of coming out of my trucklebed upon the floor i found my foot scarcely reached the edge of the mattress i made another step as it were and sat up on the edge of the bed by the side of my bed should be the candle and the matches upon the broken chair i put out my hand and touchednothing i waved my hand in the darkness and it came against some heavy hanging soft and thick in texture which gave a rustling noise at my touch i grasped this and pulled it it appeared to be a curtain suspended over the head of my bed  i was now thoroughly awake and beginning to realise that i was in a strange room i was puzzled i tried to recall the overnight circumstances and i found them now curiously enough vivid in my memory the supper my reception of the little packages my wonder whether i was intoxicated my slow undressing the coolness to my flushed face of my pillow i felt a sudden distrust was that last night or the night before at any rate this room was strange to me and i could not imagine how i had got into it the dim pallid outline was growing paler and i perceived it was a window with the dark shape of an oval toiletglass against the weak intimation of the dawn that filtered through the blind i stood up and was surprised by a curious feeling of weakness and unsteadiness with trembling hands outstretched i walked slowly towards the window getting nevertheless a bruise on the knee from a chair by the way i fumbled round the glass which was large with handsome brass sconces to find the blind cord i could not find any by chance i took hold of the tassel and with the click of a spring the blind ran up  i found myself looking out upon a scene that was altogether strange to me the night was overcast and through the flocculent grey of the heaped clouds there filtered a faint halflight of dawn just at the edge of the sky the cloudcanopy had a bloodred rim below everything was dark and indistinct dim hills in the distance a vague mass of buildings running up into pinnacles trees like spilt ink and below the window a tracery of black bushes and pale grey paths it was so unfamiliar that for the moment i thought myself still dreaming i felt the toilettable it appeared to be made of some polished wood and was rather elaborately furnishedthere were little cutglass bottles and a brush upon it there was also a queer little object horseshoe shape it felt with smooth hard projections lying in a saucer i could find no matches nor candlestick  i turned my eyes to the room again now the blind was up faint spectres of its furnishing came out of the darkness there was a huge curtained bed and the fireplace at its foot had a large white mantel with something of the shimmer of marble  i leant against the toilettable shut my eyes and opened them again and tried to think the whole thing was far too real for dreaming i was inclined to imagine there was still some hiatus in my memory as a consequence of my draught of that strange liqueur that i had come into my inheritance perhaps and suddenly lost my recollection of everything since my good fortune had been announced perhaps if i waited a little things would be clearer to me again yet my dinner with old elvesham was now singularly vivid and recent the champagne the observant waiters the powder and the liqueursi could have staked my soul it all happened a few hours ago  and then occurred a thing so trivial and yet so terrible to me that i shiver now to think of that moment i spoke aloud i said how the devil did i get here  and the voice was not my own  it was not my own it was thin the articulation was slurred the resonance of my facial bones was different then to reassure myself i ran one hand over the other and felt loose folds of skin the bony laxity of age surely i said in that horrible voice that had somehow established itself in my throat surely this thing is a dream almost as quickly as if i did it involuntarily i thrust my fingers into my mouth my teeth had gone my fingertips ran on the flaccid surface of an even row of shrivelled gums i was sick with dismay and disgust  i felt then a passionate desire to see myself to realise at once in its full horror the ghastly change that had come upon me i tottered to the mantel and felt along it for matches as i did so a barking cough sprang up in my throat and i clutched the thick flannel nightdress i found about me there were no matches there and i suddenly realised that my extremities were cold sniffing and coughing whimpering a little perhaps i fumbled back to bed it is surely a dream i whispered to myself as i clambered back surely a dream it was a senile repetition i pulled the bedclothes over my shoulders over my ears i thrust my withered hand under the pillow and determined to compose myself to sleep of course it was a dream in the morning the dream would be over and i should wake up strong and vigorous again to my youth and studies i shut my eyes breathed regularly and finding myself wakeful began to count slowly through the powers of three  but the thing i desired would not come i could not get to sleep and the persuasion of the inexorable reality of the change that had happened to me grew steadily presently i found myself with my eyes wide open the powers of three forgotten and my skinny fingers upon my shrivelled gums i was indeed suddenly and abruptly an old man i had in some unaccountable manner fallen through my life and come to old age in some way i had been cheated of all the best of my life of love of struggle of strength and hope i grovelled into the pillow and tried to persuade myself that such hallucination was possible imperceptibly steadily the dawn grew clearer  at last despairing of further sleep i sat up in bed and looked about me a chill twilight rendered the whole chamber visible it was spacious and wellfurnished better furnished than any room i had ever slept in before a candle and matches became dimly visible upon a little pedestal in a recess i threw back the bedclothes and shivering with the rawness of the early morning albeit it was summertime i got out and lit the candle then trembling horribly so that the extinguisher rattled on its spike i tottered to the glass and sawelveshams face it was none the less horrible because i had already dimly feared as much he had already seemed physically weak and pitiful to me but seen now dressed only in a coarse flannel nightdress that fell apart and showed the stringy neck seen now as my own body i cannot describe its desolate decrepitude the hollow cheeks the straggling tail of dirty grey hair the rheumy bleared eyes the quivering shrivelled lips the lower displaying a gleam of the pink interior lining and those horrible dark gums showing you who are mind and body together at your natural years cannot imagine what this fiendish imprisonment meant to me to be young and full of the desire and energy of youth and to be caught and presently to be crushed in this tottering ruin of a body  but i wander from the course of my story for some time i must have been stunned at this change that had come upon me it was daylight when i did so far gather myself together as to think in some inexplicable way i had been changed though how short of magic the thing had been done i could not say and as i thought the diabolical ingenuity of elvesham came home to me it seemed plain to me that as i found myself in his so he must be in possession of my body of my strength that is and my future but how to prove it then as i thought the thing became so incredible even to me that my mind reeled and i had to pinch myself to feel my toothless gums to see myself in the glass and touch the things about me before i could steady myself to face the facts again was all life hallucination was i indeed elvesham and he me had i been dreaming of eden overnight was there any eden but if i was elvesham i should remember where i was on the previous morning the name of the town in which i lived what happened before the dream began i struggled with my thoughts i recalled the queer doubleness of my memories overnight but now my mind was clear not the ghost of any memories but those proper to eden could i raise  this way lies insanity i cried in my piping voice i staggered to my feet dragged my feeble heavy limbs to the washhandstand and plunged my grey head into a basin of cold water then towelling myself i tried again it was no good i felt beyond all question that i was indeed eden not elvesham but eden in elveshams body  had i been a man of any other age i might have given myself up to my fate as one enchanted but in these sceptical days miracles do not pass current here was some trick of psychology what a drug and a steady stare could do a drug and a steady stare or some similar treatment could surely undo men have lost their memories before but to exchange memories as one does umbrellas i laughed alas not a healthy laugh but a wheezing senile titter i could have fancied old elvesham laughing at my plight and a gust of petulant anger unusual to me swept across my feelings i began dressing eagerly in the clothes i found lying about on the floor and only realised when i was dressed that it was an evening suit i had assumed i opened the wardrobe and found some more ordinary clothes a pair of plaid trousers and an oldfashioned dressinggown i put a venerable smokingcap on my venerable head and coughing a little from my exertions tottered out upon the landing  it was then perhaps a quarter to six and the blinds were closely drawn and the house quite silent the landing was a spacious one a broad richlycarpeted staircase went down into the darkness of the hall below and before me a door ajar showed me a writingdesk a revolving bookcase the back of a study chair and a fine array of bound books shelf upon shelf  my study i mumbled and walked across the landing then at the sound of my voice a thought struck me and i went back to the bedroom and put in the set of false teeth they slipped in with the ease of old habit thats better said i gnashing them and so returned to the study  the drawers of the writingdesk were locked its revolving top was also locked i could see no indications of the keys and there were none in the pockets of my trousers i shuffled back at once to the bedroom and went through the dress suit and afterwards the pockets of all the garments i could find i was very eager and one might have imagined that burglars had been at work to see my room when i had done not only were there no keys to be found but not a coin nor a scrap of papersave only the receipted bill of the overnight dinner  a curious weariness asserted itself i sat down and stared at the garments flung here and there their pockets turned inside out my first frenzy had already flickered out every moment i was beginning to realise the immense intelligence of the plans of my enemy to see more and more clearly the hopelessness of my position with an effort i rose and hurried hobbling into the study again on the staircase was a housemaid pulling up the blinds she stared i think at the expression of my face i shut the door of the study behind me and seizing a poker began an attack upon the desk that is how they found me the cover of the desk was split the lock smashed the letters torn out of the pigeonholes and tossed about the room in my senile rage i had flung about the pens and other such light stationery and overturned the ink moreover a large vase upon the mantel had got brokeni do not know how i could find no chequebook no money no indications of the slightest use for the recovery of my body i was battering madly at the drawers when the butler backed by two womenservants intruded upon me                                       that simply is the story of my change no one will believe my frantic assertions i am treated as one demented and even at this moment i am under restraint but i am sane absolutely sane and to prove it i have sat down to write this story minutely as the things happened to me i appeal to the reader whether there is any trace of insanity in the style or method of the story he has been reading i am a young man locked away in an old mans body but the clear fact is incredible to everyone naturally i appear demented to those who will not believe this naturally i do not know the names of my secretaries of the doctors who come to see me of my servants and neighbours of this town wherever it is where i find myself naturally i lose myself in my own house and suffer inconveniences of every sort naturally i ask the oddest questions naturally i weep and cry out and have paroxysms of despair i have no money and no chequebook the bank will not recognise my signature for i suppose that allowing for the feeble muscles i now have my handwriting is still edens these people about me will not let me go to the bank personally it seems indeed that there is no bank in this town and that i have an account in some part of london it seems that elvesham kept the name of his solicitor secret from all his household i can ascertain nothing elvesham was of course a profound student of mental science and all my declarations of the facts of the case merely confirm the theory that my insanity is the outcome of overmuch brooding upon psychology dreams of the personal identity indeed two days ago i was a healthy youngster with all life before me now i am a furious old man unkempt and desperate and miserable prowling about a great luxurious strange house watched feared and avoided as a lunatic by everyone about me and in london is elvesham beginning life again in a vigorous body and with all the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of threescore and ten he has stolen my life  what has happened i do not clearly know in the study are volumes of manuscript notes referring chiefly to the psychology of memory and parts of what may be either calculations or ciphers in symbols absolutely strange to me in some passages there are indications that he was also occupied with the philosophy of mathematics i take it he has transferred the whole of his memories the accumulation that makes up his personality from this old withered brain of his to mine and similarly that he has transferred mine to his discarded tenement practically that is he has changed bodies but how such a change may be possible is without the range of my philosophy i have been a materialist for all my thinking life but here suddenly is a clear case of mans detachability from matter  one desperate experiment i am about to try i sit writing here before putting the matter to issue this morning with the help of a tableknife that i had secreted at breakfast i succeeded in breaking open a fairly obvious secret drawer in this wrecked writingdesk i discovered nothing save a little green glass phial containing a white powder round the neck of the phial was a label and thereon was written this one word release this may beis most probablypoison i can understand elvesham placing poison in my way and i should be sure that it was his intention so to get rid of the only living witness against him were it not for this careful concealment the man has practically solved the problem of immortality save for the spite of chance he will live in my body until it has aged and then again throwing that aside he will assume some other victims youth and strength when one remembers his heartlessness it is terrible to think of the evergrowing experience that how long has he been leaping from body to body but i tire of writing the powder appears to be soluble in water the taste is not unpleasant                                       there the narrative found upon mr elveshams desk ends his dead body lay between the desk and the chair the latter had been pushed back probably by his last convulsions the story was written in pencil and in a crazy hand quite unlike his usual minute characters there remain only two curious facts to record indisputably there was some connection between eden and elvesham since the whole of elveshams property was bequeathed to the young man but he never inherited when elvesham committed suicide eden was strangely enough already dead twentyfour hours before he had been knocked down by a cab and killed instantly at the crowded crossing at the intersection of gower street and euston road so that the only human being who could have thrown light upon this fantastic narrative is beyond the reach of questions without further comment i leave this extraordinary matter to the readers individual judgment       xii    under the knife   what if i die under it the thought recurred again and again as i walked home from haddons it was a purely personal question i was spared the deep anxieties of a married man and i knew there were few of my intimate friends but would find my death troublesome chiefly on account of their duty of regret i was surprised indeed and perhaps a little humiliated as i turned the matter over to think how few could possibly exceed the conventional requirement things came before me stripped of glamour in a clear dry light during that walk from haddons house over primrose hill there were the friends of my youth i perceived now that our affection was a tradition which we foregathered rather laboriously to maintain there were the rivals and helpers of my later career i suppose i had been coldblooded or undemonstrativeone perhaps implies the other it may be that even the capacity for friendship is a question of physique there had been a time in my own life when i had grieved bitterly enough at the loss of a friend but as i walked home that afternoon the emotional side of my imagination was dormant i could not pity myself nor feel sorry for my friends nor conceive of them as grieving for me  i was interested in this deadness of my emotional natureno doubt a concomitant of my stagnating physiology and my thoughts wandered off along the line it suggested once before in my hot youth i had suffered a sudden loss of blood and had been within an ace of death i remembered now that my affections as well as my passions had drained out of me leaving scarce anything but a tranquil resignation a dreg of selfpity it had been weeks before the old ambitions and tendernesses and all the complex moral interplay of a man had reasserted themselves it occurred to me that the real meaning of this numbness might be a gradual slipping away from the pleasurepain guidance of the animal man it has been proven i take it as thoroughly as anything can be proven in this world that the higher emotions the moral feelings even the subtle unselfishness of love are evolved from the elemental desires and fears of the simple animal they are the harness in which mans mental freedom goes and it may be that as death overshadows us as our possibility of acting diminishes this complex growth of balanced impulse propensity and aversion whose interplay inspires our acts goes with it leaving what  i was suddenly brought back to reality by an imminent collision with the butcherboys tray i found that i was crossing the bridge over the regents park canal which runs parallel with that in the zoological gardens the boy in blue had been looking over his shoulder at a black barge advancing slowly towed by a gaunt white horse in the gardens a nurse was leading three happy little children over the bridge the trees were bright green the spring hopefulness was still unstained by the dusts of summer the sky in the water was bright and clear but broken by long waves by quivering bands of black as the barge drove through the breeze was stirring but it did not stir me as the spring breeze used to do  was this dulness of feeling in itself an anticipation it was curious that i could reason and follow out a network of suggestion as clearly as ever so at least it seemed to me it was calmness rather than dulness that was coming upon me was there any ground for the relief in the presentiment of death did a man near to death begin instinctively to withdraw himself from the meshes of matter and sense even before the cold hand was laid upon his i felt strangely isolatedisolated without regretfrom the life and existence about me the children playing in the sun and gathering strength and experience for the business of life the parkkeeper gossiping with a nursemaid the nursing mother the young couple intent upon each other as they passed me the trees by the wayside spreading new pleading leaves to the sunlight the stir in their branchesi had been part of it all but i had nearly done with it now  some way down the broad walk i perceived that i was tired and that my feet were heavy it was hot that afternoon and i turned aside and sat down on one of the green chairs that line the way in a minute i had dozed into a dream and the tide of my thoughts washed up a vision of the resurrection i was still sitting in the chair but i thought myself actually dead withered tattered dried one eye i saw pecked out by birds awake cried a voice and incontinently the dust of the path and the mould under the grass became insurgent i had never before thought of regents park as a cemetery but now through the trees stretching as far as eye could see i beheld a flat plain of writhing graves and heeling tombstones there seemed to be some trouble the rising dead appeared to stifle as they struggled upward they bled in their struggles the red flesh was torn away from the white bones awake cried a voice but i determined i would not rise to such horrors awake they would not let me alone wake up said an angry voice a cockney angel the man who sells the tickets was shaking me demanding my penny  i paid my penny pocketed my ticket yawned stretched my legs and feeling now rather less torpid got up and walked on towards langham place i speedily lost myself again in a shifting maze of thoughts about death going across marylebone road into that crescent at the end of langham place i had the narrowest escape from the shaft of a cab and went on my way with a palpitating heart and a bruised shoulder it struck me that it would have been curious if my meditations on my death on the morrow had led to my death that day  but i will not weary you with more of my experiences that day and the next i knew more and more certainly that i should die under the operation at times i think i was inclined to pose to myself the doctors were coming at eleven and i did not get up it seemed scarce worth while to trouble about washing and dressing and though i read my newspapers and the letters that came by the first post i did not find them very interesting there was a friendly note from addison my old schoolfriend calling my attention to two discrepancies and a printers error in my new book with one from langridge venting some vexation over minton the rest were business communications i breakfasted in bed the glow of pain at my side seemed more massive i knew it was pain and yet if you can understand i did not find it very painful i had been awake and hot and thirsty in the night but in the morning bed felt comfortable in the nighttime i had lain thinking of things that were past in the morning i dozed over the question of immortality haddon came punctual to the minute with a neat black bag and mowbray soon followed their arrival stirred me up a little i began to take a more personal interest in the proceedings haddon moved the little octagonal table close to the bedside and with his broad back to me began taking things out of his bag i heard the light click of steel upon steel my imagination i found was not altogether stagnant will you hurt me much i said in an offhand tone  not a bit haddon answered over his shoulder we shall chloroform you your hearts as sound as a bell and as he spoke i had a whiff of the pungent sweetness of the anaesthetic  they stretched me out with a convenient exposure of my side and almost before i realised what was happening the chloroform was being administered it stings the nostrils and there is a suffocating sensation at first i knew i should diethat this was the end of consciousness for me and suddenly i felt that i was not prepared for death i had a vague sense of a duty overlookedi knew not what what was it i had not done i could think of nothing more to do nothing desirable left in life and yet i had the strangest disinclination to death and the physical sensation was painfully oppressive of course the doctors did not know they were going to kill me possibly i struggled then i fell motionless and a great silence a monstrous silence and an impenetrable blackness came upon me  there must have been an interval of absolute unconsciousness seconds or minutes then with a chilly unemotional clearness i perceived that i was not yet dead i was still in my body but all the multitudinous sensations that come sweeping from it to make up the background of consciousness had gone leaving me free of it all no not free of it all for as yet something still held me to the poor stark flesh upon the bedheld me yet not so closely that i did not feel myself external to it independent of it straining away from it i do not think i saw i do not think i heard but i perceived all that was going on and it was as if i both heard and saw haddon was bending over me mowbray behind me the scalpelit was a large scalpelwas cutting my flesh at the side under the flying ribs it was interesting to see myself cut like cheese without a pang without even a qualm the interest was much of a quality with that one might feel in a game of chess between strangers haddons face was firm and his hand steady but i was surprised to perceive how i know not that he was feeling the gravest doubt as to his own wisdom in the conduct of the operation  mowbrays thoughts too i could see he was thinking that haddons manner showed too much of the specialist new suggestions came up like bubbles through a stream of frothing meditation and burst one after another in the little bright spot of his consciousness he could not help noticing and admiring haddons swift dexterity in spite of his envious quality and his disposition to detract i saw my liver exposed i was puzzled at my own condition i did not feel that i was dead but i was different in some way from my living self the grey depression that had weighed on me for a year or more and coloured all my thoughts was gone i perceived and thought without any emotional tint at all i wondered if everyone perceived things in this way under chloroform and forgot it again when he came out of it it would be inconvenient to look into some heads and not forget  although i did not think that i was dead i still perceived quite clearly that i was soon to die this brought me back to the consideration of haddons proceedings i looked into his mind and saw that he was afraid of cutting a branch of the portal vein my attention was distracted from details by the curious changes going on in his mind his consciousness was like the quivering little spot of light which is thrown by the mirror of a galvanometer his thoughts ran under it like a stream some through the focus bright and distinct some shadowy in the halflight of the edge just now the little glow was steady but the least movement on mowbrays part the slightest sound from outside even a faint difference in the slow movement of the living flesh he was cutting set the lightspot shivering and spinning a new senseimpression came rushing up through the flow of thoughts and lo the lightspot jerked away towards it swifter than a frightened fish it was wonderful to think that upon that unstable fitful thing depended all the complex motions of the man that for the next five minutes therefore my life hung upon its movements and he was growing more and more nervous in his work it was as if a little picture of a cut vein grew brighter and struggled to oust from his brain another picture of a cut falling short of the mark he was afraid his dread of cutting too little was battling with his dread of cutting too far  then suddenly like an escape of water from under a lockgate a great uprush of horrible realisation set all his thoughts swirling and simultaneously i perceived that the vein was cut he started back with a hoarse exclamation and i saw the brownpurple blood gather in a swift bead and run trickling he was horrified he pitched the redstained scalpel on to the octagonal table and instantly both doctors flung themselves upon me making hasty and illconceived efforts to remedy the disaster ice said mowbray gasping but i knew that i was killed though my body still clung to me  i will not describe their belated endeavours to save me though i perceived every detail my perceptions were sharper and swifter than they had ever been in life my thoughts rushed through my mind with incredible swiftness but with perfect definition i can only compare their crowded clarity to the effects of a reasonable dose of opium in a moment it would all be over and i should be free i knew i was immortal but what would happen i did not know should i drift off presently like a puff of smoke from a gun in some kind of halfmaterial body an attenuated version of my material self should i find myself suddenly among the innumerable hosts of the dead and know the world about me for the phantasmagoria it had always seemed should i drift to some spiritualistic séance and there make foolish incomprehensible attempts to affect a purblind medium it was a state of unemotional curiosity of colourless expectation and then i realised a growing stress upon me a feeling as though some huge human magnet was drawing me upward out of my body the stress grew and grew i seemed an atom for which monstrous forces were fighting for one brief terrible moment sensation came back to me that feeling of falling headlong which comes in nightmares that feeling a thousand times intensified that and a black horror swept across my thoughts in a torrent then the two doctors the naked body with its cut side the little room swept away from under me and vanished as a speck of foam vanishes down an eddy  i was in midair far below was the west end of london receding rapidlyfor i seemed to be flying swiftly upwardand as it receded passing westward like a panorama i could see through the faint haze of smoke the innumerable roofs chimneyset the narrow roadways stippled with people and conveyances the little specks of squares and the church steeples like thorns sticking out of the fabric but it spun away as the earth rotated on its axis and in a few seconds as it seemed i was over the scattered clumps of town about ealing the little thames a thread of blue to the south and the chiltern hills and the north downs coming up like the rim of a basin far away and faint with haze up i rushed and at first i had not the faintest conception what this headlong rush upward could mean  every moment the circle of scenery beneath me grew wider and wider and the details of town and field of hill and valley got more and more hazy and pale and indistinct a luminous grey was mingled more and more with the blue of the hills and the green of the open meadows and a little patch of cloud low and far to the west shone ever more dazzlingly white above as the veil of atmosphere between myself and outer space grew thinner the sky which had been a fair springtime blue at first grew deeper and richer in colour passing steadily through the intervening shades until presently it was as dark as the blue sky of midnight and presently as black as the blackness of a frosty starlight and at last as black as no blackness i had ever beheld and first one star and then many and at last an innumerable host broke out upon the sky more stars than anyone has ever seen from the face of the earth for the blueness of the sky in the light of the sun and stars sifted and spread abroad blindingly there is diffused light even in the darkest skies of winter and we do not see the stars by day only because of the dazzling irradiation of the sun but now i saw thingsi know not how assuredly with no mortal eyesand that defect of bedazzlement blinded me no longer the sun was incredibly strange and wonderful the body of it was a disc of blinding white light not yellowish as it seems to those who live upon the earth but livid white all streaked with scarlet streaks and rimmed about with a fringe of writhing tongues of red fire and shooting halfway across the heavens from either side of it and brighter than the milky way were two pinions of silver white making it look more like those winged globes i have seen in egyptian sculpture than anything else i can remember upon earth these i knew for the solar corona though i had never seen anything of it but a picture during the days of my earthly life  when my attention came back to the earth again i saw that it had fallen very far away from me field and town were long since indistinguishable and all the varied hues of the country were merging into a uniform bright grey broken only by the brilliant white of the clouds that lay scattered in flocculent masses over ireland and the west of england for now i could see the outlines of the north of france and ireland and all this island of britain save where scotland passed over the horizon to the north or where the coast was blurred or obliterated by cloud the sea was a dull grey and darker than the land and the whole panorama was rotating slowly towards the east  all this had happened so swiftly that until i was some thousand miles or so from the earth i had no thought for myself but now i perceived i had neither hands nor feet neither parts nor organs and that i felt neither alarm nor pain all about me i perceived that the vacancy for i had already left the air behind was cold beyond the imagination of man but it troubled me not the suns rays shot through the void powerless to light or heat until they should strike on matter in their course i saw things with a serene selfforgetfulness even as if i were god and down below there rushing away from mecountless miles in a secondwhere a little dark spot on the grey marked the position of london two doctors were struggling to restore life to the poor hacked and outworn shell i had abandoned i felt then such release such serenity as i can compare to no mortal delight i have ever known  it was only after i had perceived all these things that the meaning of that headlong rush of the earth grew into comprehension yet it was so simple so obvious that i was amazed at my never anticipating the thing that was happening to me i had suddenly been cut adrift from matter all that was material of me was there upon earth whirling away through space held to the earth by gravitation partaking of the earthinertia moving in its wreath of epicycles round the sun and with the sun and the planets on their vast march through space but the immaterial has no inertia feels nothing of the pull of matter for matter where it parts from its garment of flesh there it remains so far as space concerns it any longer immovable in space i was not leaving the earth the earth was leaving me and not only the earth but the whole solar system was streaming past and about me in space invisible to me scattered in the wake of the earth upon its journey there must be an innumerable multitude of souls stripped like myself of the material stripped like myself of the passions of the individual and the generous emotions of the gregarious brute naked intelligences things of newborn wonder and thought marvelling at the strange release that had suddenly come on them  as i receded faster and faster from the strange white sun in the black heavens and from the broad and shining earth upon which my being had begun i seemed to grow in some incredible manner vast vast as regards this world i had left vast as regards the moments and periods of a human life very soon i saw the full circle of the earth slightly gibbous like the moon when she nears her full but very large and the silvery shape of america was now in the noonday blaze wherein as it seemed little england had been basking but a few minutes ago at first the earth was large and shone in the heavens filling a great part of them but every moment she grew smaller and more distant as she shrank the broad moon in its third quarter crept into view over the rim of her disc i looked for the constellations only that part of aries directly behind the sun and the lion which the earth covered were hidden i recognised the tortuous tattered band of the milky way with vega very bright between sun and earth and sirius and orion shone splendid against the unfathomable blackness in the opposite quarter of the heavens the pole star was overhead and the great bear hung over the circle of the earth and away beneath and beyond the shining corona of the sun were strange groupings of stars i had never seen in my lifenotably a daggershaped group that i knew for the southern cross all these were no larger than when they had shone on earth but the little stars that one scarce sees shone now against the setting of black vacancy as brightly as the firstmagnitudes had done while the larger worlds were points of indescribable glory and colour aldebaran was a spot of bloodred fire and sirius condensed to one point the light of innumerable sapphires and they shone steadily they did not scintillate they were calmly glorious my impressions had an adamantine hardness and brightness there was no blurring softness no atmosphere nothing but infinite darkness set with the myriads of these acute and brilliant points and specks of light presently when i looked again the little earth seemed no bigger than the sun and it dwindled and turned as i looked until in a seconds space as it seemed to me it was halved and so it went on swiftly dwindling far away in the opposite direction a little pinkish pins head of light shining steadily was the planet mars i swam motionless in vacancy and without a trace of terror or astonishment watched the speck of cosmic dust we call the world fall away from me  presently it dawned upon me that my sense of duration had changed that my mind was moving not faster but infinitely slower that between each separate impression there was a period of many days the moon spun once round the earth as i noted this and i perceived clearly the motion of mars in his orbit moreover it appeared as if the time between thought and thought grew steadily greater until at last a thousand years was but a moment in my perception  at first the constellations had shone motionless against the black background of infinite space but presently it seemed as though the group of stars about hercules and the scorpion was contracting while orion and aldebaran and their neighbours were scattering apart flashing suddenly out of the darkness there came a flying multitude of particles of rock glittering like dustspecks in a sunbeam and encompassed in a faintly luminous cloud they swirled all about me and vanished again in a twinkling far behind and then i saw that a bright spot of light that shone a little to one side of my path was growing very rapidly larger and perceived that it was the planet saturn rushing towards me larger and larger it grew swallowing up the heavens behind it and hiding every moment a fresh multitude of stars i perceived its flattened whirling body its disclike belt and seven of its little satellites it grew and grew till it towered enormous and then i plunged amid a streaming multitude of clashing stones and dancing dustparticles and gaseddies and saw for a moment the mighty triple belt like three concentric arches of moonlight above me its shadow black on the boiling tumult below these things happened in onetenth of the time it takes to tell them the planet went by like a flash of lightning for a few seconds it blotted out the sun and there and then became a mere black dwindling winged patch against the light the earth the mother mote of my being i could no longer see  so with a stately swiftness in the profoundest silence the solar system fell from me as it had been a garment until the sun was a mere star amid the multitude of stars with its eddy of planetspecks lost in the confused glittering of the remoter light i was no longer a denizen of the solar system i had come to the outer universe i seemed to grasp and comprehend the whole world of matter ever more swiftly the stars closed in about the spot where antares and vega had vanished in a phosphorescent haze until that part of the sky had the semblance of a whirling mass of nebulae and ever before me yawned vaster gaps of vacant blackness and the stars shone fewer and fewer it seemed as if i moved towards a point between orions belt and sword and the void about that region opened vaster and vaster every second an incredible gulf of nothingness into which i was falling faster and ever faster the universe rushed by a hurry of whirling motes at last speeding silently into the void stars glowing brighter and brighter with their circling planets catching the light in a ghostly fashion as i neared them shone out and vanished again into inexistence faint comets clusters of meteorites winking specks of matter eddying lightpoints whizzed past some perhaps a hundred millions of miles or so from me at most few nearer travelling with unimaginable rapidity shooting constellations momentary darts of fire through that black enormous night more than anything else it was like a dusty draught sunbeamlit broader and wider and deeper grew the starless space the vacant beyond into which i was being drawn at last a quarter of the heavens was black and blank and the whole headlong rush of stellar universe closed in behind me like a veil of light that is gathered together it drove away from me like a monstrous jackolantern driven by the wind i had come out into the wilderness of space ever the vacant blackness grew broader until the hosts of the stars seemed only like a swarm of fiery specks hurrying away from me inconceivably remote and the darkness the nothingness and emptiness was about me on every side soon the little universe of matter the cage of points in which i had begun to be was dwindling now to a whirling disc of luminous glittering and now to one minute disc of hazy light in a little while it would shrink to a point and at last would vanish altogether  suddenly feeling came back to mefeeling in the shape of overwhelming terror such a dread of those dark vastitudes as no words can describe a passionate resurgence of sympathy and social desire were there other souls invisible to me as i to them about me in the blackness or was i indeed even as i felt alone had i passed out of being into something that was neither being nor notbeing the covering of the body the covering of matter had been torn from me and the hallucinations of companionship and security everything was black and silent i had ceased to be i was nothing there was nothing save only that infinitesimal dot of light that dwindled in the gulf i strained myself to hear and see and for a while there was naught but infinite silence intolerable darkness horror and despair  then i saw that about the spot of light into which the whole world of matter had shrunk there was a faint glow and in a band on either side of that the darkness was not absolute i watched it for ages as it seemed to me and through the long waiting the haze grew imperceptibly more distinct and then about the band appeared an irregular cloud of the faintest palest brown i felt a passionate impatience but the things grew brighter so slowly that they scarce seemed to change what was unfolding itself what was this strange reddish dawn in the interminable night of space  the clouds shape was grotesque it seemed to be looped along its lower side into four projecting masses and above it ended in a straight line what phantom was it i felt assured i had seen that figure before but i could not think what nor where nor when it was then the realisation rushed upon me it was a clenched hand i was alone in space alone with this huge shadowy hand upon which the whole universe of matter lay like an unconsidered speck of dust it seemed as though i watched it through vast periods of time on the forefinger glittered a ring and the universe from which i had come was but a spot of light upon the rings curvature and the thing that the hand gripped had the likeness of a black rod through a long eternity i watched this hand with the ring and the rod marvelling and fearing and waiting helplessly on what might follow it seemed as though nothing could follow that i should watch for ever seeing only the hand and the thing it held and understanding nothing of its import was the whole universe but a refracting speck upon some greater being were our worlds but the atoms of another universe and those again of another and so on through an endless progression and what was i was i indeed immaterial a vague persuasion of a body gathering about me came into my suspense the abysmal darkness about the hand filled with impalpable suggestions with uncertain fluctuating shapes  then suddenly came a sound like the sound of a tolling bell faint as if infinitely far muffled as though heard through thick swathings of darkness a deep vibrating resonance with vast gulfs of silence between each stroke and the hand appeared to tighten on the rod and i saw far above the hand towards the apex of the darkness a circle of dim phosphorescence a ghostly sphere whence these sounds came throbbing and at the last stroke the hand vanished for the hour had come and i heard a noise of many waters but the black rod remained as a great band across the sky and then a voice which seemed to run to the uttermost parts of space spoke saying there will be no more pain  at that an almost intolerable gladness and radiance rushed in upon me and i saw the circle shining white and bright and the rod black and shining and many things else distinct and clear and the circle was the face of the clock and the rod the rail of my bed haddon was standing at the foot against the rail with a small pair of scissors on his fingers and the hands of my clock on the mantel over his shoulder were clasped together over the hour of twelve mowbray was washing something in a basin at the octagonal table and at my side i felt a subdued feeling that could scarce be spoken of as pain  the operation had not killed me and i perceived suddenly that the dull melancholy of half a year was lifted from my mind       xiii    the sea raiders   i  until the extraordinary affair at sidmouth the peculiar species haploteuthis ferox was known to science only generically on the strength of a halfdigested tentacle obtained near the azores and a decaying body pecked by birds and nibbled by fish found early in 1896 by mr jennings near lands end  in no department of zoological science indeed are we quite so much in the dark as with regard to the deepsea cephalopods a mere accident for instance it was that led to the prince of monacos discovery of nearly a dozen new forms in the summer of 1895 a discovery in which the beforementioned tentacle was included it chanced that a cachalot was killed off terceira by some sperm whalers and in its last struggles charged almost to the princes yacht missed it rolled under and died within twenty yards of his rudder and in its agony it threw up a number of large objects which the prince dimly perceiving they were strange and important was by a happy expedient able to secure before they sank he set his screws in motion and kept them circling in the vortices thus created until a boat could be lowered and these specimens were whole cephalopods and fragments of cephalopods some of gigantic proportions and almost all of them unknown to science  it would seem indeed that these large and agile creatures living in the middle depths of the sea must to a large extent for ever remain unknown to us since under water they are too nimble for nets and it is only by such rare unlookedfor accidents that specimens can be obtained in the case of haploteuthis ferox for instance we are still altogether ignorant of its habitat as ignorant as we are of the breedingground of the herring or the seaways of the salmon and zoologists are altogether at a loss to account for its sudden appearance on our coast possibly it was the stress of a hunger migration that drove it hither out of the deep but it will be perhaps better to avoid necessarily inconclusive discussion and to proceed at once with our narrative  the first human being to set eyes upon a living haploteuthisthe first human being to survive that is for there can be little doubt now that the wave of bathing fatalities and boating accidents that travelled along the coast of cornwall and devon in early may was due to this causewas a retired teadealer of the name of fison who was stopping at a sidmouth boardinghouse it was in the afternoon and he was walking along the cliff path between sidmouth and ladram bay the cliffs in this direction are very high but down the red face of them in one place a kind of ladder staircase has been made he was near this when his attention was attracted by what at first he thought to be a cluster of birds struggling over a fragment of food that caught the sunlight and glistened pinkishwhite the tide was right out and this object was not only far below him but remote across a broad waste of rock reefs covered with dark seaweed and interspersed with silvery shining tidal pools and he was moreover dazzled by the brightness of the further water  in a minute regarding this again he perceived that his judgment was in fault for over this struggle circled a number of birds jackdaws and gulls for the most part the latter gleaming blindingly when the sunlight smote their wings and they seemed minute in comparison with it and his curiosity was perhaps aroused all the more strongly because of his first insufficient explanations  as he had nothing better to do than amuse himself he decided to make this object whatever it was the goal of his afternoon walk instead of ladram bay conceiving it might perhaps be a great fish of some sort stranded by some chance and flapping about in its distress and so he hurried down the long steep ladder stopping at intervals of thirty feet or so to take breath and scan the mysterious movement  at the foot of the cliff he was of course nearer his object than he had been but on the other hand it now came up against the incandescent sky beneath the sun so as to seem dark and indistinct whatever was pinkish of it was now hidden by a skerry of weedy boulders but he perceived that it was made up of seven rounded bodies distinct or connected and that the birds kept up a constant croaking and screaming but seemed afraid to approach it too closely  mr fison torn by curiosity began picking his way across the waveworn rocks and finding the wet seaweed that covered them thickly rendered them extremely slippery he stopped removed his shoes and socks and rolled his trousers above his knees his object was of course merely to avoid stumbling into the rocky pools about him and perhaps he was rather glad as all men are of an excuse to resume even for a moment the sensations of his boyhood at any rate it is to this no doubt that he owes his life  he approached his mark with all the assurance which the absolute security of this country against all forms of animal life gives its inhabitants the round bodies moved to and fro but it was only when he surmounted the skerry of boulders i have mentioned that he realised the horrible nature of the discovery it came upon him with some suddenness  the rounded bodies fell apart as he came into sight over the ridge and displayed the pinkish object to be the partially devoured body of a human being but whether of a man or woman he was unable to say and the rounded bodies were new and ghastlylooking creatures in shape somewhat resembling an octopus with huge and very long and flexible tentacles coiled copiously on the ground the skin had a glistening texture unpleasant to see like shiny leather the downward bend of the tentaclesurrounded mouth the curious excrescence at the bend the tentacles and the large intelligent eyes gave the creatures a grotesque suggestion of a face they were the size of a fairsized swine about the body and the tentacles seemed to him to be many feet in length there were he thinks seven or eight at least of the creatures twenty yards beyond them amid the surf of the now returning tide two others were emerging from the sea  their bodies lay flatly on the rocks and their eyes regarded him with evil interest but it does not appear that mr fison was afraid or that he realised that he was in any danger possibly his confidence is to be ascribed to the limpness of their attitudes but he was horrified of course and intensely excited and indignant at such revolting creatures preying upon human flesh he thought they had chanced upon a drowned body he shouted to them with the idea of driving them off and finding they did not budge cast about him picked up a big rounded lump of rock and flung it at one  and then slowly uncoiling their tentacles they all began moving towards himcreeping at first deliberately and making a soft purring sound to each other  in a moment mr fison realised that he was in danger he shouted again threw both his boots and started off with a leap forthwith twenty yards off he stopped and faced about judging them slow and behold the tentacles of their leader were already pouring over the rocky ridge on which he had just been standing  at that he shouted again but this time not threatening but a cry of dismay and began jumping striding slipping wading across the uneven expanse between him and the beach the tall red cliffs seemed suddenly at a vast distance and he saw as though they were creatures in another world two minute workmen engaged in the repair of the ladderway and little suspecting the race for life that was beginning below them at one time he could hear the creatures splashing in the pools not a dozen feet behind him and once he slipped and almost fell  they chased him to the very foot of the cliffs and desisted only when he had been joined by the workmen at the foot of the ladderway up the cliff all three of the men pelted them with stones for a time and then hurried to the cliff top and along the path towards sidmouth to secure assistance and a boat and to rescue the desecrated body from the clutches of these abominable creatures   ii  and as if he had not already been in sufficient peril that day mr fison went with the boat to point out the exact spot of his adventure  as the tide was down it required a considerable detour to reach the spot and when at last they came off the ladderway the mangled body had disappeared the water was now running in submerging first one slab of slimy rock and then another and the four men in the boatthe workmen that is the boatman and mr fisonnow turned their attention from the bearings off shore to the water beneath the keel  at first they could see little below them save a dark jungle of laminaria with an occasional darting fish their minds were set on adventure and they expressed their disappointment freely but presently they saw one of the monsters swimming through the water seaward with a curious rolling motion that suggested to mr fison the spinning roll of a captive balloon almost immediately after the waving streamers of laminaria were extraordinarily perturbed parted for a moment and three of these beasts became darkly visible struggling for what was probably some fragment of the drowned man in a moment the copious olivegreen ribbons had poured again over this writhing group  at that all four men greatly excited began beating the water with oars and shouting and immediately they saw a tumultuous movement among the weeds they desisted to see more clearly and as soon as the water was smooth they saw as it seemed to them the whole sea bottom among the weeds set with eyes  ugly swine cried one of the men why theres dozens  and forthwith the things began to rise through the water about them mr fison has since described to the writer this startling eruption out of the waving laminaria meadows to him it seemed to occupy a considerable time but it is probable that really it was an affair of a few seconds only for a time nothing but eyes and then he speaks of tentacles streaming out and parting the weed fronds this way and that then these things growing larger until at last the bottom was hidden by their intercoiling forms and the tips of tentacles rose darkly here and there into the air above the swell of the waters  one came up boldly to the side of the boat and clinging to this with three of its suckerset tentacles threw four others over the gunwale as if with an intention either of oversetting the boat or of clambering into it mr fison at once caught up the boathook and jabbing furiously at the soft tentacles forced it to desist he was struck in the back and almost pitched overboard by the boatman who was using his oar to resist a similar attack on the other side of the boat but the tentacles on either side at once relaxed their hold slid out of sight and splashed into the water  wed better get out of this said mr fison who was trembling violently he went to the tiller while the boatman and one of the workmen seated themselves and began rowing the other workman stood up in the fore part of the boat with the boathook ready to strike any more tentacles that might appear nothing else seems to have been said mr fison had expressed the common feeling beyond amendment in a hushed scared mood with faces white and drawn they set about escaping from the position into which they had so recklessly blundered  but the oars had scarcely dropped into the water before dark tapering serpentine ropes had bound them and were about the rudder and creeping up the sides of the boat with a looping motion came the suckers again the men gripped their oars and pulled but it was like trying to move a boat in a floating raft of weeds help here cried the boatman and mr fison and the second workman rushed to help lug at the oar  then the man with the boathookhis name was ewan or ewensprang up with a curse and began striking downward over the side as far as he could reach at the bank of tentacles that now clustered along the boats bottom and at the same time the two rowers stood up to get a better purchase for the recovery of their oars the boatman handed his to mr fison who lugged desperately and meanwhile the boatman opened a big claspknife and leaning over the side of the boat began hacking at the spiring arms upon the oar shaft  mr fison staggering with the quivering rocking of the boat his teeth set his breath coming short and the veins starting on his hands as he pulled at his oar suddenly cast his eyes seaward and there not fifty yards off across the long rollers of the incoming tide was a large boat standing in towards them with three women and a little child in it a boatman was rowing and a little man in a pinkribboned straw hat and whites stood in the stern hailing them for a moment of course mr fison thought of help and then he thought of the child he abandoned his oar forthwith threw up his arms in a frantic gesture and screamed to the party in the boat to keep away for gods sake it says much for the modesty and courage of mr fison that he does not seem to be aware that there was any quality of heroism in his action at this juncture the oar he had abandoned was at once drawn under and presently reappeared floating about twenty yards away  at the same moment mr fison felt the boat under him lurch violently and a hoarse scream a prolonged cry of terror from hill the boatman caused him to forget the party of excursionists altogether he turned and saw hill crouching by the forward rowlock his face convulsed with terror and his right arm over the side and drawn tightly down he gave now a succession of short sharp cries oh oh ohoh mr fison believes that he must have been hacking at the tentacles below the waterline and have been grasped by them but of course it is quite impossible to say now certainly what had happened the boat was heeling over so that the gunwale was within ten inches of the water and both ewan and the other labourer were striking down into the water with oar and boathook on either side of hills arm mr fison instinctively placed himself to counterpoise them  then hill who was a burly powerful man made a strenuous effort and rose almost to a standing position he lifted his arm indeed clean out of the water hanging to it was a complicated tangle of brown ropes and the eyes of one of the brutes that had hold of him glaring straight and resolute showed momentarily above the surface the boat heeled more and more and the greenbrown water came pouring in a cascade over the side then hill slipped and fell with his ribs across the side and his arm and the mass of tentacles about it splashed back into the water he rolled over his boot kicked mr fisons knee as that gentleman rushed forward to seize him and in another moment fresh tentacles had whipped about his waist and neck and after a brief convulsive struggle in which the boat was nearly capsized hill was lugged overboard the boat righted with a violent jerk that all but sent mr fison over the other side and hid the struggle in the water from his eyes  he stood staggering to recover his balance for a moment and as he did so he became aware that the struggle and the inflowing tide had carried them close upon the weedy rocks again not four yards off a table of rock still rose in rhythmic movements above the inwash of the tide in a moment mr fison seized the oar from ewan gave one vigorous stroke then dropping it ran to the bows and leapt he felt his feet slide over the rock and by a frantic effort leapt again towards a further mass he stumbled over this came to his knees and rose again  look out cried someone and a large drab body struck him he was knocked flat into a tidal pool by one of the workmen and as he went down he heard smothered choking cries that he believed at the time came from hill then he found himself marvelling at the shrillness and variety of hills voice someone jumped over him and a curving rush of foamy water poured over him and passed he scrambled to his feet dripping and without looking seaward ran as fast as his terror would let him shoreward before him over the flat space of scattered rocks stumbled the two workmenone a dozen yards in front of the other  he looked over his shoulder at last and seeing that he was not pursued faced about he was astonished from the moment of the rising of the cephalopods out of the water he had been acting too swiftly to fully comprehend his actions now it seemed to him as if he had suddenly jumped out of an evil dream  for there were the sky cloudless and blazing with the afternoon sun the sea weltering under its pitiless brightness the soft creamy foam of the breaking water and the low long dark ridges of rock the righted boat floated rising and falling gently on the swell about a dozen yards from shore hill and the monsters all the stress and tumult of that fierce fight for life had vanished as though they had never been  mr fisons heart was beating violently he was throbbing to the fingertips and his breath came deep  there was something missing for some seconds he could not think clearly enough what this might be sun sky sea rockswhat was it then he remembered the boatload of excursionists it had vanished he wondered whether he had imagined it he turned and saw the two workmen standing side by side under the projecting masses of the tall pink cliffs he hesitated whether he should make one last attempt to save the man hill his physical excitement seemed to desert him suddenly and leave him aimless and helpless he turned shoreward stumbling and wading towards his two companions  he looked back again and there were now two boats floating and the one farthest out at sea pitched clumsily bottom upward    iii  so it was haploteuthis ferox made its appearance upon the devonshire coast so far this has been its most serious aggression mr fisons account taken together with the wave of boating and bathing casualties to which i have already alluded and the absence of fish from the cornish coasts that year points clearly to a shoal of these voracious deepsea monsters prowling slowly along the subtidal coastline hunger migration has i know been suggested as the force that drove them hither but for my own part i prefer to believe the alternative theory of hemsley hemsley holds that a pack or shoal of these creatures may have become enamoured of human flesh by the accident of a foundered ship sinking among them and have wandered in search of it out of their accustomed zone first waylaying and following ships and so coming to our shores in the wake of the atlantic traffic but to discuss hemsleys cogent and admirablystated arguments would be out of place here  it would seem that the appetites of the shoal were satisfied by the catch of eleven peoplefor so far as can be ascertained there were ten people in the second boat and certainly these creatures gave no further signs of their presence off sidmouth that day the coast between seaton and budleigh salterton was patrolled all that evening and night by four preventive service boats the men in which were armed with harpoons and cutlasses and as the evening advanced a number of more or less similarly equipped expeditions organised by private individuals joined them mr fison took no part in any of these expeditions  about midnight excited hails were heard from a boat about a couple of miles out at sea to the southeast of sidmouth and a lantern was seen waving in a strange manner to and fro and up and down the nearer boats at once hurried towards the alarm the venturesome occupants of the boata seaman a curate and two schoolboyshad actually seen the monsters passing under their boat the creatures it seems like most deepsea organisms were phosphorescent and they had been floating five fathoms deep or so like creatures of moonshine through the blackness of the water their tentacles retracted and as if asleep rolling over and over and moving slowly in a wedgelike formation towards the southeast  these people told their story in gesticulated fragments as first one boat drew alongside and then another at last there was a little fleet of eight or nine boats collected together and from them a tumult like the chatter of a marketplace rose into the stillness of the night there was little or no disposition to pursue the shoal the people had neither weapons nor experience for such a dubious chase and presentlyeven with a certain relief it may bethe boats turned shoreward  and now to tell what is perhaps the most astonishing fact in this whole astonishing raid we have not the slightest knowledge of the subsequent movements of the shoal although the whole southwest coast was now alert for it but it may perhaps be significant that a cachalot was stranded off sark on june 3 two weeks and three days after this sidmouth affair a living haploteuthis came ashore on calais sands it was alive because several witnesses saw its tentacles moving in a convulsive way but it is probable that it was dying a gentleman named pouchet obtained a rifle and shot it  that was the last appearance of a living haploteuthis no others were seen on the french coast on the 15th of june a dead carcass almost complete was washed ashore near torquay and a few days later a boat from the marine biological station engaged in dredging off plymouth picked up a rotting specimen slashed deeply with a cutlass wound how the former had come by its death it is impossible to say and on the last day of june mr egbert caine an artist bathing near newlyn threw up his arms shrieked and was drawn under a friend bathing with him made no attempt to save him but swam at once for the shore this is the last fact to tell of this extraordinary raid from the deeper sea whether it is really the last of these horrible creatures it is as yet premature to say but it is believed and certainly it is to be hoped that they have returned now and returned for good to the sunless depths of the middle seas out of which they have so strangely and so mysteriously arisen       xiv    the obliterated man   i wasyou shall hear immediately why i am not nowegbert craddock cummins the name remains i am still heaven help me dramatic critic to the fiery cross what i shall be in a little while i do not know i write in great trouble and confusion of mind i will do what i can to make myself clear in the face of terrible difficulties you must bear with me a little when a man is rapidly losing his own identity he naturally finds a difficulty in expressing himself i will make it perfectly plain in a minute when once i get my grip upon the story let me seewhere am i i wish i knew ah i have it dead self egbert craddock cummins  in the past i should have disliked writing anything quite so full of i as this story must be it is full of is before and behind like the beast in revelationthe one with a head like a calf i am afraid but my tastes have changed since i became a dramatic critic and studied the mastersgas gbs grs and the others everything has changed since then at least the story is about myselfso that there is some excuse for me and it is really not egotism because as i say since those days my identity has undergone an entire alteration  that past i wasin those daysrather a nice fellow rather shy taste for grey in my clothes weedy little moustache face interesting slight stutter which i had caught in my early life from a schoolfellow engaged to a very nice girl named delia fairly new she was cigarettesliked me because i was human and original considered i was like lambon the strength of the stutter i believe father an eminent authority on postage stamps she read a great deal in the british museum a perfect pairing ground for literary people that british museumyou should read george egerton and justin huntly mcarthy and gissing and the rest of them we loved in our intellectual way and shared the brightest hopes all gone now and her father liked me because i seemed honestly eager to hear about stamps she had no mother indeed i had the happiest prospects a young man could have i never went to theatres in those days my aunt charlotte before she died had told me not to  then barnaby the editor of the fiery cross made mein spite of my spasmodic efforts to escapedramatic critic he is a fine healthy man barnaby with an enormous head of frizzy black hair and a convincing manner and he caught me on the staircase going to see wembly he had been dining and was more than usually buoyant hullo cummins he said the very man i want he caught me by the shoulder or the collar or something ran me up the little passage and flung me over the wastepaper basket into the armchair in his office pray be seated he said as he did so then he ran across the room and came back with some pink and yellow tickets and pushed them into my hand opera comique he said thursday friday the surrey saturday the frivolity thats all i think  but i began  glad youre free he said snatching some proofs off the desk and beginning to read  i dont quite understand i said  eigh he said at the top of his voice as though he thought i had gone and was startled at my remark  do you want me to criticise these plays  do something with em did you think it was a treat  but i cant  did you call me a fool  well ive never been to a theatre in my life  virgin soil  but i dont know anything about it you know  thats just it new view no habits no clichés in stock ours is a live paper not a bag of tricks none of your clockwork professional journalism in this office and i can rely on your integrity  but ive conscientious scruples  he caught me up suddenly and put me outside his door go and talk to wembly about that he said hell explain  as i stood perplexed he opened the door again said i forgot this thrust a fourth ticket into my hand it was for that nightin twenty minutes time and slammed the door upon me his expression was quite calm but i caught his eye  i hate arguments i decided that i would take his hint and become to my own destruction a dramatic critic i walked slowly down the passage to wembly that barnaby has a remarkable persuasive way he has made few suggestions during our very pleasant intercourse of four years that he has not ultimately won me round to adopting it may be of course that i am of a yielding disposition certainly i am too apt to take my colour from my circumstances it is indeed to my unfortunate susceptibility to vivid impressions that all my misfortunes are due i have already alluded to the slight stammer i had acquired from a schoolfellow in my youth however this is a digression i went home in a cab to dress  i will not trouble the reader with my thoughts about the firstnight audience strange assembly as it isthose i reserve for my memoirsnor the humiliating story of how i got lost during the entracte in a lot of red plush passages and saw the third act from the gallery the only point upon which i wish to lay stress was the remarkable effect of the acting upon me you must remember i had lived a quiet and retired life and had never been to the theatre before and that i am extremely sensitive to vivid impressions at the risk of repetition i must insist upon these points  the first effect was a profound amazement not untinctured by alarm the phenomenal unnaturalness of acting is a thing discounted in the minds of most people by early visits to the theatre they get used to the fantastic gestures the flamboyant emotions the weird mouthings melodious snortings agonising yelps lipgnawings glaring horrors and other emotional symbolism of the stage it becomes at last a mere deafanddumb language to them which they read intelligently pari passu with the hearing of the dialogue but all this was new to me the thing was called a modern comedy the people were supposed to be english and were dressed like fashionable americans of the current epoch and i fell into the natural error of supposing that the actors were trying to represent human beings i looked round on my firstnight audience with a kind of wonder discoveredas all new dramatic critics dothat it rested with me to reform the drama and after a supper choked with emotion went off to the office to write a column piebald with new paragraphs as all my stuff isit fills out so and purple with indignation barnaby was delighted  but i could not sleep that night i dreamt of actorsactors glaring actors smiting their chests actors flinging out a handful of extended fingers actors smiling bitterly laughing despairingly falling hopelessly dying idiotically i got up at eleven with a slight headache read my notice in the fiery cross breakfasted and went back to my room to shave its my habit to do so then an odd thing happened i could not find my razor suddenly it occurred to me that i had not unpacked it the day before  ah said i in front of the lookingglass then hullo  quite involuntarily when i had thought of my portmanteau i had flung up the left arm fingers fully extended and clutched at my diaphragm with my right hand i am an acutely selfconscious man at all times the gesture struck me as absolutely novel for me i repeated it for my own satisfaction odd then rather puzzled i turned to my portmanteau  after shaving my mind reverted to the acting i had seen and i entertained myself before the cheval glass with some imitations of jafferays more exaggerated gestures really one might think it a disease i saidstagewalkitis theres many a truth spoken in jest then if i remember rightly i went off to see wembly and afterwards lunched at the british museum with delia we actually spoke about our prospects in the light of my new appointment  but that appointment was the beginning of my downfall from that day i necessarily became a persistent theatregoer and almost insensibly i began to change the next thing i noticed after the gesture about the razor was to catch myself bowing ineffably when i met delia and stooping in an oldfashioned courtly way over her hand directly i caught myself i straightened myself up and became very uncomfortable i remember she looked at me curiously then in the office i found myself doing nervous business fingers on teeth when barnaby asked me a question i could not very well answer then in some trifling difference with delia i clasped my hand to my brow and i pranced through my social transactions at times singularly like an actor i tried not tono one could be more keenly alive to the arrant absurdity of the histrionic bearing and i did  it began to dawn on me what it all meant the acting i saw was too much for my delicatelystrung nervous system i have always i know been too amenable to the suggestions of my circumstances night after night of concentrated attention to the conventional attitudes and intonation of the english stage was gradually affecting my speech and carriage i was giving way to the infection of sympathetic imitation night after night my plastic nervous system took the print of some new amazing gesture some new emotional exaggerationand retained it a kind of theatrical veneer threatened to plate over and obliterate my private individuality altogether i saw myself in a kind of vision sitting by myself one night my new self seemed to me to glide posing and gesticulating across the room he clutched his throat he opened his fingers he opened his legs in walking like a highclass marionette he went from attitude to attitude he might have been clockwork directly after this i made an ineffectual attempt to resign my theatrical work but barnaby persisted in talking about the polywhiddle divorce all the time i was with him and i could get no opportunity of saying what i wished  and then delias manner began to change towards me the ease of our intercourse vanished i felt she was learning to dislike me i grinned and capered and scowled and posed at her in a thousand ways and knewwith what a voiceless agonythat i did it all the time i tried to resign again and barnaby talked about x and z and y in the new review and gave me a strong cigar to smoke and so routed me and then i walked up the assyrian gallery in the manner of irving to meet delia and so precipitated the crisis  ahdear i said with more sprightliness and emotion in my voice than had ever been in all my life before i became to my own undoing a dramatic critic  she held out her hand rather coldly scrutinising my face as she did so i prepared with a newwon grace to walk by her side egbert she said standing still and thought then she looked at me  i said nothing i felt what was coming i tried to be the old egbert craddock cummins of shambling gait and stammering sincerity whom she loved but i felt even as i did so that i was a new thing a thing of surging emotions and mysterious fixitylike no human being that ever lived except upon the stage egbert she said you are not yourself  ah involuntarily i clutched my diaphragm and averted my head as is the way with them  there she said  what do you mean i said whispering in vocal italicsyou know how they do itturning on her perplexity on face right hand down left on brow i knew quite well what she meant i knew quite well the dramatic unreality of my behaviour but i struggled against it in vain what do you mean i said and in a kind of hoarse whisper i dont understand  she really looked as though she disliked me what do you keep on posing for she said i dont like it you didnt use to  didnt use to i said slowly repeating this twice i glared up and down the gallery with short sharp glances we are alone i said swiftly listen i poked my forefinger towards her and glared at her i am under a curse  i saw her hand tighten upon her sunshade you are under some bad influence or other said delia you should give it up i never knew anyone change as you have done  delia i said lapsing into the pathetic pity me augh delia pity me  she eyed me critically why you keep playing the fool like this i dont know she said anyhow i really cannot go about with a man who behaves as you do you made us both ridiculous on wednesday frankly i dislike you as you are now i met you here to tell you soas its about the only place where we can be sure of being alone together  delia said i with intensity knuckles of clenched hands white you dont mean  i do said delia a womans lot is sad enough at the best of times but with you  i clapped my hand on my brow  so goodbye said delia without emotion  oh delia i said not this  goodbye mr cummins she said  by a violent effort i controlled myself and touched her hand i tried to say some word of explanation to her she looked into my working face and winced i must do it she said hopelessly then she turned from me and began walking rapidly down the gallery  heavens how the human agony cried within me i loved delia but nothing found expressioni was already too deeply crusted with my acquired self  goodbaye i said at last watching her retreating figure how i hated myself for doing it after she had vanished i repeated in a dreamy way goodbaye looking hopelessly round me then with a kind of heartbroken cry i shook my clenched fists in the air staggered to the pedestal of a winged figure buried my face in my arms and made my shoulders heave something within me said ass as i did so i had the greatest difficulty in persuading the museum policeman who was attracted by my cry of agony that i was not intoxicated but merely suffering from a transient indisposition  but even this great sorrow has not availed to save me from my fate i see it everyone sees it i grow more theatrical every day and no one could be more painfully aware of the pungent silliness of theatrical ways the quiet nervous but pleasing ec cummins vanishes i cannot save him i am driven like a dead leaf before the winds of march my tailor even enters into the spirit of my disorder he has a peculiar sense of what is fitting i tried to get a dull grey suit from him this spring and he foisted a brilliant blue upon me and i see he has put braid down the sides of my new dress trousers my hairdresser insists upon giving me a wave  i am beginning to associate with actors i detest them but it is only in their company that i can feel i am not glaringly conspicuous their talk infects me i notice a growing tendency to dramatic brevity to dashes and pauses in my style to a punctuation of bows and attitudes barnaby has remarked it too i offended wembly by calling him dear boy yesterday i dread the end but i cannot escape from it  the fact is i am being obliterated living a grey retired life all my youth i came to the theatre a delicate sketch of a man a thing of tints and faint lines their gorgeous colouring has effaced me altogether people forget how much mode of expression method of movement are a matter of contagion i have heard of stagestruck people before and thought it a figure of speech i spoke of it jestingly as a disease it is no jest it is a disease and i have got it badly deep down within me i protest against the wrong done to my personalityunavailingly for three hours or more a week i have to go and concentrate my attention on some fresh play and the suggestions of the drama strengthen their awful hold upon me my manners grow so flamboyant my passions so professional that i doubt as i said at the outset whether it is really myself that behaves in such a manner i feel merely the core to this dramatic casing that grows thicker and presses upon meme and mine i feel like king johns abbot in his cope of lead  i doubt indeed whether i should not abandon the struggle altogether leave this sad world of ordinary life for which i am so ill fitted abandon the name of cummins for some professional pseudonym complete my selfeffacement anda thing of tricks and tatters of posing and pretencego upon the stage it seems my only resortto hold the mirror up to nature for in the ordinary life i will confess no one now seems to regard me as both sane and sober only upon the stage i feel convinced will people take me seriously that will be the end of it i know that will be the end of it and yet  i will frankly confess  all that marks off your actor from your common man  i detest i am still largely of my aunt charlottes opinion that playacting is unworthy of a pureminded mans attention much more participation even now i would resign my dramatic criticism and try a rest only i cant get hold of barnaby letters of resignation he never notices he says it is against the etiquette of journalism to write to your editor and when i go to see him he gives me another big cigar and some strong whisky and soda and then something always turns up to prevent my explanation       xv    the plattner story   whether the story of gottfried plattner is to be credited or not is a pretty question in the value of evidence on the one hand we have seven witnessesto be perfectly exact we have six and a half pairs of eyes and one undeniable fact and on the other we havewhat is itprejudice commonsense the inertia of opinion never were there seven more honestseeming witnesses never was there a more undeniable fact than the inversion of gottfried plattners anatomical structure andnever was there a more preposterous story than the one they have to tell the most preposterous part of the story is the worthy gottfrieds contribution for i count him as one of the seven heaven forbid that i should be led into giving countenance to superstition by a passion for impartiality and so come to share the fate of eusapias patrons frankly i believe there is something crooked about this business of gottfried plattner but what that crooked factor is i will admit as frankly i do not know i have been surprised at the credit accorded to the story in the most unexpected and authoritative quarters the fairest way to the reader however will be for me to tell it without further comment  gottfried plattner is in spite of his name a freeborn englishman his father was an alsatian who came to england in the sixties married a respectable english girl of unexceptionable antecedents and died after a wholesome and uneventful life devoted i understand chiefly to the laying of parquet flooring in 1887 gottfrieds age is sevenandtwenty he is by virtue of his heritage of three languages modern languages master in a small private school in the south of england to the casual observer he is singularly like any other modern languages master in any other small private school his costume is neither very costly nor very fashionable but on the other hand it is not markedly cheap or shabby his complexion like his height and his bearing is inconspicuous you would notice perhaps that like the majority of people his face was not absolutely symmetrical his right eye a little larger than the left and his jaw a trifle heavier on the right side if you as an ordinary careless person were to bare his chest and feel his heart beating you would probably find it quite like the heart of anyone else but here you and the trained observer would part company if you found his heart quite ordinary the trained observer would find it quite otherwise and once the thing was pointed out to you you too would perceive the peculiarity easily enough it is that gottfrieds heart beats on the right side of his body  now that is not the only singularity of gottfrieds structure although it is the only one that would appeal to the untrained mind careful sounding of gottfrieds internal arrangements by a wellknown surgeon seems to point to the fact that all the other unsymmetrical parts of his body are similarly misplaced the right lobe of his liver is on the left side the left on his right while his lungs too are similarly contraposed what is still more singular unless gottfried is a consummate actor we must believe that his right hand has recently become his left since the occurrences we are about to consider as impartially as possible he has found the utmost difficulty in writing except from right to left across the paper with his left hand he cannot throw with his right hand he is perplexed at mealtimes between knife and fork and his ideas of the rule of the roadhe is a cyclistare still a dangerous confusion and there is not a scrap of evidence to show that before these occurrences gottfried was at all lefthanded  there is yet another wonderful fact in this preposterous business gottfried produces three photographs of himself you have him at the age of five or six thrusting fat legs at you from under a plaid frock and scowling in that photograph his left eye is a little larger than his right and his jaw is a trifle heavier on the left side this is the reverse of his present living condition the photograph of gottfried at fourteen seems to contradict these facts but that is because it is one of those cheap gem photographs that were then in vogue taken direct upon metal and therefore reversing things just as a lookingglass would the third photograph represents him at oneandtwenty and confirms the record of the others there seems here evidence of the strongest confirmatory character that gottfried has exchanged his left side for his right yet how a human being can be so changed short of a fantastic and pointless miracle it is exceedingly hard to suggest  in one way of course these facts might be explicable on the supposition that plattner has undertaken an elaborate mystification on the strength of his hearts displacement photographs may be faked and lefthandedness imitated but the character of the man does not lend itself to any such theory he is quiet practical unobtrusive and thoroughly sane from the nordau standpoint he likes beer and smokes moderately takes walking exercise daily and has a healthily high estimate of the value of his teaching he has a good but untrained tenor voice and takes a pleasure in singing airs of a popular and cheerful character he is fond but not morbidly fond of readingchiefly fiction pervaded with a vaguely pious optimismsleeps well and rarely dreams he is in fact the very last person to evolve a fantastic fable indeed so far from forcing this story upon the world he has been singularly reticent on the matter he meets enquirers with a certain engagingbashfulness is almost the word that disarms the most suspicious he seems genuinely ashamed that anything so unusual has occurred to him  it is to be regretted that plattners aversion to the idea of postmortem dissection may postpone perhaps for ever the positive proof that his entire body has had its left and right sides transposed upon that fact mainly the credibility of his story hangs there is no way of taking a man and moving him about in space as ordinary people understand space that will result in our changing his sides whatever you do his right is still his right his left his left you can do that with a perfectly thin and flat thing of course if you were to cut a figure out of paper any figure with a right and left side you could change its sides simply by lifting it up and turning it over but with a solid it is different mathematical theorists tell us that the only way in which the right and left sides of a solid body can be changed is by taking that body clean out of space as we know ittaking it out of ordinary existence that is and turning it somewhere outside space this is a little abstruse no doubt but anyone with any knowledge of mathematical theory will assure the reader of its truth to put the thing in technical language the curious inversion of plattners right and left sides is proof that he has moved out of our space into what is called the fourth dimension and that he has returned again to our world unless we choose to consider ourselves the victims of an elaborate and motiveless fabrication we are almost bound to believe that this has occurred  so much for the tangible facts we come now to the account of the phenomena that attended his temporary disappearance from the world it appears that in the sussexville proprietary school plattner not only discharged the duties of modern languages master but also taught chemistry commercial geography bookkeeping shorthand drawing and any other additional subject to which the changing fancies of the boys parents might direct attention he knew little or nothing of these various subjects but in secondary as distinguished from board or elementary schools knowledge in the teacher is very properly by no means so necessary as high moral character and gentlemanly tone in chemistry he was particularly deficient knowing he says nothing beyond the three gases whatever the three gases may be as however his pupils began by knowing nothing and derived all their information from him this caused him or anyone but little inconvenience for several terms then a little boy named whibble joined the school who had been educated it seems by some mischievous relative into an inquiring habit of mind this little boy followed plattners lessons with marked and sustained interest and in order to exhibit his zeal on the subject brought at various times substances for plattner to analyse plattner flattered by this evidence of his power of awakening interest and trusting to the boys ignorance analysed these and even made general statements as to their composition indeed he was so far stimulated by his pupil as to obtain a work upon analytical chemistry and study it during his supervision of the evenings preparation he was surprised to find chemistry quite an interesting subject  so far the story is absolutely commonplace but now the greenish powder comes upon the scene the source of that greenish powder seems unfortunately lost master whibble tells a tortuous story of finding it done up in a packet in a disused limekiln near the downs it would have been an excellent thing for plattner and possibly for master whibbles family if a match could have been applied to that powder there and then the young gentleman certainly did not bring it to school in a packet but in a common eightounce graduated medicine bottle plugged with masticated newspaper he gave it to plattner at the end of the afternoon school four boys had been detained after school prayers in order to complete some neglected tasks and plattner was supervising these in the small classroom in which the chemical teaching was conducted the appliances for the practical teaching of chemistry in the sussexville proprietary school as in most small schools in this country are characterised by a severe simplicity they are kept in a small cupboard standing in a recess and having about the same capacity as a common travelling trunk plattner being bored with his passive superintendence seems to have welcomed the intervention of whibble with his green powder as an agreeable diversion and unlocking this cupboard proceeded at once with his analytical experiments whibble sat luckily for himself at a safe distance regarding him the four malefactors feigning a profound absorption in their work watched him furtively with the keenest interest for even within the limits of the three gases plattners practical chemistry was i understand temerarious  they are practically unanimous in their account of plattners proceedings he poured a little of the green powder into a testtube and tried the substance with water hydrochloric acid nitric acid and sulphuric acid in succession getting no result he emptied out a little heapnearly half the bottleful in factupon a slate and tried a match he held the medicine bottle in his left hand the stuff began to smoke and melt and then exploded with deafening violence and a blinding flash  the five boys seeing the flash and being prepared for catastrophes ducked below their desks and were none of them seriously hurt the window was blown out into the playground and the blackboard on its easel was upset the slate was smashed to atoms some plaster fell from the ceiling no other damage was done to the school edifice or appliances and the boys at first seeing nothing of plattner fancied he was knocked down and lying out of their sight below the desks they jumped out of their places to go to his assistance and were amazed to find the space empty being still confused by the sudden violence of the report they hurried to the open door under the impression that he must have been hurt and have rushed out of the room but carson the foremost nearly collided in the doorway with the principal mr lidgett  mr lidgett is a corpulent excitable man with one eye the boys describe him as stumbling into the room mouthing some of those tempered expletives irritable schoolmasters accustom themselves to uselest worse befall wretched mumchancer he said wheres mr plattner the boys are agreed on the very words wobbler snivelling puppy and mumchancer are it seems among the ordinary small change of mr lidgetts scholastic commerce  wheres mr plattner that was a question that was to be repeated many times in the next few days it really seemed as though that frantic hyperbole blown to atoms had for once realised itself there was not a visible particle of plattner to be seen not a drop of blood nor a stitch of clothing to be found apparently he had been blown clean out of existence and left not a wrack behind not so much as would cover a sixpenny piece to quote a proverbial expression the evidence of his absolute disappearance as a consequence of that explosion is indubitable  it is not necessary to enlarge here upon the commotion excited in the sussexville proprietary school and in sussexville and elsewhere by this event it is quite possible indeed that some of the readers of these pages may recall the hearing of some remote and dying version of that excitement during the last summer holidays lidgett it would seem did everything in his power to suppress and minimise the story he instituted a penalty of twentyfive lines for any mention of plattners name among the boys and stated in the schoolroom that he was clearly aware of his assistants whereabouts he was afraid he explains that the possibility of an explosion happening in spite of the elaborate precautions taken to minimise the practical teaching of chemistry might injure the reputation of the school and so might any mysterious quality in plattners departure indeed he did everything in his power to make the occurrence seem as ordinary as possible in particular he crossexamined the five eyewitnesses of the occurrence so searchingly that they began to doubt the plain evidence of their senses but in spite of these efforts the tale in a magnified and distorted state made a nine days wonder in the district and several parents withdrew their sons on colourable pretexts not the least remarkable point in the matter is the fact that a large number of people in the neighbourhood dreamed singularly vivid dreams of plattner during the period of excitement before his return and that these dreams had a curious uniformity in almost all of them plattner was seen sometimes singly sometimes in company wandering about through a coruscating iridescence in all cases his face was pale and distressed and in some he gesticulated towards the dreamer one or two of the boys evidently under the influence of nightmare fancied that plattner approached them with remarkable swiftness and seemed to look closely into their very eyes others fled with plattner from the pursuit of vague and extraordinary creatures of a globular shape but all these fancies were forgotten in inquiries and speculations when on the wednesday next but one after the monday of the explosion plattner returned  the circumstances of his return were as singular as those of his departure so far as mr lidgetts somewhat choleric outline can be filled in from plattners hesitating statements it would appear that on wednesday evening towards the hour of sunset the former gentleman having dismissed evening preparation was engaged in his garden picking and eating strawberries a fruit of which he is inordinately fond it is a large oldfashioned garden secured from observation fortunately by a high and ivycovered redbrick wall just as he was stooping over a particularly prolific plant there was a flash in the air and a heavy thud and before he could look round some heavy body struck him violently from behind he was pitched forward crushing the strawberries he held in his hand and that so roughly that his silk hatmr lidgett adheres to the older ideas of scholastic costumewas driven violently down upon his forehead and almost over one eye this heavy missile which slid over him sideways and collapsed into a sitting posture among the strawberry plants proved to be our longlost mr gottfried plattner in an extremely dishevelled condition he was collarless and hatless his linen was dirty and there was blood upon his hands mr lidgett was so indignant and surprised that he remained on allfours and with his hat jammed down on his eye while he expostulated vehemently with plattner for his disrespectful and unaccountable conduct  this scarcely idyllic scene completes what i may call the exterior version of the plattner storyits exoteric aspect it is quite unnecessary to enter here into all the details of his dismissal by mr lidgett such details with the full names and dates and references will be found in the larger report of these occurrences that was laid before the society for the investigation of abnormal phenomena the singular transposition of plattners right and left sides was scarcely observed for the first day or so and then first in connection with his disposition to write from right to left across the blackboard he concealed rather than ostended this curious confirmatory circumstance as he considered it would unfavourably affect his prospects in a new situation the displacement of his heart was discovered some months after when he was having a tooth extracted under anaesthetics he then very unwillingly allowed a cursory surgical examination to be made of himself with a view to a brief account in the journal of anatomy that exhausts the statement of the material facts and we may now go on to consider plattners account of the matter  but first let us clearly differentiate between the preceding portion of this story and what is to follow all i have told thus far is established by such evidence as even a criminal lawyer would approve every one of the witnesses is still alive the reader if he have the leisure may hunt the lads out tomorrow or even brave the terrors of the redoubtable lidgett and crossexamine and trap and test to his hearts content gottfried plattner himself and his twisted heart and his three photographs are producible it may be taken as proved that he did disappear for nine days as the consequence of an explosion that he returned almost as violently under circumstances in their nature annoying to mr lidgett whatever the details of those circumstances may be and that he returned inverted just as a reflection returns from a mirror from the last fact as i have already stated it follows almost inevitably that plattner during those nine days must have been in some state of existence altogether out of space the evidence to these statements is indeed far stronger than that upon which most murderers are hanged but for his own particular account of where he had been with its confused explanations and wellnigh selfcontradictory details we have only mr gottfried plattners word i do not wish to discredit that but i must point outwhat so many writers upon obscure psychic phenomena fail to dothat we are passing here from the practically undeniable to that kind of matter which any reasonable man is entitled to believe or reject as he thinks proper the previous statements render it plausible its discordance with common experience tilts it towards the incredible i would prefer not to sway the beam of the readers judgment either way but simply to tell the story as plattner told it me  he gave me his narrative i may state at my house at chislehurst and so soon as he had left me that evening i went into my study and wrote down everything as i remembered it subsequently he was good enough to read over a typewritten copy so that its substantial correctness is undeniable  he states that at the moment of the explosion he distinctly thought he was killed he felt lifted off his feet and driven forcibly backward it is a curious fact for psychologists that he thought clearly during his backward flight and wondered whether he should hit the chemistry cupboard or the blackboard easel his heels struck ground and he staggered and fell heavily into a sitting position on something soft and firm for a moment the concussion stunned him he became aware at once of a vivid scent of singed hair and he seemed to hear the voice of lidgett asking for him you will understand that for a time his mind was greatly confused  at first he was under the impression that he was still standing in the classroom he perceived quite distinctly the surprise of the boys and the entry of mr lidgett he is quite positive upon that score he did not hear their remarks but that he ascribed to the deafening effect of the experiment things about him seemed curiously dark and faint but his mind explained that on the obvious but mistaken idea that the explosion had engendered a huge volume of dark smoke through the dimness the figures of lidgett and the boys moved as faint and silent as ghosts plattners face still tingled with the stinging heat of the flash he was he says all muddled his first definite thoughts seem to have been of his personal safety he thought he was perhaps blinded and deafened he felt his limbs and face in a gingerly manner then his perceptions grew clearer and he was astonished to miss the old familiar desks and other schoolroom furniture about him only dim uncertain grey shapes stood in the place of these then came a thing that made him shout aloud and awoke his stunned faculties to instant activity two of the boys gesticulating walked one after the other clean through him neither manifested the slightest consciousness of his presence it is difficult to imagine the sensation he felt they came against him he says with no more force than a wisp of mist  plattners first thought after that was that he was dead having been brought up with thoroughly sound views in these matters however he was a little surprised to find his body still about him his second conclusion was that he was not dead but that the others were that the explosion had destroyed the sussexville proprietary school and every soul in it except himself but that too was scarcely satisfactory he was thrown back upon astonished observation  everything about him was profoundly dark at first it seemed to have an altogether ebony blackness overhead was a black firmament the only touch of light in the scene was a faint greenish glow at the edge of the sky in one direction which threw into prominence a horizon of undulating black hills this i say was his impression at first as his eye grew accustomed to the darkness he began to distinguish a faint quality of differentiating greenish colour in the circumambient night against this background the furniture and occupants of the classroom it seems stood out like phosphorescent spectres faint and impalpable he extended his hand and thrust it without an effort through the wall of the room by the fireplace  he describes himself as making a strenuous effort to attract attention he shouted to lidgett and tried to seize the boys as they went to and fro he only desisted from these attempts when mrs lidgett whom he as an assistant master naturally disliked entered the room he says the sensation of being in the world and yet not a part of it was an extraordinarily disagreeable one he compared his feelings not inaptly to those of a cat watching a mouse through a window whenever he made a motion to communicate with the dim familiar world about him he found an invisible incomprehensible barrier preventing intercourse  he then turned his attention to his solid environment he found the medicine bottle still unbroken in his hand with the remainder of the green powder therein he put this in his pocket and began to feel about him apparently he was sitting on a boulder of rock covered with a velvety moss the dark country about him he was unable to see the faint misty picture of the schoolroom blotting it out but he had a feeling due perhaps to a cold wind that he was near the crest of a hill and that a steep valley fell away beneath his feet the green glow along the edge of the sky seemed to be growing in extent and intensity he stood up rubbing his eyes  it would seem that he made a few steps going steeply downhill and then stumbled nearly fell and sat down again upon a jagged mass of rock to watch the dawn he became aware that the world about him was absolutely silent it was as still as it was dark and though there was a cold wind blowing up the hillface the rustle of grass the soughing of the boughs that should have accompanied it were absent he could hear therefore if he could not see that the hillside upon which he stood was rocky and desolate the green grew brighter every moment and as it did so a faint transparent bloodred mingled with but did not mitigate the blackness of the sky overhead and the rocky desolations about him having regard to what follows i am inclined to think that that redness may have been an optical effect due to contrast something black fluttered momentarily against the livid yellowgreen of the lower sky and then the thin and penetrating voice of a bell rose out of the black gulf below him an oppressive expectation grew with the growing light  it is probable that an hour or more elapsed while he sat there the strange green light growing brighter every moment and spreading slowly in flamboyant fingers upward towards the zenith as it grew the spectral vision of our world became relatively or absolutely fainter probably both for the time must have been about that of our earthly sunset so far as his vision of our world went plattner by his few steps downhill had passed through the floor of the classroom and was now it seemed sitting in midair in the larger schoolroom downstairs he saw the boarders distinctly but much more faintly than he had seen lidgett they were preparing their evening tasks and he noticed with interest that several were cheating with their euclid riders by means of a crib a compilation whose existence he had hitherto never suspected as the time passed they faded steadily as steadily as the light of the green dawn increased  looking down into the valley he saw that the light had crept far down its rocky sides and that the profound blackness of the abyss was now broken by a minute green glow like the light of a glowworm and almost immediately the limb of a huge heavenly body of blazing green rose over the basaltic undulations of the distant hills and the monstrous hillmasses about him came out gaunt and desolate in green light and deep ruddy black shadows he became aware of a vast number of ballshaped objects drifting as thistledown drifts over the high ground there were none of these nearer to him than the opposite side of the gorge the bell below twanged quicker and quicker with something like impatient insistence and several lights moved hither and thither the boys at work at their desks were now almost imperceptibly faint  this extinction of our world when the green sun of this other universe rose is a curious point upon which plattner insists during the otherworld night it is difficult to move about on account of the vividness with which the things of this world are visible it becomes a riddle to explain why if this is the case we in this world catch no glimpse of the otherworld it is due perhaps to the comparatively vivid illumination of this world of ours plattner describes the midday of the otherworld at its brightest as not being nearly so bright as this world at full moon while its night is profoundly black consequently the amount of light even in an ordinary dark room is sufficient to render the things of the otherworld invisible on the same principle that faint phosphorescence is only visible in the profoundest darkness i have tried since he told me his story to see something of the otherworld by sitting for a long space in a photographers dark room at night i have certainly seen indistinctly the form of greenish slopes and rocks but only i must admit very indistinctly indeed the reader may possibly be more successful plattner tells me that since his return he has dreamt and seen and recognised places in the otherworld but this is probably due to his memory of these scenes it seems quite possible that people with unusually keen eyesight may occasionally catch a glimpse of this strange otherworld about us  however this is a digression as the green sun rose a long street of black buildings became perceptible though only darkly and indistinctly in the gorge and after some hesitation plattner began to clamber down the precipitous descent towards them the descent was long and exceedingly tedious being so not only by the extraordinary steepness but also by reason of the looseness of the boulders with which the whole face of the hill was strewn the noise of his descentnow and then his heels struck fire from the rocksseemed now the only sound in the universe for the beating of the bell had ceased as he drew nearer he perceived that the various edifices had a singular resemblance to tombs and mausoleums and monuments saving only that they were all uniformly black instead of being white as most sepulchres are and then he saw crowding out of the largest building very much as people disperse from church a number of pallid rounded palegreen figures these dispersed in several directions about the broad street of the place some going through side alleys and reappearing upon the steepness of the hill others entering some of the small black buildings which lined the way  at the sight of these things drifting up towards him plattner stopped staring they were not walking they were indeed limbless and they had the appearance of human heads beneath which a tadpolelike body swung he was too astonished at their strangeness too full indeed of strangeness to be seriously alarmed by them they drove towards him in front of the chill wind that was blowing uphill much as soapbubbles drive before a draught and as he looked at the nearest of those approaching he saw it was indeed a human head albeit with singularly large eyes and wearing such an expression of distress and anguish as he had never seen before upon mortal countenance he was surprised to find that it did not turn to regard him but seemed to be watching and following some unseen moving thing for a moment he was puzzled and then it occurred to him that this creature was watching with its enormous eyes something that was happening in the world he had just left nearer it came and nearer and he was too astonished to cry out it made a very faint fretting sound as it came close to him then it struck his face with a gentle patits touch was very coldand drove past him and upward towards the crest of the hill  an extraordinary conviction flashed across plattners mind that this head had a strong likeness to lidgett then he turned his attention to the other heads that were now swarming thickly up the hillside none made the slightest sign of recognition one or two indeed came close to his head and almost followed the example of the first but he dodged convulsively out of the way upon most of them he saw the same expression of unavailing regret he had seen upon the first and heard the same faint sounds of wretchedness from them one or two wept and one rolling swiftly uphill wore an expression of diabolical rage but others were cold and several had a look of gratified interest in their eyes one at least was almost in an ecstasy of happiness plattner does not remember that he recognised any more likenesses in those he saw at this time  for several hours perhaps plattner watched these strange things dispersing themselves over the hills and not till long after they had ceased to issue from the clustering black buildings in the gorge did he resume his downward climb the darkness about him increased so much that he had a difficulty in stepping true overhead the sky was now a bright pale green he felt neither hunger nor thirst later when he did he found a chilly stream running down the centre of the gorge and the rare moss upon the boulders when he tried it at last in desperation was good to eat  he groped about among the tombs that ran down the gorge seeking vaguely for some clue to these inexplicable things after a long time he came to the entrance of the big mausoleumlike building from which the heads had issued in this he found a group of green lights burning upon a kind of basaltic altar and a bellrope from a belfry overhead hanging down into the centre of the place round the wall ran a lettering of fire in a character unknown to him while he was still wondering at the purport of these things he heard the receding tramp of heavy feet echoing far down the street he ran out into the darkness again but he could see nothing he had a mind to pull the bellrope and finally decided to follow the footsteps but although he ran far he never overtook them and his shouting was of no avail the gorge seemed to extend an interminable distance it was as dark as earthly starlight throughout its length while the ghastly green day lay along the upper edge of its precipices there were none of the heads now below they were all it seemed busily occupied along the upper slopes looking up he saw them drifting hither and thither some hovering stationary some flying swiftly through the air it reminded him he said of big snowflakes only these were black and pale green  in pursuing the firm undeviating footsteps that he never overtook in groping into new regions of this endless devils dyke in clambering up and down the pitiless heights in wandering about the summits and in watching the drifting faces plattner states that he spent the better part of seven or eight days he did not keep count he says though once or twice he found eyes watching him he had word with no living soul he slept among the rocks on the hillside in the gorge things earthly were invisible because from the earthly standpoint it was far underground on the altitudes so soon as the earthly day began the world became visible to him he found himself sometimes stumbling over the dark green rocks or arresting himself on a precipitous brink while all about him the green branches of the sussexville lanes were swaying or again he seemed to be walking through the sussexville streets or watching unseen the private business of some household and then it was he discovered that to almost every human being in our world there pertained some of these drifting heads that everyone in the world is watched intermittently by these helpless disembodiments  what are theythese watchers of the living plattner never learned but two that presently found and followed him were like his childhoods memory of his father and mother now and then other faces turned their eyes upon him eyes like those of dead people who had swayed him or injured him or helped him in his youth and manhood whenever they looked at him plattner was overcome with a strange sense of responsibility to his mother he ventured to speak but she made no answer she looked sadly steadfastly and tenderlya little reproachfully too it seemedinto his eyes  he simply tells this story he does not endeavour to explain we are left to surmise who these watchers of the living may be or if they are indeed the dead why they should so closely and passionately watch a world they have left for ever it may beindeed to my mind it seems justthat when our life has closed when evil or good is no longer a choice for us we may still have to witness the working out of the train of consequences we have laid if human souls continue after death then surely human interests continue after death but that is merely my own guess at the meaning of the things seen plattner offers no interpretation for none was given him it is well the reader should understand this clearly day after day with his head reeling he wandered about this strange lit world outside the world weary and towards the end weak and hungry by dayby our earthly day that isthe ghostly vision of the old familiar scenery of sussexville all about him irked and worried him he could not see where to put his feet and ever and again with a chilly touch one of these watching souls would come against his face and after dark the multitude of these watchers about him and their intent distress confused his mind beyond describing a great longing to return to the earthly life that was so near and yet so remote consumed him the unearthliness of things about him produced a positively painful mental distress he was worried beyond describing by his own particular followers he would shout at them to desist from staring at him scold at them hurry away from them they were always mute and intent run as he might over the uneven ground they followed his destinies  on the ninth day towards evening plattner heard the invisible footsteps approaching far away down the gorge he was then wandering over the broad crest of the same hill upon which he had fallen in his entry into this strange otherworld of his he turned to hurry down into the gorge feeling his way hastily and was arrested by the sight of the thing that was happening in a room in a back street near the school both of the people in the room he knew by sight the windows were open the blinds up and the setting sun shone clearly into it so that it came out quite brightly at first a vivid oblong of room lying like a magiclantern picture upon the black landscape and the livid green dawn in addition to the sunlight a candle had just been lit in the room  on the bed lay a lank man his ghastly white face terrible upon the tumbled pillow his clenched hands were raised above his head a little table beside the bed carried a few medicine bottles some toast and water and an empty glass every now and then the lank mans lips fell apart to indicate a word he could not articulate but the woman did not notice that he wanted anything because she was busy turning out papers from an oldfashioned bureau in the opposite corner of the room at first the picture was very vivid indeed but as the green dawn behind it grew brighter and brighter so it became fainter and more and more transparent  as the echoing footsteps paced nearer and nearer those footsteps that sound so loud in that otherworld and come so silently in this plattner perceived about him a great multitude of dim faces gathering together out of the darkness and watching the two people in the room never before had he seen so many of the watchers of the living a multitude had eyes only for the sufferer in the room another multitude in infinite anguish watched the woman as she hunted with greedy eyes for something she could not find they crowded about plattner they came across his sight and buffeted his face the noise of their unavailing regrets was all about him he saw clearly only now and then at other times the picture quivered dimly through the veil of green reflections upon their movements in the room it must have been very still and plattner says the candle flame streamed up into a perfectly vertical line of smoke but in his ears each footfall and its echoes beat like a clap of thunder and the faces two more particularly near the womans one a womans also white and clearfeatured a face which might have once been cold and hard but which was now softened by the touch of a wisdom strange to earth the other might have been the womans father both were evidently absorbed in the contemplation of some act of hateful meanness so it seemed which they could no longer guard against and prevent behind were others teachers it may be who had taught ill friends whose influence had failed and over the man tooa multitude but none that seemed to be parents or teachers faces that might once have been coarse now purged to strength by sorrow and in the forefront one face a girlish one neither angry nor remorseful but merely patient and weary and as it seemed to plattner waiting for relief his powers of description fail him at the memory of this multitude of ghastly countenances they gathered on the stroke of the bell he saw them all in the space of a second it would seem that he was so worked on by his excitement that quite involuntarily his restless fingers took the bottle of green powder out of his pocket and held it before him but he does not remember that  abruptly the footsteps ceased he waited for the next and there was silence and then suddenly cutting through the unexpected stillness like a keen thin blade came the first stroke of the bell at that the multitudinous faces swayed to and fro and a louder crying began all about him the woman did not hear she was burning something now in the candle flame at the second stroke everything grew dim and a breath of wind icy cold blew through the host of watchers they swirled about him like an eddy of dead leaves in the spring and at the third stroke something was extended through them to the bed you have heard of a beam of light this was like a beam of darkness and looking again at it plattner saw that it was a shadowy arm and hand  the green sun was now topping the black desolations of the horizon and the vision of the room was very faint plattner could see that the white of the bed struggled and was convulsed and that the woman looked round over her shoulder at it startled  the cloud of watchers lifted high like a puff of green dust before the wind and swept swiftly downward towards the temple in the gorge then suddenly plattner understood the meaning of the shadowy black arm that stretched across his shoulder and clutched its prey he did not dare turn his head to see the shadow behind the arm with a violent effort and covering his eyes he set himself to run made perhaps twenty strides then slipped on a boulder and fell he fell forward on his hands and the bottle smashed and exploded as he touched the ground  in another moment he found himself stunned and bleeding sitting face to face with lidgett in the old walled garden behind the school                                       there the story of plattners experiences ends i have resisted i believe successfully the natural disposition of a writer of fiction to dress up incidents of this sort i have told the thing as far as possible in the order in which plattner told it to me i have carefully avoided any attempt at style effect or construction it would have been easy for instance to have worked the scene of the deathbed into a kind of plot in which plattner might have been involved but quite apart from the objectionableness of falsifying a most extraordinary true story any such trite devices would spoil to my mind the peculiar effect of this dark world with its livid green illumination and its drifting watchers of the living which unseen and unapproachable to us is yet lying all about us  it remains to add that a death did actually occur in vincent terrace just beyond the school garden and so far as can be proved at the moment of plattners return deceased was a ratecollector and insurance agent his widow who was much younger than himself married last month a mr whymper a veterinary surgeon of allbeeding as the portion of this story given here has in various forms circulated orally in sussexville she has consented to my use of her name on condition that i make it distinctly known that she emphatically contradicts every detail of plattners account of her husbands last moments she burnt no will she says although plattner never accused her of doing so her husband made but one will and that just after their marriage certainly from a man who had never seen it plattners account of the furniture of the room was curiously accurate  one other thing even at the risk of an irksome repetition i must insist upon lest i seem to favour the credulous superstitious view plattners absence from the world for nine days is i think proved but that does not prove his story it is quite conceivable that even outside space hallucinations may be possible that at least the reader must bear distinctly in mind      xvi    the red room   i can assure you said i that it will take a very tangible ghost to frighten me and i stood up before the fire with my glass in my hand  it is your own choosing said the man with the withered arm and glanced at me askance  eightandtwenty years said i i have lived and never a ghost have i seen as yet  the old woman sat staring hard into the fire her pale eyes wide open ay she broke in and eightandtwenty years you have lived and never seen the likes of this house i reckon theres a many things to see when ones still but eightandtwenty she swayed her head slowly from side to side a many things to see and sorrow for  i half suspected the old people were trying to enhance the spiritual terrors of their house by their droning insistence i put down my empty glass on the table and looked about the room and caught a glimpse of myself abbreviated and broadened to an impossible sturdiness in the queer old mirror at the end of the room well i said if i see anything tonight i shall be so much the wiser for i come to the business with an open mind  its your own choosing said the man with the withered arm once more  i heard the sound of a stick and a shambling step on the flags in the passage outside and the door creaked on its hinges as a second old man entered more bent more wrinkled more aged even than the first he supported himself by a single crutch his eyes were covered by a shade and his lower lip half averted hung pale and pink from his decaying yellow teeth he made straight for an armchair on the opposite side of the table sat down clumsily and began to cough the man with the withered arm gave this newcomer a short glance of positive dislike the old woman took no notice of his arrival but remained with her eyes fixed steadily on the fire  i saidits your own choosing said the man with the withered arm when the coughing had ceased for a while  its my own choosing i answered  the man with the shade became aware of my presence for the first time and threw his head back for a moment and sideways to see me i caught a momentary glimpse of his eyes small and bright and inflamed then he began to cough and splutter again  why dont you drink said the man with the withered arm pushing the beer towards him the man with the shade poured out a glassful with a shaky hand that splashed half as much again on the deal table a monstrous shadow of him crouched upon the wall and mocked his action as he poured and drank i must confess i had scarce expected these grotesque custodians there is to my mind something inhuman in senility something crouching and atavistic the human qualities seem to drop from old people insensibly day by day the three of them made me feel uncomfortable with their gaunt silences their bent carriage their evident unfriendliness to me and to one another  if said i you will show me to this haunted room of yours i will make myself comfortable there  the old man with the cough jerked his head back so suddenly that it startled me and shot another glance of his red eyes at me from under the shade but no one answered me i waited a minute glancing from one to the other  if i said a little louder if you will show me to this haunted room of yours i will relieve you from the task of entertaining me  theres a candle on the slab outside the door said the man with the withered arm looking at my feet as he addressed me but if you go to the red room tonight  this night of all nights said the old woman  you go alone  very well i answered and which way do i go  you go along the passage for a bit said he until you come to a door and through that is a spiral staircase and halfway up that is a landing and another door covered with baize go through that and down the long corridor to the end and the red room is on your left up the steps  have i got that right i said and repeated his directions he corrected me in one particular  and are you really going said the man with the shade looking at me again for the third time with that queer unnatural tilting of the face  this night of all nights said the old woman  it is what i came for i said and moved towards the door as i did so the old man with the shade rose and staggered round the table so as to be closer to the others and to the fire at the door i turned and looked at them and saw they were all close together dark against the firelight staring at me over their shoulders with an intent expression on their ancient faces  goodnight i said setting the door open  its your own choosing said the man with the withered arm  i left the door wide open until the candle was well alight and then i shut them in and walked down the chilly echoing passage  i must confess that the oddness of these three old pensioners in whose charge her ladyship had left the castle and the deeptoned oldfashioned furniture of the housekeepers room in which they foregathered affected me in spite of my efforts to keep myself at a matteroffact phase they seemed to belong to another age an older age an age when things spiritual were different from this of ours less certain an age when omens and witches were credible and ghosts beyond denying their very existence was spectral the cut of their clothing fashions born in dead brains the ornaments and conveniences of the room about them were ghostlythe thoughts of vanished men which still haunted rather than participated in the world of today but with an effort i sent such thoughts to the rightabout the long draughty subterranean passage was chilly and dusty and my candle flared and made the shadows cower and quiver the echoes rang up and down the spiral staircase and a shadow came sweeping up after me and one fled before me into the darkness overhead i came to the landing and stopped there for a moment listening to a rustling that i fancied i heard then satisfied of the absolute silence i pushed open the baizecovered door and stood in the corridor  the effect was scarcely what i expected for the moonlight coming in by the great window on the grand staircase picked out everything in vivid black shadow or silvery illumination everything was in its place the house might have been deserted on the yesterday instead of eighteen months ago there were candles in the sockets of the sconces and whatever dust had gathered on the carpets or upon the polished flooring was distributed so evenly as to be invisible in the moonlight i was about to advance and stopped abruptly a bronze group stood upon the landing hidden from me by the corner of the wall but its shadow fell with marvellous distinctness upon the white panelling and gave me the impression of someone crouching to waylay me i stood rigid for half a minute perhaps then with my hand in the pocket that held my revolver i advanced only to discover a ganymede and eagle glistening in the moonlight that incident for a time restored my nerve and a porcelain chinaman on a buhl table whose head rocked silently as i passed him scarcely startled me  the door to the red room and the steps up to it were in a shadowy corner i moved my candle from side to side in order to see clearly the nature of the recess in which i stood before opening the door here it was thought i that my predecessor was found and the memory of that story gave me a sudden twinge of apprehension i glanced over my shoulder at the ganymede in the moonlight and opened the door of the red room rather hastily with my face half turned to the pallid silence of the landing  i entered closed the door behind me at once turned the key i found in the lock within and stood with the candle held aloft surveying the scene of my vigil the great red room of lorraine castle in which the young duke had died or rather in which he had begun his dying for he had opened the door and fallen headlong down the steps i had just ascended that had been the end of his vigil of his gallant attempt to conquer the ghostly tradition of the place and never i thought had apoplexy better served the ends of superstition and there were other and older stories that clung to the room back to the halfcredible beginning of it all the tale of a timid wife and the tragic end that came to her husbands jest of frightening her and looking around that large sombre room with its shadowy window bays its recesses and alcoves one could well understand the legends that had sprouted in its black corners its germinating darkness my candle was a little tongue of light in its vastness that failed to pierce the opposite end of the room and left an ocean of mystery and suggestion beyond its island of light  i resolved to make a systematic examination of the place at once and dispel the fanciful suggestions of its obscurity before they obtained a hold upon me after satisfying myself of the fastening of the door i began to walk about the room peering round each article of furniture tucking up the valances of the bed and opening its curtains wide i pulled up the blinds and examined the fastenings of the several windows before closing the shutters leant forward and looked up the blackness of the wide chimney and tapped the dark oak panelling for any secret opening there were two big mirrors in the room each with a pair of sconces bearing candles and on the mantelshelf too were more candles in china candlesticks all these i lit one after the other the fire was laid an unexpected consideration from the old housekeeperand i lit it to keep down any disposition to shiver and when it was burning well i stood round with my back to it and regarded the room again i had pulled up a chintzcovered armchair and a table to form a kind of barricade before me and on this lay my revolver ready to hand my precise examination had done me good but i still found the remoter darkness of the place and its perfect stillness too stimulating for the imagination the echoing of the stir and crackling of the fire was no sort of comfort to me the shadow in the alcove at the end in particular had that undefinable quality of a presence that odd suggestion of a lurking living thing that comes so easily in silence and solitude at last to reassure myself i walked with a candle into it and satisfied myself that there was nothing tangible there i stood that candle upon the floor of the alcove and left it in that position  by this time i was in a state of considerable nervous tension although to my reason there was no adequate cause for the condition my mind however was perfectly clear i postulated quite unreservedly that nothing supernatural could happen and to pass the time i began to string some rhymes together ingoldsby fashion of the original legend of the place a few i spoke aloud but the echoes were not pleasant for the same reason i also abandoned after a time a conversation with myself upon the impossibility of ghosts and haunting my mind reverted to the three old and distorted people downstairs and i tried to keep it upon that topic the sombre reds and blacks of the room troubled me even with seven candles the place was merely dim the one in the alcove flared in a draught and the fireflickering kept the shadows and penumbra perpetually shifting and stirring casting about for a remedy i recalled the candles i had seen in the passage and with a slight effort walked out into the moonlight carrying a candle and leaving the door open and presently returned with as many as ten these i put in various knickknacks of china with which the room was sparsely adorned lit and placed where the shadows had lain deepest some on the floor some in the window recesses until at last my seventeen candles were so arranged that not an inch of the room but had the direct light of at least one of them it occurred to me that when the ghost came i could warn him not to trip over them the room was now quite brightly illuminated there was something very cheery and reassuring in these little streaming flames and snuffing them gave me an occupation and afforded a helpful sense of the passage of time even with that however the brooding expectation of the vigil weighed heavily upon me it was after midnight that the candle in the alcove suddenly went out and the black shadow sprang back to its place there i did not see the candle go out i simply turned and saw that the darkness was there as one might start and see the unexpected presence of a stranger by jove said i aloud that draughts a strong one and taking the matches from the table i walked across the room in a leisurely manner to relight the corner again my first match would not strike and as i succeeded with the second something seemed to blink on the wall before me i turned my head involuntarily and saw that the two candles on the little table by the fireplace were extinguished i rose at once to my feet  odd i said did i do that myself in a flash of absentmindedness  i walked back relit one and as i did so i saw the candle in the right sconce of one of the mirrors wink and go right out and almost immediately its companion followed it there was no mistake about it the flame vanished as if the wicks had been suddenly nipped between a finger and a thumb leaving the wick neither glowing nor smoking but black while i stood gaping the candle at the foot of the bed went out and the shadows seemed to take another step towards me  this wont do said i and first one and then another candle on the mantelshelf followed  whats up i cried with a queer high note getting into my voice somehow at that the candle on the wardrobe went out and the one i had relit in the alcove followed  steady on i said these candles are wanted speaking with a halfhysterical facetiousness and scratching away at a match the while for the mantel candlesticks my hands trembled so much that twice i missed the rough paper of the matchbox as the mantel emerged from darkness again two candles in the remoter end of the window were eclipsed but with the same match i also relit the larger mirror candles and those on the floor near the doorway so that for the moment i seemed to gain on the extinctions but then in a volley there vanished four lights at once in different corners of the room and i struck another match in quivering haste and stood hesitating whither to take it  as i stood undecided an invisible hand seemed to sweep out the two candles on the table with a cry of terror i dashed at the alcove then into the corner and then into the window relighting three as two more vanished by the fireplace then perceiving a better way i dropped the matches on the ironbound deedbox in the corner and caught up the bedroom candlestick with this i avoided the delay of striking matches but for all that the steady process of extinction went on and the shadows i feared and fought against returned and crept in upon me first a step gained on this side of me and then on that it was like a ragged stormcloud sweeping out the stars now and then one returned for a minute and was lost again i was now almost frantic with the horror of the coming darkness and my selfpossession deserted me i leaped panting and dishevelled from candle to candle in a vain struggle against that remorseless advance  i bruised myself on the thigh against the table i sent a chair headlong i stumbled and fell and whisked the cloth from the table in my fall my candle rolled away from me and i snatched another as i rose abruptly this was blown out as i swung it off the table by the wind of my sudden movement and immediately the two remaining candles followed but there was light still in the room a red light that staved off the shadows from me the fire of course i could still thrust my candle between the bars and relight it  i turned to where the flames were still dancing between the glowing coals and splashing red reflections upon the furniture made two steps towards the grate and incontinently the flames dwindled and vanished the glow vanished the reflections rushed together and vanished and as i thrust the candle between the bars darkness closed upon me like the shutting of an eye wrapped about me in a stifling embrace sealed my vision and crushed the last vestiges of reason from my brain the candle fell from my hand i flung out my arms in a vain effort to thrust that ponderous blackness away from me and lifting up my voice screamed with all my mightonce twice thrice then i think i must have staggered to my feet i know i thought suddenly of the moonlit corridor and with my head bowed and my arms over my face made a run for the door  but i had forgotten the exact position of the door and struck myself heavily against the corner of the bed i staggered back turned and was either struck or struck myself against some other bulky furniture i have a vague memory of battering myself thus to and fro in the darkness of a cramped struggle and of my own wild crying as i darted to and fro of a heavy blow at last upon my forehead a horrible sensation of falling that lasted an age of my last frantic effort to keep my footing and then i remember no more  i opened my eyes in daylight my head was roughly bandaged and the man with the withered arm was watching my face i looked about me trying to remember what had happened and for a space i could not recollect i rolled my eyes into the corner and saw the old woman no longer abstracted pouring out some drops of medicine from a little blue phial into a glass where am i i asked i seem to remember you and yet i cannot remember who you are  they told me then and i heard of the haunted red room as one who hears a tale we found you at dawn said he and there was blood on your forehead and lips  it was very slowly i recovered my memory of my experience you believe now said the old man that the room is haunted he spoke no longer as one who greets an intruder but as one who grieves for a broken friend  yes said i the room is haunted  and you have seen it and we who have lived here all our lives have never set eyes upon it because we have never dared tell us is it truly the old earl who  no said i it is not  i told you so said the old lady with the glass in her hand it is his poor young countess who was frightened  it is not i said there is neither ghost of earl nor ghost of countess in that room there is no ghost there at all but worse far worse  well they said  the worst of all the things that haunt poor mortal man said i and that is in all its nakednessfear that will not have light nor sound that will not bear with reason that deafens and darkens and overwhelms it followed me through the corridor it fought against me in the room  i stopped abruptly there was an interval of silence my hand went up to my bandages  then the man with the shade sighed and spoke that is it said he i knew that was it a power of darkness to put such a curse upon a woman it lurks there always you can feel it even in the daytime even of a bright summers day in the hangings in the curtains keeping behind you however you face about in the dusk it creeps along the corridor and follows you so that you dare not turn there is fear in that room of hersblack fear and there will beso long as this house of sin endures       xvii    the purple pileus   mr coombes was sick of life he walked away from his unhappy home and sick not only of his own existence but of everybody elses turned aside down gaswork lane to avoid the town and crossing the wooden bridge that goes over the canal to starlings cottages was presently alone in the damp pine woods and out of sight and sound of human habitation he would stand it no longer he repeated aloud with blasphemies unusual to him that he would stand it no longer  he was a palefaced little man with dark eyes and a fine and very black moustache he had a very stiff upright collar slightly frayed that gave him an illusory double chin and his overcoat albeit shabby was trimmed with astrachan his gloves were a bright brown with black stripes over the knuckles and split at the finger ends his appearance his wife had said once in the dear dead days beyond recallbefore he married her that iswas military but now she called himit seems a dreadful thing to tell of between husband and wife but she called him a little grub it wasnt the only thing she had called him either  the row had arisen about that beastly jennie again jennie was his wifes friend and by no invitation of mr coombes she came in every blessed sunday to dinner and made a shindy all the afternoon she was a big noisy girl with a taste for loud colours and a strident laugh and this sunday she had outdone all her previous intrusions by bringing in a fellow with her a chap as showy as herself and mr coombes in a starchy clean collar and his sunday frockcoat had sat dumb and wrathful at his own table while his wife and her guests talked foolishly and undesirably and laughed aloud well he stood that and after dinner which as usual was late what must miss jennie do but go to the piano and play banjo tunes for all the world as if it were a weekday flesh and blood could not endure such goings on they would hear next door they would hear in the road it was a public announcement of their disrepute he had to speak  he had felt himself go pale and a kind of rigour had affected his respiration as he delivered himself he had been sitting on one of the chairs by the windowthe new guest had taken possession of the armchair he turned his head sun day he said over the collar in the voice of one who warns sun day what people call a nasty tone it was  jennie had kept on playing but his wife who was looking through some music that was piled on the top of the piano had stared at him whats wrong now she said cant people enjoy themselves  i dont mind rational njoyment at all said little coombes but i aint agoing to have weekday tunes playing on a sunday in this house  whats wrong with my playing now said jennie stopping and twirling round on the musicstool with a monstrous rustle of flounces  coombes saw it was going to be a row and opened too vigorously as is common with your timid nervous men all the world over steady on with that musicstool said he it aint made for eavyweights  never you mind about weights said jennie incensed what was you saying behind my back about my playing  surely you dont old with not having a bit of music on a sunday mr coombes said the new guest leaning back in the armchair blowing a cloud of cigarette smoke and smiling in a kind of pitying way and simultaneously his wife said something to jennie about never mind im you go on jinny  i do said mr coombes addressing the new guest  may i arst why said the new guest evidently enjoying both his cigarette and the prospect of an argument he was bytheby a lank young man very stylishly dressed in bright drab with a white cravat and a pearl and silver pin it had been better taste to come in a black coat mr coombes thought  because began mr coombes it dont suit me im a business man i ave to study my connection rational njoyment  his connection said mrs coombes scornfully thats what hes always asaying we got to do this and we got to do that  if you dont mean to study my connection said mr coombes what did you marry me for  i wonder said jennie and turned back to the piano  i never saw such a man as you said mrs coombes  youve altered all round since we were married before  then jennie began at the turn turn turn again  look here said mr coombes driven at last to revolt standing up and raising his voice i tell you i wont have that the frockcoat heaved with his indignation  no vilence now said the long young man in drab sitting up  who the juice are you said mr coombes fiercely  whereupon they all began talking at once the new guest said he was jennies intended and meant to protect her and mr coombes said he was welcome to do so anywhere but in his mr coombes house and mrs coombes said he ought to be ashamed of insulting his guests and as i have already mentioned that he was getting a regular little grub and the end was that mr coombes ordered his visitors out of the house and they wouldnt go and so he said he would go himself with his face burning and tears of excitement in his eyes he went into the passage and as he struggled with his overcoathis frockcoat sleeves got concertinaed up his armand gave a brush at his silk hat jennie began again at the piano and strummed him insultingly out of the house turn turn turn he slammed the shop door so that the house quivered that briefly was the immediate making of his mood you will perhaps begin to understand his disgust with existence  as he walked along the muddy path under the firsit was late october and the ditches and heaps of fir needles were gorgeous with clumps of fungihe recapitulated the melancholy history of his marriage it was brief and commonplace enough he now perceived with sufficient clearness that his wife had married him out of a natural curiosity and in order to escape from her worrying laborious and uncertain life in the workroom and like the majority of her class she was far too stupid to realise that it was her duty to cooperate with him in his business she was greedy of enjoyment loquacious and sociallyminded and evidently disappointed to find the restraints of poverty still hanging about her his worries exasperated her and the slightest attempt to control her proceedings resulted in a charge of grumbling why couldnt he be nice as he used to be and coombes was such a harmless little man too nourished mentally on selfhelp and with a meagre ambition of selfdenial and competition that was to end in a sufficiency then jennie came in as a female mephistopheles a gabbling chronicle of fellers and was always wanting his wife to go to theatres and all that and in addition were aunts of his wife and cousins male and female to eat up capital insult him personally upset business arrangements annoy good customers and generally blight his life it was not the first occasion by many that mr coombes had fled his home in wrath and indignation and something like fear vowing furiously and even aloud that he wouldnt stand it and so frothing away his energy along the line of least resistance but never before had he been quite so sick of life as on this particular sunday afternoon the sunday dinner may have had its share in his despairand the greyness of the sky perhaps too he was beginning to realise his unendurable frustration as a business man as the consequence of his marriage presently bankruptcy and after that perhaps she might have reason to repent when it was too late and destiny as i have already intimated had planted the path through the wood with evilsmelling fungi thickly and variously planted it not only on the right side but on the left  a small shopman is in such a melancholy position if his wife turns out a disloyal partner his capital is all tied up in his business and to leave her means to join the unemployed in some strange part of the earth the luxuries of divorce are beyond him altogether so that the good old tradition of marriage for better or worse holds inexorably for him and things work up to tragic culminations bricklayers kick their wives to death and dukes betray theirs but it is among the small clerks and shopkeepers nowadays that it comes most often to a cutting of throats under the circumstances it is not so very remarkableand you must take it as charitably as you canthat the mind of mr coombes ran for a while on some such glorious close to his disappointed hopes and that he thought of razors pistols breadknives and touching letters to the coroner denouncing his enemies by name and praying piously for forgiveness after a time his fierceness gave way to melancholia he had been married in this very overcoat in his first and only frockcoat that was buttoned up beneath it he began to recall their courting along this very walk his years of penurious saving to get capital and the bright hopefulness of his marrying days for it all to work out like this was there no sympathetic ruler anywhere in the world he reverted to death as a topic  he thought of the canal he had just crossed and doubted whether he shouldnt stand with his head out even in the middle and it was while drowning was in his mind that the purple pileus caught his eye he looked at it mechanically for a moment and stopped and stooped towards it to pick it up under the impression that it was some such small leather object as a purse then he saw that it was the purple top of a fungus a peculiarly poisonouslooking purple slimy shiny and emitting a sour odour he hesitated with his hand an inch or so from it and the thought of poison crossed his mind with that he picked the thing and stood up again with it in his hand  the odour was certainly strongacrid but by no means disgusting he broke off a piece and the fresh surface was a creamy white that changed like magic in the space of ten seconds to a yellowishgreen colour it was even an invitinglooking change he broke off two other pieces to see it repeated they were wonderful things these fungi thought mr coombes and all of them the deadliest poisons as his father had often told him deadly poisons  there is no time like the present for a rash resolve why not here and now thought mr coombes he tasted a little piece a very little piece indeeda mere crumb it was so pungent that he almost spat it out again then merely hot and fullflavoured a kind of german mustard with a touch of horseradish andwell mushroom he swallowed it in the excitement of the moment did he like it or did he not his mind was curiously careless he would try another bit it really wasnt badit was good he forgot his troubles in the interest of the immediate moment playing with death it was he took another bite and then deliberately finished a mouthful a curious tingling sensation began in his fingertips and toes his pulse began to move faster the blood in his ears sounded like a millrace try bi more said mr coombes he turned and looked about him and found his feet unsteady he saw and struggled towards a little patch of purple a dozen yards away jol goo stuff said mr coombes elomore ye he pitched forward and fell on his face his hands outstretched towards the cluster of pilei but he did not eat any more of them he forgot forthwith  he rolled over and sat up with a look of astonishment on his face his carefully brushed silk hat had rolled away towards the ditch he pressed his hand to his brow something had happened but he could not rightly determine what it was anyhow he was no longer dullhe felt bright cheerful and his throat was afire he laughed in the sudden gaiety of his heart had he been dull he did not know but at any rate he would be dull no longer he got up and stood unsteadily regarding the universe with an agreeable smile he began to remember he could not remember very well because of a steam roundabout that was beginning in his head and he knew he had been disagreeable at home just because they wanted to be happy they were quite right life should be as gay as possible he would go home and make it up and reassure them and why not take some of this delightful toadstool with him for them to eat a hatful no less some of those red ones with white spots as well and a few yellow he had been a dull dog an enemy to merriment he would make up for it it would be gay to turn his coatsleeves inside out and stick some yellow gorse into his waistcoat pockets then homesingingfor a jolly evening  after the departure of mr coombes jennie discontinued playing and turned round on the musicstool again what a fuss about nothing said jennie  you see mr clarence what ive got to put up with said mrs coombes  he is a bit hasty said mr clarence judicially  he aint got the slightest sense of our position said mrs coombes thats what i complain of he cares for nothing but his old shop and if i have a bit of company or buy anything to keep myself decent or get any little thing i want out of the housekeeping money theres disagreeables economy he says struggle for life and all that he lies awake of nights about it worrying how he can screw me out of a shilling he wanted us to eat dorset butter once if once i was to give in to himthere  of course said jennie  if a man values a woman said mr clarence lounging back in the armchair he must be prepared to make sacrifices for her for my own part said mr clarence with his eye on jennie i shouldnt think of marrying till i was in a position to do the thing in style its downright selfishness a man ought to go through the roughandtumble by himself and not drag her  i dont agree altogether with that said jennie i dont see why a man shouldnt have a womans help provided he doesnt treat her meanly you know its meanness  you wouldnt believe said mrs coombes but i was a fool to ave im i might ave known if it adnt been for my father we shouldnt ave ad not a carriage to our wedding  lord he didnt stick out at that said mr clarence quite shocked  said he wanted the money for his stock or some such rubbish why he wouldnt have a woman in to help me once a week if it wasnt for my standing out plucky and the fusses he makes about moneycomes to me well pretty near crying with sheets of paper and figgers if only we can tide over this year he says the business is bound to go if only we can tide over this year i says then itll be if only we can tide over next year i know you i says and you dont catch me screwing myself lean and ugly why didnt you marry a slavey i says if you wanted oneinstead of a respectable girl i says  so mrs coombes but we will not follow this unedifying conversation further suffice it that mr coombes was very satisfactorily disposed of and they had a snug little time round the fire then mrs coombes went to get the tea and jennie sat coquettishly on the arm of mr clarences chair until the teathings clattered outside what was that i heard asked mrs coombes playfully as she entered and there was badinage about kissing they were just sitting down to the little circular table when the first intimation of mr coombes return was heard  this was a fumbling at the latch of the front door  eres my lord said mrs coombes went out like a lion and comes back like a lamb ill lay  something fell over in the shop a chair it sounded like then there was a sound as of some complicated step exercise in the passage then the door opened and coombes appeared but it was coombes transfigured the immaculate collar had been torn carelessly from his throat his carefullybrushed silk hat halffull of a crush of fungi was under one arm his coat was inside out and his waistcoat adorned with bunches of yellowblossomed furze these little eccentricities of sunday costume however were quite overshadowed by the change in his face it was livid white his eyes were unnaturally large and bright and his pale blue lips were drawn back in a cheerless grin merry he said he had stopped dancing to open the door rational njoyment dance he made three fantastic steps into the room and stood bowing  jim shrieked mrs coombes and mr clarence sat petrified with a dropping lower jaw  tea said mr coombes jol thing tea tosestools too brosher  hes drunk said jennie in a weak voice never before had she seen this intense pallor in a drunken man or such shining dilated eyes  mr coombes held out a handful of scarlet agaric to mr clarence jo stuff said he ta some  at that moment he was genial then at the sight of their startled faces he changed with the swift transition of insanity into overbearing fury and it seemed as if he had suddenly recalled the quarrel of his departure in such a huge voice as mrs coombes had never heard before he shouted my house im master ere eat what i give yer he bawled this as it seemed without an effort without a violent gesture standing there as motionless as one who whispers holding out a handful of fungus  clarence approved himself a coward he could not meet the mad fury in coombes eyes he rose to his feet pushing back his chair and turned stooping at that coombes rushed at him jennie saw her opportunity and with the ghost of a shriek made for the door  mrs coombes followed her clarence tried to dodge over went the teatable with a smash as coombes clutched him by the collar and tried to thrust the fungus into his mouth clarence was content to leave his collar behind him and shot out into the passage with red patches of fly agaric still adherent to his face shut im in cried mrs coombes and would have closed the door but her supports deserted her jennie saw the shop door open and vanished thereby locking it behind her while clarence went on hastily into the kitchen mr coombes came heavily against the door and mrs coombes finding the key was inside fled upstairs and locked herself in the spare bedroom  so the new convert to joie de vivre emerged upon the passage his decorations a little scattered but that respectable hatful of fungi still under his arm he hesitated at the three ways and decided on the kitchen whereupon clarence who was fumbling with the key gave up the attempt to imprison his host and fled into the scullery only to be captured before he could open the door into the yard mr clarence is singularly reticent of the details of what occurred it seems that mr coombes transitory irritation had vanished again and he was once more a genial playfellow and as there were knives and meat choppers about clarence very generously resolved to humour him and so avoid anything tragic it is beyond dispute that mr coombes played with mr clarence to his hearts content they could not have been more playful and familiar if they had known each other for years he insisted gaily on clarence trying the fungi and after a friendly tussle was smitten with remorse at the mess he was making of his guests face it also appears that clarence was dragged under the sink and his face scrubbed with the blacking brushhe being still resolved to humour the lunatic at any costand that finally in a somewhat dishevelled chipped and discoloured condition he was assisted to his coat and shown out by the back door the shopway being barred by jennie mr coombes wandering thoughts then turned to jennie jennie had been unable to unfasten the shop door but she shot the bolts against mr coombes latchkey and remained in possession of the shop for the rest of the evening  it would appear that mr coombes then returned to the kitchen still in pursuit of gaiety and albeit a strict good templar drank or spilt down the front of the first and only frockcoat no less than five bottles of the stout mrs coombes insisted upon having for her healths sake he made cheerful noises by breaking off the necks of the bottles with several of his wifes weddingpresent dinnerplates and during the earlier part of this great drunk he sang divers merry ballads he cut his finger rather badly with one of the bottlesthe only bloodshed in this storyand what with that and the systematic convulsion of his inexperienced physiology by the liquorish brand of mrs coombes stout it may be the evil of the fungus poison was somehow allayed but we prefer to draw a veil over the concluding incidents of this sunday afternoon they ended in the coal cellar in a deep and healing sleep  an interval of five years elapsed again it was a sunday afternoon in october and again mr coombes walked through the pine wood beyond the canal he was still the same darkeyed blackmoustached little man that he was at the outset of the story but his double chin was now scarcely so illusory as it had been his overcoat was new with a velvet lapel and a stylish collar with turndown corners free of any coarse starchiness had replaced the original allround article his hat was glossy his gloves newishthough one finger had split and been carefully mended and a casual observer would have noticed about him a certain rectitude of bearing a certain erectness of head that marks the man who thinks well of himself he was a master now with three assistants beside him walked a larger sunburnt parody of himself his brother tom just back from australia they were recapitulating their early struggles and mr coombes had just been making a financial statement  its a very nice little business jim said brother tom in these days of competition youre jolly lucky to have worked it up so and youre jolly lucky too to have a wife whos willing to help like yours does  between ourselves said mr coombes it wasnt always so it wasnt always like this to begin with the missus was a bit giddy girls are funny creatures  dear me  yes youd hardly think it but she was downright extravagant and always having slaps at me i was a bit too easy and loving and all that and she thought the whole blessed show was run for her turned the ouse into a regular caravansery always having her relations and girls from business in and their chaps comic songs a sunday it was getting to and driving trade away and she was making eyes at the chaps too i tell you tom the place wasnt my own  shouldnt a thought it  it was so welli reasoned with her i said i aint a duke to keep a wife like a pet animal i married you for elp and company i said you got to elp and pull the business through she wouldnt ear of it very well i says im a mild man till im roused i says and its getting to that but she wouldnt ear of no warnings  well  its the way with women she didnt think i

coombes looked i dessay theyre sent for some wise purpose said mr coombes  and that was as much thanks as the purple pileus ever got for maddening this absurd little man to the pitch of decisive action and so altering the whole course of his life       xviii    a slip under the microscope   outside the laboratory windows was a waterygrey fog and within a close warmth and the yellow light of the greenshaded gas lamps that stood two to each table down its narrow length on each table stood a couple of glass jars containing the mangled vestiges of the crayfish mussels frogs and guineapigs upon which the students had been working and down the side of the room facing the windows were shelves bearing bleached dissections in spirits surmounted by a row of beautifully executed anatomical drawings in whitewood frames and overhanging a row of cubical lockers all the doors of the laboratory were panelled with blackboard and on these were the halferased diagrams of the previous days work the laboratory was empty save for the demonstrator who sat near the preparationroom door and silent save for a low continuous murmur and the clicking of the rocker microtome at which he was working but scattered about the room were traces of numerous students handbags polished boxes of instruments in one place a large drawing covered by newspaper and in another a prettily bound copy of news from nowhere a book oddly at variance with its surroundings these things had been put down hastily as the students had arrived and hurried at once to secure their seats in the adjacent lecture theatre deadened by the closed door the measured accents of the professor sounded as a featureless muttering  presently faint through the closed windows came the sound of the oratory clock striking the hour of eleven the clicking of the microtome ceased and the demonstrator looked at his watch rose thrust his hands into his pockets and walked slowly down the laboratory towards the lecture theatre door he stood listening for a moment and then his eye fell on the little volume by william morris he picked it up glanced at the title smiled opened it looked at the name on the flyleaf ran the leaves through with his hand and put it down almost immediately the even murmur of the lecturer ceased there was a sudden burst of pencils rattling on the desks in the lecture theatre a stirring a scraping of feet and a number of voices speaking together then a firm footfall approached the door which began to open and stood ajar as some indistinctly heard question arrested the newcomer  the demonstrator turned walked slowly back past the microtome and left the laboratory by the preparationroom door as he did so first one and then several students carrying notebooks entered the laboratory from the lecture theatre and distributed themselves among the little tables or stood in a group about the doorway they were an exceptionally heterogeneous assembly for while oxford and cambridge still recoil from the blushing prospect of mixed classes the college of science anticipated america in the matter years agomixed socially too for the prestige of the college is high and its scholarships free of any age limit dredge deeper even than do those of the scotch universities the class numbered oneandtwenty but some remained in the theatre questioning the professor copying the blackboard diagrams before they were washed off or examining the special specimens he had produced to illustrate the days teaching of the nine who had come into the laboratory three were girls one of whom a little fair woman wearing spectacles and dressed in greyishgreen was peering out of the window at the fog while the other two both wholesomelooking plainfaced schoolgirls unrolled and put on the brown holland aprons they wore while dissecting of the men two went down the laboratory to their places one a pallid darkbearded man who had once been a tailor the other a pleasantfeatured ruddy young man of twenty dressed in a wellfitting brown suit young wedderburn the son of wedderburn the eye specialist the others formed a little knot near the theatre door one of these a dwarfed spectacled figure with a hunchback sat on a bent wood stool two others one a short dark youngster and the other a flaxenhaired reddishcomplexioned young man stood leaning side by side against the slate sink while the fourth stood facing them and maintained the larger share of the conversation  this last person was named hill he was a sturdily built young fellow of the same age as wedderburn he had a white face dark grey eyes hair of an indeterminate colour and prominent irregular features he talked rather louder than was needful and thrust his hands deeply into his pockets his collar was frayed and blue with the starch of a careless laundress his clothes were evidently readymade and there was a patch on the side of his boot near the toe and as he talked or listened to the others he glanced now and again towards the lecture theatre door they were discussing the depressing peroration of the lecture they had just heard the last lecture it was in the introductory course in zoology from ovum to ovum is the goal of the higher vertebrata the lecturer had said in his melancholy tones and so had neatly rounded off the sketch of comparative anatomy he had been developing the spectacled hunchback had repeated it with noisy appreciation had tossed it towards the fairhaired student with an evident provocation and had started one of these vague rambling discussions on generalities so unaccountably dear to the student mind all the world over  that is our goal perhapsi admit it as far as science goes said the fairhaired student rising to the challenge but there are things above science  science said hill confidently is systematic knowledge ideas that dont come into the systemmust anyhowbe loose ideas he was not quite sure whether that was a clever saying or a fatuity until his hearers took it seriously  the thing i cannot understand said the hunchback at large is whether hill is a materialist or not  there is one thing above matter said hill promptly feeling he had a better thing this time aware too of someone in the doorway behind him and raising his voice a trifle for her benefit and that is the delusion that there is something above matter  so we have your gospel at last said the fair student its all a delusion is it all our aspirations to lead something more than dogs lives all our work for anything beyond ourselves but see how inconsistent you are your socialism for instance why do you trouble about the interests of the race why do you concern yourself about the beggar in the gutter why are you bothering yourself to lend that book  he indicated william morris by a movement of the headto everyone in the lab  girl said the hunchback indistinctly and glanced guiltily over his shoulder  the girl in brown with the brown eyes had come into the laboratory and stood on the other side of the table behind him with her rolledup apron in one hand looking over her shoulder listening to the discussion she did not notice the hunchback because she was glancing from hill to his interlocutor hills consciousness of her presence betrayed itself to her only in his studious ignorance of the fact but she understood that and it pleased her i see no reason said he why a man should live like a brute because he knows of nothing beyond matter and does not expect to exist a hundred years hence  why shouldnt he said the fairhaired student  why should he said hill  what inducement has he  thats the way with all you religious people its all a business of inducements cannot a man seek after righteousness for righteousness sake  there was a pause the fair man answered with a kind of vocal padding butyou seeinducementwhen i said inducement to gain time and then the hunchback came to his rescue and inserted a question he was a terrible person in the debating society with his questions and they invariably took one forma demand for a definition whats your definition of righteousness said the hunchback at this stage  hill experienced a sudden loss of complacency at this question but even as it was asked relief came in the person of brooks the laboratory attendant who entered by the preparationroom door carrying a number of freshly killed guineapigs by their hind legs this is the last batch of material this session said the youngster who had not previously spoken brooks advanced up the laboratory smacking down a couple of guineapigs at each table the rest of the class scenting the prey from afar came crowding in by the lecture theatre door and the discussion perished abruptly as the students who were not already in their places hurried to them to secure the choice of a specimen there was a noise of keys rattling on split rings as lockers were opened and dissecting instruments taken out hill was already standing by his table and his box of scalpels was sticking out of his pocket the girl in brown came a step towards him and leaning over his table said softly did you see that i returned your book mr hill  during the whole scene she and the book had been vividly present in his consciousness but he made a clumsy pretence of looking at the book and seeing it for the first time oh yes he said taking it up i see did you like it  i want to ask you some questions about itsome time  certainly said hill i shall be glad he stopped awkwardly you liked it he said  its a wonderful book only some things i dont understand  then suddenly the laboratory was hushed by a curious braying noise it was the demonstrator he was at the blackboard ready to begin the days instruction and it was his custom to demand silence by a sound midway between the er of common intercourse and the blast of a trumpet the girl in brown slipped back to her place it was immediately in front of hills and hill forgetting her forthwith took a notebook out of the drawer of his table turned over its leaves hastily drew a stumpy pencil from his pocket and prepared to make a copious note of the coming demonstration for demonstrations and lectures are the sacred text of the college students books saving only the professors own you mayit is even expedient toignore  hill was the son of a landport cobbler and had been hooked by a chance blue paper the authorities had thrown out to the landport technical college he kept himself in london on his allowance of a guinea a week and found that with proper care this also covered his clothing allowance an occasional waterproof collar that is and ink and needles and cotton and suchlike necessaries for a man about town this was his first year and his first session but the brown old man in landport had already got himself detested in many publichouses by boasting of his son the professor hill was a vigorous youngster with a serene contempt for the clergy of all denominations and a fine ambition to reconstruct the world he regarded his scholarship as a brilliant opportunity he had begun to read at seven and had read steadily whatever came in his way good or bad since then his worldly experience had been limited to the island of portsea and acquired chiefly in the wholesale boot factory in which he had worked by day after passing the seventh standard of the board school he had a considerable gift of speech as the college debating society which met amidst the crushing machines and mine models in the metallurgical theatre downstairs already recognisedrecognised by a violent battering of desks whenever he rose and he was just at that fine emotional age when life opens at the end of a narrow pass like a broad valley at ones feet full of the promise of wonderful discoveries and tremendous achievements and his own limitations save that he knew that he knew neither latin nor french were all unknown to him  at first his interest had been divided pretty equally between his biological work at the college and social and theological theorising an employment which he took in deadly earnest of a night when the big museum library was not open he would sit on the bed of his room in chelsea with his coat and a muffler on and write out the lecture notes and revise his dissection memoranda until thorpe called him out by a whistlethe landlady objected to open the door to attic visitorsand then the two would go prowling about the shadowy shiny gaslit streets talking very much in the fashion of the sample just given of the god idea and righteousness and carlyle and the reorganisation of society and in the midst of it all hill arguing not only for thorpe but for the casual passerby would lose the thread of his argument glancing at some pretty painted face that looked meaningly at him as he passed science and righteousness but once or twice lately there had been signs that a third interest was creeping into his life and he had found his attention wandering from the fate of the mesoblastic somites or the probable meaning of the blastopore to the thought of the girl with the brown eyes who sat at the table before him  she was a paying student she descended inconceivable social altitudes to speak to him at the thought of the education she must have had and the accomplishments she must possess the soul of hill became abject within him she had spoken to him first over a difficulty about the alisphenoid of a rabbits skull and he had found that in biology at least he had no reason for selfabasement and from that after the manner of young people starting from any startingpoint they got to generalities and while hill attacked her upon the question of socialismsome instinct told him to spare her a direct assault upon her religionshe was gathering resolution to undertake what she told herself was his aesthetic education she was a year or two older than he though the thought never occurred to him the loan of news from nowhere was the beginning of a series of cross loans upon some absurd first principle of his hill had never wasted time upon poetry and it seemed an appalling deficiency to her one day in the lunch hour when she chanced upon him alone in the little museum where the skeletons were arranged shamefully eating the bun that constituted his midday meal she retreated and returned to lend him with a slightly furtive air a volume of browning he stood sideways towards her and took the book rather clumsily because he was holding the bun in the other hand and in the retrospect his voice lacked the cheerful clearness he could have wished  that occurred after the examination in comparative anatomy on the day before the college turned out its students and was carefully locked up by the officials for the christmas holidays the excitement of cramming for the first trial of strength had for a little while dominated hill to the exclusion of his other interests in the forecasts of the result in which everyone indulged he was surprised to find that no one regarded him as a possible competitor for the harvey commemoration medal of which this and the two subsequent examinations disposed it was about this time that wedderburn who so far had lived inconspicuously on the uttermost margin of hills perceptions began to take on the appearance of an obstacle by a mutual agreement the nocturnal prowlings with thorpe ceased for the three weeks before the examination and his landlady pointed out that she really could not supply so much lamp oil at the price he walked to and fro from the college with little slips of mnemonics in his hand lists of crayfish appendages rabbits skullbones and vertebrate nerves for example and became a positive nuisance to foot passengers in the opposite direction  but by a natural reaction poetry and the girl with the brown eyes ruled the christmas holiday the pending results of the examination became such a secondary consideration that hill marvelled at his fathers excitement even had he wished it there was no comparative anatomy to read in landport and he was too poor to buy books but the stock of poets in the library was extensive and hills attack was magnificently sustained he saturated himself with the fluent numbers of longfellow and tennyson and fortified himself with shakespeare found a kindred soul in pope and a master in shelley and heard and fled the siren voices of eliza cook and mrs hemans but he read no more browning because he hoped for the loan of other volumes from miss haysman when he returned to london  he walked from his lodgings to the college with that volume of browning in his shiny black bag and his mind teeming with the finest general propositions about poetry indeed he framed first this little speech and then that with which to grace the return the morning was an exceptionally pleasant one for london there was a clear hard frost and undeniable blue in the sky a thin haze softened every outline and warm shafts of sunlight struck between the house blocks and turned the sunny side of the street to amber and gold in the hall of the college he pulled off his glove and signed his name with fingers so stiff with cold that the characteristic dash under the signature he cultivated became a quivering line he imagined miss haysman about him everywhere he turned at the staircase and there below he saw a crowd struggling at the foot of the noticeboard this possibly was the biology list he forgot browning and miss haysman for the moment and joined the scrimmage and at last with his cheek flattened against the sleeve of the man on the step above him he read the list  class i h j somers wedderburn william hill  and thereafter followed a second class that is outside our present sympathies it was characteristic that he did not trouble to look for thorpe on the physics list but backed out of the struggle at once and in a curious emotional state between pride over common secondclass humanity and acute disappointment at wedderburns success went on his way upstairs at the top as he was hanging up his coat in the passage the zoological demonstrator a young man from oxford who secretly regarded him as a blatant mugger of the very worst type offered his heartiest congratulations  at the laboratory door hill stopped for a second to get his breath and then entered he looked straight up the laboratory and saw all five girl students grouped in their places and wedderburn the once retiring wedderburn leaning rather gracefully against the window playing with the blind tassel and talking apparently to the five of them now hill could talk bravely enough and even overbearingly to one girl and he could have made a speech to a roomful of girls but this business of standing at ease and appreciating fencing and returning quick remarks round a group was he knew altogether beyond him coming up the staircase his feelings for wedderburn had been generous a certain admiration perhaps a willingness to shake his hand conspicuously and heartily as one who had fought but the first round but before christmas wedderburn had never gone up to that end of the room to talk in a flash hills mist of vague excitement condensed abruptly to a vivid dislike of wedderburn possibly his expression changed as he came up to his place wedderburn nodded carelessly to him and the others glanced round miss haysman looked at him and away again the faintest touch of her eyes i cant agree with you mr wedderburn she said  i must congratulate you on your firstclass mr hill said the spectacled girl in green turning round and beaming at him  its nothing said hill staring at wedderburn and miss haysman talking together and eager to hear what they talked about  we poor folks in the second class dont think so said the girl in spectacles  what was it wedderburn was saying something about william morris hill did not answer the girl in spectacles and the smile died out of his face he could not hear and failed to see how he could cut in confound wedderburn he sat down opened his bag hesitated whether to return the volume of browning forthwith in the sight of all and instead drew out his new notebooks for the short course in elementary botany that was now beginning and which would terminate in february as he did so a fat heavy man with a white face and pale grey eyesbindon the professor of botany who came up from kew for january and februarycame in by the lecture theatre door and passed rubbing his hands together and smiling in silent affability down the laboratory                                       in the subsequent six weeks hill experienced some very rapid and curiously complex emotional developments for the most part he had wedderburn in focusa fact that miss haysman never suspected she told hill for in the comparative privacy of the museum she talked a good deal to him of socialism and browning and general propositions that she had met wedderburn at the house of some people she knew and hes inherited his cleverness for his father you know is the great eyespecialist  my father is a cobbler said hill quite irrelevantly and perceived the want of dignity even as he said it but the gleam of jealousy did not offend her she conceived herself the fundamental source of it he suffered bitterly from a sense of wedderburns unfairness and a realisation of his own handicap here was this wedderburn had picked up a prominent man for a father and instead of his losing so many marks on the score of that advantage it was counted to him for righteousness and while hill had to introduce himself and talk to miss haysman clumsily over mangled guineapigs in the laboratory this wedderburn in some backstairs way had access to her social altitudes and could converse in a polished argot that hill understood perhaps but felt incapable of speaking not of course that he wanted to then it seemed to hill that for wedderburn to come there day after day with cuffs unfrayed neatly tailored precisely barbered quietly perfect was in itself an illbred sneering sort of proceeding moreover it was a stealthy thing for wedderburn to behave insignificantly for a space to mock modesty to lead hill to fancy that he himself was beyond dispute the man of the year and then suddenly to dart in front of him and incontinently to swell up in this fashion in addition to these things wedderburn displayed an increasing disposition to join in any conversational grouping that included miss haysman and would venture and indeed seek occasion to pass opinions derogatory to socialism and atheism he goaded hill to incivilities by neat shallow and exceedingly effective personalities about the socialist leaders until hill hated bernard shaws graceful egotisms william morriss limited editions and luxurious wallpapers and walter cranes charmingly absurd ideal working men about as much as he hated wedderburn the dissertations in the laboratory that had been his glory in the previous term became a danger degenerated into inglorious tussels with wedderburn and hill kept to them only out of an obscure perception that his honour was involved in the debating society hill knew quite clearly that to a thunderous accompaniment of banged desks he could have pulverised wedderburn only wedderburn never attended the debating society to be pulverised becausenauseous affectationhe dined late  you must not imagine that these things presented themselves in quite such a crude form to hills perception hill was a born generaliser wedderburn to him was not so much an individual obstacle as a type the salient angle of a class the economic theories that after infinite ferment had shaped themselves in hills mind became abruptly concrete at the contact the world became full of easymannered graceful gracefullydressed conversationally dexterous finally shallow wedderburns bishops wedderburn wedderburn mps professors wedderburn wedderburn landlords all with fingerbowl shibboleths and epigrammatic cities of refuge from a sturdy debater and everyone illclothed or illdressed from the cobbler to the cabrunner was a man and a brother a fellowsufferer to hills imagination so that he became as it were a champion of the fallen and oppressed albeit to outward seeming only a selfassertive illmannered young man and an unsuccessful champion at that again and again a skirmish over the afternoon tea that the girl students had inaugurated left hill with flushed cheeks and a tattered temper and the debating society noticed a new quality of sarcastic bitterness in his speeches  you will understand now how it was necessary if only in the interests of humanity that hill should demolish wedderburn in the forthcoming examination and outshine him in the eyes of miss haysman and you will perceive too how miss haysman fell into some common feminine misconceptions the hillwedderburn quarrel for in his unostentatious way wedderburn reciprocated hills illveiled rivalry became a tribute to her indefinable charm she was the queen of beauty in a tournament of scalpels and stumpy pencils to her confidential friends secret annoyance it even troubled her conscience for she was a good girl and painfully aware from ruskin and contemporary fiction how entirely mens activities are determined by womens attitudes and if hill never by any chance mentioned the topic of love to her she only credited him with the finer modesty for that omission so the time came on for the second examination and hills increasing pallor confirmed the general rumour that he was working hard in the aerated bread shop near south kensington station you would see him breaking his bun and sipping his milk with his eyes intent upon a paper of closely written notes in his bedroom there were propositions about buds and stems round his lookingglass a diagram to catch his eye if soap should chance to spare it above his washing basin he missed several meetings of the debating society but he found the chance encounters with miss haysman in the spacious ways of the adjacent art museum or in the little museum at the top of the college or in the college corridors more frequent and very restful in particular they used to meet in a little gallery full of wroughtiron chests and gates near the art library and there hill used to talk under the gentle stimulus of her flattering attention of browning and his personal ambitions a characteristic she found remarkable in him was his freedom from avarice he contemplated quite calmly the prospect of living all his life on an income below a hundred pounds a year but he was determined to be famous to make recognisably in his own proper person the world a better place to live in he took bradlaugh and john burns for his leaders and models poor even impecunious great men but miss haysman thought that such lives were deficient on the aesthetic side by which though she did not know it she meant good wallpaper and upholstery pretty books tasteful clothes concerts and meals nicely cooked and respectfully served  at last came the day of the second examination and the professor of botany a fussy conscientious man rearranged all the tables in a long narrow laboratory to prevent copying and put his demonstrator on a chair on a table where he felt he said like a hindoo god to see all the cheating and stuck a notice outside the door door closed for no earthly reason that any human being could discover and all the morning from ten till one the quill of wedderburn shrieked defiance at hills and the quills of the others chased their leaders in a tireless pack and so also it was in the afternoon wedderburn was a little quieter than usual and hills face was hot all day and his overcoat bulged with textbooks and notebooks against the last moments revision and the next day in the morning and in the afternoon was the practical examination when sections had to be cut and slides identified in the morning hill was depressed because he knew he had cut a thick section and in the afternoon came the mysterious slip  it was just the kind of thing that the botanical professor was always doing like the income tax it offered a premium to the cheat it was a preparation under the microscope a little glass slip held in its place on the stage of the instrument by light steel clips and the inscription set forth that the slip was not to be moved each student was to go in turn to it sketch it write in his book of answers what he considered it to be and return to his place now to move such a slip is a thing one can do by a chance movement of the finger and in a fraction of a second the professors reason for decreeing that the slip should not be moved depended on the fact that the object he wanted identified was characteristic of a certain tree stem in the position in which it was placed it was a difficult thing to recognise but once the slip was moved so as to bring other parts of the preparation into view its nature was obvious enough  hill came to this flushed from a contest with staining reagents sat down on the little stool before the microscope turned the mirror to get the best light and then out of sheer habit shifted the slips at once he remembered the prohibition and with an almost continuous motion of his hands moved it back and sat paralysed with astonishment at his action  then slowly he turned his head the professor was out of the room the demonstrator sat aloft on his impromptu rostrum reading the q jour mi sci the rest of the examinees were busy and with their backs to him should he own up to the accident now he knew quite clearly what the thing was it was a lenticel a characteristic preparation from the eldertree his eyes roved over his intent fellowstudents and wedderburn suddenly glanced over his shoulder at him with a queer expression in his eyes the mental excitement that had kept hill at an abnormal pitch of vigour these two days gave way to a curious nervous tension his book of answers was beside him he did not write down what the thing was but with one eye at the microscope he began making a hasty sketch of it his mind was full of this grotesque puzzle in ethics that had suddenly been sprung upon him should he identify it or should he leave this question unanswered in that case wedderburn would probably come out first in the second result how could he tell now whether he might not have identified the thing without shifting it it was possible that wedderburn had failed to recognise it of course suppose wedderburn too had shifted the slide he looked up at the clock there were fifteen minutes in which to make up his mind he gathered up his book of answers and the coloured pencils he used in illustrating his replies and walked back to his seat  he read through his manuscript and then sat thinking and gnawing his knuckle it would look queer now if he owned up he must beat wedderburn he forgot the examples of those starry gentlemen john burns and bradlaugh besides he reflected the glimpse of the rest of the slip he had had was after all quite accidental forced upon him by chance a kind of providential revelation rather than an unfair advantage it was not nearly so dishonest to avail himself of that as it was of broome who believed in the efficacy of prayer to pray daily for a firstclass five minutes more said the demonstrator folding up his paper and becoming observant hill watched the clock hands until two minutes remained then he opened the book of answers and with hot ears and an affectation of ease gave his drawing of the lenticel its name  when the second pass list appeared the previous positions of wedderburn and hill were reversed and the spectacled girl in green who knew the demonstrator in private life where he was practically human said that in the result of the two examinations taken together hill had the advantage of a mark167 to 166 out of a possible 200 everyone admired hill in a way though the suspicion of mugging clung to him but hill was to find congratulations and miss haysmans enhanced opinion of him and even the decided decline in the crest of wedderburn tainted by an unhappy memory he felt a remarkable access of energy at first and the note of a democracy marching to triumph returned to his debatingsociety speeches he worked at his comparative anatomy with tremendous zeal and effect and he went on with his aesthetic education but through it all a vivid little picture was continually coming before his minds eyeof a sneakish person manipulating a slide  no human being had witnessed the act and he was cocksure that no higher power existed to see it but for all that it worried him memories are not dead things but alive they dwindle in disuse but they harden and develop in all sorts of queer ways if they are being continually fretted curiously enough though at the time he perceived clearly that the shifting was accidental as the days wore on his memory became confused about it until at last he was not surealthough he assured himself that he was surewhether the movement had been absolutely involuntary then it is possible that hills dietary was conducive to morbid conscientiousness a breakfast frequently eaten in a hurry a midday bun and at such hours after five as chanced to be convenient such meat as his means determined usually in a chophouse in a back street off the brompton road occasionally he treated himself to threepenny or ninepenny classics and they usually represented a suppression of potatoes or chops it is indisputable that outbreaks of selfabasement and emotional revival have a distinct relation to periods of scarcity but apart from this influence on the feelings there was in hill a distinct aversion to falsity that the blasphemous landport cobbler had inculcated by strap and tongue from his earliest years of one fact about professed atheists i am convinced they may bethey usually arefools void of subtlety revilers of holy institutions brutal speakers and mischievous knaves but they lie with difficulty if it were not so if they had the faintest grasp of the idea of compromise they would simply be liberal churchmen and moreover this memory poisoned his regard for miss haysman for she now so evidently preferred him to wedderburn that he felt sure he cared for her and began reciprocating her attentions by timid marks of personal regard at one time he even bought a bunch of violets carried it about in his pocket and produced it with a stumbling explanation withered and dead in the gallery of old iron it poisoned too the denunciation of capitalist dishonesty that had been one of his lifes pleasures and lastly it poisoned his triumph in wedderburn previously he had been wedderburns superior in his own eyes and had raged simply at a want of recognition now he began to fret at the darker suspicion of positive inferiority he fancied he found justifications for his position in browning but they vanished on analysis at lastmoved curiously enough by exactly the same motive forces that had resulted in his dishonestyhe went to professor bindon and made a clean breast of the whole affair as hill was a paid student professor bindon did not ask him to sit down and he stood before the professors desk as he made his confession  its a curious story said professor bindon slowly realising how the thing reflected on himself and then letting his anger risea most remarkable story i cant understand your doing it and i cant understand this avowal youre a type of studentcambridge men would never dreami suppose i ought to have thoughtwhy did you cheat  i didnt cheat said hill  but you have just been telling me you did  i thought i explained  either you cheated or you did not cheat  i said my motion was involuntary  i am not a metaphysician i am a servant of scienceof fact you were told not to move the slip you did move the slip if that is not cheating  if i was a cheat said hill with the note of hysterics in his voice should i come here and tell you  your repentance of course does you credit said professor bindon but it does not alter the original facts  no sir said hill giving in in utter selfabasement  even now you cause an enormous amount of trouble the examination list will have to be revised  i suppose so sir  suppose so of course it must be revised and i dont see how i can conscientiously pass you  not pass me said hill fail me  its the rule in all examinations or where should we be what else did you expect you dont want to shirk the consequences of your own acts  i thought perhaps said hill and then fail me i thought as i told you you would simply deduct the marks given for that slip  impossible said bindon besides it would still leave you above wedderburn deduct only the marks preposterous the departmental regulations distinctly say  but its my own admission sir  the regulations say nothing whatever of the manner in which the matter comes to light they simply provide  it will ruin me if i fail this examination they wont renew my scholarship  you should have thought of that before  but sir consider all my circumstances  i cannot consider anything professors in this college are machines the regulations will not even let us recommend our students for appointments i am a machine and you have worked me i have to do  its very hard sir  possibly it is  if i am to be failed this examination i might as well go home at once  that is as you think proper bindons voice softened a little he perceived he had been unjust and provided he did not contradict himself he was disposed to amelioration as a private person he said i think this confession of yours goes far to mitigate your offence but you have set the machinery in motion and now it must take its course ii am really sorry you gave way  a wave of emotion prevented hill from answering suddenly very vividly he saw the heavilylined face of the old landport cobbler his father good god what a fool i have been he said hotly and abruptly  i hope said bindon that it will be a lesson to you  but curiously enough they were not thinking of quite the same indiscretion  there was a pause  i would like a day to think sir and then i will let you knowabout going home i mean said hill moving towards the door                                       the next day hills place was vacant the spectacled girl in green was as usual first with the news wedderburn and miss haysman were talking of a performance of the meistersingers when she came up to them  have you heard she said  heard what  there was cheating in the examination  cheating said wedderburn with his face suddenly hot how  that slide  moved never  it was that slide that we werent to move  nonsense said wedderburn why how could they find out who do they say  it was mr hill  hill  mr hill  notsurely not the immaculate hill said wedderburn recovering  i dont believe it said miss haysman how do you know  i didnt said the girl in spectacles but i know it now for a fact mr hill went and confessed to professor bindon himself  by jove said wedderburn hill of all people but i am always inclined to distrust these philanthropistsonprinciple  are you quite sure said miss haysman with a catch in her breath  quite its dreadful isnt it but you know what can you expect his father is a cobbler  then miss haysman astonished the girl in spectacles  i dont care i will not believe it she said flushing darkly under her warmtinted skin i will not believe it until he has told me so himself face to face i would scarcely believe it then and abruptly she turned her back on the girl in spectacles and walked to her own place  its true all the same said the girl in spectacles peering and smiling at wedderburn  but wedderburn did not answer her she was indeed one of those people who seemed destined to make unanswered remarks       xix    the crystal egg   there was until a year ago a little and very grimylooking shop near seven dials over which in weatherworn yellow lettering the name of c cave naturalist and dealer in antiquities was inscribed the contents of its window were curiously variegated they comprised some elephant tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen beads and weapons a box of eyes two skulls of tigers and one human several motheaten stuffed monkeys one holding a lamp an oldfashioned cabinet a flyblown ostrich egg or so some fishingtackle and an extraordinarily dirty empty glass fishtank there was also at the moment the story begins a mass of crystal worked into the shape of an egg and brilliantly polished and at that two people who stood outside the window were looking one of them a tall thin clergyman the other a blackbearded young man of dusky complexion and unobtrusive costume the dusky young man spoke with eager gesticulation and seemed anxious for his companion to purchase the article  while they were there mr cave came into his shop his beard still wagging with the bread and butter of his tea when he saw these men and the object of their regard his countenance fell he glanced guiltily over his shoulder and softly shut the door he was a little old man with pale face and peculiar watery blue eyes his hair was a dirty grey and he wore a shabby blue frockcoat an ancient silk hat and carpet slippers very much down at heel he remained watching the two men as they talked the clergyman went deep into his trouser pocket examined a handful of money and showed his teeth in an agreeable smile mr cave seemed still more depressed when they came into the shop  the clergyman without any ceremony asked the price of the crystal egg mr cave glanced nervously towards the door leading into the parlour and said five pounds the clergyman protested that the price was high to his companion as well as to mr caveit was indeed very much more than mr cave had intended to ask when he had stocked the articleand an attempt at bargaining ensued mr cave stepped to the shop door and held it open five pounds is my price he said as though he wished to save himself the trouble of unprofitable discussion as he did so the upper portion of a womans face appeared above the blind in the glass upper panel of the door leading into the parlour and stared curiously at the two customers five pounds is my price said mr cave with a quiver in his voice  the swarthy young man had so far remained a spectator watching cave keenly now he spoke give him five pounds he said the clergyman glanced at him to see if he were in earnest and when he looked at mr cave again he saw that the latters face was white its a lot of money said the clergyman and diving into his pocket began counting his resources he had little more than thirty shillings and he appealed to his companion with whom he seemed to be on terms of considerable intimacy this gave mr cave an opportunity of collecting his thoughts and he began to explain in an agitated manner that the crystal was not as a matter of fact entirely free for sale his two customers were naturally surprised at this and inquired why he had not thought of that before he began to bargain mr cave became confused but he stuck to his story that the crystal was not in the market that afternoon that a probable purchaser of it had already appeared the two treating this as an attempt to raise the price still further made as if they would leave the shop but at this point the parlour door opened and the owner of the dark fringe and the little eyes appeared  she was a coarsefeatured corpulent woman younger and very much larger than mr cave she walked heavily and her face was flushed that crystal is for sale she said and five pounds is a good enough price for it i cant think what youre about cave not to take the gentlemans offer  mr cave greatly perturbed by the irruption looked angrily at her over the rims of his spectacles and without excessive assurance asserted his right to manage his business in his own way an altercation began the two customers watched the scene with interest and some amusement occasionally assisting mrs cave with suggestions mr cave hard driven persisted in a confused and impossible story of an inquiry for the crystal that morning and his agitation became painful but he stuck to his point with extraordinary persistence it was the young oriental who ended this curious controversy he proposed that they should call again in the course of two daysso as to give the alleged inquirer a fair chance and then we must insist said the clergyman five pounds mrs cave took it on herself to apologise for her husband explaining that he was sometimes a little odd and as the two customers left the couple prepared for a free discussion of the incident in all its bearings  mrs cave talked to her husband with singular directness the poor little man quivering with emotion muddled himself between his stories maintaining on the one hand that he had another customer in view and on the other asserting that the crystal was honestly worth ten guineas why did you ask five pounds said his wife do let me manage my business my own way said mr cave  mr cave had living with him a stepdaughter and a stepson and at supper that night the transaction was rediscussed none of them had a high opinion of mr caves business methods and this action seemed a culminating folly  its my opinion hes refused that crystal before said the stepson a looselimbed lout of eighteen  but five pounds said the stepdaughter an argumentative young woman of sixandtwenty  mr caves answers were wretched he could only mumble weak assertions that he knew his own business best they drove him from his halfeaten supper into the shop to close it for the night his ears aflame and tears of vexation behind his spectacles why had he left the crystal in the window so long the folly of it that was the trouble closest in his mind for a time he could see no way of evading sale  after supper his stepdaughter and stepson smartened themselves up and went out and his wife retired upstairs to reflect upon the business aspects of the crystal over a little sugar and lemon and so forth in hot water mr cave went into the shop and stayed there until late ostensibly to make ornamental rockeries for goldfish cases but really for a private purpose that will be better explained later the next day mrs cave found that the crystal had been removed from the window and was lying behind some secondhand books on angling she replaced it in a conspicuous position but she did not argue further about it as a nervous headache disinclined her from debate mr cave was always disinclined the day passed disagreeably mr cave was if anything more absentminded than usual and uncommonly irritable withal in the afternoon when his wife was taking her customary sleep he removed the crystal from the window again  the next day mr cave had to deliver a consignment of dogfish at one of the hospital schools where they were needed for dissection in his absence mrs caves mind reverted to the topic of the crystal and the methods of expenditure suitable to a windfall of five pounds she had already devised some very agreeable expedients among others a dress of green silk for herself and a trip to richmond when a jangling of the front door bell summoned her into the shop the customer was an examination coach who came to complain of the nondelivery of certain frogs asked for the previous day mrs cave did not approve of this particular branch of mr caves business and the gentleman who had called in a somewhat aggressive mood retired after a brief exchange of wordsentirely civil so far as he was concerned mrs caves eye then naturally turned to the window for the sight of the crystal was an assurance of the five pounds and of her dreams what was her surprise to find it gone  she went to the place behind the locker on the counter where she had discovered it the day before it was not there and she immediately began an eager search about the shop  when mr cave returned from his business with the dogfish about a quarter to two in the afternoon he found the shop in some confusion and his wife extremely exasperated and on her knees behind the counter routing among his taxidermic material her face came up hot and angry over the counter as the jangling bell announced his return and she forthwith accused him of hiding it  hid what asked mr cave  the crystal  at that mr cave apparently much surprised rushed to the window isnt it here he said great heavens what has become of it  just then mr caves stepson reentered the shop from the inner roomhe had come home a minute or so before mr caveand he was blaspheming freely he was apprenticed to a secondhand furniture dealer down the road but he had his meals at home and he was naturally annoyed to find no dinner ready  but when he heard of the loss of the crystal he forgot his meal and his anger was diverted from his mother to his stepfather their first idea of course was that he had hidden it but mr cave stoutly denied all knowledge of its fate freely offering his bedabbled affidavit in the matterand at last was worked up to the point of accusing first his wife and then his stepson of having taken it with a view to a private sale so began an exceedingly acrimonious and emotional discussion which ended for mrs cave in a peculiar nervous condition midway between hysterics and amuck and caused the stepson to be halfanhour late at the furniture establishment in the afternoon mr cave took refuge from his wifes emotions in the shop  in the evening the matter was resumed with less passion and in a judicial spirit under the presidency of the stepdaughter the supper passed unhappily and culminated in a painful scene mr cave gave way at last to extreme exasperation and went out banging the front door violently the rest of the family having discussed him with the freedom his absence warranted hunted the house from garret to cellar hoping to light upon the crystal  the next day the two customers called again they were received by mrs cave almost in tears it transpired that no one could imagine all that she had stood from cave at various times in her married pilgrimage  she also gave a garbled account of the disappearance the clergyman and the oriental laughed silently at one another and said it was very extraordinary as mrs cave seemed disposed to give them the complete history of her life they made to leave the shop thereupon mrs cave still clinging to hope asked for the clergymans address so that if she could get anything out of cave she might communicate it the address was duly given but apparently was afterwards mislaid mrs cave can remember nothing about it  in the evening of that day the caves seem to have exhausted their emotions and mr cave who had been out in the afternoon supped in a gloomy isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the impassioned controversy of the previous days for some time matters were very badly strained in the cave household but neither crystal nor customer reappeared  now without mincing the matter we must admit that mr cave was a liar he knew perfectly well where the crystal was it was in the rooms of mr jacoby wace assistant demonstrator at st catherines hospital westbourne street it stood on the sideboard partially covered by a black velvet cloth and beside a decanter of american whisky it is from mr wace indeed that the particulars upon which this narrative is based were derived cave had taken off the thing to the hospital hidden in the dogfish sack and there had pressed the young investigator to keep it for him mr wace was a little dubious at first his relationship to cave was peculiar he had a taste for singular characters and he had more than once invited the old man to smoke and drink in his rooms and to unfold his rather amusing views of life in general and of his wife in particular mr wace had encountered mrs cave too on occasions when mr cave was not at home to attend to him he knew the constant interference to which cave was subjected and having weighed the story judicially he decided to give the crystal a refuge mr cave promised to explain the reasons for his remarkable affection for the crystal more fully on a later occasion but he spoke distinctly of seeing visions therein he called on mr wace the same evening  he told a complicated story the crystal he said had come into his possession with other oddments at the forced sale of another curiosity dealers effects and not knowing what its value might be he had ticketed it at ten shillings it had hung upon his hands at that price for some months and he was thinking of reducing the figure when he made a singular discovery  at that time his health was very badand it must be borne in mind that throughout all this experience his physical condition was one of ebband he was in considerable distress by reason of the negligence the positive illtreatment even he received from his wife and stepchildren his wife was vain extravagant unfeeling and had a growing taste for private drinking his stepdaughter was mean and overreaching and his stepson had conceived a violent dislike for him and lost no chance of showing it the requirements of his business pressed heavily upon him and mr wace does not think that he was altogether free from occasional intemperance he had begun life in a comfortable position he was a man of fair education and he suffered for weeks at a stretch from melancholia and insomnia afraid to disturb his family he would slip quietly from his wifes side when his thoughts became intolerable and wander about the house and about three oclock one morning late in august chance directed him into the shop  the dirty little place was impenetrably black except in one spot where he perceived an unusual glow of light approaching this he discovered it to be the crystal egg which was standing on the corner of the counter towards the window a thin ray smote through a crack in the shutters impinged upon the object and seemed as it were to fill its entire interior  it occurred to mr cave that this was not in accordance with the laws of optics as he had known them in his younger days he could understand the rays being refracted by the crystal and coming to a focus in its interior but this diffusion jarred with his physical conceptions he approached the crystal nearly peering into it and round it with a transient revival of the scientific curiosity that in his youth had determined his choice of a calling he was surprised to find the light not steady but writhing within the substance of the egg as though that object was a hollow sphere of some luminous vapour in moving about to get different points of view he suddenly found that he had come between it and the ray and that the crystal none the less remained luminous greatly astonished he lifted it out of the light ray and carried it to the darkest part of the shop it remained bright for some four or five minutes when it slowly faded and went out he placed it in the thin streak of daylight and its luminousness was almost immediately restored  so far at least mr wace was able to verify the remarkable story of mr cave he has himself repeatedly held this crystal in a ray of light which had to be of a less diameter than one millimetre and in a perfect darkness such as could be produced by velvet wrapping the crystal did undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent it would seem however that the luminousness was of some exceptional sort and not equally visible to all eyes for mr harbingerwhose name will be familiar to the scientific reader in connection with the pasteur institutewas quite unable to see any light whatever and mr waces own capacity for its appreciation was out of comparison inferior to that of mr caves even with mr cave the power varied very considerably his vision was most vivid during states of extreme weakness and fatigue  now from the outset this light in the crystal exercised a curious fascination upon mr cave and it says more for his loneliness of soul than a volume of pathetic writing could do that he told no human being of his curious observations he seems to have been living in such an atmosphere of petty spite that to admit the existence of a pleasure would have been to risk the loss of it he found that as the dawn advanced and the amount of diffused light increased the crystal became to all appearance nonluminous and for some time he was unable to see anything in it except at nighttime in dark corners of the shop  but the use of an old velvet cloth which he used as a background for a collection of minerals occurred to him and by doubling this and putting it over his head and hands he was able to get a sight of the luminous movement within the crystal even in the daytime he was very cautious lest he should be thus discovered by his wife and he practised this occupation only in the afternoons while she was asleep upstairs and then circumspectly in a hollow under the counter and one day turning the crystal about in his hands he saw something it came and went like a flash but it gave him the impression that the object had for a moment opened to him the view of a wide and spacious and strange country and turning it about he did just as the light faded see the same vision again  now it would be tedious and unnecessary to state all the phases of mr caves discovery from this point suffice that the effect was this the crystal being peered into at an angle of about 137 degrees from the direction of the illuminating ray gave a clear and consistent picture of a wide and peculiar countryside it was not dreamlike at all it produced a definite impression of reality and the better the light the more real and solid it seemed it was a moving picture that is to say certain objects moved in it but slowly in an orderly manner like real things and according as the direction of the lighting and vision changed the picture changed also it must indeed have been like looking through an oval glass at a view and turning the glass about to get at different aspects  mr caves statements mr wace assures me were extremely circumstantial and entirely free from any of that emotional quality that taints hallucinatory impressions but it must be remembered that all the efforts of mr wace to see any similar clarity in the faint opalescence of the crystal were wholly unsuccessful try as he would the difference in intensity of the impressions received by the two men was very great and it is quite conceivable that what was a view to mr cave was a mere blurred nebulosity to mr wace  the view as mr cave described it was invariably of an extensive plain and he seemed always to be looking at it from a considerable height as if from a tower or a mast to the east and to the west the plain was bounded at a remote distance by vast reddish cliffs which reminded him of those he had seen in some picture but what the picture was mr wace was unable to ascertain these cliffs passed north and southhe could tell the points of the compass by the stars that were visible of a nightreceding in an almost illimitable perspective and fading into the mists of the distance before they met he was nearer the eastern set of cliffs on the occasion of his first vision the sun was rising over them and black against the sunlight and pale against their shadow appeared a multitude of soaring forms that mr cave regarded as birds a vast range of buildings spread below him he seemed to be looking down upon them and as they approached the blurred and refracted edge of the picture they became indistinct there were also trees curious in shape and in colouring a deep mossy green and an exquisite grey beside a wide and shining canal and something great and brilliantly coloured flew across the picture but the first time mr cave saw these pictures he saw only in flashes his hands shook his head moved the vision came and went and grew foggy and indistinct and at first he had the greatest difficulty in finding the picture again once the direction of it was lost  his next clear vision which came about a week after the first the interval having yielded nothing but tantalising glimpses and some useful experience showed him the view down the length of the valley the view was different but he had a curious persuasion which his subsequent observations abundantly confirmed that he was regarding the strange world from exactly the same spot although he was looking in a different direction the long façade of the great building whose roof he had looked down upon before was now receding in perspective he recognised the roof in the front of the façade was a terrace of massive proportions and extraordinary length and down the middle of the terrace at certain intervals stood huge but very graceful masts bearing small shiny objects which reflected the setting sun the import of these small objects did not occur to mr cave until some time after as he was describing the scene to mr wace the terrace overhung a thicket of the most luxuriant and graceful vegetation and beyond this was a wide grassy lawn on which certain broad creatures in form like beetles but enormously larger reposed beyond this again was a richly decorated causeway of pinkish stone and beyond that and lined with dense red weeds and passing up the valley exactly parallel with the distant cliffs was a broad and mirrorlike expanse of water the air seemed full of squadrons of great birds manoeuvring in stately curves and across the river was a multitude of splendid buildings richly coloured and glittering with metallic tracery and facets among a forest of mosslike and lichenous trees and suddenly something flapped repeatedly across the vision like the fluttering of a jewelled fan or the beating of a wing and a face or rather the upper part of a face with very large eyes came as it were close to his own and as if on the other side of the crystal mr cave was so startled and so impressed by the absolute reality of these eyes that he drew his head back from the crystal to look behind it he had become so absorbed in watching that he was quite surprised to find himself in the cool darkness of his little shop with its familiar odour of methyl mustiness and decay and as he blinked about him the glowing crystal faded and went out  such were the first general impressions of mr cave the story is curiously direct and circumstantial from the outset when the valley first flashed momentarily on his senses his imagination was strangely affected and as he began to appreciate the details of the scene he saw his wonder rose to the point of a passion he went about his business listless and distraught thinking only of the time when he should be able to return to his watching and then a few weeks after his first sight of the valley came the two customers the stress and excitement of their offer and the narrow escape of the crystal from sale as i have already told  now while the thing was mr caves secret it remained a mere wonder a thing to creep to covertly and peep at as a child might peep upon a forbidden garden but mr wace has for a young scientific investigator a particularly lucid and consecutive habit of mind directly the crystal and its story came to him and he had satisfied himself by seeing the phosphorescence with his own eyes that there really was a certain evidence for mr caves statements he proceeded to develop the matter systematically mr cave was only too eager to come and feast his eyes on this wonderland he saw and he came every night from halfpast eight until halfpast ten and sometimes in mr waces absence during the day on sunday afternoons also he came from the outset mr wace made copious notes and it was due to his scientific method that the relation between the direction from which the initiating ray entered the crystal and the orientation of the picture were proved and by covering the crystal in a box perforated only with a small aperture to admit the exciting ray and by substituting black holland for his buff blinds he greatly improved the conditions of the observations so that in a little while they were able to survey the valley in any direction they desired  so having cleared the way we may give a brief account of this visionary world within the crystal the things were in all cases seen by mr cave and the method of working was invariably for him to watch the crystal and report what he saw while mr wace who as a science student had learnt the trick of writing in the dark wrote a brief note of his report when the crystal faded it was put into its box in the proper position and the electric light turned on mr wace asked questions and suggested observations to clear up difficult points nothing indeed could have been less visionary and more matteroffact  the attention of mr cave had been speedily directed to the birdlike creatures he had seen so abundantly present in each of his earlier visions his first impression was soon corrected and he considered for a time that they might represent a diurnal species of bat then he thought grotesquely enough that they might be cherubs their heads were round and curiously human and it was the eyes of one of them that had so startled him on his second observation they had broad silvery wings not feathered but glistening almost as brilliantly as newkilled fish and with the same subtle play of colour and these wings were not built on the plan of birdwing or bat mr wace learned but supported by curved ribs radiating from the body a sort of butterfly wing with curved ribs seems best to express their appearance the body was small but fitted with two bunches of prehensile organs like long tentacles immediately under the mouth incredible as it appeared to mr wace the persuasion at last became irresistible that it was these creatures which owned the great quasihuman buildings and the magnificent garden that made the broad valley so splendid and mr cave perceived that the buildings with other peculiarities had no doors but that the great circular windows which opened freely gave the creatures egress and entrance they would alight upon their tentacles fold their wings to a smallness almost rodlike and hop into the interior but among them was a multitude of smallerwinged creatures like great dragonflies and moths and flying beetles and across the greensward brilliantlycoloured gigantic groundbeetles crawled lazily to and fro moreover on the causeways and terraces largeheaded creatures similar to the greater winged flies but wingless were visible hopping busily upon their handlike tangle of tentacles  allusion has already been made to the glittering objects upon masts that stood upon the terrace of the nearer building it dawned upon mr cave after regarding one of these masts very fixedly on one particularly vivid day that the glittering object there was a crystal exactly like that into which he peered and a still more careful scrutiny convinced him that each one in a vista of nearly twenty carried a similar object  occasionally one of the large flying creatures would flutter up to one and folding its wings and coiling a number of its tentacles about the mast would regard the crystal fixedly for a spacesometimes for as long as fifteen minutes and a series of observations made at the suggestion of mr wace convinced both watchers that so far as this visionary world was concerned the crystal into which they peered actually stood at the summit of the endmost mast on the terrace and that on one occasion at least one of these inhabitants of this other world had looked into mr caves face while he was making these observations  so much for the essential facts of this very singular story unless we dismiss it all as the ingenious fabrication of mr wace we have to believe one of two things either that mr caves crystal was in two worlds at once and that while it was carried about in one it remained stationary in the other which seems altogether absurd or else that it had some peculiar relation of sympathy with another and exactly similar crystal in this other world so that what was seen in the interior of the one in this world was under suitable conditions visible to an observer in the corresponding crystal in the other world and vice versa at present indeed we do not know of any way in which two crystals could so come en rapport but nowadays we know enough to understand that the thing is not altogether impossible this view of the crystals as en rapport was the supposition that occurred to mr wace and to me at least it seems extremely plausible  and where was this other world on this also the alert intelligence of mr wace speedily threw light after sunset the sky darkened rapidly there was a very brief twilight interval indeedand the stars shone out they were recognisably the same as those we see arranged in the same constellations mr cave recognised the bear the pleiades aldebaran and sirius so that the other world must be somewhere in the solar system and at the utmost only a few hundreds of millions of miles from our own following up this clue mr wace learned that the midnight sky was a darker blue even than our midwinter sky and that the sun seemed a little smaller and there were two small moons like our moon but smaller and quite differently marked one of which moved so rapidly that its motion was clearly visible as one regarded it these moons were never high in the sky but vanished as they rose that is every time they revolved they were eclipsed because they were so near their primary planet and all this answers quite completely although mr cave did not know it to what must be the condition of things on mars  indeed it seems an exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering into this crystal mr cave did actually see the planet mars and its inhabitants and if that be the case then the evening star that shone so brilliantly in the sky of that distant vision was neither more nor less than our own familiar earth  for a time the martiansif they were martiansdo not seem to have known of mr caves inspection once or twice one would come to peer and go away very shortly to some other mast as though the vision was unsatisfactory during this time mr cave was able to watch the proceedings of these winged people without being disturbed by their attentions and although his report is necessarily vague and fragmentary it is nevertheless very suggestive imagine the impression of humanity a martian observer would get who after a difficult process of preparation and with considerable fatigue to the eyes was able to peer at london from the steeple of st martins church for stretches at longest of four minutes at a time mr cave was unable to ascertain if the winged martians were the same as the martians who hopped about the causeways and terraces and if the latter could put on wings at will he several times saw certain clumsy bipeds dimly suggestive of apes white and partially translucent feeding among certain of the lichenous trees and once some of these fled before one of the hopping roundheaded martians the latter caught one in its tentacles and then the picture faded suddenly and left mr cave most tantalisingly in the dark on another occasion a vast thing that mr cave thought at first was some gigantic insect appeared advancing along the causeway beside the canal with extraordinary rapidity as this drew nearer mr cave perceived that it was a mechanism of shining metals and of extraordinary complexity and then when he looked again it had passed out of sight  after a time mr wace aspired to attract the attention of the martians and the next time that the strange eyes of one of them appeared close to the crystal mr cave cried out and sprang away and they immediately turned on the light and began to gesticulate in a manner suggestive of signalling but when at last mr cave examined the crystal again the martian had departed  thus far these observations had progressed in early november and then mr cave feeling that the suspicions of his family about the crystal were allayed began to take it to and fro with him in order that as occasion arose in the daytime or night he might comfort himself with what was fast becoming the most real thing in his existence  in december mr waces work in connection with a forthcoming examination became heavy the sittings were reluctantly suspended for a week and for ten or eleven dayshe is not quite sure whichhe saw nothing of cave he then grew anxious to resume these investigations and the stress of his seasonal labours being abated he went down to seven dials at the corner he noticed a shutter before a bird fanciers window and then another at a cobblers mr caves shop was closed  he rapped and the door was opened by the stepson in black he at once called mrs cave who was mr wace could not but observe in cheap but ample widows weeds of the most imposing pattern without any very great surprise mr wace learnt that cave was dead and already buried she was in tears and her voice was a little thick she had just returned from highgate her mind seemed occupied with her own prospects and the honourable details of the obsequies but mr wace was at last able to learn the particulars of caves death he had been found dead in his shop in the early morning the day after his last visit to mr wace and the crystal had been clasped in his stonecold hands his face was smiling said mrs cave and the velvet cloth from the minerals lay on the floor at his feet he must have been dead five or six hours when he was found  this came as a great shock to wace and he began to reproach himself bitterly for having neglected the plain symptoms of the old mans illhealth but his chief thought was of the crystal he approached that topic in a gingerly manner because he knew mrs caves peculiarities he was dumfounded to learn that it was sold  mrs caves first impulse directly caves body had been taken upstairs had been to write to the mad clergyman who had offered five pounds for the crystal informing him of its recovery but after a violent hunt in which her daughter joined her they were convinced of the loss of his address as they were without the means required to mourn and bury cave in the elaborate style the dignity of an old seven dials inhabitant demands they had appealed to a friendly fellowtradesman in great portland street he had very kindly taken over a portion of the stock at a valuation the valuation was his own and the crystal egg was included in one of the lots mr wace after a few suitable condolences a little offhandedly proffered perhaps hurried at once to great portland street but there he learned that the crystal egg had already been sold to a tall dark man in grey and there the material facts in this curious and to me at least very suggestive story come abruptly to an end the great portland street dealer did not know who the tall dark man in grey was nor had he observed him with sufficient attention to describe him minutely he did not even know which way this person had gone after leaving the shop for a time mr wace remained in the shop trying the dealers patience with hopeless questions venting his own exasperation and at last realising abruptly that the whole thing had passed out of his hands had vanished like a vision of the night he returned to his own rooms a little astonished to find the notes he had made still tangible and visible upon his untidy table  his annoyance and disappointment were naturally very great he made a second call equally ineffectual upon the great portland street dealer and he resorted to advertisements in such periodicals as were lively to come into the hands of a bricabrac collector he also wrote letters to the daily chronicle and nature but both those periodicals suspecting a hoax asked him to reconsider his action before they printed and he was advised that such a strange story unfortunately so bare of supporting evidence might imperil his reputation as an investigator moreover the calls of his proper work were urgent so that after a month or so save for an occasional reminder to certain dealers he had reluctantly to abandon the quest for the crystal egg and from that day to this it remains undiscovered occasionally however he tells me and i can quite believe him he has bursts of zeal in which he abandons his more urgent occupation and resumes the search  whether or not it will remain lost for ever with the material and origin of it are things equally speculative at the present time if the present purchaser is a collector one would have expected the enquiries of mr wace to have reached him through the dealers he has been able to discover mr caves clergyman and orientalno other than the rev james parker and the young prince of bossokuni in java i am obliged to them for certain particulars the object of the prince was simply curiosityand extravagance he was so eager to buy because cave was so oddly reluctant to sell it is just as possible that the buyer in the second instance was simply a casual purchaser and not a collector at all and the crystal egg for all i know may at the present moment be within a mile of me decorating a drawingroom or serving as a paperweightits remarkable functions all unknown indeed it is partly with the idea of such a possibility that i have thrown this narrative into a form that will give it a chance of being read by the ordinary consumer of fiction  my own ideas in the matter are practically identical with those of mr wace i believe the crystal on the mast in mars and the crystal egg of mr caves to be in some physical but at present quite inexplicable way en rapport and we both believe further that the terrestrial crystal must have beenpossibly at some remote datesent hither from that planet in order to give the martians a near view of our affairs possibly the fellows to the crystals on the other masts are also on our globe no theory of hallucination suffices for the facts       xx    the star   it was on the first day of the new year that the announcement was made almost simultaneously from three observatories that the motion of the planet neptune the outermost of all the planets that wheel about the sun had become very erratic ogilvy had already called attention to a suspected retardation in its velocity in december such a piece of news was scarcely calculated to interest a world the greater portion of whose inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet neptune nor outside the astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of a faint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet cause any very great excitement scientific people however found the intelligence remarkable enough even before it became known that the new body was rapidly growing larger and brighter that its motion was quite different from the orderly progress of the planets and that the deflection of neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an unprecedented kind  few people without a training in science can realise the huge isolation of the solar system the sun with its specks of planets its dust of planetoids and its impalpable comets swims in a vacant immensity that almost defeats the imagination beyond the orbit of neptune there is space vacant so far as human observation has penetrated without warmth or light or sound blank emptiness for twenty million times a million miles that is the smallest estimate of the distance to be traversed before the very nearest of the stars is attained and saving a few comets more unsubstantial than the thinnest flame no matter had ever to human knowledge crossed this gulf of space until early in the twentieth century this strange wanderer appeared a vast mass of matter it was bulky heavy rushing without warning out of the black mystery of the sky into the radiance of the sun by the second day it was clearly visible to any decent instrument as a speck with a barely sensible diameter in the constellation leo near regulus in a little while an opera glass could attain it  on the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two hemispheres were made aware for the first time of the real importance of this unusual apparition in the heavens a planetary collision one london paper headed the news and proclaimed duchaines opinion that this strange new planet would probably collide with neptune the leaderwriters enlarged upon the topic so that in most of the capitals of the world on january 3rd there was an expectation however vague of some imminent phenomenon in the sky and as the night followed the sunset round the globe thousands of men turned their eyes skyward to seethe old familiar stars just as they had always been  until it was dawn in london and pollux setting and the stars overhead grown pale the winters dawn it was a sickly filtering accumulation of daylight and the light of gas and candles shone yellow in the windows to show where people were astir but the yawning policeman saw the thing the busy crowds in the markets stopped agape workmen going to their work betimes milkmen the drivers of newscarts dissipation going home jaded and pale homeless wanderers sentinels on their beats and in the country labourers trudging afield poachers slinking home all over the dusky quickening country it could be seenand out at sea by seamen watching for the daya great white star come suddenly into the westward sky  brighter it was than any star in our skies brighter than the evening star at its brightest it still glowed out white and large no mere twinkling spot of light but a small round clear shining disc an hour after the day had come and where science has not reached men stared and feared telling one another of the wars and pestilences that are foreshadowed by these fiery signs in the heavens sturdy boers dusky hottentots gold coast negroes frenchmen spaniards portuguese stood in the warmth of the sunrise watching the setting of this strange new star  and in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed excitement rising almost to shouting pitch as the two remote bodies had rushed together and a hurrying to and fro to gather photographic apparatus and spectroscope and this appliance and that to record this novel astonishing sight the destruction of a world for it was a world a sister planet of our earth far greater than our earth indeed that had so suddenly flashed into flaming death neptune it was had been struck fairly and squarely by the strange planet from outer space and the heat of the concussion had incontinently turned two solid globes into one vast mass of incandescence round the world that day two hours before the dawn went the pallid great white star fading only as it sank westward and the sun mounted above it everywhere men marvelled at it but of all those who saw it none could have marvelled more than those sailors habitual watchers of the stars who far away at sea had heard nothing of its advent and saw it now rise like a pigmy moon and climb zenithward and hang overhead and sink westward with the passing of the night  and when next it rose over europe everywhere were crowds of watchers on hilly slopes on houseroofs in open spaces staring eastward for the rising of the great new star it rose with a white glow in front of it like the glare of a white fire and those who had seen it come into existence the night before cried out at the sight of it it is larger they cried it is brighter and indeed the moon a quarter full and sinking in the west was in its apparent size beyond comparison but scarcely in all its breadth had it as much brightness now as the little circle of the strange new star  it is brighter cried the people clustering in the streets but in the dim observatories the watchers held their breath and peered at one another it is nearer they said nearer  and voice after voice repeated it is nearer and the clicking telegraph took that up and it trembled along telephone wires and in a thousand cities grimy compositors fingered the type it is nearer men writing in offices struck with a strange realisation flung down their pens men talking in a thousand places suddenly came upon a grotesque possibility in those words it is nearer it hurried along awakening streets it was shouted down the froststilled ways of quiet villages men who had read these things from the throbbing tape stood in yellowlit doorways shouting the news to the passersby it is nearer pretty women flushed and glittering heard the news told jestingly between the dances and feigned an intelligent interest they did not feel nearer indeed how curious how very very clever people must be to find out things like that  lonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those words to comfort themselveslooking skyward it has need to be nearer for the nights as cold as charity dont seem much warmth from it if it is nearer all the same  what is a new star to me cried the weeping woman kneeling beside her dead  the schoolboy rising early for his examination work puzzled it out for himselfwith the great white star shining broad and bright through the frostflowers of his window centrifugal centripetal he said with his chin on his fist stop a planet in its flight rob it of its centrifugal force what then centripetal has it and down it falls into the sun and this  do we come in the way i wonder  the light of that day went the way of its brethren and with the later watches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star again and it was now so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a pale yellow ghost of itself hanging huge in the sunset in a south african city a great man had married and the streets were alight to welcome his return with his bride even the skies have illuminated said the flatterer under capricorn two negro lovers daring the wild beasts and evil spirits for love of one another crouched together in a cane brake where the fireflies hovered that is our star they whispered and felt strangely comforted by the sweet brilliance of its light  the master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the papers from him his calculations were already finished in a small white phial there still remained a little of the drug that had kept him awake and active for four long nights each day serene explicit patient as ever he had given his lecture to his students and then had come back at once to this momentous calculation his face was grave a little drawn and hectic from his drugged activity for some time he seemed lost in thought then he went to the window and the blind went up with a click halfway up the sky over the clustering roofs chimneys and steeples of the city hung the star  he looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave enemy you may kill me he said after a silence but i can hold youand all the universe for that matterin the grip of this small brain i would not change even now  he looked at the little phial there will be no need of sleep again he said the next day at noon punctual to the minute he entered his lecture theatre put his hat on the end of the table as his habit was and carefully selected a large piece of chalk it was a joke among his students that he could not lecture without that piece of chalk to fumble in his fingers and once he had been stricken to impotence by their hiding his supply he came and looked under his grey eyebrows at the rising tiers of young fresh faces and spoke with his accustomed studied commonness of phrasing  circumstances have arisencircumstances beyond my control he said and paused which will debar me from completing the course i had designed it would seem gentlemen if i may put the thing clearly and briefly thatman has lived in vain  the students glanced at one another had they heard aright mad raised eyebrows and grinning lips there were but one or two faces remained intent upon his calm greyfringed face it will be interesting he was saying to devote this morning to an exposition so far as i can make it clear to you of the calculations that have led me to this conclusion let us assume  he turned towards the blackboard meditating a diagram in the way that was usual to him what was that about lived in vain whispered one student to another listen said the other nodding towards the lecturer  and presently they began to understand                                       that night the star rose later for its proper eastward motion had carried it some way across leo towards virgo and its brightness was so great that the sky became a luminous blue as it rose and every star was hidden in its turn save only jupiter near the zenith capella aldebaran sirius and the pointers of the bear it was very white and beautiful in many parts of the world that night a pallid halo encircled it about it was perceptibly larger in the clear refractive sky of the tropics it seemed as if it were nearly a quarter the size of the moon the frost was still on the ground in england but the world was as brightly lit as if it were midsummer moonlight one could see to read quite ordinary print by that cold clear light and in the cities the lamps burnt yellow and wan  and everywhere the world was awake that night and throughout christendom a sombre murmur hung in the keen air over the countryside like the belling of bees in the heather and this murmurous tumult grew to a clangour in the cities it was the tolling of the bells in a million belfry towers and steeples summoning the people to sleep no more to sin no more but to gather in their churches and pray and overhead growing larger and brighter as the earth rolled on its way and the night passed rose the dazzling star  and the streets and houses were alight in all the cities the shipyards glared and whatever roads led to high country were lit and crowded all night long and in all the seas about the civilized lands ships with throbbing engines and ships with bellying sails crowded with men and living creatures were standing out to ocean and the north for already the warning of the master mathematician had been telegraphed all over the world and translated into a hundred tongues the new planet and neptune locked in a fiery embrace were whirling headlong ever faster and faster towards the sun already every second this blazing mass flew a hundred miles and every second its terrific velocity increased as it flew now indeed it must pass a hundred million of miles wide of the earth and scarcely affect it but near its destined path as yet only slightly perturbed spun the mighty planet jupiter and his moons sweeping splendid round the sun every moment now the attraction between the fiery star and the greatest of the planets grew stronger and the result of that attraction inevitably jupiter would be deflected from its orbit into an elliptical path and the burning star swung by his attraction wide of its sunward rush would describe a curved path and perhaps collide with and certainly pass very close to our earth earthquakes volcanic outbreaks cyclones sea waves floods and a steady rise in temperature to i know not what limitso prophesied the master mathematician  and overhead to carry out his words lonely and cold and livid blazed the star of the coming doom  to many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached it seemed that it was visibly approaching and that night too the weather changed and the frost that had gripped all central europe and france and england softened towards a thaw  but you must not imagine because i have spoken of people praying through the night and people going aboard ships and people fleeing towards mountainous country that the whole world was already in a terror because of the star as a matter of fact use and wont still ruled the world and save for the talk of idle moments and the splendour of the night nine human beings out of ten were still busy at their common occupations in all the cities the shops save one here and there opened and closed at their proper hours the doctor and the undertaker plied their trades the workers gathered in the factories soldiers drilled scholars studied lovers sought one another thieves lurked and fled politicians planned their schemes the presses of the newspapers roared through the nights and many a priest of this church and that would not open his holy building to further what he considered a foolish panic the newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year 1000for then too people had anticipated the end the star was no starmere gasa comet and were it a star it could not possibly strike the earth there was no precedent for such a thing commonsense was sturdy everywhere scornful jesting a little inclined to persecute the obdurate fearful that night at sevenfifteen by greenwich time the star would be at its nearest to jupiter then the world would see the turn things would take the master mathematicians grim warnings were treated by many as so much mere elaborate selfadvertisement commonsense at last a little heated by argument signified its unalterable convictions by going to bed so too barbarism and savagery already tired of the novelty went about their nightly business and save for a howling dog here and there the beast world left the star unheeded  and yet when at last the watchers in the european states saw the star rise an hour later it is true but no larger than it had been the night before there were still plenty awake to laugh at the master mathematicianto take the danger as if it had passed  but hereafter the laughter ceased the star grewit grew with a terrible steadiness hour after hour a little larger each hour a little nearer the midnight zenith and brighter and brighter until it had turned night into a second day had it come straight to the earth instead of in a curved path had it lost no velocity to jupiter it must have leapt the intervening gulf in a day but as it was it took five days altogether to come by our planet the next night it had become a third the size of the moon before it set to english eyes and the thaw was assured it rose over america near the size of the moon but blinding white to look at and hot and a breath of hot wind blew now with its rising and gathering strength and in virginia and brazil and down the st lawrence valley it shone intermittently through a driving reek of thunderclouds flickering violet lightning and hail unprecedented in manitoba was a thaw and devastating floods and upon all the mountains of the earth the snow and ice began to melt that night and all the rivers coming out of high country flowed thick and turbid and soonin their upper reaches with swirling trees and the bodies of beasts and men they rose steadily steadily in the ghostly brilliance and came trickling over their banks at last behind the flying population of their valleys  and along the coast of argentina and up the south atlantic the tides were higher than had ever been in the memory of man and the storms drove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland drowning whole cities and so great grew the heat during the night that the rising of the sun was like the coming of a shadow the earthquakes began and grew until all down america from the arctic circle to cape horn hillsides were sliding fissures were opening and houses and walls crumbling to destruction the whole side of cotopaxi slipped out in one vast convulsion and a tumult of lava poured out so high and broad and swift and liquid that in one day it reached the sea  so the star with the wan moon in its wake marched across the pacific trailed the thunderstorms like the hem of a robe and the growing tidal wave that toiled behind it frothing and eager poured over island and island and swept them clear of men until that wave came at lastin a blinding light and with the breath of a furnace swift and terrible it camea wall of water fifty feet high roaring hungrily upon the long coasts of asia and swept inland across the plains of china for a space the star hotter now and larger and brighter than the sun in its strength showed with pitiless brilliance the wide and populous country towns and villages with their pagodas and trees roads wide cultivated fields millions of sleepless people staring in helpless terror at the incandescent sky and then low and growing came the murmur of the flood and thus it was with millions of men that nighta flight nowhither with limbs heavy with heat and breath fierce and scant and the flood like a wall swift and white behind and then death  china was lit glowing white but over japan and java and all the islands of eastern asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire because of the steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were spouting forth to salute its coming above was the lava hot gases and ash and below the seething floods and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with the earthquake shocks soon the immemorial snows of thibet and the himalaya were melting and pouring down by ten million deepening converging channels upon the plains of burmah and hindostan the tangled summits of the indian jungles were aflame in a thousand places and below the hurrying waters around the stems were dark objects that still struggled feebly and reflected the bloodred tongues of fire and in a rudderless confusion a multitude of men and women fled down the broad riverways to that one last hope of menthe open sea  larger grew the star and larger hotter and brighter with a terrible swiftness now the tropical ocean had lost its phosphorescence and the whirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that plunged incessantly speckled with stormtossed ships  and then came a wonder it seemed to those who in europe watched for the rising of the star that the world must have ceased its rotation in a thousand open spaces of down and upland the people who had fled thither from the floods and the falling houses and sliding slopes of hill watched for that rising in vain hour followed hour through a terrible suspense and the star rose not once again men set their eyes upon the old constellations they had counted lost to them for ever in england it was hot and clear overhead though the ground quivered perpetually but in the tropics sirius and capella and aldebaran showed through a veil of steam and when at last the great star rose near ten hours late the sun rose close upon it and in the centre of its white heart was a disc of black  over asia it was the star had begun to fall behind the movement of the sky and then suddenly as it hung over india its light had been veiled all the plain of india from the mouth of the indus to the mouths of the ganges was a shallow waste of shining water that night out of which rose temples and palaces mounds and hills black with people every minaret was a clustering mass of people who fell one by one into the turbid waters as heat and terror overcame them the whole land seemed awailing and suddenly there swept a shadow across that furnace of despair and a breath of cold wind and a gathering of clouds out of the cooling air men looking up near blinded at the star saw that a black disc was creeping across the light it was the moon coming between the star and the earth and even as men cried to god at this respite out of the east with a strange inexplicable swiftness sprang the sun and then star sun and moon rushed together across the heavens  so it was that presently to the european watchers star and sun rose close upon each other drove headlong for a space and then slower and at last came to rest star and sun merged into one glare of flame at the zenith of the sky the moon no longer eclipsed the star but was lost to sight in the brilliance of the sky and though those who were still alive regarded it for the most part with that dull stupidity that hunger fatigue heat and despair engender there were still men who could perceive the meaning of these signs star and earth had been at their nearest had swung about one another and the star had passed already it was receding swifter and swifter in the last stage of its headlong journey downward into the sun  and then the clouds gathered blotting out the vision of the sky the thunder and lightning wove a garment round the world all over the earth was such a downpour of rain as men had never before seen and where the volcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy there descended torrents of mud everywhere the waters were pouring off the land leaving mudsilted ruins and the earth littered like a stormworn beach with all that had floated and the dead bodies of the men and brutes its children for days the water streamed off the land sweeping away soil and trees and houses in the way and piling huge dykes and scooping out titanic gullies over the countryside those were the days of darkness that followed the star and the heat all through them and for many weeks and months the earthquakes continued  but the star had passed and men hungerdriven and gathering courage only slowly might creep back to their ruined cities buried granaries and sodden fields such few ships as had escaped the storms of that time came stunned and shattered and sounding their way cautiously through the new marks and shoals of once familiar ports and as the storms subsided men perceived that everywhere the days were hotter than of yore and the sun larger and the moon shrunk to a third of its former size took now fourscore days between its new and new  but of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men of the saving of laws and books and machines of the strange change that had come over iceland and greenland and the shores of baffins bay so that the sailors coming there presently found them green and gracious and could scarce believe their eyes this story does not tell nor of the movement of mankind now that the earth was hotter northward and southward towards the poles of the earth it concerns itself only with the coming and the passing of the star  the martian astronomersfor there are astronomers on mars although they are very different beings from menwere naturally profoundly interested by these things they saw them from their own standpoint of course considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was flung through our solar system into the sun one wrote it is astonishing what a little damage the earth which it missed so narrowly has sustained all the familiar continental markings and the masses of the seas remain intact and indeed the only difference seems to be a shrinkage of the white discolouration supposed to be frozen water round either pole which only shows how small the vastest of human catastrophes may seem at a distance of a few million miles       xxi    the man who could work miracles    a pantoum in prose   it is doubtful whether the gift was innate for my own part i think it came to him suddenly indeed until he was thirty he was a sceptic and did not believe in miraculous powers and here since it is the most convenient place i must mention that he was a little man and had eyes of a hot brown very erect red hair a moustache with ends that he twisted up and freckles his name was george mcwhirter fotheringaynot the sort of name by any means to lead to any expectation of miraclesand he was clerk at gomshotts he was greatly addicted to assertive argument it was while he was asserting the impossibility of miracles that he had his first intimation of his extraordinary powers this particular argument was being held in the bar of the long dragon and toddy beamish was conducting the opposition by a monotonous but effective so you say that drove mr fotheringay to the very limit of his patience  there were present besides these two a very dusty cyclist landlord cox and miss maybridge the perfectly respectable and rather portly barmaid of the dragon miss maybridge was standing with her back to mr fotheringay washing glasses the others were watching him more or less amused by the present ineffectiveness of the assertive method goaded by the torres vedras tactics of mr beamish mr fotheringay determined to make an unusual rhetorical effort looky here mr beamish said mr fotheringay let us clearly understand what a miracle is its something contrariwise to the course of nature done by power of will something what couldnt happen without being specially willed  so you say said mr beamish repulsing him  mr fotheringay appealed to the cyclist who had hitherto been a silent auditor and received his assentgiven with a hesitating cough and a glance at mr beamish the landlord would express no opinion and mr fotheringay returning to mr beamish received the unexpected concession of a qualified assent to his definition of a miracle  for instance said mr fotheringay greatly encouraged here would be a miracle that lamp in the natural course of nature couldnt burn like that upsydown could it beamish  you say it couldnt said beamish  and you said fotheringay you dont mean to sayeh  no said beamish reluctantly no it couldnt  very well said mr fotheringay then here comes someone as it might be me along here and stands as it might be here and says to that lamp as i might do collecting all my willturn upsydown without breaking and go on burning steady andhullo  it was enough to make anyone say hullo the impossible the incredible was visible to them all the lamp hung inverted in the air burning quietly with its flame pointing down it was as solid as indisputable as ever a lamp was the prosaic common lamp of the long dragon bar  mr fotheringay stood with an extended forefinger and the knitted brows of one anticipating a catastrophic smash the cyclist who was sitting next the lamp ducked and jumped across the bar everybody jumped more or less miss maybridge turned and screamed for nearly three seconds the lamp remained still a faint cry of mental distress came from mr fotheringay i cant keep it up he said any longer he staggered back and the inverted lamp suddenly flared fell against the corner of the bar bounced aside smashed upon the floor and went out  it was lucky it had a metal receiver or the whole place would have been in a blaze mr cox was the first to speak and his remark shorn of needless excrescences was to the effect that fotheringay was a fool fotheringay was beyond disputing even so fundamental a proposition as that he was astonished beyond measure at the thing that had occurred the subsequent conversation threw absolutely no light on the matter so far as fotheringay was concerned the general opinion not only followed mr cox very closely but very vehemently everyone accused fotheringay of a silly trick and presented him to himself as a foolish destroyer of comfort and security his mind was in a tornado of perplexity he was himself inclined to agree with them and he made a remarkably ineffectual opposition to the proposal of his departure  he went home flushed and heated coatcollar crumpled eyes smarting and ears red he watched each of the ten street lamps nervously as he passed it it was only when he found himself alone in his little bedroom in church row that he was able to grapple seriously with his memories of the occurrence and ask what on earth happened  he had removed his coat and boots and was sitting on the bed with his hands in his pockets repeating the text of his defence for the seventeenth time i didnt want the confounded thing to upset when it occurred to him that at the precise moment he had said the commanding words he had inadvertently willed the thing he said and that when he had seen the lamp in the air he had felt that it depended on him to maintain it there without being clear how this was to be done he had not a particularly complex mind or he might have stuck for a time at that inadvertently willed embracing as it does the abstrusest problems of voluntary action but as it was the idea came to him with a quite acceptable haziness and from that following as i must admit no clear logical path he came to the test of experiment  he pointed resolutely to his candle and collected his mind though he felt he did a foolish thing be raised up he said but in a second that feeling vanished the candle was raised hung in the air one giddy moment and as mr fotheringay gasped fell with a smash on his toilettable leaving him in darkness save for the expiring glow of its wick  for a time mr fotheringay sat in the darkness perfectly still it did happen after all he said and ow im to explain it i dont know he sighed heavily and began feeling in his pockets for a match he could find none and he rose and groped about the toilettable i wish i had a match he said he resorted to his coat and there was none there and then it dawned upon him that miracles were possible even with matches he extended a hand and scowled at it in the dark let there be a match in that hand he said he felt some light object fall across his palm and his fingers closed upon a match  after several ineffectual attempts to light this he discovered it was a safety match he threw it down and then it occurred to him that he might have willed it lit he did and perceived it burning in the midst of his toilettable mat he caught it up hastily and it went out his perception of possibilities enlarged and he felt for and replaced the candle in its candlestick here you be lit said mr fotheringay and forthwith the candle was flaring and he saw a little black hole in the toiletcover with a wisp of smoke rising from it for a time he stared from this to the little flame and back and then looked up and met his own gaze in the lookingglass by this help he communed with himself in silence for a time  how about miracles now said mr fotheringay at last addressing his reflection  the subsequent meditations of mr fotheringay were of a severe but confused description so far he could see it was a case of pure willing with him the nature of his experiences so far disinclined him for any further experiments at least until he had reconsidered them but he lifted a sheet of paper and turned a glass of water pink and then green and he created a snail which he miraculously annihilated and got himself a miraculous new toothbrush somewhere in the small hours he had reached the fact that his willpower must be of a particularly rare and pungent quality a fact of which he had indeed had inklings before but no certain assurance the scare and perplexity of his first discovery was now qualified by pride in this evidence of singularity and by vague intimations of advantage he became aware that the church clock was striking one and as it did not occur to him that his daily duties at gomshotts might be miraculously dispensed with he resumed undressing in order to get to bed without further delay as he struggled to get his shirt over his head he was struck with a brilliant idea let me be in bed he said and found himself so undressed he stipulated and finding the sheets cold added hastily and in my nightshirtho in a nice soft woollen nightshirt ah he said with immense enjoyment and now let me be comfortably asleep  he awoke at his usual hour and was pensive all through breakfasttime wondering whether his overnight experience might not be a particularly vivid dream at length his mind turned again to cautious experiments for instance he had three eggs for breakfast two his landlady had supplied good but shoppy and one was a delicious fresh gooseegg laid cooked and served by his extraordinary will he hurried off to gomshotts in a state of profound but carefully concealed excitement and only remembered the shell of the third egg when his landlady spoke of it that night all day he could do no work because of this astonishing new selfknowledge but this caused him no inconvenience because he made up for it miraculously in his last ten minutes  as the day wore on his state of mind passed from wonder to elation albeit the circumstances of his dismissal from the long dragon were still disagreeable to recall and a garbled account of the matter that had reached his colleagues led to some badinage it was evident he must be careful how he lifted frangible articles but in other ways his gift promised more and more as he turned it over in his mind he intended among other things to increase his personal property by unostentatious acts of creation he called into existence a pair of very splendid diamond studs and hastily annihilated them again as young gomshott came across the countinghouse to his desk he was afraid young gomshott might wonder how he had come by them he saw quite clearly the gift required caution and watchfulness in its exercise but so far as he could judge the difficulties attending its mastery would be no greater than those he had already faced in the study of cycling it was that analogy perhaps quite as much as the feeling that he would be unwelcome in the long dragon that drove him out after supper into the lane beyond the gasworks to rehearse a few miracles in private  there was possibly a certain want of originality in his attempts for apart from his willpower mr fotheringay was not a very exceptional man the miracle of moses rod came to his mind but the night was dark and unfavourable to the proper control of large miraculous snakes then he recollected the story of tannhäuser that he had read on the back of the philharmonic programme that seemed to him singularly attractive and harmless he stuck his walkingsticka very nice poonapenang lawyer into the turf that edged the footpath and commanded the dry wood to blossom the air was immediately full of the scent of roses and by means of a match he saw for himself that this beautiful miracle was indeed accomplished his satisfaction was ended by advancing footsteps afraid of a premature discovery of his powers he addressed the blossoming stick hastily go back what he meant was change back but of course he was confused the stick receded at a considerable velocity and incontinently came a cry of anger and a bad word from the approaching person who are you throwing brambles at you fool cried a voice that got me on the shin  im sorry old chap said mr fotheringay and then realising the awkward nature of the explanation caught nervously at his moustache he saw winch one of the three immering constables advancing  what dyer mean by it asked the constable hullo its you is it the gent that broke the lamp at the long dragon  i dont mean anything by it said mr fotheringay nothing at all  what dyer do it for then  oh bother said mr fotheringay  bother indeed dyer know that stick hurt what dyer do it for eh  for the moment mr fotheringay could not think what he had done it for his silence seemed to irritate mr winch youve been assaulting the police young man this time thats what you done  look here mr winch said mr fotheringay annoyed and confused im sorry very the fact is  well  he could think of no way but the truth i was working a miracle he tried to speak in an offhand way but try as he would he couldnt  working a ere dont you talk rot working a miracle indeed miracle well thats downright funny why yous the chap that dont believe in miracles fact is this is another of your silly conjuring tricksthats what this is now i tell you  but mr fotheringay never heard what mr winch was going to tell him he realised he had given himself away flung his valuable secret to all the winds of heaven a violent gust of irritation swept him to action he turned on the constable swiftly and fiercely here he said ive had enough of this i have ill show you a silly conjuring trick i will go to hades go now  he was alone  mr fotheringay performed no more miracles that night nor did he trouble to see what had become of his flowering stick he returned to the town scared and very quiet and went to his bedroom lord he said its a powerful giftan extremely powerful gift i didnt hardly mean as much as that not really i wonder what hades is like  he sat on the bed taking off his boots struck by a happy thought he transferred the constable to san francisco and without any more interference with normal causation went soberly to bed in the night he dreamt of the anger of winch  the next day mr fotheringay heard two interesting items of news someone had planted a most beautiful climbing rose against the elder mr gomshotts private house in the lullaborough road and the river as far as rawlings mill was to be dragged for constable winch  mr fotheringay was abstracted and thoughtful all that day and performed no miracles except certain provisions for winch and the miracle of completing his days work with punctual perfection in spite of all the beeswarm of thoughts that hummed through his mind and the extraordinary abstraction and meekness of his manner was remarked by several people and made a matter for jesting for the most part he was thinking of winch  on sunday evening he went to chapel and oddly enough mr maydig who took a certain interest in occult matters preached about things that are not lawful mr fotheringay was not a regular chapelgoer but the system of assertive scepticism to which i have already alluded was now very much shaken the tenor of the sermon threw an entirely new light on these novel gifts and he suddenly decided to consult mr maydig immediately after the service so soon as that was determined he found himself wondering why he had not done so before  mr maydig a lean excitable man with quite remarkably long wrists and neck was gratified at a request for a private conversation from a young man whose carelessness in religious matters was a subject for general remark in the town after a few necessary delays he conducted him to the study of the manse which was contiguous to the chapel seated him comfortably and standing in front of a cheerful firehis legs threw a rhodian arch of shadow on the opposite wallrequested mr fotheringay to state his business  at first mr fotheringay was a little abashed and found some difficulty in opening the matter you will scarcely believe me mr maydig i am afraidand so forth for some time he tried a question at last and asked mr maydig his opinion of miracles  mr maydig was still saying well in an extremely judicial tone when mr fotheringay interrupted again you dont believe i suppose that some common sort of personlike myself for instanceas it might be sitting here now might have some sort of twist inside him that made him able to do things by his will  its possible said mr maydig something of the sort perhaps is possible  if i might make free with something here i think i might show you by a sort of experiment said mr fotheringay now take that tobaccojar on the table for instance what i want to know is whether what i am going to do with it is a miracle or not just half a minute mr maydig please  he knitted his brows pointed to the tobaccojar and said be a bowl of vilets  the tobaccojar did as it was ordered  mr maydig started violently at the change and stood looking from the thaumaturgist to the bowl of flowers he said nothing presently he ventured to lean over the table and smell the violets they were freshpicked and very fine ones then he stared at mr fotheringay again  how did you do that he asked  mr fotheringay pulled his moustache just told itand there you are is that a miracle or is it black art or what is it and what do you thinks the matter with me thats what i want to ask  its a most extraordinary occurrence  and this day last week i knew no more that i could do things like that than you did it came quite sudden its something odd about my will i suppose and thats as far as i can see  is thatthe only thing could you do other things besides that  lord yes said mr fotheringay just anything he thought and suddenly recalled a conjuring entertainment he had seen here he pointed change into a bowl of fishno not thatchange into a glass bowl full of water with goldfish swimming in it thats better you see that mr maydig  its astonishing its incredible you are either a most extraordinary but no  i could change it into anything said mr fotheringay just anything here be a pigeon will you  in another moment a blue pigeon was fluttering round the room and making mr maydig duck every time it came near him stop there will you said mr fotheringay and the pigeon hung motionless in the air i could change it back to a bowl of flowers he said and after replacing the pigeon on the table worked that miracle i expect you will want your pipe in a bit he said and restored the tobaccojar  mr maydig had followed all these later changes in a sort of ejaculatory silence he stared at mr fotheringay and in a very gingerly manner picked up the tobaccojar examined it replaced it on the table well was the only expression of his feelings  now after that its easier to explain what i came about said mr fotheringay and proceeded to a lengthy and involved narrative of his strange experiences beginning with the affair of the lamp in the long dragon and complicated by persistent allusions to winch as he went on the transient pride mr maydigs consternation had caused passed away he became the very ordinary mr fotheringay of everyday intercourse again mr maydig listened intently the tobaccojar in his hand and his bearing changed also with the course of the narrative presently while mr fotheringay was dealing with the miracle of the third egg the minister interrupted with a fluttering extended hand  it is possible he said it is credible it is amazing of course but it reconciles a number of amazing difficulties the power to work miracles is a gifta peculiar quality like genius or second sight hitherto it has come very rarely and to exceptional people but in this casei have always wondered at the miracles of mahomet and at yogis miracles and the miracles of madame blavatsky but of courseyes it is simply a gift it carries out so beautifully the arguments of that great thinker mr maydigs voice sankhis grace the duke of argyll here we plumb some profounder lawdeeper than the ordinary laws of nature yesyes go on go on  mr fotheringay proceeded to tell of his misadventure with winch and mr maydig no longer overawed or scared began to jerk his limbs about and interject astonishment its this what troubled me most proceeded mr fotheringay its this im most mijitly in want of advice for of course hes at san franciscowherever san francisco may bebut of course its awkward for both of us as youll see mr maydig i dont see how he can understand what has happened and i daresay hes scared and exasperated something tremendous and trying to get at me i daresay he keeps on starting off to come here i send him back by a miracle every few hours when i think of it and of course thats a thing he wont be able to understand and its bound to annoy him and of course if he takes a ticket every time it will cost him a lot of money i done the best i could for him but of course its difficult for him to put himself in my place i thought afterwards that his clothes might have got scorched you knowif hades is all its supposed to bebefore i shifted him in that case i suppose theyd have locked him up in san francisco of course i willed him a new suit of clothes on him directly i thought of it but you see im already in a deuce of a tangle  mr maydig looked serious i see you are in a tangle yes its a difficult position how you are to end it he became diffuse and inconclusive  however well leave winch for a little and discuss the larger question i dont think this is a case of the black art or anything of the sort i dont think there is any taint of criminality about it at all mr fotheringaynone whatever unless you are suppressing material facts no its miraclespure miraclesmiracles if i may say so of the very highest class  he began to pace the hearthrug and gesticulate while mr fotheringay sat with his arm on the table and his head on his arm looking worried i dont see how im to manage about winch he said  a gift of working miraclesapparently a very powerful gift said mr maydig will find a way about winchnever fear my dear sir you are a most important mana man of the most astonishing possibilities as evidence for example and in other ways the things you may do  yes ive thought of a thing or two said mr fotheringay but some of the things came a bit twisty you saw that fish at first wrong sort of bowl and wrong sort of fish and i thought id ask someone  a proper course said mr maydig a very proper coursealtogether the proper course he stopped and looked at mr fotheringay its practically an unlimited gift let us test your powers for instance if they really are  if they really are all they seem to be  and so incredible as it may seem in the study of the little house behind the congregational chapel on the evening of sunday nov 10 1896 mr fotheringay egged on and inspired by mr maydig began to work miracles the readers attention is specially and definitely called to the date he will object probably has already objected that certain points in this story are improbable that if any things of the sort already described had indeed occurred they would have been in all the papers at that time the details immediately following he will find particularly hard to accept because among other things they involve the conclusion that he or she the reader in question must have been killed in a violent and unprecedented manner more than a year ago now a miracle is nothing if not improbable and as a matter of fact the reader was killed in a violent and unprecedented manner in 1896 in the subsequent course of this story that will become perfectly clear and credible as every rightminded and reasonable reader will admit but this is not the place for the end of the story being but little beyond the hither side of the middle and at first the miracles worked by mr fotheringay were timid little miracleslittle things with the cups and parlour fitments as feeble as the miracles of theosophists and feeble as they were they were received with awe by his collaborator he would have preferred to settle the winch business out of hand but mr maydig would not let him but after they had worked a dozen of these domestic trivialities their sense of power grew their imagination began to show signs of stimulation and their ambition enlarged their first larger enterprise was due to hunger and the negligence of mrs minchin mr maydigs housekeeper the meal to which the minister conducted mr fotheringay was certainly illlaid and uninviting as refreshment for two industrious miracleworkers but they were seated and mr maydig was descanting in sorrow rather than in anger upon his housekeepers shortcomings before it occurred to mr fotheringay that an opportunity lay before him dont you think mr maydig he said if it isnt a liberty i  my dear mr fotheringay of course noi didnt think  mr fotheringay waved his hand what shall we have he said in a large inclusive spirit and at mr maydigs order revised the supper very thoroughly as for me he said eyeing mr maydigs selection i am always particularly fond of a tankard of stout and a nice welsh rarebit and ill order that i aint much given to burgundy and forthwith stout and welsh rarebit promptly appeared at his command they sat long at their supper talking like equals as mr fotheringay presently perceived with a glow of surprise and gratification of all the miracles they would presently do and bytheby mr maydig said mr fotheringay i might perhaps be able to help youin a domestic way  dont quite follow said mr maydig pouring out a glass of miraculous old burgundy  mr fotheringay helped himself to a second welsh rarebit out of vacancy and took a mouthful i was thinking he said i might be able chum chum to work chum chum a miracle with mrs minchin chum chummake her a better woman  mr maydig put down the glass and looked doubtful  shesshe strongly objects to interference you know mr fotheringay andas a matter of factits well past eleven and shes probably in bed and asleep do you think on the whole  mr fotheringay considered these objections i dont see that it shouldnt be done in her sleep  for a time mr maydig opposed the idea and then he yielded mr fotheringay issued his orders and a little less at their ease perhaps the two gentlemen proceeded with their repast mr maydig was enlarging on the changes he might expect in his housekeeper next day with an optimism that seemed even to mr fotheringays supper senses a little forced and hectic when a series of confused noises from upstairs began their eyes exchanged interrogations and mr maydig left the room hastily mr fotheringay heard him calling up to his housekeeper and then his footsteps going softly up to her  in a minute or so the minister returned his step light his face radiant wonderful he said and touching most touching  he began pacing the hearthrug a repentancea most touching repentance through the crack of the door poor woman a most wonderful change she had got up she must have got up at once she had got up out of her sleep to smash a private bottle of brandy in her box and to confess it too but this gives usit opensa most amazing vista of possibilities if we can work this miraculous change in her  the things unlimited seemingly said mr fotheringay and about mr winch  altogether unlimited and from the hearthrug mr maydig waving the winch difficulty aside unfolded a series of wonderful proposals proposals he invented as he went along  now what those proposals were does not concern the essentials of this story suffice it that they were designed in a spirit of infinite benevolence the sort of benevolence that used to be called postprandial suffice it too that the problem of winch remained unsolved nor is it necessary to describe how far that series got to its fulfilment there were astonishing changes the small hours found mr maydig and mr fotheringay careering across the chilly market square under the still moon in a sort of ecstasy of thaumaturgy mr maydig all flap and gesture mr fotheringay short and bristling and no longer abashed at his greatness they had reformed every drunkard in the parliamentary division changed all the beer and alcohol to water mr maydig had overruled mr fotheringay on this point they had further greatly improved the railway communication of the place drained flinders swamp improved the soil of one tree hill and cured the vicars wart and they were going to see what could be done with the injured pier at south bridge the place gasped mr maydig wont be the same place tomorrow how surprised and thankful everyone will be and just at that moment the church clock struck three  i say said mr fotheringay thats three oclock i must be getting back ive got to be at business by eight and besides mrs wimms  were only beginning said mr maydig full of the sweetness of unlimited power were only beginning think of all the good were doing when people wake  but said mr fotheringay  mr maydig gripped his arm suddenly his eyes were bright and wild my dear chap he said theres no hurry lookhe pointed to the moon at the zenithjoshua  joshua said mr fotheringay  joshua said mr maydig why not stop it  mr fotheringay looked at the moon  thats a bit tall he said after a pause  why not said mr maydig of course it doesnt stop you stop the rotation of the earth you know time stops it isnt as if we were doing harm  hm said mr fotheringay well he sighed ill try here  he buttoned up his jacket and addressed himself to the habitable globe with as good an assumption of confidence as lay in his power jest stop rotating will you said mr fotheringay  incontinently he was flying head over heels through the air at the rate of dozens of miles a minute in spite of the innumerable circles he was describing per second he thought for thought is wonderfulsometimes as sluggish as flowing pitch sometimes as instantaneous as light he thought in a second and willed let me come down safe and sound whatever else happens let me down safe and sound  he willed it only just in time for his clothes heated by his rapid flight through the air were already beginning to singe he came down with a forcible but by no means injurious bump in what appeared to be a mound of freshturned earth a large mass of metal and masonry extraordinarily like the clocktower in the middle of the market square hit the earth near him ricochetted over him and flew into stonework bricks and cement like a bursting bomb a hurtling cow hit one of the larger blocks and smashed like an egg there was a crash that made all the most violent crashes of his past life seem like the sound of falling dust and this was followed by a descending series of lesser crashes a vast wind roared throughout earth and heaven so that he could scarcely lift his head to look for a while he was too breathless and astonished even to see where he was or what had happened and his first movement was to feel his head and reassure himself that his streaming hair was still his own  lord gasped mr fotheringay scarce able to speak for the gale ive had a squeak whats gone wrong storms and thunder and only a minute ago a fine night its maydig set me on to this sort of thing what a wind if i go on fooling in this way im bound to have a thundering accident  wheres maydig  what a confounded mess everythings in  he looked about him so far as his flapping jacket would permit the appearance of things was really extremely strange the skys all right anyhow said mr fotheringay and thats about all that is all right and even there it looks like a terrific gale coming up but theres the moon overhead just as it was just now bright as midday but as for the restwheres the village whereswheres anything and what on earth set this wind ablowing i didnt order no wind  mr fotheringay struggled to get to his feet in vain and after one failure remained on all fours holding on he surveyed the moonlit world to leeward with the tails of his jacket streaming over his head theres something seriously wrong said mr fotheringay and what it is goodness knows  far and wide nothing was visible in the white glare through the haze of dust that drove before a screaming gale but tumbled masses of earth and heaps of inchoate ruins no trees no houses no familiar shapes only a wilderness of disorder vanishing at last into the darkness beneath the whirling columns and streamers the lightnings and thunderings of a swiftly rising storm near him in the livid glare was something that might once have been an elmtree a smashed mass of splinters shivered from boughs to base and further a twisted mass of iron girdersonly too evidently the viaductrose out of the piled confusion  you see when mr fotheringay had arrested the rotation of the solid globe he had made no stipulation concerning the trifling movables upon its surface and the earth spins so fast that the surface at its equator is travelling at rather more than a thousand miles an hour and in these latitudes at more than half that pace so that the village and mr maydig and mr fotheringay and everybody and everything had been jerked violently forward at about nine miles per secondthat is to say much more violently than if they had been fired out of a cannon and every human being every living creature every house and every treeall the world as we know ithad been so jerked and smashed and utterly destroyed that was all  these things mr fotheringay did not of course fully appreciate but he perceived that his miracle had miscarried and with that a great disgust of miracles came upon him he was in darkness now for the clouds had swept together and blotted out his momentary glimpse of the moon and the air was full of fitful struggling tortured wraiths of hail a great roaring of wind and waters filled earth and sky and peering under his hand through the dust and sleet to windward he saw by the play of the lightnings a vast wall of water pouring towards him  maydig screamed mr fotheringays feeble voice amid the elemental uproar heremaydig  stop cried mr fotheringay to the advancing water oh for goodness sake stop  just a moment said mr fotheringay to the lightnings and thunder stop jest a moment while i collect my thoughts and now what shall i do he said what shall i do lord i wish maydig was about  i know said mr fotheringay and for goodness sake lets have it right this time  he remained on all fours leaning against the wind very intent to have everything right  ah he said let nothing what im going to order happen until i say offlord i wish id thought of that before  he lifted his little voice against the whirlwind shouting louder and louder in the vain desire to hear himself speak now thenhere goes mind about that what i said just now in the first place when all ive got to say is done let me lose my miraculous power let my will become just like anybody elses will and all these dangerous miracles be stopped i dont like them id rather i didnt work em ever so much thats the first thing and the second islet me be back just before the miracles begin let everything be just as it was before that blessed lamp turned up its a big job but its the last have you got it no more miracles everything as it wasme back in the long dragon just before i drank my halfpint thats it yes  he dug his fingers into the mould closed his eyes and said off  everything became perfectly still he perceived that he was standing erect  so you say said a voice  he opened his eyes he was in the bar of the long dragon arguing about miracles with toddy beamish he had a vague sense of some great thing forgotten that instantaneously passed you see that except for the loss of his miraculous powers everything was back as it had been his mind and memory therefore were now just as they had been at the time when this story began so that he knew absolutely nothing of all that is told here knows nothing of all that is told here to this day and among other things of course he still did not believe in miracles  i tell you that miracles properly speaking cant possibly happen he said whatever you like to hold and im prepared to prove it up to the hilt  thats what you think said toddy beamish and prove it if you can  looky here mr beamish said mr fotheringay let us clearly understand what a miracle is its something contrariwise to the course of nature done by power of will       xxii    a vision of judgment   i  bruaaa  i listened not understanding  wararara  good lord said i still only half awake what an infernal shindy  rarararararararara tararrara  its enough said i to wake and stopped short where was i  tarrararalouder and louder  its either some new invention  tooratooratoora deafening  no said i speaking loud in order to hear myself thats the last trump  tooorraa   ii  the last note jerked me out of my grave like a hooked minnow  i saw my monument rather a mean little affair and i wished i knew whod done it and the old elm tree and the sea view vanished like a puff of steam and then all about mea multitude no man could number nations tongues kingdoms peopleschildren of all the ages in an amphitheatral space as vast as the sky and over against us seated on a throne of dazzling white cloud the lord god and all the host of his angels i recognised azrael by his darkness and michael by his sword and the great angel who had blown the trumpet stood with the trumpet still half raised   iii  prompt said the little man beside me very prompt do you see the angel with the book  he was ducking and craning his head about to see over and under and between the souls that crowded round us everybodys here he said everybody and now we shall know  theres darwin he said going off at a tangent hell catch it and thereyou seethat tall importantlooking man trying to catch the eye of the lord god thats the duke but theres a lot of people one doesnt know  oh theres priggles the publisher i have always wondered about printers overs priggles was a clever man  but we shall know noweven about him  i shall hear all that i shall get most of the fun before  my letters s  he drew the air in between his teeth  historical characters too see thats henry the eighth therell be a good bit of evidence oh damn hes tudor  he lowered his voice notice this chap just in front of us all covered with hair paleolithic you know and there again  but i did not heed him because i was looking at the lord god   iv  is this all asked the lord god  the angel at the bookit was one of countless volumes like the british museum readingroom catalogue glanced at us and seemed to count us in the instant  thats all he said and added it was o god a very little planet  the eyes of god surveyed us  let us begin said the lord god   v  the angel opened the book and read a name it was a name full of as and the echoes of it came back out of the uttermost parts of space i did not catch it clearly because the little man beside me said in a sharp jerk whats that it sounded like ahab to me but it could not have been the ahab of scripture  instantly a small black figure was lifted up to a puffy cloud at the very feet of god it was a stiff little figure dressed in rich outlandish robes and crowned and it folded its arms and scowled  well said god looking down at him  we were privileged to hear the reply and indeed the acoustic properties of the place were marvellous  i plead guilty said the little figure  tell them what you have done said the lord god  i was a king said the little figure a great king and i was lustful and proud and cruel i made wars i devastated countries i built palaces and the mortar was the blood of men hear o god the witnesses against me calling to you for vengeance hundreds and thousands of witnesses he waved his hands towards us and worse i took a prophetone of your prophets  one of my prophets said the lord god  and because he would not bow to me i tortured him for four days and nights and in the end he died i did more o god i blasphemed i robbed you of your honours  robbed me of my honours said the lord god  i caused myself to be worshipped in your stead no evil was there but i practised it no cruelty wherewith i did not stain my soul and at last you smote me o god  god raised his eyebrows slightly  and i was slain in battle and so i stand before you meet for your nethermost hell out of your greatness daring no lies daring no pleas but telling the truth of my iniquities before all mankind  he ceased his face i saw distinctly and it seemed to me white and terrible and proud and strangely noble i thought of miltons satan  most of that is from the obelisk said the recording angel finger on page  it is said the tyrannous man with a faint touch of surprise  then suddenly god bent forward and took this man in his hand and held him up on his palm as if to see him better he was just a little dark stroke in the middle of gods palm  did he do all this said the lord god  the recording angel flattened his book with his hand  in a way said the recording angel carelessly now when i looked again at the little man his face had changed in a very curious manner he was looking at the recording angel with a strange apprehension in his eyes and one hand fluttered to his mouth just the movement of a muscle or so and all that dignity of defiance was gone  read said the lord god  and the angel read explaining very carefully and fully all the wickedness of the wicked man it was quite an intellectual treata little daring in places i thought but of course heaven has its privileges   vi  everybody was laughing even the prophet of the lord whom the wicked man had tortured had a smile on his face the wicked man was really such a preposterous little fellow  and then read the recording angel with a smile that set us all agog one day when he was a little irascible from overeating he  oh not that cried the wicked man nobody knew of that  it didnt happen screamed the wicked man i was badi was really bad frequently bad but there was nothing so sillyso absolutely silly  the angel went on reading  o god cried the wicked man dont let them know that ill repent ill apologise  the wicked man on gods hand began to dance and weep suddenly shame overcame him he made a wild rush to jump off the ball of gods little finger but god stopped him by a dexterous turn of the wrist then he made a rush for the gap between hand and thumb but the thumb closed and all the while the angel went on readingreading the wicked man rushed to and fro across gods palm and then suddenly turned about and fled up the sleeve of god  i expected god would turn him out but the mercy of god is infinite  the recording angel paused  eh said the recording angel  next said god and before the recording angel could call the name a hairy creature in filthy rags stood upon gods palm   vii  has god got hell up his sleeve then said the little man beside me  is there a hell i asked  if you notice he saidhe peered between the feet of the great angels theres no particular indication of a celestial city  ssh said a little woman near us scowling hear this blessed saint   viii  he was lord of the earth but i was the prophet of the god of heaven cried the saint and all the people marvelled at the sign for i o god knew of the glories of thy paradise no pain no hardship gashing with knives splinters thrust under my nails strips of flesh flayed off all for the glory and honour of god  god smiled  and at last i went i in my rags and sores smelling of my holy discomforts  gabriel laughed abruptly  and lay outside his gates as a sign as a wonder  as a perfect nuisance said the recording angel and began to read heedless of the fact that the saint was still speaking of the gloriously unpleasant things he had done that paradise might be his  and behold in that book the record of the saint also was a revelation a marvel  it seemed not ten seconds before the saint also was rushing to and fro over the great palm of god not ten seconds and at last he also shrieked beneath that pitiless and cynical exposition and fled also even as the wicked man had fled into the shadow of the sleeve and it was permitted us to see into the shadow of the sleeve and the two sat side by side stark of all delusions in the shadow of the robe of gods charity like brothers  and thither also i fled in my turn   ix  and now said god as he shook us out of his sleeve upon the planet he had given us to live upon the planet that whirled about green sirius for a sun now that you understand me and each other a little bettertry again  then he and his great angels turned themselves about and suddenly had vanished  the throne had vanished  all about me was a beautiful land more beautiful than any i had ever seen beforewaste austere and wonderful and all about me were the enlightened souls of men in new clean bodies       xxiii    jimmy goggles the god   it isnt every one whos been a god said the sunburnt man but its happened to meamong other things  i intimated my sense of his condescension  it dont leave much for ambition does it said the sunburnt man  i was one of those men who were saved from the ocean pioneer gummy how time flies its twenty years ago i doubt if youll remember anything of the ocean pioneer  the name was familiar and i tried to recall when and where i had read it the ocean pioneer something about gold dust i said vaguely but the precise  thats it he said in a beastly little channel she hadnt no business indodging pirates it was before theyd put the kybosh on that business and thered been volcanoes or something and all the rocks was wrong theres places about by soona where you fair have to follow the rocks about to see where theyre going next down she went in twenty fathoms before you could have dealt for whist with fifty thousand pounds worth of gold aboard it was said in one form or another  survivors  three  i remember the case now i said there was something about salvage  but at the word salvage the sunburnt man exploded into language so extraordinarily horrible that i stopped aghast he came down to more ordinary swearing and pulled himself up abruptly excuse me he said butsalvage  he leant over towards me i was in that job he said tried to make myself a rich man and got made a god instead ive got my feelings  it aint all jam being a god said the sunburnt man and for some time conversed by means of such pithy but unprogressive axioms at last he took up his tale again  there was me said the sunburnt man and a seaman named jacobs and always the mate of the ocean pioneer and him it was that set the whole thing going i remember him now when we was in the jollyboat suggesting it all to our minds just by one sentence he was a wonderful hand at suggesting things there was forty thousand pounds he said on that ship and its for me to say just where she went down it didnt need much brains to tumble to that and he was the leader from the first to the last he got hold of the sanderses and their brig they were brothers and the brig was the pride of banya and he it was bought the diving dressa secondhand one with a compressed air apparatus instead of pumping hed have done the diving too if it hadnt made him sick going down and the salvage people were mucking about with a chart hed cooked up as solemn as could be at starr race a hundred and twenty miles away  i can tell you we was a happy lot aboard that brig jokes and drink and bright hopes all the time it all seemed so neat and clean and straightforward and what rough chaps call a cert and we used to speculate how the other blessed lot the proper salvagers whod started two days before us were getting on until our sides fairly ached we all messed together in the sanderses cabinit was a curious crew all officers and no menand there stood the divingdress waiting its turn young sanders was a humorous sort of chap and there certainly was something funny in the confounded things great fat head and its stare and he made us see it too jimmy goggles he used to call it and talk to it like a christian asked if he was married and how mrs goggles was and all the little goggleses fit to make you split and every blessed day all of us used to drink the health of jimmy goggles in rum and unscrew his eye and pour a glass of rum in him until instead of that nasty mackintosheriness he smelt as nice in his inside as a cask of rum it was jolly times we had in those days i can tell youlittle suspecting poor chaps what was acoming  we werent going to throw away our chances by any blessed hurry you know and we spent a whole day sounding our way towards where the ocean pioneer had gone down right between two chunks of ropy grey rocklava rocks that rose nearly out of the water we had to lay off about half a mile to get a safe anchorage and there was a thundering row who should stop on board and there she lay just as she had gone down so that you could see the top of the masts that was still standing perfectly distinctly the row ended in all coming in the boat i went down in the divingdress on friday morning directly it was light  what a surprise it was i can see it all now quite distinctly it was a queerlooking place and the light was just coming people over here think every blessed place in the tropics is a flat shore and palmtrees and surf bless em this place for instance wasnt a bit that way not common rocks they were undermined by waves but great curved banks like ironwork cinder heaps with green slime below and thorny shrubs and things just waving upon them here and there and the water glassy calm and clear and showing you a kind of dirty grayblack shine with huge flaring redbrown weeds spreading motionless and crawling and darting things going through it and far away beyond the ditches and pools and the heaps was a forest on the mountain flank growing again after the fires and cinder showers of the last eruption and the other way forest too and a kind of brokenwhat is itambytheatre of black and rusty cinders rising out of it all and the sea in a kind of bay in the middle  the dawn i say was just coming and there wasnt much colour about things and not a human being but ourselves anywhere in sight up or down the channel except the pride of banya lying out beyond a lump of rocks towards the line of the sea  not a human being in sight he repeated and paused  i dont know where they came from not a bit and we were feeling so safe that we were all alone that poor young sanders was asinging i was in jimmy goggles all except the helmet easy says always theres her mast and after id had just one squint over the gunwale i caught up the bogey and almost tipped out as old sanders brought the boat round when the windows were screwed and everything was all right i shut the valve from the airbelt in order to help my sinking and jumped overboard feet foremostfor we hadnt a ladder i left the boat pitching and all of them staring down into water after me as my head sank down into the weeds and blackness that lay about the mast i suppose nobody not the most cautious chap in the world would have bothered about a lookout at such a desolate place it stunk of solitude  of course you must understand that i was a greenhorn at diving none of us were divers wed had to muck about with the thing to get the way of it and this was the first time id been deep it feels damnable your ears hurt beastly i dont know if youve ever hurt yourself yawning or sneezing but it takes you like that only ten times worse and a pain over the eyebrows heresplittingand a feeling like influenza in the head and it isnt all heaven in your lungs and things and going down feels like the beginning of a lift only it keeps on and you cant turn your head to see whats above you and you cant get a fair squint at whats happening to your feet without bending down something painful and being deep it was dark let alone the blackness of the ashes and mud that formed the bottom it was like going down out of the dawn back into the night so to speak  the mast came up like a ghost out of the black and then a lot of fishes and then a lot of flapping red seaweed and then whack i came with a kind of dull bang on the deck of the ocean pioneer and the fishes that had been feeding on the dead rose about me like a swarm of flies from road stuff in summertime i turned on the compressed air againfor the suit was a bit thick and mackintoshery after all in spite of the rumand stood recovering myself it struck coolish down there and that helped take off the stuffiness a bit  when i began to feel easier i started looking about me it was an extraordinary sight even the light was extraordinary a kind of reddycoloured twilight on account of the streamers of seaweed that floated up on either side of the ship and far overhead just a moony deep green blue the deck of the ship except for a slight list to starboard was level and lay all dark and long between the weeds clear except where the masts had snapped when she rolled and vanishing into black night towards the forecastle there wasnt any dead on the decks most were in the weeds alongside i suppose but afterwards i found two skeletons lying in the passengers cabins where death had come to them it was curious to stand on that deck and recognise it all bit by bit a place against the rail where id been fond of smoking by starlight and the corner where an old chap from sydney used to flirt with a widow we had aboard a comfortable couple theyd been only a month ago and now you couldnt have got a meal for a baby crab off either of them  ive always had a bit of a philosophical turn and i daresay i spent the best part of five minutes in such thoughts before i went below to find where the blessed dust was stored it was slow work hunting feeling it was for the most part pitchy dark with confusing blue gleams down the companion and there were things moving about a dab at my glass once and once a pinch at my leg crabs i expect i kicked a lot of loose stuff that puzzled me and stooped and picked up something all knobs and spikes what do you think backbone but i never had any particular feeling for bones we had talked the affair over pretty thoroughly and always knew just where the stuff was stowed i found it that trip i lifted a box one end an inch or more  he broke off in his story ive lifted it he said as near as that forty thousand pounds worth of pure gold gold i shouted inside my helmet as a kind of cheer and hurt my ears i was getting confounded stuffy and tired by this timei must have been down twentyfive minutes or moreand i thought this was good enough i went up the companion again and as my eyes came up flush with the deck a thundering great crab gave a kind of hysterical jump and went scuttling off sideways quite a start it gave me i stood up clear on deck and shut the valve behind the helmet to let the air accumulate to carry me up againi noticed a kind of whacking from above as though they were hitting the water with an oar but i didnt look up i fancied they were signalling me to come up  and then something shot down by mesomething heavy and stood aquiver in the planks i looked and there was a long knife id seen young sanders handling thinks i hes dropped it and i was still calling him this kind of fool and thatfor it might have hurt me seriouswhen i began to lift and drive up towards the daylight just about the level of the top spars of the ocean pioneer whack i came against something sinking down and a boot knocked in front of my helmet then something else struggling frightful it was a big weight atop of me whatever it was and moving and twisting about id have thought it a big octopus or some such thing if it hadnt been for the boot but octopuses dont wear boots it was all in a moment of course  i felt myself sinking down again and i threw my arms about to keep steady and the whole lot rolled free of me and shot down as i went up  he paused  i saw young sanderss face over a naked black shoulder and a spear driven clean through his neck and out of his mouth and neck what looked like spirts of pink smoke in the water and down they went clutching one another and turning over and both too far gone to leave go and in another second my helmet came a whack fit to split against the niggers canoe it was niggers two canoes full  it was lively times i tell you overboard came always with three spears in him there was the legs of three or four black chaps kicking about me in the water i couldnt see much but i saw the game was up at a glance gave my valve a tremendous twist and went bubbling down again after poor always in as awful a state of scare and astonishment as you can well imagine i passed young sanders and the nigger going up again and struggling still a bit and in another moment i was standing in the dim again on the deck of the ocean pioneer  gummy thinks i heres a fix niggers at first i couldnt see anything for it but stifle below or stabs above i didnt properly understand how much air there was to last me out but i didnt feel like standing very much more of it down below i was hot and frightfully heady quite apart from the blue funk i was in wed never reckoned with these beastly natives filthy papuan beasts it wasnt any good coming up where i was but i had to do something on the spur of the moment i clambered over the side of the brig and landed among the weeds and set off through the darkness as fast as i could i just stopped once and knelt and twisted back my head in the helmet and had a look up it was a most extraordinary bright greenblue above and the two canoes and the boat floating there very small and distant like a kind of twisted h and it made me feel sick to squint up at it and think what the pitching and swaying of the three meant  it was just about the most horrible ten minutes i ever had blundering about in that darknesspressure something awful like being buried in sand pain across the chest sick with funk and breathing nothing as it seemed but the smell of rum and mackintosh gummy after a bit i found myself going up a steepish sort of slope i had another squint to see if anything was visible of the canoes and boats and then kept on i stopped with my head a foot from the surface and tried to see where i was going but of course nothing was to be seen but the reflection of the bottom then out i dashed like knocking my head through a mirror directly i got my eyes out of the water i saw id come up a kind of beach near the forest i had a look round but the natives and the brig were both hidden by a big hummucky heap of twisted lava the born fool in me suggested a run for the woods i didnt take the helmet off but i eased open one of the windows and after a bit of a pant went on out of the water youd hardly imagine how clean and light the air tasted  of course with four inches of lead in your boot soles and your head in a copper knob the size of a football and been thirtyfive minutes under water you dont break any records running i ran like a ploughboy going to work and halfway to the trees i saw a dozen niggers or more coming out in a gaping astonished sort of way to meet me  i just stopped dead and cursed myself for all the fools out of london i had about as much chance of cutting back to the water as a turned turtle i just screwed up my window again to leave my hands free and waited for them there wasnt anything else for me to do  but they didnt come on very much i began to suspect why jimmy goggles i says its your beauty does it i was inclined to be a little lightheaded i think with all these dangers about and the change in the pressure of the blessed air whore ye staring at i said as if the savages could hear me what dye take me for im hanged if i dont give you something to stare at i said and with that i screwed up the escape valve and turned on the compressed air from the belt until i was swelled out like a blown frog regular imposing it must have been im blessed if theyd come on a step and presently one and then another went down on their hands and knees they didnt know what to make of me and they was doing the extra polite which was very wise and reasonable of them i had half a mind to edge back seaward and cut and run but it seemed too hopeless a step back and theyd have been after me and out of sheer desperation i began to march towards them up the beach with slow heavy steps and waving my blownout arms about in a dignified manner and inside of me i was singing as small as a tomtit  but theres nothing like a striking appearance to help a man over a difficultyive found that before and since people like ourselves whore up to diving dresses by the time were seven can scarcely imagine the effect of one on a simpleminded savage one or two of these niggers cut and run the others started in a great hurry trying to knock their brains out on the ground and on i went as slow and solemn and sillylooking and artful as a jobbing plumber it was evident they took me for something immense  then up jumped one and began pointing making extraordinary gestures to me as he did so and all the others began sharing their attention between me and something out at sea whats the matter now i said i turned slowly on account of my dignity and there i saw coming round a point the poor old pride of banya towed by a couple of canoes the sight fairly made me sick but they evidently expected some recognition so i waved my arms in a striking sort of noncommittal manner and then i turned and stalked on towards the trees again at that time i was praying like mad i remember over and over again lord help me through with it lord help me through with it its only fools who know nothing of danger can afford to laugh at praying  but these niggers werent going to let me walk through and away like that they started a kind of bowing dance about me and sort of pressed me to take a pathway that lay through the trees it was clear to me they didnt take me for a british citizen whatever else they thought of me and for my own part i was never less anxious to own up to the old country  youd hardly believe it perhaps unless youre familiar with savages but these poor misguided ignorant creatures took me straight to their kind of joss place to present me to the blessed old black stone there by this time i was beginning to sort of realise the depth of their ignorance and directly i set eyes on this deity i took my cue i started a baritone howl wowwow very long on one note and began waving my arms about a lot and then very slowly and ceremoniously turned their image over on its side and sat down on it i wanted to sit down badly for diving dresses aint much wear in the tropics or to put it different like theyre a sight too much it took away their breath i could see my sitting on their joss but in less time than a minute they made up their minds and were hard at work worshipping me and i can tell you i felt a bit relieved to see things turning out so well in spite of the weight on my shoulders and feet  but what made me anxious was what the chaps in the canoes might think when they came back if theyd seen me in the boat before i went down and without the helmet onfor they might have been spying and hiding since over nightthey would very likely take a different view from the others i was in a deuce of a stew about that for hours as it seemed until the shindy of the arrival began  but they took it downthe whole blessed village took it down at the cost of sitting up stiff and stern as much like those sitting egyptian images one sees as i could manage for pretty nearly twelve hours i should guess at least on end i got over it youd hardly think what it meant in that heat and stink i dont think any of them dreamt of the man inside i was just a wonderful leathery great joss that had come up with luck out of the water but the fatigue the heat the beastly closeness the mackintosheriness and the rum and the fuss they lit a stinking fire on a kind of lava slab there was before me and brought in a lot of gory muckthe worst parts of what they were feasting on outside the beasts and burnt it all in my honour i was getting a bit hungry but i understand now how gods manage to do without eating what with the smell of burntofferings about them and they brought in a lot of the stuff theyd got off the brig and among other stuff what i was a bit relieved to see the kind of pneumatic pump that was used for the compressed air affair and then a lot of chaps and girls came in and danced about me something disgraceful its extraordinary the different ways different people have of showing respect if id had a hatchet handy id have gone for the lot of themthey made me feel that wild all this time i sat as stiff as company not knowing anything better to do and at last when nightfall came and the wattle josshouse place got a bit too shadowy for their tasteall these here savages are afraid of the dark you knowand i started a sort of moo noise they built big bonfires outside and left me alone in peace in the darkness of my hut free to unscrew my windows a bit and think things over and feel just as bad as i liked and lord i was sick  i was weak and hungry and my mind kept on behaving like a beetle on a pin tremendous activity and nothing done at the end of it come round just where it was before there was sorrowing for the other chaps beastly drunkards certainly but not deserving such a fate and young sanders with the spear through his neck wouldnt go out of my mind there was the treasure down there in the ocean pioneer and how one might get it and hide it somewhere safer and get away and come back for it and there was the puzzle where to get anything to eat i tell you i was fair rambling i was afraid to ask by signs for food for fear of behaving too human and so there i sat and hungered until very near the dawn then the village got a bit quiet and i couldnt stand it any longer and i went out and got some stuff like artichokes in a bowl and some sour milk what was left of these i put away among the other offerings just to give them a hint of my tastes and in the morning they came to worship and found me sitting up stiff and respectable on their previous god just as theyd left me overnight id got my back against the central pillar of the hut and practically i was asleep and thats how i became a god among the heathenfalse god no doubt and blasphemous but one cant always pick and choose  now i dont want to crack myself up as a god beyond my merits but i must confess that while i was god to these people they was extraordinary successful i dont say theres anything in it mind you they won a battle with another tribei got a lot of offerings i didnt want through itthey had wonderful fishing and their crop of pourra was exceptional fine and they counted the capture of the brig among the benefits i brought em i must say i dont think that was a poor record for a perfectly new hand and though perhaps youd scarcely credit it i was the tribal god of those beastly savages for pretty nearly four months  what else could i do man but i didnt wear that divingdress all the time i made em rig me up a sort of holy of holies and a deuce of a time i had too making them understand what it was i wanted them to do that indeed was the great difficultymaking them understand my wishes i couldnt let myself down by talking their lingo badly even if id been able to speak at all and i couldnt go flapping a lot of gestures at them so i drew pictures in sand and sat down beside them and hooted like one oclock sometimes they did the things i wanted all right and sometimes they did them all wrong they was always very willing certainly all the while i was puzzling how i was to get the confounded business settled every night before the dawn i used to march out in full rig and go off to a place where i could see the channel in which the ocean pioneer lay sunk and once even one moonlight night i tried to walk out to her but the weeds and rocks and dark clean beat me i didnt get back till full day and then i found all those silly niggers out on the beach praying their seagod to return to them i was that vexed and tired messing and tumbling about and coming up and going down again i could have punched their silly heads all round when they started rejoicing hanged if i like so much ceremony  and then came the missionary that missionary what a guy gummy it was in the afternoon and i was sitting in state in my outer temple place sitting on that old black stone of theirs when he came i heard a row outside and jabbering and then his voice speaking to an interpreter they worship stocks and stones he said and i knew what was up in a flash i had one of my windows out for comfort and i sang out straight away on the spur of the moment stocks and stones i says you come inside i says and ill punch your blooming exeter hall of a head  there was a kind of silence and more jabbering and in he came bible in hand after the manner of thema little sandy chap in specks and a pith helmet i flatter myself that me sitting there in the shadows with my copper head and my big goggles struck him a bit of a heap at first well i says hows the trade in scissors for i dont hold with missionaries  i had a lark with that missionary he was a raw hand and quite outclassed by a man like me he gasped out who was i and i told him to read the inscription at my feet if he wanted to know there wasnt no inscription why should there be but down he goes to read and his interpreter being of course as superstitious as any of them more so by reason of his seeing missionary close to took it for an act of worship and plumped down like a shot all my people gave a howl of triumph and there wasnt any more business to be done in my village after that journey not by the likes of him  but of course i was a fool to choke him off like that if id had any sense i should have told him straight away of the treasure and taken him into co ive no doubt hed have come into co a child with a few hours to think it over could have seen the connection between my diving dress and the loss of the ocean pioneer a week after he left i went out one morning and saw the motherhood the salvers ship from starr race towing up the channel and sounding the whole blessed game was up and all my trouble thrown away gummy how wild i felt and guying it in that stinking silly dress four months  the sunburnt mans story degenerated again think of it he said when he emerged to linguistic purity once more forty thousand pounds worth of gold  did the little missionary come back i asked  oh yes bless him and he pledged his reputation there was a man inside the god and started out to see as much with tremendous ceremony but wasnthe got sold again i always did hate scenes and explanations and long before he came i was out of it allgoing home to banya along the coast hiding in bushes by day and thieving food from the villages by night only weapon a spear no clothes no money nothing my face my fortune as the saying is and just a squeak of eight thousand pounds of goldfifth share but the natives cut up rusty thank goodness because they thought it was him had driven their luck away       xxiv    miss winchelseas heart   miss winchelsea was going to rome the matter had filled her mind for a month or more and had overflowed so abundantly into her conversation that quite a number of people who were not going to rome and who were not likely to go to rome had made it a personal grievance against her some indeed had attempted quite unavailingly to convince her that rome was not nearly such a desirable place as it was reported to be and others had gone so far as to suggest behind her back that she was dreadfully stuck up about that rome of hers and little lily hardhurst had told her friend mr binns that so far as she was concerned miss winchelsea might go to her old rome and stop there she miss lily hardhurst wouldnt grieve and the way in which miss winchelsea put herself upon terms of personal tenderness with horace and benvenuto cellini and raphael and shelley and keatsif she had been shelleys widow she could not have professed a keener interest in his gravewas a matter of universal astonishment her dress was a triumph of tactful discretion sensible but not too touristymiss winchelsea had a great dread of being touristyand her baedeker was carried in a cover of grey to hide its glaring red she made a prim and pleasant little figure on the charing cross platform in spite of her swelling pride when at last the great day dawned and she could start for rome the day was bright the channel passage would be pleasant and all the omens promised well there was the gayest sense of adventure in this unprecedented departure  she was going with two friends who had been fellowstudents with her at the training college nice honest girls both though not so good at history and literature as miss winchelsea they both looked up to her immensely though physically they had to look down and she anticipated some pleasant times to be spent in stirring them up to her own pitch of aesthetic and historical enthusiasm they had secured seats already and welcomed her effusively at the carriage door in the instant criticism of the encounter she noted that fanny had a slightly touristy leather strap and that helen had succumbed to a serge jacket with side pockets into which her hands were thrust but they were much too happy with themselves and the expedition for their friend to attempt any hint at the moment about these things as soon as the first ecstasies were over fannys enthusiasm was a little noisy and crude and consisted mainly in emphatic repetitions of just fancy were going to rome my dearromethey gave their attention to their fellowtravellers helen was anxious to secure a compartment to themselves and in order to discourage intruders got out and planted herself firmly on the step miss winchelsea peeped out over her shoulder and made sly little remarks about the accumulating people on the platform at which fanny laughed gleefully  they were travelling with one of mr thomas gunns partiesfourteen days in rome for fourteen pounds they did not belong to the personally conducted party of coursemiss winchelsea had seen to thatbut they travelled with it because of the convenience of that arrangement the people were the oddest mixture and wonderfully amusing there was a vociferous redfaced polyglot personal conductor in a pepperandsalt suit very long in the arms and legs and very active he shouted proclamations when he wanted to speak to people he stretched out an arm and held them until his purpose was accomplished one hand was full of papers tickets counterfoils of tourists the people of the personally conducted party were it seemed of two sorts people the conductor wanted and could not find and people he did not want and who followed him in a steadily growing tail up and down the platform these people seemed indeed to think that their one chance of reaching rome lay in keeping close to him three little old ladies were particularly energetic in his pursuit and at last maddened him to the pitch of clapping them into a carriage and daring them to emerge again for the rest of the time one two or three of their heads protruded from the window wailing inquiries about a little wickerwork box whenever he drew near there was a very stout man with a very stout wife in shiny black there was a little old man like an aged hostler  what can such people want in rome asked miss winchelsea what can it mean to them there was a very tall curate in a very small straw hat and a very short curate encumbered by a long camera stand the contrast amused fanny very much once they heard some one calling for snooks i always thought that name was invented by novelists said miss winchelsea fancy snooks i wonder which is mr snooks finally they picked out a very stout and resolute little man in a large check suit if he isnt snooks he ought to be said miss winchelsea  presently the conductor discovered helens attempt at a corner in carriages room for five he bawled with a parallel translation on his fingers a party of four togethermother father and two daughters blundered in all greatly excited its all right mayou let me said one of the daughters hitting her mothers bonnet with a handbag she struggled to put in the rack miss winchelsea detested people who banged about and called their mother ma a young man travelling alone followed he was not at all touristy in his costume miss winchelsea observed his gladstone bag was of good pleasant leather with labels reminiscent of luxembourg and ostend and his boots though brown were not vulgar he carried an overcoat on his arm before these people had properly settled in their places came an inspection of tickets and a slamming of doors and behold they were gliding out of charing cross station on their way to rome  fancy cried fanny we are going to rome my dear rome i dont seem to believe it even now  miss winchelsea suppressed fannys emotions with a little smile and the lady who was called ma explained to people in general why they had cut it so close at the station the two daughters called her ma several times toned her down in a tactless effective way and drove her at last to the muttered inventory of a basket of travelling requisites presently she looked up lor she said i didnt bring them both the daughters said oh ma but what them was did not appear  presently fanny produced hares walks in rome a sort of mitigated guidebook very popular among roman visitors and the father of the two daughters began to examine his books of tickets minutely apparently in a search after english words when he had looked at the tickets for a long time right way up he turned them upside down then he produced a fountain pen and dated them with considerable care the young man having completed an unostentatious survey of his fellowtravellers produced a book and fell to reading when helen and fanny were looking out of the window at chislehurstthe place interested fanny because the poor dear empress of the french used to live theremiss winchelsea took the opportunity to observe the book the young man held it was not a guidebook but a little thin volume of poetrybound she glanced at his faceit seemed a refined pleasant face to her hasty glance he wore a little gilt pincenez do you think she lives there now said fanny and miss winchelseas inspection came to an end  for the rest of the journey miss winchelsea talked little and what she said was as agreeable and as stamped with refinement as she could make it her voice was always low and clear and pleasant and she took care that on this occasion it was particularly low and clear and pleasant as they came under the white cliffs the young man put his book of poetry away and when at last the train stopped beside the boat he displayed a graceful alacrity with the impedimenta of miss winchelsea and her friends miss winchelsea hated nonsense but she was pleased to see the young man perceived at once that they were ladies and helped them without any violent geniality and how nicely he showed that his civilities were to be no excuse for further intrusions none of her little party had been out of england before and they were all excited and a little nervous at the channel passage they stood in a little group in a good place near the middle of the boatthe young man had taken miss winchelseas carryall there and had told her it was a good placeand they watched the white shores of albion recede and quoted shakespeare and made quiet fun of their fellowtravellers in the english way  they were particularly amused at the precautions the biggersized people had taken against the little wavescut lemons and flasks prevailed one lady lay full length in a deck chair with a handkerchief over her face and a very broad resolute man in a bright brown touristy suit walked all the way from england to france along the deck with his legs as widely apart as providence permitted these were all excellent precautions and nobody was ill the personallyconducted party pursued the conductor about the deck with inquiries in a manner that suggested to helens mind the rather vulgar image of hens with a piece of bacon rind until at last he went into hiding below and the young man with the thin volume of poetry stood at the stern watching england receding looking rather lonely and sad to miss winchelseas eye  and then came calais and tumultuous novelties and the young man had not forgotten miss winchelseas holdall and the other little things all three girls though they had passed government examinations in french to any extent were stricken with a dumb shame of their accents and the young man was very useful and he did not intrude he put them in a comfortable carriage and raised his hat and went away miss winchelsea thanked him in her best mannera pleasing cultivated mannerand fanny said he was nice almost before he was out of earshot i wonder what he can be said helen hes going to italy because i noticed green tickets in his book miss winchelsea almost told them of the poetry and decided not to do so and presently the carriage windows seized hold upon them and the young man was forgotten it made them feel that they were doing an educated sort of thing to travel through a country whose commonest advertisements were in idiomatic french and miss winchelsea made unpatriotic comparisons because there were weedy little signboard advertisements by the rail side instead of the broad hoardings that deface the landscape in our land but the north of france is really uninteresting country and after a time fanny reverted to hares walks and helen initiated lunch miss winchelsea awoke out of a happy reverie she had been trying to realise she said that she was actually going to rome but she perceived at helens suggestion that she was hungry and they lunched out of their baskets very cheerfully in the afternoon they were tired and silent until helen made tea miss winchelsea might have dozed only she knew fanny slept with her mouth open and as their fellowpassengers were two rather nice criticallooking ladies of uncertain agewho knew french well enough to talk itshe employed herself in keeping fanny awake the rhythm of the train became insistent and the streaming landscape outside became at last quite painful to the eye they were already dreadfully tired of travelling before their nights stoppage came  the stoppage for the night was brightened by the appearance of the young man and his manners were all that could be desired and his french quite serviceable  his coupons availed for the same hotel as theirs and by chance as it seemed he sat next miss winchelsea at the table dhôte in spite of her enthusiasm for rome she had thought out some such possibility very thoroughly and when he ventured to make a remark upon the tediousness of travellinghe let the soup and fish go by before he did thisshe did not simply assent to his proposition but responded with another they were soon comparing their journeys and helen and fanny were cruelly overlooked in the conversation it was to be the same journey they found one day for the galleries at florencefrom what i hear said the young man it is barely enoughand the rest at rome he talked of rome very pleasantly he was evidently quite well read and he quoted horace about soracte miss winchelsea had done that book of horace for her matriculation and was delighted to cap his quotation it gave a sort of tone to things this incidenta touch of refinement to mere chatting fanny expressed a few emotions and helen interpolated a few sensible remarks but the bulk of the talk on the girls side naturally fell to miss winchelsea  before they reached rome this young man was tacitly of their party they did not know his name nor what he was but it seemed he taught and miss winchelsea had a shrewd idea he was an extension lecturer at any rate he was something of that sort something gentlemanly and refined without being opulent and impossible she tried once or twice to ascertain whether he came from oxford or cambridge but he missed her timid opportunities she tried to get him to make remarks about those places to see if he would say come up to them instead of go downshe knew that was how you told a varsity man he used the word varsitynot universityin quite the proper way  they saw as much of mr ruskins florence as the brief time permitted he met them in the pitti gallery and went round with them chatting brightly and evidently very grateful for their recognition he knew a great deal about art and all four enjoyed the morning immensely it was fine to go round recognising old favourites and finding new beauties especially while so many people fumbled helplessly with baedeker nor was he a bit of a prig miss winchelsea said and indeed she detested prigs he had a distinct undertone of humour and was funny for example without being vulgar at the expense of the quaint work of beato angelico he had a grave seriousness beneath it all and was quick to seize the moral lessons of the pictures fanny went softly among these masterpieces she admitted she knew so little about them and she confessed that to her they were all beautiful fannys beautiful inclined to be a little monotonous miss winchelsea thought she had been quite glad when the last sunny alp had vanished because of the staccato of fannys admiration helen said little but miss winchelsea had found her a trifle wanting on the aesthetic side in the old days and was not surprised sometimes she laughed at the young mans hesitating delicate jests and sometimes she didnt and sometimes she seemed quite lost to the art about them in the contemplation of the dresses of the other visitors  at rome the young man was with them intermittently a rather touristy friend of his took him away at times he complained comically to miss winchelsea i have only two short weeks in rome he said and my friend leonard wants to spend a whole day at tivoli looking at a waterfall  what is your friend leonard asked miss winchelsea abruptly  hes the most enthusiastic pedestrian i ever met the young man repliedamusingly but a little unsatisfactorily miss winchelsea thought  they had some glorious times and fanny could not think what they would have done without him miss winchelseas interest and fannys enormous capacity for admiration were insatiable they never flaggedthrough pictures and sculpture galleries immense crowded churches ruins and museums judas trees and prickly pears wine carts and palaces they admired their way unflinchingly they never saw a stone pine or a eucalyptus but they named and admired it they never glimpsed soracte but they exclaimed their common ways were made wonderful by imaginative play here caesar may have walked they would say raphael may have seen soracte from this very point they happened on the tomb of bibulus old bibulus said the young man the oldest monument of republican rome said miss winchelsea  im dreadfully stupid said fanny but who was bibulus  there was a curious little pause  wasnt he the person who built the wall said helen  the young man glanced quickly at her and laughed that was balbus he said helen reddened but neither he nor miss winchelsea threw any light upon fannys ignorance about bibulus  helen was more taciturn than the other three but then she was always taciturn and usually she took care of the tram tickets and things like that or kept her eye on them if the young man took them and told him where they were when he wanted them glorious times they had these young people in that pale brown cleanly city of memories that was once the world their only sorrow was the shortness of the time they said indeed that the electric trams and the 70 buildings and that criminal advertisement that glares upon the forum outraged their aesthetic feelings unspeakably but that was only part of the fun and indeed rome is such a wonderful place that it made miss winchelsea forget some of her most carefully prepared enthusiasms at times and helen taken unawares would suddenly admit the beauty of unexpected things yet fanny and helen would have liked a shop window or so in the english quarter if miss winchelseas uncompromising hostility to all other english visitors had not rendered that district impossible  the intellectual and aesthetic fellowship of miss winchelsea and the scholarly young man passed insensibly towards a deeper feeling the exuberant fanny did her best to keep pace with their recondite admiration by playing her beautiful with vigour and saying oh lets go with enormous appetite whenever a new place of interest was mentioned but helen developed a certain want of sympathy towards the end that disappointed miss winchelsea a little she refused to see anything in the face of beatrice cencishelleys beatrice cenciin the barberini gallery and one day when they were deploring the electric trams she said rather snappishly that people must get about somehow and its better than torturing horses up these horrid little hills she spoke of the seven hills of rome as horrid little hills   and the day they went on the palatinethough miss winchelsea did not know of thisshe remarked suddenly to fanny dont hurry like that my dear they dont want us to overtake them and we dont say the right things for them when we do get near  i wasnt trying to overtake them said fanny slackening her excessive pace i wasnt indeed and for a minute she was short of breath  but miss winchelsea had come upon happiness it was only when she came to look back across an intervening tragedy that she quite realised how happy she had been pacing among the cypressshadowed ruins and exchanging the very highest class of information the human mind can possess the most refined impressions it is possible to convey insensibly emotion crept into their intercourse sunning itself openly and pleasantly at last when helens modernity was not too near insensibly their interest drifted from the wonderful associations about them to their more intimate and personal feelings in a tentative way information was supplied she spoke allusively of her school of her examination successes of her gladness that the days of cram were over he made it quite clear that he also was a teacher they spoke of the greatness of their calling of the necessity of sympathy to face its irksome details of a certain loneliness they sometimes felt  that was in the colosseum and it was as far as they got that day because helen returned with fannyshe had taken her into the upper galleries yet the private dreams of miss winchelsea already vivid and concrete enough became now realistic in the highest degree she figured that pleasant young man lecturing in the most edifying way to his students herself modestly prominent as his intellectual mate and helper she figured a refined little home with two bureaus with white shelves of highclass books and autotypes of the pictures of rossetti and burne jones with morriss wallpapers and flowers in pots of beaten copper indeed she figured many things on the pincio the two had a few precious moments together while helen marched fanny off to see the muro torto and he spoke at once plainly he said he hoped their friendship was only beginning that he already found her company very precious to him that indeed it was more than that  he became nervous thrusting at his glasses with trembling fingers as though he fancied his emotions made them unstable i should of course he said tell you things about myself i know it is rather unusual my speaking to you like this only our meeting has been so accidentalor providentialand i am snatching at things i came to rome expecting a lonely tour  and i have been so very happy so very happy quite recently i have found myself in a positioni have dared to think and  he glanced over his shoulder and stopped he said demn quite distinctlyand she did not condemn him for that manly lapse into profanity she looked and saw his friend leonard advancing he drew nearer he raised his hat to miss winchelsea and his smile was almost a grin ive been looking for you everywhere snooks he said you promised to be on the piazza steps halfanhour ago  snooks the name struck miss winchelsea like a blow in the face she did not hear his reply she thought afterwards that leonard must have considered her the vaguestminded person to this day she is not sure whether she was introduced to leonard or not nor what she said to him a sort of mental paralysis was upon her of all offensive surnamessnooks  helen and fanny were returning there were civilities and the young men were receding by a great effort she controlled herself to face the inquiring eyes of her friends all that afternoon she lived the life of a heroine under the indescribable outrage of that name chatting observing with snooks gnawing at her heart from the moment that it first rang upon her ears the dream of her happiness was prostrate in the dust all the refinement she had figured was ruined and defaced by that cognomens unavoidable vulgarity  what was that refined little home to her now spite of autotypes morris papers and bureaus athwart it in letters of fire ran an incredible inscription mrs snooks that may seem a little thing to the reader but consider the delicate refinement of miss winchelseas mind be as refined as you can and then think of writing yourself downsnooks she conceived herself being addressed as mrs snooks by all the people she liked least conceived the patronymic touched with a vague quality of insult she figured a card of grey and silver bearing winchelsea triumphantly effaced by an arrow cupids arrow in favour of snooks degrading confession of feminine weakness she imagined the terrible rejoicings of certain girl friends of certain grocer cousins from whom her growing refinement had long since estranged her how they would make it sprawl across the envelope that would bring their sarcastic congratulations would even his pleasant company compensate her for that it is impossible she muttered impossible snooks  she was sorry for him but not so sorry as she was for herself for him she had a touch of indignation to be so nice so refined while all the time he was snooks to hide under a pretentious gentility of demeanour the badge sinister of his surname seemed a sort of treachery to put it in the language of sentimental science she felt he had led her on  there were of course moments of terrible vacillation a period even when something almost like passion bid her throw refinement to the winds and there was something in her an unexpurgated vestige of vulgarity that made a strenuous attempt at proving that snooks was not so very bad a name after all any hovering hesitation flew before fannys manner when fanny came with an air of catastrophe to tell that she also knew the horror fannys voice fell to a whisper when she said snooks miss winchelsea would not give him any answer when at last in the borghese she could have a minute with him but she promised him a note  she handed him that note in the little book of poetry he had lent her the little book that had first drawn them together her refusal was ambiguous allusive she could no more tell him why she rejected him than she could have told a cripple of his hump he too must feel something of the unspeakable quality of his name indeed he had avoided a dozen chances of telling it she now perceived so she spoke of obstacles she could not revealreasons why the thing he spoke of was impossible she addressed the note with a shiver ek snooks  things were worse than she had dreaded he asked her to explain how could she explain those last two days in rome were dreadful she was haunted by his air of astonished perplexity she knew she had given him intimate hopes she had not the courage to examine her mind thoroughly for the extent of her encouragement she knew he must think her the most changeable of beings now that she was in full retreat she would not even perceive his hints of a possible correspondence but in that matter he did a thing that seemed to her at once delicate and romantic he made a gobetween of fanny fanny could not keep the secret and came and told her that night under a transparent pretext of needed advice mr snooks said fanny wants to write to me fancy i had no idea but should i let him they talked it over long and earnestly and miss winchelsea was careful to keep the veil over her heart she was already repenting his disregarded hints why should she not hear of him sometimespainful though his name must be to her miss winchelsea decided it might be permitted and fanny kissed her goodnight with unusual emotion after she had gone miss winchelsea sat for a long time at the window of her little room it was moonlight and down the street a man sang santa lucia with almost heartdissolving tenderness she sat very still  she breathed a word very softly to herself the word was snooks then she got up with a profound sigh and went to bed the next morning he said to her meaningly i shall hear of you through your friend  mr snooks saw them off from rome with that pathetic interrogative perplexity still on his face and if it had not been for helen he would have retained miss winchelseas holdall in his hand as a sort of encyclopaedic keepsake on their way back to england miss winchelsea on six separate occasions made fanny promise to write to her the longest of long letters fanny it seemed would be quite near mr snooks her new schoolshe was always going to new schoolswould be only five miles from steely bank and it was in the steely bank polytechnic and one or two firstclass schools that mr snooks did his teaching he might even see her at times they could not talk much of himshe and fanny always spoke of him never of mr snooksbecause helen was apt to say unsympathetic things about him her nature had coarsened very much miss winchelsea perceived since the old training college days she had become hard and cynical she thought he had a weak face mistaking refinement for weakness as people of her stamp are apt to do and when she heard his name was snooks she said she had expected something of the sort miss winchelsea was careful to spare her own feelings after that but fanny was less circumspect  the girls parted in london and miss winchelsea returned with a new interest in life to the girls high school in which she had been an increasingly valuable assistant for the last three years her new interest in life was fanny as a correspondent and to give her a lead she wrote her a lengthy descriptive letter within a fortnight of her return fanny answered very disappointingly fanny indeed had no literary gift but it was new to miss winchelsea to find herself deploring the want of gifts in a friend that letter was even criticised aloud in the safe solitude of miss winchelseas study and her criticism spoken with great bitterness was twaddle it was full of just the things miss winchelseas letter had been full of particulars of the school and of mr snooks only this much i have had a letter from mr snooks and he has been over to see me on two saturday afternoons running he talked about rome and you we both talked about you your ears must have burnt my dear  miss winchelsea repressed a desire to demand more explicit information and wrote the sweetest long letter again tell me all about yourself dear that journey has quite refreshed our ancient friendship and i do so want to keep in touch with you about mr snooks she simply wrote on the fifth page that she was glad fanny had seen him and that if he should ask after her she was to be remembered to him very kindly underlined and fanny replied most obtusely in the key of that ancient friendship reminding miss winchelsea of a dozen foolish things of those old schoolgirl days at the training college and saying not a word about mr snooks  for nearly a week miss winchelsea was so angry at the failure of fanny as a gobetween that she could not write to her and then she wrote less effusively and in her letter she asked pointblank have you seen mr snooks fannys letter was unexpectedly satisfactory i have seen mr snooks she wrote and having once named him she kept on about him it was all snookssnooks this and snooks that he was to give a public lecture said fanny among other things yet miss winchelsea after the first glow of gratification still found this letter a little unsatisfactory fanny did not report mr snooks as saying anything about miss winchelsea nor as looking a little white and worn as he ought to have been doing and behold before she had replied came a second letter from fanny on the same theme quite a gushing letter and covering six sheets with her loose feminine hand  and about this second letter was a rather odd little thing that miss winchelsea only noticed as she reread it the third time fannys natural femininity had prevailed even against the round and clear traditions of the training college she was one of those shecreatures born to make all her ms and ns and us and rs and es alike and to leave her os and as open and her is undotted so that it was only after an elaborate comparison of word with word that miss winchelsea felt assured mr snooks was not really mr snooks at all in fannys first letter of gush he was mr snooks in her second the spelling was changed to mr senoks miss winchelseas hand positively trembled as she turned the sheet overit meant so much to her for it had already begun to seem to her that even the name of mrs snooks might be avoided at too great a price and suddenlythis possibility she turned over the six sheets all dappled with that critical name and everywhere the first letter had the form of an e for a time she walked the room with a hand pressed upon her heart  she spent a whole day pondering this change weighing a letter of inquiry that should be at once discreet and effectual weighing too what action she should take after the answer came she was resolved that if this altered spelling was anything more than a quaint fancy of fannys she would write forthwith to mr snooks she had now reached a stage when the minor refinements of behaviour disappear her excuse remained uninvented but she had the subject of her letter clear in her mind even to the hint that circumstances in my life have changed very greatly since we talked together but she never gave that hint there came a third letter from that fitful correspondent fanny the first line proclaimed her the happiest girl alive  miss winchelsea crushed the letter in her handthe rest unreadand sat with her face suddenly very still she had received it just before morning school and had opened it when the junior mathematicians were well under way presently she resumed reading with an appearance of great calm but after the first sheet she went on reading the third without discovering the errortold him frankly i did not like his name the third sheet began he told me he did not like it himselfyou know that sort of sudden frank way he hasmiss winchelsea did know so i said couldnt you change it he didnt see it at first well you know dear he had told me what it really meant it means sevenoaks only it has got down to snooksboth snooks and noaks dreadfully vulgar surnames though they be are really worn forms of sevenoaks so i saideven i have my bright ideas at timesif it got down from sevenoaks to snooks why not get it back from snooks to sevenoaks and the long and the short of it is dear he couldnt refuse me and he changed his spelling there and then to senoks for the bills of the new lecture and afterwards when we are married we shall put in the apostrophe and make it senoks wasnt it kind of him to mind that fancy of mine when many men would have taken offence but it is just like him all over he is as kind as he is clever because he knew as well as i did that i would have had him in spite of it had he been ten times snooks but he did it all the same  the class was startled by the sound of paper being viciously torn and looked up to see miss winchelsea white in the face and with some very small pieces of paper clenched in one hand for a few seconds they stared at her stare and then her expression changed back to a more familiar one has any one finished number three she asked in an even tone she remained calm after that but impositions ruled high that day and she spent two laborious evenings writing letters of various sorts to fanny before she found a decent congratulatory vein her reason struggled hopelessly against the persuasion that fanny had behaved in an exceedingly treacherous manner  one may be extremely refined and still capable of a very sore heart certainly miss winchelseas heart was very sore she had moods of sexual hostility in which she generalised uncharitably about mankind he forgot himself with me she said but fanny is pink and pretty and soft and a foola very excellent match for a man and by way of a wedding present she sent fanny a gracefully bound volume of poetry by george meredith and fanny wrote back a grossly happy letter to say that it was all beautiful miss winchelsea hoped that some day mr senoks might take up that slim book and think for a moment of the donor fanny wrote several times before and about her marriage pursuing that fond legend of their ancient friendship and giving her happiness in the fullest detail and miss winchelsea wrote to helen for the first time after the roman journey saying nothing about the marriage but expressing very cordial feelings  they had been in rome at easter and fanny was married in the august vacation she wrote a garrulous letter to miss winchelsea describing her homecoming and the astonishing arrangements of their teeny weeny little house mr senoks was now beginning to assume a refinement in miss winchelseas memory out of all proportion to the facts of the case and she tried in vain to imagine his cultured greatness in a teeny weeny little house am busy enamelling a cosy corner said fanny sprawling to the end of her third sheet so excuse more miss winchelsea answered in her best style gently poking fun at fannys arrangements and hoping intensely that mr senoks might see the letter only this hope enabled her to write at all answering not only that letter but one in november and one at christmas  the two latter communications contained urgent invitations for her to come to steely bank on a visit during the christmas holidays she tried to think that he had told her to ask that but it was too much like fannys opulent goodnature she could not but believe that he must be sick of his blunder by this time and she had more than a hope that he would presently write her a letter beginning dear friend something subtly tragic in the separation was a great support to her a sad misunderstanding to have been jilted would have been intolerable but he never wrote that letter beginning dear friend  for two years miss winchelsea could not go to see her friends in spite of the reiterated invitations of mrs sevenoaksit became full sevenoaks in the second year then one day near the easter rest she felt lonely and without a soul to understand her in the world and her mind ran once more on what is called platonic friendship fanny was clearly happy and busy in her new sphere of domesticity but no doubt he had his lonely hours did he ever think of those days in rome gone now beyond recalling no one had understood her as he had done no one in all the world it would be a sort of melancholy pleasure to talk to him again and what harm could it do why should she deny herself that night she wrote a sonnet all but the last two lines of the octavewhich would not come and the next day she composed a graceful little note to tell fanny she was coming down  and so she saw him again  even at the first encounter it was evident he had changed he seemed stouter and less nervous and it speedily appeared that his conversation had already lost much of its old delicacy there even seemed a justification for helens description of weakness in his facein certain lights it was weak he seemed busy and preoccupied about his affairs and almost under the impression that miss winchelsea had come for the sake of fanny he discussed his dinner with fanny in an intelligent way they only had one good long talk together and that came to nothing he did not refer to rome and spent some time abusing a man who had stolen an idea he had had for a textbook it did not seem a very wonderful idea to miss winchelsea she discovered he had forgotten the names of more than half the painters whose work they had rejoiced over in florence  it was a sadly disappointing week and miss winchelsea was glad when it came to an end under various excuses she avoided visiting them again after a time the visitors room was occupied by their two little boys and fannys invitations ceased the intimacy of her letters had long since faded away       xxv    a dream of armageddon   the man with the white face entered the carriage at rugby he moved slowly in spite of the urgency of his porter and even while he was still on the platform i noted how ill he seemed he dropped into the corner over against me with a sigh made an incomplete attempt to arrange his travelling shawl and became motionless with his eyes staring vacantly presently he was moved by a sense of my observation looked up at me and put out a spiritless hand for his newspaper then he glanced again in my direction  i feigned to read i feared i had unwittingly embarrassed him and in a moment i was surprised to find him speaking  i beg your pardon said i  that book he repeated pointing a lean finger is about dreams  obviously i answered for it was fortnumroscoes dream states and the title was on the cover  he hung silent for a space as if he sought words yes he said at last but they tell you nothing  i did not catch his meaning for a second  they dont know he added  i looked a little more attentively at his face  there are dreams he said and dreams that sort of proposition i never dispute i suppose he hesitated do you ever dream i mean vividly  i dream very little i answered i doubt if i have three vivid dreams in a year  ah he said and seemed for a moment to collect his thoughts  your dreams dont mix with your memories he asked abruptly you dont find yourself in doubt did this happen or did it not  hardly ever except just for a momentary hesitation now and then i suppose few people do  does he say he indicated the book  says it happens at times and gives the usual explanation about intensity of impression and the like to account for its not happening as a rule i suppose you know something of these theories  very littleexcept that they are wrong  his emaciated hand played with the strap of the window for a time i prepared to resume reading and that seemed to precipitate his next remark he leant forward almost as though he would touch me  isnt there something called consecutive dreamingthat goes on night after night  i believe there is there are cases given in most books on mental trouble  mental trouble yes i daresay there are its the right place for them but what i mean he looked at his bony knuckles is that sort of thing always dreaming is it dreaming or is it something else mightnt it be something else  i should have snubbed his persistent conversation but for the drawn anxiety of his face i remember now the look of his faded eyes and the lids red stainedperhaps you know that look  im not just arguing about a matter of opinion he said the things killing me  dreams  if you call them dreams night after night vividso vivid  this he indicated the landscape that went streaming by the window seems unreal in comparison i can scarcely remember who i am what business i am on   he paused even now  the dream is always the samedo you mean i asked  its over  you mean  i died  died  smashed and killed and now so much of me as that dream was is dead dead for ever i dreamt i was another man you know living in a different part of the world and in a different time i dreamt that night after night night after night i woke into that other life fresh scenes and fresh happeningsuntil i came upon the last  when you died  when i died  and since then  no he said thank god that was the end of the dream  it was clear i was in for this dream and after all i had an hour before me the light was fading fast and fortnumroscoe has a dreary way with him living in a different time i said do you mean in some different age  yes  past  no to cometo come  the year three thousand for example  i dont know what year it was i did when i was asleep when i was dreaming that is but not nownot now that i am awake theres a lot of things i have forgotten since i woke out of these dreams though i knew them at the time when i wasi suppose it was dreaming they called the year differently from our way of calling the year what did they call it he put his hand to his forehead no said he i forget  he sat smiling weakly for a moment i feared he did not mean to tell me his dream as a rule i hate people who tell their dreams but this struck me differently i proffered assistance even it began i suggested  it was vivid from the first i seemed to wake up in it suddenly and its curious that in these dreams i am speaking of i never remembered this life i am living now it seemed as if the dream life was enough while it lasted perhapsbut i will tell you how i find myself when i do my best to recall it all i dont remember anything clearly until i found myself sitting in a sort of loggia looking out over the sea i had been dozing and suddenly i woke upfresh and vividnot a bit dreamlike because the girl had stopped fanning me  the girl  yes the girl you must not interrupt or you will put me out  he stopped abruptly you wont think im mad he said  no i answered youve been dreaming tell me your dream  i woke up i say because the girl had stopped fanning me i was not surprised to find myself there or anything of that sort you understand i did not feel i had fallen into it suddenly i simply took it up at that point whatever memory i had of this life this nineteenthcentury life faded as i woke vanished like a dream i knew all about myself knew that my name was no longer cooper but hedon and all about my position in the world ive forgotten a lot since i woketheres a want of connectionbut it was all quite clear and matteroffact then  he hesitated again gripping the window strap putting his face forward and looking up to me appealingly  this seems bosh to you  no no i cried go on tell me what this loggia was like  it was not really a loggiai dont know what to call it it faced south it was small it was all in shadow except the semicircle above the balcony that showed the sky and sea and the corner where the girl stood i was on a couchit was a metal couch with light striped cushionsand the girl was leaning over the balcony with her back to me the light of the sunrise fell on her ear and cheek her pretty white neck and the little curls that nestled there and her white shoulder were in the sun and all the grace of her body was in the cool blue shadow she was dressedhow can i describe it it was easy and flowing and altogether there she stood so that it came to me how beautiful and desirable she was as though i had never seen her before and when at last i sighed and raised myself upon my arm she turned her face to me  he stopped  i have lived threeandfifty years in this world i have had mother sisters friends wife and daughtersall their faces the play of their faces i know but the face of this girlit is much more real to me i can bring it back into memory so that i see it againi could draw it or paint it and after all  he stoppedbut i said nothing  the face of a dreamthe face of a dream she was beautiful not that beauty which is terrible cold and worshipful like the beauty of a saint nor that beauty that stirs fierce passions but a sort of radiation sweet lips that softened into smiles and grave gray eyes and she moved gracefully she seemed to have part with all pleasant and gracious things  he stopped and his face was downcast and hidden then he looked up at me and went on making no further attempt to disguise his absolute belief in the reality of his story  you see i had thrown up my plans and ambitions thrown up all i had ever worked for or desired for her sake i had been a master man away there in the north with influence and property and a great reputation but none of it had seemed worth having beside her i had come to the place this city of sunny pleasures with her and left all those things to wreck and ruin just to save a remnant at least of my life while i had been in love with her before i knew that she had any care for me before i had imagined that she would darethat we should dareall my life had seemed vain and hollow dust and ashes it was dust and ashes night after night and through the long days i had longed and desiredmy soul had beaten against the thing forbidden  but it is impossible for one man to tell another just these things its emotion its a tint a light that comes and goes only while its there everything changes everything the thing is i came away and left them in their crisis to do what they could  left whom i asked puzzled  the people up in the north there you seein this dream anyhowi had been a big man the sort of man men come to trust in to group themselves about millions of men who had never seen me were ready to do things and risk things because of their confidence in me i had been playing that game for years that big laborious game that vague monstrous political game amidst intrigues and betrayals speech and agitation it was a vast weltering world and at last i had a sort of leadership against the gang you know it was called the ganga sort of compromise of scoundrelly projects and base ambitions and vast public emotional stupidities and catchwordsthe gang that kept the world noisy and blind year by year and all the while that it was drifting drifting towards infinite disaster but i cant expect you to understand the shades and complications of the yearthe year something or other ahead i had it alldown to the smallest detailsin my dream i suppose i had been dreaming of it before i awoke and the fading outline of some queer new development i had imagined still hung about me as i rubbed my eyes it was some grubby affair that made me thank god for the sunlight i sat up on the couch and remained looking at the woman and rejoicingrejoicing that i had come away out of all that tumult and folly and violence before it was too late after all i thought this is lifelove and beauty desire and delight are they not worth all those dismal struggles for vague gigantic ends and i blamed myself for having ever sought to be a leader when i might have given my days to love but then thought i if i had not spent my early days sternly and austerely i might have wasted myself upon vain and worthless women and at the thought all my being went out in love and tenderness to my dear mistress my dear lady who had come at last and compelled mecompelled me by her invincible charm for meto lay that life aside  you are worth it i said speaking without intending her to hear you are worth it my dearest one worth pride and praise and all things love to have you is worth them all together and at the murmur of my voice she turned about  come and see she criedi can hear her nowcome and see the sunrise upon monte solaro  i remember how i sprang to my feet and joined her at the balcony she put a white hand upon my shoulder and pointed towards great masses of limestone flushing as it were into life i looked but first i noted the sunlight on her face caressing the lines of her cheeks and neck how can i describe to you the scene we had before us we were at capri  i have been there i said i have clambered up monte solaro and drunk vero caprimuddy stuff like ciderat the summit  ah said the man with the white face then perhaps you can tell meyou will know if this was indeed capri for in this life i have never been there let me describe it we were in a little room one of a vast multitude of little rooms very cool and sunny hollowed out of the limestone of a sort of cape very high above the sea the whole island you know was one enormous hotel complex beyond explaining and on the other side there were miles of floating hotels and huge floating stages to which the flying machines came they called it a pleasure city of course there was none of that in your timerather i should say is none of that now of course nowyes  well this room of ours was at the extremity of the cape so that one could see east and west eastward was a great cliffa thousand feet high perhaps coldly grey except for one bright edge of gold and beyond it the isle of the sirens and a falling coast that faded and passed into the hot sunrise and when one turned to the west distinct and near was a little bay a little beach still in shadow and out of that shadow rose solaro straight and tall flushed and goldencrested like a beauty throned and the white moon was floating behind her in the sky and before us from east to west stretched the manytinted sea all dotted with little sailingboats  to the eastward of course these little boats were gray and very minute and clear but to the westward they were little boats of goldshining goldalmost like little flames and just below us was a rock with an arch worn through it the blue seawater broke to green and foam all round the rock and a galley came gliding out of the arch  i know that rock i said i was nearly drowned there it is called the faraglioni  faraglioni yes she called it that answered the man with the white face there was some storybut that  he put his hand to his forehead again no he said i forget that story  well that is the first thing i remember the first dream i had that little shaded room and the beautiful air and sky and that dear lady of mine with her shining arms and her graceful robe and how we sat and talked in half whispers to one another we talked in whispers not because there was any one to hear but because there was still such a freshness of mind between us that our thoughts were a little frightened i think to find themselves at last in words and so they went softly  presently we were hungry and we went from our apartment going by a strange passage with a moving floor until we came to the great breakfastroomthere was a fountain and music a pleasant and joyful place it was with its sunlight and splashing and the murmur of plucked strings and we sat and ate and smiled at one another and i would not heed a man who was watching me from a table near by  and afterwards we went on to the dancinghall but i cannot describe that hall the place was enormous larger than any building you have ever seenand in one place there was the old gate of capri caught into the wall of a gallery high overhead light girders stems and threads of gold burst from the pillars like fountains streamed like an aurora across the roof and interlaced likelike conjuring tricks all about the great circle for the dancers there were beautiful figures strange dragons and intricate and wonderful grotesques bearing lights the place was inundated with artificial light that shamed the newborn day and as we went through the throng the people turned about and looked at us for all through the world my name and face were known and how i had suddenly thrown up pride and struggle to come to this place and they looked also at the lady beside me though half the story of how at last she had come to me was unknown or mistold and few of the men who were there i know but judged me a happy man in spite of all the shame and dishonour that had come upon my name  the air was full of music full of harmonious scents full of the rhythm of beautiful motions thousands of beautiful people swarmed about the hall crowded the galleries sat in a myriad recesses they were dressed in splendid colours and crowned with flowers thousands danced about the great circle beneath the white images of the ancient gods and glorious processions of youths and maidens came and went we two danced not the dreary monotonies of your daysof this time i meanbut dances that were beautiful intoxicating and even now i can see my lady dancingdancing joyously she danced you know with a serious face she danced with a serious dignity and yet she was smiling at me and caressing mesmiling and caressing with her eyes  the music was different he murmured it wenti cannot describe it but it was infinitely richer and more varied than any music that has ever come to me awake  and thenit was when we had done dancinga man came to speak to me he was a lean resolute man very soberly clad for that place and already i had marked his face watching me in the breakfasting hall and afterwards as we went along the passage i had avoided his eye but now as we sat in a little alcove smiling at the pleasure of all the people who went to and fro across the shining floor he came and touched me and spoke to me so that i was forced to listen and he asked that he might speak to me for a little time apart  no i said i have no secrets from this lady what do you want to tell me  he said it was a trivial matter or at least a dry matter for a lady to hear  perhaps for me to hear said i  he glanced at her as though almost he would appeal to her then he asked me suddenly if i had heard of a great and avenging declaration that gresham had made now gresham had always before been the man next to myself in the leadership of that great party in the north he was a forcible hard and tactless man and only i had been able to control and soften him it was on his account even more than my own i think that the others had been so dismayed at my retreat so this question about what he had done reawakened my old interest in the life i had put aside just for a moment  i have taken no heed of any news for many days i said what has gresham been saying  and with that the man began nothing loth and i must confess ever i was struck by greshams reckless folly in the wild and threatening words he had used and this messenger they had sent to me not only told me of greshams speech but went on to ask counsel and to point out what need they had of me while he talked my lady sat a little forward and watched his face and mine  my old habits of scheming and organising reasserted themselves i could even see myself suddenly returning to the north and all the dramatic effect of it all that this man said witnessed to the disorder of the party indeed but not to its damage i should go back stronger than i had come and then i thought of my lady you seehow can i tell you there were certain peculiarities of our relationshipas things are i need not tell about thatwhich would render her presence with me impossible i should have had to leave her indeed i should have had to renounce her clearly and openly if i was to do all that i could do in the north and the man knew that even as he talked to her and me knew it as well as she did that my steps to duty werefirst separation then abandonment at the touch of that thought my dream of a return was shattered i turned on the man suddenly as he was imagining his eloquence was gaining ground with me  what have i to do with these things now i said i have done with them do you think i am coquetting with your people in coming here  no he said but  why cannot you leave me alone i have done with these things i have ceased to be anything but a private man  yes he answered but have you thoughtthis talk of war these reckless challenges these wild aggressions  i stood up  no i cried i wont hear you i took count of all those things i weighed themand i have come away  he seemed to consider the possibility of persistence he looked from me to where the lady sat regarding us  war he said as if he were speaking to himself and then turned slowly from me and walked away  i stood caught in the whirl of thoughts his appeal had set going  i heard my ladys voice  dear she said but if they have need of you  she did not finish her sentence she let it rest there i turned to her sweet face and the balance of my mood swayed and reeled  they want me only to do the thing they dare not do themselves i said if they distrust gresham they must settle with him themselves  she looked at me doubtfully  but war she said  i saw a doubt on her face that i had seen before a doubt of herself and me the first shadow of the discovery that seen strongly and completely must drive us apart for ever  now i was an older mind than hers and i could sway her to this belief or that  my dear one i said you must not trouble over these things there will be no war certainly there will be no war the age of wars is past trust me to know the justice of this case they have no right upon me dearest and no one has a right upon me i have been free to choose my life and i have chosen this  but war she said  i sat down beside her i put an arm behind her and took her hand in mine i set myself to drive that doubt awayi set myself to fill her mind with pleasant things again i lied to her and in lying to her i lied also to myself and she was only too ready to believe me only too ready to forget  very soon the shadow had gone again and we were hastening to our bathingplace in the grotta del bovo marino where it was our custom to bathe every day we swam and splashed one another and in that buoyant water i seemed to become something lighter and stronger than a man and at last we came out dripping and rejoicing and raced among the rocks and then i put on a dry bathingdress and we sat to bask in the sun and presently i nodded resting my head against her knee and she put her hand upon my hair and stroked it softly and i dozed and behold as it were with the snapping of the string of a violin i was awakening and i was in my own bed in liverpool in the life of today  only for a time i could not believe that all these vivid moments had been no more than the substance of a dream  in truth i could not believe it a dream for all the sobering reality of things about me i bathed and dressed as it were by habit and as i shaved i argued why i of all men should leave the woman i loved to go back to fantastic politics in the hard and strenuous north even if gresham did force the world back to war what was that to me i was a man with the heart of a man and why should i feel the responsibility of a deity for the way the world might go  you know that is not quite the way i think about affairs about my real affairs i am a solicitor you know with a point of view  the vision was so real you must understand so utterly unlike a dream that i kept perpetually recalling little irrelevant details even the ornament of a bookcover that lay on my wifes sewingmachine in the breakfastroom recalled with the utmost vividness the gilt line that ran about the seat in the alcove where i had talked with the messenger from my deserted party have you ever heard of a dream that had a quality like that  like  so that afterwards you remembered little details you had forgotten  i thought i had never noticed the point before but he was right  never i said that is what you never seem to do with dreams  no he answered but that is just what i did i am a solicitor you must understand in liverpool and i could not help wondering what the clients and business people i found myself talking to in my office would think if i told them suddenly i was in love with a girl who would be born a couple of hundred years or so hence and worried about the politics of my greatgreatgreatgrandchildren i was chiefly busy that day negotiating a ninetynineyear building lease it was a private builder in a hurry and we wanted to tie him in every possible way i had an interview with him and he showed a certain want of temper that sent me to bed still irritated that night i had no dream nor did i dream the next night at least to remember  something of that intense reality of conviction vanished i began to feel sure it was a dream and then it came again  when the dream came again nearly four days later it was very different i think it certain that four days had also elapsed in the dream many things had happened in the north and the shadow of them was back again between us and this time it was not so easily dispelled i began i know with moody musings why in spite of all should i go back go back for all the rest of my days to toil and stress insults and perpetual dissatisfaction simply to save hundreds of millions of common people whom i did not love whom too often i could not do other than despise from the stress and anguish of war and infinite misrule and after all i might fail they all sought their own narrow ends and why should not iwhy should not i also live as a man and out of such thoughts her voice summoned me and i lifted my eyes  i found myself awake and walking we had come out above the pleasure city we were near the summit of monte solaro and looking towards the bay it was the late afternoon and very clear far away to the left ischia hung in a golden haze between sea and sky and naples was coldly white against the hills and before us was vesuvius with a tall and slender streamer feathering at last towards the south and the ruins of torre dell annunziata and castellammare glittering and near  i interrupted suddenly you have been to capri of course  only in this dream he said only in this dream all across the bay beyond sorrento were the floating palaces of the pleasure city moored and chained and northward were the broad floating stages that received the aeroplanes aeroplanes fell out of the sky every afternoon each bringing its thousands of pleasureseekers from the uttermost parts of the earth to capri and its delights all these things i say stretched below  but we noticed them only incidentally because of an unusual sight that evening had to show five war aeroplanes that had long slumbered useless in the distant arsenals of the rhinemouth were manoeuvring now in the eastward sky gresham had astonished the world by producing them and others and sending them to circle here and there it was the threat material in the great game of bluff he was playing and it had taken even me by surprise he was one of those incredibly stupid energetic people who seem sent by heaven to create disasters his energy to the first glance seemed so wonderfully like capacity but he had no imagination no invention only a stupid vast driving force of will and a mad faith in his stupid idiot luck to pull him through i remember how we stood out upon the headland watching the squadron circling far away and how i weighed the full meaning of the sight seeing clearly the way things must go and then even it was not too late i might have gone back i think and saved the world the people of the north would follow me i knew granted only that in one thing i respected their moral standards the east and south would trust me as they would trust no other northern man and i knew i had only to put it to her and she would have let me go not because she did not love me  only i did not want to go my will was all the other way about i had so newly thrown off the incubus of responsibility i was still so fresh a renegade from duty that the daylight clearness of what i ought to do had no power at all to touch my will my will was to live to gather pleasures and make my dear lady happy but though this sense of vast neglected duties had no power to draw me it could make me silent and preoccupied it robbed the days i had spent of half their brightness and roused me into dark meditations in the silence of the night and as i stood and watched greshams aeroplanes sweep to and frothose birds of infinite ill omenshe stood beside me watching me perceiving the trouble indeed but not perceiving it clearlyher eyes questioning my face her expression shaded with perplexity her face was grey because the sunset was fading out of the sky it was no fault of hers that she held me she had asked me to go from her and again in the nighttime and with tears she had asked me to go  at last it was the sense of her that roused me from my mood i turned upon her suddenly and challenged her to race down the mountain slopes no she said as if i jarred with her gravity but i was resolved to end that gravity and made her runno one can be very grey and sad who is out of breathand when she stumbled i ran with my hand beneath her arm we ran down past a couple of men who turned back staring in astonishment at my behaviourthey must have recognised my face and halfway down the slope came a tumult in the airclangclank clangclankand we stopped and presently over the hillcrest those war things came flying one behind the other  the man seemed hesitating on the verge of a description  what were they like i asked  they had never fought he said they were just like our ironclads are nowadays they had never fought no one knew what they might do with excited men inside them few even cared to speculate they were great driving things shaped like spearheads without a shaft with a propeller in the place of the shaft  steel  not steel  aluminium  no no nothing of that sort an alloy that was very commonas common as brass for example it was calledlet me see he squeezed his forehead with the fingers of one hand i am forgetting everything he said  and they carried guns  little guns firing high explosive shells they fired the guns backwards out of the base of the leaf so to speak and rammed with the beak that was the theory you know but they had never been fought no one could tell exactly what was going to happen and meanwhile i suppose it was very fine to go whirling through the air like a flight of young swallows swift and easy i guess the captains tried not to think too clearly what the real thing would be like and these flying war machines you know were only one sort of the endless war contrivances that had been invented and had fallen into abeyance during the long peace there were all sorts of these things that people were routing out and furbishing up infernal things silly things things that had never been tried big engines terrible explosives great guns you know the silly way of these ingenious sort of men who make these things they turn em out as beavers build dams and with no more sense of the rivers theyre going to divert and the lands theyre going to flood  as we went down the winding stepway to our hotel again in the twilight i foresaw it all i saw how clearly and inevitably things were driving for war in greshams silly violent hands and i had some inkling of what war was bound to be under these new conditions and even then though i knew it was drawing near the limit of my opportunity i could find no will to go back  he sighed  that was my last chance  we did not go into the city until the sky was full of stars so we walked out upon the high terrace to and fro andshe counselled me to go back  my dearest she said and her sweet face looked up to me this is death this life you lead is death go back to them go back to your duty  she began to weep saying between her sobs and clinging to my arm as she said it go backgo back  then suddenly she fell mute and glancing down at her face i read in an instant the thing she had thought to do it was one of those moments when one sees  no i said  no she asked in surprise and i think a little fearful at the answer to her thought  nothing i said shall send me back nothing i have chosen love i have chosen and the world must go whatever happens i will live this lifei will live for you itnothing shall turn me aside nothing my dear one even if you diedeven if you died  yes she murmured softly  theni also would die  and before she could speak again i began to talk talking eloquentlyas i could do in that lifetalking to exalt love to make the life we were living seem heroic and glorious and the thing i was deserting something hard and enormously ignoble that it was a fine thing to set aside i bent all my mind to throw that glamour upon it seeking not only to convert her but myself to that we talked and she clung to me torn too between all that she deemed noble and all that she knew was sweet and at last i did make it heroic made all the thickening disaster of the world only a sort of glorious setting to our unparalleled love and we two poor foolish souls strutted there at last clad in that splendid delusion drunken rather with that glorious delusion under the still stars  and so my moment passed  it was my last chance even as we went to and fro there the leaders of the south and east were gathering their resolve and the hot answer that shattered greshams bluffing for ever took shape and waited and all over asia and the ocean and the south the air and the wires were throbbing with their warnings to prepareprepare  no one living you know knew what war was no one could imagine with all these new inventions what horror war might bring i believe most people still believed it would be a matter of bright uniforms and shouting charges and triumphs and flags and bandsin a time when half the world drew its foodsupply from regions ten thousand miles away  the man with the white face paused i glanced at him and his face was intent on the floor of the carriage a little railway station a string of loaded trucks a signalbox and the back of a cottage shot by the carriage window and a bridge passed with a clap of noise echoing the tumult of the train  after that he said i dreamt often for three weeks of nights that dream was my life and the worst of it was there were nights when i could not dream when i lay tossing on a bed in this accursed life and theresomewhere lost to methings were happeningmomentous terrible things i lived at nightsmy days my waking days this life i am living now became a faded faraway dream a drab setting the cover of the book  he thought  i could tell you all tell you every little thing in the dream but as to what i did in the daytimeno i could not telli do not remember my memorymy memory has gone the business of life slips from me  he leant forward and pressed his hands upon his eyes for a long time he said nothing  and then said i  the war burst like a hurricane  he stared before him at unspeakable things  and then i urged again  one touch of unreality he said in the low tone of a man who speaks to himself and they would have been nightmares but they were not nightmaresthey were not nightmares no  he was silent for so long that it dawned upon me that there was a danger of losing the rest of the story but he went on talking again in the same tone of questioning selfcommunion  what was there to do but flight i had not thought the war would touch caprii had seemed to see capri as being out of it all as the contrast to it all but two nights after the whole place was shouting and bawling every woman almost and every other man wore a badgegreshams badgeand there was no music but a jangling warsong over and over again and everywhere men enlisting and in the dancing halls they were drilling the whole island was awhirl with rumours it was said again and again that fighting had begun i had not expected this i had seen so little of the life of pleasure that i had failed to reckon with this violence of the amateurs and as for me i was out of it i was like a man who might have prevented the firing of a magazine the time had gone i was no one the vainest stripling with a badge counted for more than i the crowd jostled us and bawled in our ears that accursed song deafened us a woman shrieked at my lady because no badge was on her and we two went back to our own place again ruffled and insultedmy lady white and silent and i aquiver with rage so furious was i i could have quarrelled with her if i could have found one shade of accusation in her eyes  all my magnificence had gone from me i walked up and down our rock cell and outside was the darkling sea and a light to the southward that flared and passed and came again  we must get out of this place i said over and over i have made my choice and i will have no hand in these troubles i will have nothing of this war we have taken our lives out of all these things this is no refuge for us let us go  and the next day we were already in flight from the war that covered the world  and all the rest was flightall the rest was flight  he mused darkly  how much was there of it  he made no answer  how many days  his face was white and drawn and his hands were clenched he took no heed of my curiosity  i tried to draw him back to his story with questions  where did you go i said  when  when you left capri  southwest he said and glanced at me for a second we went in a boat  but i should have thought an aeroplane  they had been seized  i questioned him no more presently i thought he was beginning again he broke out in an argumentative monotone  but why should it be if indeed this battle this slaughter and stress is life why have we this craving for pleasure and beauty if there is no refuge if there is no place of peace and if all our dreams of quiet places are a folly and a snare why have we such dreams surely it was no ignoble cravings no base intentions had brought us to this it was love had isolated us love had come to me with her eyes and robed in her beauty more glorious than all else in life in the very shape and colour of life and summoned me away i had silenced all the voices i had answered all the questionsi had come to her and suddenly there was nothing but war and death  i had an inspiration after all i said it could have been only a dream  a dream he cried flaming upon me a dreamwhen even now  for the first time he became animated a faint flush crept into his cheek he raised his open hand and clenched it and dropped it to his knee he spoke looking away from me and for all the rest of the time he looked away we are but phantoms he said and the phantoms of phantoms desires like cloud shadows and wills of straw that eddy in the wind the days pass use and wont carry us through as a train carries the shadow of its lightsso be it but one thing is real and certain one thing is no dream stuff but eternal and enduring it is the centre of my life and all other things about it are subordinate or altogether vain i loved her that woman of a dream and she and i are dead together  a dream how can it be a dream when it drenched a living life with unappeasable sorrow when it makes all that i have lived for and cared for worthless and unmeaning  until that very moment when she was killed i believed we had still a chance of getting away he said all through the night and morning that we sailed across the sea from capri to salerno we talked of escape we were full of hope and it clung about us to the end hope for the life together we should lead out of it all out of the battle and struggle the wild and empty passions the empty arbitrary thou shalt and thou shalt not of the world we were uplifted as though our quest was a holy thing as though love for one another was a mission  even when from our boat we saw the fair face of that great rock capri already scarred and gashed by the gun emplacements and hidingplaces that were to make it a fastnesswe reckoned nothing of the imminent slaughter though the fury of preparation hung about in puffs and clouds of dust at a hundred points amidst the grey but indeed i made a text of that and talked there you know was the rock still beautiful for all its scars with its countless windows and arches and ways tier upon tier for a thousand feet a vast carving of grey broken by vineclad terraces and lemon and orange groves and masses of agave and prickly pear and puffs of almond blossom and out under the archway that is built over the piccola marina other boats were coming and as we came round the cape and within sight of the mainland another little string of boats came into view driving before the wind towards the southwest in a little while a multitude had come out the remoter just little specks of ultramarine in the shadow of the eastward cliff  it is love and reason i said fleeing from all this madness of war  and though we presently saw a squadron of aeroplanes flying across the southern sky we did not heed it there it wasa line of little dots in the skyand then more dotting the southeastern horizon and then still more until all that quarter of the sky was stippled with blue specks now they were all thin little strokes of blue and now one and now a multitude would heel and catch the sun and become short flashes of light they came rising and falling and growing larger like some huge flight of gulls or rooks or suchlike birds moving with a marvellous uniformity and ever as they drew nearer they spread over a greater width of sky the southward wing flung itself in an arrowheaded cloud athwart the sun and then suddenly they swept round to the eastward and streamed eastward growing smaller and smaller and clearer and clearer again until they vanished from the sky and after that we noted to the northward and very high greshams fighting machines hanging high over naples like an evening swarm of gnats  it seemed to have no more to do with us than a flight of birds  even the mutter of guns far away in the southeast seemed to us to signify nothing  each day each dream after that we were still exalted still seeking that refuge where we might live and love fatigue had come upon us pain and many distresses for though we were dusty and stained by our toilsome tramping and half starved and with the horror of the dead men we had seen and the flight of the peasantsfor very soon a gust of fighting swept up the peninsulawith these things haunting our minds it still resulted only in a deepening resolution to escape oh but she was brave and patient she who had never faced hardship and exposure had courage for herselfand me we went to and fro seeking an outlet over a country all commandeered and ransacked by the gathering hosts of war always we went on foot at first there were other fugitives but we did not mingle with them some escaped northward some were caught in the torrent of peasantry that swept along the main roads many gave themselves into the hands of the soldiery and were sent northward many of the men were impressed but we kept away from these things we had brought no money to bribe a passage north and i feared for my lady at the hands of these conscript crowds we had landed at salerno and we had been turned back from cava and we had tried to cross towards taranto by a pass over mount alburno but we had been driven back for want of food and so we had come down among the marshes by paestum where those great temples stand alone i had some vague idea that by paestum it might be possible to find a boat or something and take once more to sea and there it was the battle overtook us  a sort of soulblindness had me plainly i could see that we were being hemmed in that the great net of that giant warfare had us in its toils many times we had seen the levies that had come down from the north going to and fro and had come upon them in the distance amidst the mountains making ways for the ammunition and preparing the mounting of the guns once we fancied they had fired at us taking us for spiesat any rate a shot had gone shuddering over us several times we had hidden in woods from hovering aeroplanes  but all these things do not matter now these nights of flight and pain we were in an open place near those great temples at paestum at last on a blank stony place dotted with spiky bushes empty and desolate and so flat that a grove of eucalyptus far away showed to the feet of its stems how i can see it my lady was sitting down under a bush resting a little for she was very weak and weary and i was standing up watching to see if i could tell the distance of the firing that came and went they were still you know fighting far from each other with these terrible new weapons that had never before been used guns that would carry beyond sight and aeroplanes that would dowhat they would do no man could foretell  i knew that we were between the two armies and that they drew together i knew we were in danger and that we could not stop there and rest  though all those things were in my mind they were in the background they seemed to be affairs beyond our concern chiefly i was thinking of my lady an aching distress filled me for the first time she had owned herself beaten and had fallen aweeping behind me i could hear her sobbing but i would not turn round to her because i knew she had need of weeping and had held herself so far and so long for me it was well i thought that she would weep and rest and then we would toil on again for i had no inkling of the thing that hung so near even now i can see her as she sat there her lovely hair upon her shoulder can mark again the deepening hollow of her cheek  if we had parted she said if i had let you go  no said i even now i do not repent i will not repent i made my choice and i will hold on to the end  and then  overhead in the sky flashed something and burst and all about us i heard the bullets making a noise like a handful of peas suddenly thrown they chipped the stones about us and whirled fragments from the bricks and passed  he put his hand to his mouth and then moistened his lips  at the flash i had turned about  you knowshe stood up  she stood up you know and moved a step towards me  as though she wanted to reach me  and she had been shot through the heart  he stopped and stared at me i felt all that foolish incapacity an englishman feels on such occasions i met his eyes for a moment and then stared out of the window for a long space we kept silence when at last i looked at him he was sitting back in his corner his arms folded and his teeth gnawing at his knuckles  he bit his nail suddenly and stared at it  i carried her he said towards the temples in my armsas though it mattered i dont know why they seemed a sort of sanctuary you know they had lasted so long i suppose  she must have died almost instantly onlyi talked to herall the way  silence again  i have seen those temples i said abruptly and indeed he had brought those still sunlit arcades of worn sandstone very vividly before me  it was the brown one the big brown one i sat down on a fallen pillar and held her in my arms silent after the first babble was over and after a little while the lizards came out and ran about again as though nothing unusual was going on as though nothing had changed it was tremendously still there the sun high and the shadows still even the shadows of the weeds upon the entablature were stillin spite of the thudding and banging that went all about the sky  i seem to remember that the aeroplanes came up out of the south and that the battle went away to the west one aeroplane was struck and overset and fell i remember thatthough it didnt interest me in the least it didnt seem to signify it was like a wounded gull you knowflapping for a time in the water i could see it down the aisle of the templea black thing in the bright blue water  three or four times shells burst about the beach and then that ceased each time that happened all the lizards scuttled in and hid for a space that was all the mischief done except that once a stray bullet gashed the stone hard bymade just a fresh bright surface  as the shadows grew longer the stillness seemed greater  the curious thing he remarked with the manner of a man who makes a trivial conversation is that i didnt thinki didnt think at all i sat with her in my arms amidst the stonesin a sort of lethargy stagnant  and i dont remember waking up i dont remember dressing that day i know i found myself in my office with my letters all slit open in front of me and how i was struck by the absurdity of being there seeing that in reality i was sitting stunned in that paestum temple with a dead woman in my arms i read my letters like a machine i have forgotten what they were about  he stopped and there was a long silence  suddenly i perceived that we were running down the incline from chalk farm to euston i started at this passing of time i turned on him with a brutal question with the tone of now or never  and did you dream again  yes  he seemed to force himself to finish his voice was very low  once more and as it were only for a few instants i seemed to have suddenly awakened out of a great apathy to have risen into a sitting position and the body lay there on the stones beside me a gaunt body not her you know so soonit was not her  i may have heard voices i do not know only i knew clearly that men were coming into the solitude and that that was a last outrage  i stood up and walked through the temple and then there came into sightfirst one man with a yellow face dressed in a uniform of dirty white trimmed with blue and then several climbing to the crest of the old wall of the vanished city and crouching there they were little bright figures in the sunlight and there they hung weapon in hand peering cautiously before them  and further away i saw others and then more at another point in the wall it was a long lax line of men in open order  presently the man i had first seen stood up and shouted a command and his men came tumbling down the wall and into the high weeds towards the temple he scrambled down with them and led them he came facing towards me and when he saw me he stopped  at first i had watched these men with a mere curiosity but when i had seen they meant to come to the temple i was moved to forbid them i shouted to the officer  you must not come here i cried i am here i am here with my dead  he stared and then shouted a question back to me in some unknown tongue  i repeated what i had said  he shouted again and i folded my arms and stood still presently he spoke to his men and came forward he carried a drawn sword  i signed to him to keep away but he continued to advance i told him again very patiently and clearly you must not come here these are old temples and i am here with my dead  presently he was so close i could see his face clearly it was a narrow face with dull grey eyes and a black moustache he had a scar on his upper lip and he was dirty and unshaven he kept shouting unintelligible things questions perhaps at me  i know now that he was afraid of me but at the time that did not occur to me as i tried to explain to him he interrupted me in imperious tones bidding me i suppose stand aside  he made to go past me and i caught hold of him  i saw his face change at my grip  you fool i cried dont you know she is dead  he started back he looked at me with cruel eyes  i saw a sort of exultant resolve leap into themdelight then suddenly with a scowl he swept his sword backsoand thrust  he stopped abruptly  i became aware of a change in the rhythm of the train the brakes lifted their voices and the carriage jarred and jerked this present world insisted upon itself became clamorous i saw through the steamy window huge electric lights glaring down from tall masts upon a fog saw rows of stationary empty carriages passing by and then a signalbox hoisting its constellation of green and red into the murky london twilight marched after them i looked again at his drawn features  he ran me through the heart it was with a sort of astonishmentno fear no painbut just amazement that i felt it pierce me felt the sword drive home into my body it didnt hurt you know it didnt hurt at all  the yellow platform lights came into the field of view passing first rapidly then slowly and at last stopping with a jerk dim shapes of men passed to and fro without  euston cried a voice  do you mean  there was no pain no sting or smart amazement and then darkness sweeping over everything the hot brutal face before me the face of the man who had killed me seemed to recede it swept out of existence  euston clamoured the voices outside euston  the carriage door opened admitting a flood of sound and a porter stood regarding us the sounds of doors slamming and the hoofclatter of cabhorses and behind these things the featureless remote roar of the london cobblestones came to my ears a truckload of lighted lamps blazed along the platform  a darkness a flood of darkness that opened and spread and blotted out all things  any luggage sir said the porter  and that was the end i asked  he seemed to hesitate then almost inaudibly he answered no  you mean  i couldnt get to her she was there on the other side of the temple and then  yes i insisted yes  nightmares he cried nightmares indeed my god great birds that fought and tore       xxvi    the valley of spiders   towards midday the three pursuers came abruptly round a bend in the torrent bed upon the sight of a very broad and spacious valley the difficult and winding trench of pebbles along which they had tracked the fugitives for so long expanded to a broad slope and with a common impulse the three men left the trail and rode to a little eminence set with olivedun trees and there halted the two others as became them a little behind the man with the silverstudded bridle  for a space they scanned the great expanse below them with eager eyes it spread remoter and remoter with only a few clusters of sere thorn bushes here and there and the dim suggestions of some now waterless ravine to break its desolation of yellow grass its purple distances melted at last into the bluish slopes of the further hillshills it might be of a greener kindand above them invisibly supported and seeming indeed to hang in the blue were the snowclad summits of mountainsthat grew larger and bolder to the northwestward as the sides of the valley drew together and westward the valley opened until a distant darkness under the sky told where the forests began but the three men looked neither east nor west but only steadfastly across the valley  the gaunt man with the scarred lip was the first to speak nowhere he said with a sigh of disappointment in his voice but after all they had a full days start  they dont know we are after them said the little man on the white horse  she would know said the leader bitterly as if speaking to himself  even then they cant go fast theyve got no beast but the mule and all today the girls foot has been bleeding  the man with the silver bridle flashed a quick intensity of rage on him do you think i havent seen that he snarled  it helps anyhow whispered the little man to himself  the gaunt man with the scarred lip stared impassively they cant be over the valley he said if we ride hard  he glanced at the white horse and paused  curse all white horses said the man with the silver bridle and turned to scan the beast his curse included  the little man looked down between the melancholy ears of his steed  i did my best he said  the two others stared again across the valley for a space the gaunt man passed the back of his hand across the scarred lip  come up said the man who owned the silver bridle suddenly the little man started and jerked his rein and the horse hoofs of the three made a multitudinous faint pattering upon the withered grass as they turned back towards the trail  they rode cautiously down the long slope before them and so came through a waste of prickly twisted bushes and strange dry shapes of thorny branches that grew amongst the rocks into the levels below and there the trail grew faint for the soil was scanty and the only herbage was this scorched dead straw that lay upon the ground still by hard scanning by leaning beside the horses necks and pausing ever and again even these white men could contrive to follow after their prey  there were trodden places bent and broken blades of the coarse grass and ever and again the sufficient intimation of a footmark and once the leader saw a brown smear of blood where the halfcaste girl may have trod and at that under his breath he cursed her for a fool  the gaunt man checked his leaders tracking and the little man on the white horse rode behind a man lost in a dream they rode one after another the man with the silver bridle led the way and they spoke never a word after a time it came to the little man on the white horse that the world was very still he started out of his dream besides the little noises of their horses and equipment the whole great valley kept the brooding quiet of a painted scene  before him went his master and his fellow each intently leaning forward to the left each impassively moving with the paces of his horse their shadows went before themstill noiseless tapering attendants and nearer a crouched cool shape was his own he looked about him what was it had gone then he remembered the reverberation from the banks of the gorge and the perpetual accompaniment of shifting jostling pebbles and moreover there was no breeze that was it what a vast still place it was a monotonous afternoon slumber and the sky open and blank except for a sombre veil of haze that had gathered in the upper valley  he straightened his back fretted with his bridle puckered his lips to whistle and simply sighed he turned in his saddle for a time and stared at the throat of the mountain gorge out of which they had come blank blank slopes on either side with never a sign of a decent beast or tree much less a man what a land it was what a wilderness he dropped again into his former pose  it filled him with a momentary pleasure to see a wry stick of purple black flash out into the form of a snake and vanish amidst the brown after all the infernal valley was alive and then to rejoice him still more came a little breath across his face a whisper that came and went the faintest inclination of a stiff blackantlered bush upon a little crest the first intimations of a possible breeze idly he wetted his finger and held it up  he pulled up sharply to avoid a collision with the gaunt man who had stopped at fault upon the trail just at that guilty moment he caught his masters eye looking towards him  for a time he forced an interest in the tracking then as they rode on again he studied his masters shadow and hat and shoulder appearing and disappearing behind the gaunt mans nearer contours they had ridden four days out of the very limits of the world into this desolate place short of water with nothing but a strip of dried meat under their saddles over rocks and mountains where surely none but these fugitives had ever been beforefor that  and all this was for a girl a mere wilful child and the man had whole cityfuls of people to do his basest biddinggirls women why in the name of passionate folly this one in particular asked the little man and scowled at the world and licked his parched lips with a blackened tongue it was the way of the master and that was all he knew just because she sought to evade him  his eye caught a whole row of highplumed canes bending in unison and then the tails of silk that hung before his neck flapped and fell the breeze was growing stronger somehow it took the stiff stillness out of thingsand that was well  hullo said the gaunt man  all three stopped abruptly  what asked the master what  over there said the gaunt man pointing up the valley  what  something coming towards us  and as he spoke a yellow animal crested a rise and came bearing down upon them it was a big wild dog coming before the wind tongue out at a steady pace and running with such an intensity of purpose that he did not seem to see the horsemen he approached he ran with his nose up following it was plain neither scent nor quarry as he drew nearer the little man felt for his sword hes mad said the gaunt rider  shout said the little man and shouted  the dog came on then when the little mans blade was already out it swerved aside and went panting by them and passed the eyes of the little man followed its flight there was no foam he said for a space the man with the silverstudded bridle stared up the valley oh come on he cried at last what does it matter and jerked his horse into movement again  the little man left the insoluble mystery of a dog that fled from nothing but the wind and lapsed into profound musings on human character come on he whispered to himself why should it be given to one man to say come on with that stupendous violence of effect always all his life the man with the silver bridle has been saying that if i said it thought the little man but people marvelled when the master was disobeyed even in the wildest things this halfcaste girl seemed to him seemed to every one madblasphemous almost the little man by way of comparison reflected on the gaunt rider with the scarred lip as stalwart as his master as brave and indeed perhaps braver and yet for him there was obedience nothing but to give obedience duly and stoutly  certain sensations of the hands and knees called the little man back to more immediate things he became aware of something he rode up beside his gaunt fellow do you notice the horses he said in an undertone  the gaunt face looked interrogation  they dont like this wind said the little man and dropped behind as the man with the silver bridle turned upon him  its all right said the gauntfaced man  they rode on again for a space in silence the foremost two rode downcast upon the trail the hindmost man watched the haze that crept down the vastness of the valley nearer and nearer and noted how the wind grew in strength moment by moment far away on the left he saw a line of dark bulkswild hog perhaps galloping down the valley but of that he said nothing nor did he remark again upon the uneasiness of the horses  and then he saw first one and then a second great white ball a great shining white ball like a gigantic head of thistledown that drove before the wind athwart the path these balls soared high in the air and dropped and rose again and caught for a moment and hurried on and passed but at the sight of them the restlessness of the horses increased  then presently he saw that more of these drifting globesand then soon very many morewere hurrying towards him down the valley  they became aware of a squealing athwart the path a huge boar rushed turning his head but for one instant to glance at them and then hurling on down the valley again and at that all three stopped and sat in their saddles staring into the thickening haze that was coming upon them  if it were not for this thistledown began the leader  but now a big globe came drifting past within a score of yards of them it was really not an even sphere at all but a vast soft ragged filmy thing a sheet gathered by the corners an aerial jellyfish as it were but rolling over and over as it advanced and trailing long cobwebby threads and streamers that floated in its wake  it isnt thistledown said the little man  i dont like the stuff said the gaunt man  and they looked at one another  curse it cried the leader the airs full of lit up there if it keeps on at this pace long it will stop us altogether  an instinctive feeling such as lines out a herd of deer at the approach of some ambiguous thing prompted them to turn their horses to the wind ride forward for a few paces and stare at that advancing multitude of floating masses they came on before the wind with a sort of smooth swiftness rising and falling noiselessly sinking to earth rebounding high soaringall with a perfect unanimity with a still deliberate assurance  right and left of the horsemen the pioneers of this strange army passed at one that rolled along the ground breaking shapelessly and trailing out reluctantly into long grappling ribbons and bands all three horses began to shy and dance the master was seized with a sudden unreasonable impatience he cursed the drifting globes roundly get on he cried get on what do these things matter how can they matter back to the trail he fell swearing at his horse and sawed the bit across its mouth  he shouted aloud with rage i will follow that trail i tell you he cried where is the trail  he gripped the bridle of his prancing horse and searched amidst the grass a long and clinging thread fell across his face a grey streamer dropped about his bridle arm some big active thing with many legs ran down the back of his head he looked up to discover one of those grey masses anchored as it were above him by these things and flapping out ends as a sail flaps when a boat comes aboutbut noiselessly  he had an impression of many eyes of a dense crew of squat bodies of long manyjointed limbs hauling at their mooring ropes to bring the thing down upon him for a space he stared up reining in his prancing horse with the instinct born of years of horsemanship then the flat of a sword smote his back and a blade flashed overhead and cut the drifting balloon of spiderweb free and the whole mass lifted softly and drove clear and away  spiders cried the voice of the gaunt man the things are full of big spiders look my lord  the man with the silver bridle still followed the mass that drove away  look my lord  the master found himself staring down at a red smashed thing on the ground that in spite of partial obliteration could still wriggle unavailing legs then when the gaunt man pointed to another mass that bore down upon them he drew his sword hastily up the valley now it was like a fog bank torn to rags he tried to grasp the situation  ride for it the little man was shouting ride for it down the valley  what happened then was like the confusion of a battle the man with the silver bridle saw the little man go past him slashing furiously at imaginary cobwebs saw him cannon into the horse of the gaunt man and hurl it and its rider to earth his own horse went a dozen paces before he could rein it in then he looked up to avoid imaginary dangers and then back again to see a horse rolling on the ground the gaunt man standing and slashing over it at a rent and fluttering mass of grey that streamed and wrapped about them both and thick and fast as thistledown on waste land on a windy day in july the cobweb masses were coming on  the little man had dismounted but he dared not release his horse he was endeavouring to lug the struggling brute back with the strength of one arm while with the other he slashed aimlessly the tentacles of a second grey mass had entangled themselves with the struggle and this second grey mass came to its moorings and slowly sank  the master set his teeth gripped his bridle lowered his head and spurred his horse forward the horse on the ground rolled over there was blood and moving shapes upon the flanks and the gaunt man suddenly leaving it ran forward towards his master perhaps ten paces his legs were swathed and encumbered with grey he made ineffectual movements with his sword grey streamers waved from him there was a thin veil of grey across his face with his left hand he beat at something on his body and suddenly he stumbled and fell he struggled to rise and fell again and suddenly horribly began to howl ohohoo ohooh  the master could see the great spiders upon him and others upon the ground  as he strove to force his horse nearer to this gesticulating screaming grey object that struggled up and down there came a clatter of hoofs and the little man in act of mounting swordless balanced on his belly athwart the white horse and clutching its mane whirled past and again a clinging thread of grey gossamer swept across the masters face all about him and over him it seemed this drifting noiseless cobweb circled and drew nearer him  to the day of his death he never knew just how the event of that moment happened did he indeed turn his horse or did it really of its own accord stampede after its fellow suffice it that in another second he was galloping full tilt down the valley with his sword whirling furiously overhead and all about him on the quickening breeze the spiders airships their air bundles and air sheets seemed to him to hurry in a conscious pursuit  clatter clatter thud thudthe man with the silver bridle rode heedless of his direction with his fearful face looking up now right now left and his sword arm ready to slash and a few hundred yards ahead of him with a tail of torn cobweb trailing behind him rode the little man on the white horse still but imperfectly in the saddle the reeds bent before them the wind blew fresh and strong over his shoulder the master could see the webs hurrying to overtake  he was so intent to escape the spiders webs that only as his horse gathered together for a leap did he realise the ravine ahead and then he realised it only to misunderstand and interfere he was leaning forward on his horses neck and sat up and back all too late  but if in his excitement he had failed to leap at any rate he had not forgotten how to fall he was horseman again in midair he came off clear with a mere bruise upon his shoulder and his horse rolled kicking spasmodic legs and lay still but the masters sword drove its point into the hard soil and snapped clean across as though chance refused him any longer as her knight and the splintered end missed his face by an inch or so  he was on his feet in a moment breathlessly scanning the onrushing spiderwebs for a moment he was minded to run and then thought of the ravine and turned back he ran aside once to dodge one drifting terror and then he was swiftly clambering down the precipitous sides and out of the touch of the gale  there under the lee of the dry torrents steeper banks he might crouch and watch these strange grey masses pass and pass in safety till the wind fell and it became possible to escape and there for a long time he crouched watching the strange grey ragged masses trail their streamers across his narrowed sky  once a stray spider fell into the ravine close beside hima full foot it measured from leg to leg and its body was half a mans handand after he had watched its monstrous alacrity of search and escape for a little while and tempted it to bite his broken sword he lifted up his ironheeled boot and smashed it into a pulp he swore as he did so and for a time sought up and down for another  then presently when he was surer these spider swarms could not drop into the ravine he found a place where he could sit down and sat and fell into deep thought and began after his manner to gnaw his knuckles and bite his nails and from this he was moved by the coming of the man with the white horse  he heard him long before he saw him as a clattering of hoofs stumbling footsteps and a reassuring voice then the little man appeared a rueful figure still with a tail of white cobweb trailing behind him they approached each other without speaking without a salutation the little man was fatigued and shamed to the pitch of hopeless bitterness and came to a stop at last face to face with his seated master the latter winced a little under his dependents eye well he said at last with no pretence of authority  you left him  my horse bolted  i know so did mine  he laughed at his master mirthlessly  i say my horse bolted said the man who once had a silverstudded bridle  cowards both said the little man  the other gnawed his knuckle through some meditative moments with his eye on his inferior  dont call me a coward he said at length  you are a coward like myself  a coward possibly there is a limit beyond which every man must fear that i have learnt at last but not like yourself that is where the difference comes in  i never could have dreamt you would have left him he saved your life two minutes before why are you our lord  the master gnawed his knuckles again and his countenance was dark  no man calls me a coward he said no  a broken sword is better than none  one spavined white horse cannot be expected to carry two men a four days journey i hate white horses but this time it cannot be helped you begin to understand me i perceive that you are minded on the strength of what you have seen and fancy to taint my reputation it is men of your sort who unmake kings besides whichi never liked you  my lord said the little man  no said the master no  he stood up sharply as the little man moved for a minute perhaps they faced one another overhead the spiders balls went driving there was a quick movement among the pebbles a running of feet a cry of despair a gasp and a blow  towards nightfall the wind fell the sun set in a calm serenity and the man who had once possessed the silver bridle came at last very cautiously and by an easy slope out of the ravine again but now he led the white horse that once belonged to the little man he would have gone back to his horse to get his silvermounted bridle again but he feared night and a quickening breeze might still find him in the valley and besides he disliked greatly to think he might discover his horse all swathed in cobwebs and perhaps unpleasantly eaten  and as he thought of those cobwebs and of all the dangers he had been through and the manner in which he had been preserved that day his hand sought a little reliquary that hung about his neck and he clasped it for a moment with heartfelt gratitude as he did so his eyes went across the valley  i was hot with passion he said and now she has met her reward they also no doubt  and behold far away out of the wooded slopes across the valley but in the clearness of the sunset distinct and unmistakable he saw a little spire of smoke  at that his expression of serene resignation changed to an amazed anger smoke he turned the head of the white horse about and hesitated and as he did so a little rustle of air went through the grass about him far away upon some reeds swayed a tattered sheet of grey he looked at the cobwebs he looked at the smoke  perhaps after all it is not them he said at last  but he knew better  after he had stared at the smoke for some time he mounted the white horse  as he rode he picked his way amidst stranded masses of web for some reason there were many dead spiders on the ground and those that lived feasted guiltily on their fellows at the sound of his horses hoofs they fled  their time had passed from the ground without either a wind to carry them or a windingsheet ready these things for all their poison could do him little evil  he flicked with his belt at those he fancied came too near once where a number ran together over a bare place he was minded to dismount and trample them with his boots but this impulse he overcame ever and again he turned in his saddle and looked back at the smoke  spiders he muttered over and over again spiders well well the next time i must spin a web       xxvii    the new accelerator   certainly if ever a man found a guinea when he was looking for a pin it is my good friend professor gibberne i have heard before of investigators overshooting the mark but never quite to the extent that he has done he has really this time at any rate without any touch of exaggeration in the phrase found something to revolutionise human life and that when he was simply seeking an allround nervous stimulant to bring languid people up to the stresses of these pushful days i have tasted the stuff now several times and i cannot do better than describe the effect the thing had on me that there are astonishing experiences in store for all in search of new sensations will become apparent enough  professor gibberne as many people know is my neighbour in folkestone unless my memory plays me a trick his portrait at various ages has already appeared in the strand magazinethink late in 1899 but i am unable to look it up because i have lent that volume to someone who has never sent it back the reader may perhaps recall the high forehead and the singularly long black eyebrows that give such a mephistophelean touch to his face he occupies one of those pleasant little detached houses in the mixed style that make the western end of the upper sandgate road so interesting his is the one with the flemish gables and the moorish portico and it is in the little room with the mullioned bay window that he works when he is down here and in which of an evening we have so often smoked and talked together he is a mighty jester but besides he likes to talk to me about his work he is one of those men who find a help and stimulus in talking and so i have been able to follow the conception of the new accelerator right up from a very early stage of course the greater portion of his experimental work is not done in folkestone but in gower street in the fine new laboratory next to the hospital that he has been the first to use  as every one knows or at least as all intelligent people know the special department in which gibberne has gained so great and deserved a reputation among physiologists is the action of drugs upon the nervous system upon soporifics sedatives and anaesthetics he is i am told unequalled he is also a chemist of considerable eminence and i suppose in the subtle and complex jungle of riddles that centres about the ganglion cell and the axis fibre there are little cleared places of his making little glades of illumination that until he sees fit to publish his results are still inaccessible to every other living man and in the last few years he has been particularly assiduous upon this question of nervous stimulants and already before the discovery of the new accelerator very successful with them medical science has to thank him for at least three distinct and absolutely safe invigorators of unrivalled value to practising men in cases of exhaustion the preparation known as gibbernes b syrup has i suppose saved more lives already than any lifeboat round the coast  but none of these little things begin to satisfy me yet he told me nearly a year ago either they increase the central energy without affecting the nerves or they simply increase the available energy by lowering the nervous conductivity and all of them are unequal and local in their operation one wakes up the heart and viscera and leaves the brain stupefied one gets at the brain champagne fashion and does nothing good for the solar plexus and what i wantand what if its an earthly possibility i mean to haveis a stimulant that stimulates all round that wakes you up for a time from the crown of your head to the tip of your great toe and makes you go twoor even threeto everybody elses one eh thats the thing im after  it would tire a man i said  not a doubt of it and youd eat double or trebleand all that but just think what the thing would mean imagine yourself with a little phial like thishe held up a little bottle of green glass and marked his points with itand in this precious phial is the power to think twice as fast move twice as quickly do twice as much work in a given time as you could otherwise do  but is such a thing possible  i believe so if it isnt ive wasted my time for a year these various preparations of the hypophosphites for example seem to show that something of the sort even if it was only one and a half times as fast it would do  it would do i said  if you were a statesman in a corner for example time rushing up against you something urgent to be done eh  he could dose his private secretary i said  and gaindouble time and think if you for example wanted to finish a book  usually i said i wish id never begun em  or a doctor driven to death wants to sit down and think out a case or a barristeror a man cramming for an examination  worth a guinea a drop said i and moreto men like that  and in a duel again said gibberne where it all depends on your quickness in pulling the trigger  or in fencing i echoed  you see said gibberne if i get it as an allround thing it will really do you no harm at allexcept perhaps to an infinitesimal degree it brings you nearer old age you will just have lived twice to other peoples once  i suppose i meditated in a duelit would be fair  thats a question for the seconds said gibberne  i harked back further and you really think such a thing is possible i said  as possible said gibberne and glanced at something that went throbbing by the window as a motorbus as a matter of fact  he paused and smiled at me deeply and tapped slowly on the edge of his desk with the green phial i think i know the stuff already ive got something coming the nervous smile upon his face betrayed the gravity of his revelation he rarely talked of his actual experimental work unless things were very near the end and it may be it may bei shouldnt be surprisedit may even do the thing at a greater rate than twice  it will be rather a big thing i hazarded  it will be i think rather a big thing  but i dont think he quite knew what a big thing it was to be for all that  i remember we had several talks about the stuff after that the new accelerator he called it and his tone about it grew more confident on each occasion sometimes he talked nervously of unexpected physiological results its use might have and then he would get a little unhappy at others he was frankly mercenary and we debated long and anxiously how the preparation might be turned to commercial account its a good thing said gibberne a tremendous thing i know im giving the world something and i think it only reasonable we should expect the world to pay the dignity of science is all very well but i think somehow i must have the monopoly of the stuff for say ten years i dont see why all the fun in life should go to the dealers in ham  my own interest in the coming drug certainly did not wane in the time i have always had a queer little twist towards metaphysics in my mind i have always been given to paradoxes about space and time and it seemed to me that gibberne was really preparing no less than the absolute acceleration of life suppose a man repeatedly dosed with such a preparation he would live an active and record life indeed but he would be an adult at eleven middleaged at twentyfive and by thirty well on the road to senile decay it seemed to me that so far gibberne was only going to do for any one who took his drug exactly what nature has done for the jews and orientals who are men in their teens and aged by fifty and quicker in thought and act than we are all the time the marvel of drugs has always been great to my mind you can madden a man calm a man make him incredibly strong and alert or a helpless log quicken this passion and allay that all by means of drugs and here was a new miracle to be added to this strange armoury of phials the doctors use but gibberne was far too eager upon his technical points to enter very keenly into my aspect of the question  it was the 7th or 8th of august when he told me the distillation that would decide his failure or success for a time was going forward as we talked and it was on the 10th that he told me the thing was done and the new accelerator a tangible reality in the world i met him as i was going up the sandgate hill towards folkestonei think i was going to get my hair cut and he came hurrying down to meet mei suppose he was coming to my house to tell me at once of his success i remember that his eyes were unusually bright and his face flushed and i noted even then the swift alacrity of his step  its done he cried and gripped my hand speaking very fast its more than done come up to my house and see  really  really he shouted incredibly come up and see  and it doestwice  it does more much more it scares me come up and see the stuff taste it try it its the most amazing stuff on earth he gripped my arm and walking at such a pace that he forced me into a trot went shouting with me up the hill a whole charàbancful of people turned and stared at us in unison after the manner of people in charsàbanc it was one of those hot clear days that folkestone sees so much of every colour incredibly bright and every outline hard there was a breeze of course but not so much breeze as sufficed under these conditions to keep me cool and dry i panted for mercy  im not walking fast am i cried gibberne and slackened his pace to a quick march  youve been taking some of this stuff i puffed  no he said at the utmost a drop of water that stood in a beaker from which i had washed out the last traces of the stuff i took some last night you know but that is ancient history now  and it goes twice i said nearing his doorway in a grateful perspiration  it goes a thousand times many thousand times cried gibberne with a dramatic gesture flinging open his early english carved oak gate  phew said i and followed him to the door  i dont know how many times it goes he said with his latchkey in his hand  and you  it throws all sorts of light on nervous physiology it kicks the theory of vision into a perfectly new shape  heaven knows how many thousand times well try all that afterthe thing is to try the stuff now  try the stuff i said as we went along the passage  rather said gibberne turning on me in his study there it is in that little green phial there unless you happen to be afraid  i am a careful man by nature and only theoretically adventurous i was afraid but on the other hand there is pride  well i haggled you say youve tried it  ive tried it he said and i dont look hurt by it do i i dont even look livery and i feel  i sat down give me the potion i said if the worst comes to the worst it will save having my hair cut and that i think is one of the most hateful duties of a civilised man how do you take the mixture  with water said gibberne whacking down a carafe  he stood up in front of his desk and regarded me in his easychair his manner was suddenly affected by a touch of the harley street specialist its rum stuff you know he said  i made a gesture with my hand  i must warn you in the first place as soon as youve got it down to shut your eyes and open them very cautiously in a minute or sos time one still sees the sense of vision is a question of length of vibration and not of multitude of impacts but theres a kind of shock to the retina a nasty giddy confusion just at the time if the eyes are open keep em shut  shut i said good  and the next thing is keep still dont begin to whack about you may fetch something a nasty rap if you do remember you will be going several thousand times faster than you ever did before heart lungs muscles braineverythingand you will hit hard without knowing it you wont know it you know youll feel just as you do now only everything in the world will seem to be going ever so many thousand times slower than it ever went before thats what makes it so deuced queer  lor i said and you mean  youll see said he and took up a little measure he glanced at the material on his desk glasses he said water all here mustnt take too much for the first attempt  the little phial glucked out its precious contents dont forget what i told you he said turning the contents of the measure into a glass in the manner of an italian waiter measuring whisky sit with the eyes tightly shut and in absolute stillness for two minutes he said then you will hear me speak  he added an inch or so of water to the little dose in each glass  bytheby he said dont put your glass down keep it in your hand and rest your hand on your knee yesso and now  he raised his glass  the new accelerator i said  the new accelerator he answered and we touched glasses and drank and instantly i closed my eyes  you know that blank nonexistence into which one drops when one has taken gas for an indefinite interval it was like that then i heard gibberne telling me to wake up and i stirred and opened my eyes there he stood as he had been standing glass still in hand it was empty that was all the difference  well said i  nothing out of the way  nothing a slight feeling of exhilaration perhaps nothing more  sounds  things are still i said by jove yes they are still except the sort of faint pat patter like rain falling on different things what is it  analysed sounds i think he said but i am not sure he glanced at the window have you ever seen a curtain before a window fixed in that way before  i followed his eyes and there was the end of the curtain frozen as it were corner high in the act of flapping briskly in the breeze  no said i thats odd  and here he said and opened the hand that held the glass naturally i winced expecting the glass to smash but so far from smashing it did not even seem to stir it hung in midairmotionless roughly speaking said gibberne an object in these latitudes falls 16 feet in the first second this glass is falling 16 feet in a second now only you see it hasnt been falling yet for the hundredth part of a second that gives you some idea of the pace of my accelerator  and he waved his hand round and round over and under the slowly sinking glass finally he took it by the bottom pulled it down and placed it very carefully on the table eh he said to me and laughed  that seems all right i said and began very gingerly to raise myself from my chair i felt perfectly well very light and comfortable and quite confident in my mind i was going fast all over my heart for example was beating a thousand times a second but that caused me no discomfort at all i looked out of the window an immovable cyclist head down and with a frozen puff of dust behind his drivingwheel scorched to overtake a galloping charàbanc that did not stir i gaped in amazement at this incredible spectacle gibberne i cried how long will this confounded stuff last  heaven knows he answered last time i took it i went to bed and slept it off i tell you i was frightened it must have lasted some minutes i thinkit seemed like hours but after a bit it slows down rather suddenly i believe  i was proud to observe that i did not feel frightenedi suppose because there were two of us why shouldnt we go out i asked  why not  theyll see us  not they goodness no why we shall be going a thousand times faster than the quickest conjuring trick that was ever done come along which way shall we go window or door  and out by the window we went  assuredly of all the strange experiences that i have ever had or imagined or read of other people having or imagining that little raid i made with gibberne on the folkestone leas under the influence of the new accelerator was the strangest and maddest of all we went out by his gate into the road and there we made a minute examination of the statuesque passing traffic the tops of the wheels and some of the legs of the horses of this charàbanc the end of the whiplash and the lower jaw of the conductorwho was just beginning to yawnwere perceptibly in motion but all the rest of the lumbering conveyance seemed still and quite noiseless except for a faint rattling that came from one mans throat and as parts of this frozen edifice there were a driver you know and a conductor and eleven people the effect as we walked about the thing began by being madly queer and ended by beingdisagreeable there they were people like ourselves and yet not like ourselves frozen in careless attitudes caught in midgesture a girl and a man smiled at one another a leering smile that threatened to last for evermore a woman in a floppy capelline rested her arm on the rail and stared at gibbernes house with the unwinking stare of eternity a man stroked his moustache like a figure of wax and another stretched a tiresome stiff hand with extended fingers towards his loosened hat we stared at them we laughed at them we made faces at them and then a sort of disgust of them came upon us and we turned away and walked round in front of the cyclist towards the leas  goodness cried gibberne suddenly look there  he pointed and there at the tip of his finger and sliding down the air with wings flapping slowly and at the speed of an exceptionally languid snailwas a bee  and so we came out upon the leas there the thing seemed madder than ever the band was playing in the upper stand though all the sound it made for us was a lowpitched wheezy rattle a sort of prolonged last sigh that passed at times into a sound like the slow muffled ticking of some monstrous clock frozen people stood erect strange silent selfconsciouslooking dummies hung unstably in midstride promenading upon the grass i passed close to a little poodle dog suspended in the act of leaping and watched the slow movement of his legs as he sank to earth lord look here cried gibberne and we halted for a moment before a magnificent person in white faintstriped flannels white shoes and a panama hat who turned back to wink at two gaily dressed ladies he had passed a wink studied with such leisurely deliberation as we could afford is an unattractive thing it loses any quality of alert gaiety and one remarks that the winking eye does not completely close that under its drooping lid appears the lower edge of an eyeball and a little line of white heaven give me memory said i and i will never wink again  or smile said gibberne with his eye on the ladys answering teeth  its infernally hot somehow said i lets go slower  oh come along said gibberne  we picked our way among the bathchairs in the path many of the people sitting in the chairs seemed almost natural in their passive poses but the contorted scarlet of the bandsmen was not a restful thing to see a purplefaced little gentleman was frozen in the midst of a violent struggle to refold his newspaper against the wind there were many evidences that all these people in their sluggish way were exposed to a considerable breeze a breeze that had no existence so far as our sensations went we came out and walked a little way from the crowd and turned and regarded it to see all that multitude changed to a picture smitten rigid as it were into the semblance of realistic wax was impossibly wonderful it was absurd of course but it filled me with an irrational an exultant sense of superior advantage consider the wonder of it all that i had said and thought and done since the stuff had begun to work in my veins had happened so far as those people so far as the world in general went in the twinkling of an eye the new accelerator i began but gibberne interrupted me  theres that infernal old woman he said  what old woman  lives next door to me said gibberne has a lapdog that yaps gods the temptation is strong  there is something very boyish and impulsive about gibberne at times before i could expostulate with him he had dashed forward snatched the unfortunate animal out of visible existence and was running violently with it towards the cliff of the leas it was most extraordinary the little brute you know didnt bark or wriggle or make the slightest sign of vitality it kept quite stiffly in an attitude of somnolent repose and gibberne held it by the neck it was like running about with a dog of wood gibberne i cried put it down then i said something else if you run like that gibberne i cried youll set your clothes on fire your linen trousers are going brown as it is  he clapped his hand on his thigh and stood hesitating on the verge gibberne i cried coming up put it down this heat is too much its our running so two or three miles a second friction of the air  what he said glancing at the dog  friction of the air i shouted friction of the air going too fast like meteorites and things too hot and gibberne gibberne im all over pricking and a sort of perspiration you can see people stirring slightly i believe the stuffs working off put that dog down  eh he said  its working off i repeated were too hot and the stuffs working off im wet through  he stared at me then at the band the wheezy rattle of whose performance was certainly going faster then with a tremendous sweep of the arm he hurled the dog away from him and it went spinning upward still inanimate and hung at last over the grouped parasols of a knot of chattering people gibberne was gripping my elbow by jove he cried i believe it is a sort of hot pricking andyes that mans moving his pockethandkerchief perceptibly we must get out of this sharp  but we could not get out of it sharply enough luckily perhaps for we might have run and if we had run we should i believe have burst into flames almost certainly we should have burst into flames you know we had neither of us thought of that but before we could even begin to run the action of the drug had ceased it was the business of a minute fraction of a second the effect of the new accelerator passed like the drawing of a curtain vanished in the movement of a hand i heard gibbernes voice in infinite alarm sit down he said and flop down upon the turf at the edge of the leas i satscorching as i sat there is a patch of burnt grass there still where i sat down the whole stagnation seemed to wake up as i did so the disarticulated vibration of the band rushed together into a blast of music the promenaders put their feet down and walked their ways the papers and flags began flapping smiles passed into words the winker finished his wink and went on his way complacently and all the seated people moved and spoke  the whole world had come alive again was going as fast as we were or rather we were going no faster than the rest of the world it was like slowing down as one comes into a railway station everything seemed to spin round for a second or two i had the most transient feeling of nausea and that was all and the little dog which had seemed to hang for a moment when the force of gibbernes arm was expended fell with a swift acceleration clean through a ladys parasol  that was the saving of us unless it was for one corpulent old gentleman in a bathchair who certainly did start at the sight of us and afterwards regarded us at intervals with a darkly suspicious eye and finally i believe said something to his nurse about us i doubt if a solitary person remarked our sudden appearance among them plop we must have appeared abruptly we ceased to smoulder almost at once though the turf beneath me was uncomfortably hot the attention of every one including even the amusements association band which on this occasion for the only time in its history got out of tunewas arrested by the amazing fact and the still more amazing yapping and uproar caused by the fact that a respectable overfed lapdog sleeping quietly to the east of the bandstand should suddenly fall through the parasol of a lady on the westin a slightly singed condition due to the extreme velocity of its movements through the air in these absurd days too when we are all trying to be as psychic and silly and superstitious as possible people got up and trod on other people chairs were overturned the leas policeman ran how the matter settled itself i do not knowwe were much too anxious to disentangle ourselves from the affair and get out of range of the eye of the old gentleman in the bathchair to make minute inquiries as soon as we were sufficiently cool and sufficiently recovered from our giddiness and nausea and confusion of mind to do so we stood up and skirting the crowd directed our steps back along the road below the metropole towards gibbernes house but amidst the din i heard very distinctly the gentleman who had been sitting beside the lady of the ruptured sunshade using quite unjustifiable threats and language to one of those chairattendants who have inspector written on their caps if you didnt throw the dog he said who did  the sudden return of movement and familiar noises and our natural anxiety about ourselves our clothes were still dreadfully hot and the fronts of the thighs of gibbernes white trousers were scorched a drabbish brown prevented the minute observations i should have liked to make on all these things indeed i really made no observations of any scientific value on that return the bee of course had gone i looked for that cyclist but he was already out of sight as we came into the upper sandgate road or hidden from us by traffic the charàbanc however with its people now all alive and stirring was clattering along at a spanking pace almost abreast of the nearer church  we noted however that the windowsill on which we had stepped in getting out of the house was slightly singed and that the impressions of our feet on the gravel of the path were unusually deep  so it was i had my first experience of the new accelerator practically we had been running about and saying and doing all sorts of things in the space of a second or so of time we had lived half an hour while the band had played perhaps two bars but the effect it had upon us was that the whole world had stopped for our convenient inspection considering all things and particularly considering our rashness in venturing out of the house the experience might certainly have been much more disagreeable than it was it showed no doubt that gibberne has still much to learn before his preparation is a manageable convenience but its practicability it certainly demonstrated beyond all cavil  since that adventure he has been steadily bringing its use under control and i have several times and without the slightest bad result taken measured doses under his direction though i must confess i have not yet ventured abroad again while under its influence i may mention for example that this story has been written at one sitting and without interruption except for the nibbling of some chocolate by its means i began at 625 and my watch is now very nearly at the minute past the halfhour the convenience of securing a long uninterrupted spell of work in the midst of a day full of engagements cannot be exaggerated gibberne is now working at the quantitative handling of his preparation with especial reference to its distinctive effects upon different types of constitution he then hopes to find a retarder with which to dilute its present rather excessive potency the retarder will of course have the reverse effect to the accelerator used alone it should enable the patient to spread a few seconds over many hours of ordinary time and so to maintain an apathetic inaction a glacierlike absence of alacrity amidst the most animated or irritating surroundings the two things together must necessarily work an entire revolution in civilised existence it is the beginning of our escape from that time garment of which carlyle speaks while this accelerator will enable us to concentrate ourselves with tremendous impact upon any moment or occasion that demands our utmost sense and vigour the retarder will enable us to pass in passive tranquillity through infinite hardship and tedium perhaps i am a little optimistic about the retarder which has indeed still to be discovered but about the accelerator there is no possible sort of doubt whatever its appearance upon the market in a convenient controllable and assimilable form is a matter of the next few months it will be obtainable of all chemists and druggists in small green bottles at a high but considering its extraordinary qualities by no means excessive price gibbernes nervous accelerator it will be called and he hopes to be able to supply it in three strengths one in 200 one in 900 and one in 2000 distinguished by yellow pink and white labels respectively  no doubt its use renders a great number of very extraordinary things possible for of course the most remarkable and possibly even criminal proceedings may be effected with impunity by thus dodging as it were into the interstices of time like all potent preparations it will be liable to abuse we have however discussed this aspect of the question very thoroughly and we have decided that this is purely a matter of medical jurisprudence and altogether outside our province we shall manufacture and sell the accelerator and as for the consequenceswe shall see       xxviii    the truth about pyecraft   he sits not a dozen yards away if i glance over my shoulder i can see him and if i catch his eyeand usually i catch his eyeit meets me with an expression  it is mainly an imploring lookand yet with suspicion in it  confound his suspicion if i wanted to tell on him i should have told long ago i dont tell and i dont tell and he ought to feel at his ease as if anything so gross and fat as he could feel at ease who would believe me if i did tell  poor old pyecraft great uneasy jelly of substance the fattest clubman in london  he sits at one of the little club tables in the huge bay by the fire stuffing what is he stuffing i glance judiciously and catch him biting at a round of hot buttered teacake with his eyes on me confound him with his eyes on me  that settles it pyecraft since you will be abject since you will behave as though i was not a man of honour here right under your embedded eyes i write the thing downthe plain truth about pyecraft the man i helped the man i shielded and who has requited me by making my club unendurable absolutely unendurable with his liquid appeal with the perpetual dont tell of his looks  and besides why does he keep on eternally eating  well here goes for the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth  pyecraft i made the acquaintance of pyecraft in this very smokingroom i was a young nervous new member and he saw it i was sitting all alone wishing i knew more of the members and suddenly he came a great rolling front of chins and abdomina towards me and grunted and sat down in a chair close by me and wheezed for a space and scraped for a space with a match and lit a cigar and then addressed me i forget what he saidsomething about the matches not lighting properly and afterwards as he talked he kept stopping the waiters one by one as they went by and telling them about the matches in that thin fluty voice he has but anyhow it was in some such way we began our talking  he talked about various things and came round to games and thence to my figure and complexion you ought to be a good cricketer he said i suppose i am slender slender to what some people would call lean and i suppose i am rather dark stilli am not ashamed of having a hindu greatgrandmother but for all that i dont want casual strangers to see through me at a glance to her so that i was set against pyecraft from the beginning  but he only talked about me in order to get to himself  i expect he said you take no more exercise than i do and probably you eat no less like all excessively obese people he fancied he ate nothing yetand he smiled an oblique smilewe differ  and then he began to talk about his fatness and his fatness all he did for his fatness and all he was going to do for his fatness what people had advised him to do for his fatness and what he had heard of people doing for fatness similar to his a priori he said one would think a question of nutrition could be answered by dietary and a question of assimilation by drugs it was stifling it was dumpling talk it made me feel swelled to hear him  one stands that sort of thing once in a way at a club but a time came when i fancied i was standing too much he took to me altogether too conspicuously i could never go into the smokingroom but he would come wallowing towards me and sometimes he came and gormandised round and about me while i had my lunch he seemed at times almost to be clinging to me he was a bore but not so fearful a bore as to be limited to me and from the first there was something in his manneralmost as though he knew almost as though he penetrated to the fact that i mightthat there was a remote exceptional chance in me that no one else presented  id give anything to get it down he would sayanything and peer at me over his vast cheeks and pant poor old pyecraft he has just gonged no doubt to order another buttered teacake  he came to the actual thing one day our pharmacopoeia he said our western pharmacopoeia is anything but the last word of medical science in the east ive been told  he stopped and stared at me it was like being at an aquarium  i was quite suddenly angry with him look here i said who told you about my greatgrandmothers recipes  well he fenced  every time weve met for a week i saidand weve met pretty often youve given me a broad hint or so about that little secret of mine  well he said now the cats out of the bag ill admit yes it is so i had it  from pattison  indirectly he said which i believe was lying yes  pattison i said took that stuff at his own risk he pursed his mouth and bowed  my greatgrandmothers recipes i said are queer things to handle my father was near making me promise  he didnt  no but he warned me he himself used oneonce  ah  but do you think supposesuppose there did happen to be one  the things are curious documents i said even the smell of em  no  but after going so far pyecraft was resolved i should go farther i was always a little afraid if i tried his patience too much he would fall on me suddenly and smother me i own i was weak but i was also annoyed with pyecraft i had got to that state of feeling for him that disposed me to say well take the risk the little affair of pattison to which i have alluded was a different matter altogether what it was doesnt concern us now but i knew anyhow that the particular recipe i used then was safe the rest i didnt know so much about and on the whole i was inclined to doubt their safety pretty completely  yet even if pyecraft got poisoned  i must confess the poisoning of pyecraft struck me as an immense undertaking  that evening i took that queer oddscented sandalwood box out of my safe and turned the rustling skins over the gentleman who wrote the recipes for my greatgrandmother evidently had a weakness for skins of a miscellaneous origin and his handwriting was cramped to the last degree some of the things are quite unreadable to methough my family with its indian civil service associations has kept up a knowledge of hindustani from generation to generationand none are absolutely plain sailing but i found the one that i knew was there soon enough and sat on the floor by my safe for some time looking at it  look here said i to pyecraft next day and snatched the slip away from his eager grasp  so far as i can make it out this is a recipe for loss of weight ah said pyecraft im not absolutely sure but i think its that and if you take my advice youll leave it alone because you knowi blacken my blood in your interest pyecraftmy ancestors on that side were so far as i can gather a jolly queer lot see  let me try it said pyecraft  i leant back in my chair my imagination made one mighty effort and fell flat within me what in heavens name pyecraft i asked do you think youll look like when you get thin  he was impervious to reason i made him promise never to say a word to me about his disgusting fatness again whatever happenednever and then i handed him that little piece of skin  its nasty stuff i said  no matter he said and took it  he goggled at it butbut he said  he had just discovered that it wasnt english  to the best of my ability i said i will do you a translation  i did my best after that we didnt speak for a fortnight whenever he approached me i frowned and motioned him away and he respected our compact but at the end of the fortnight he was as fat as ever and then he got a word in  i must speak he said it isnt fair theres something wrong its done me no good youre not doing your greatgrandmother justice  wheres the recipe  he produced it gingerly from his pocketbook  i ran my eye over the items was the egg addled i asked  no ought it to have been  that i said goes without saying in all my poor dear greatgrandmothers recipes when condition or quality is not specified you must get the worst she was drastic or nothing and theres one or two possible alternatives to some of these other things you got fresh rattlesnake venom  i got a rattlesnake from jamrachs it costit cost  thats your affair anyhow this last item  i know a man who  yes hm well ill write the alternatives down so far as i know the language the spelling of this recipe is particularly atrocious bytheby dog here probably means pariah dog  for a month after that i saw pyecraft constantly at the club and as fat and anxious as ever he kept our treaty but at times he broke the spirit of it by shaking his head despondently then one day in the cloakroom he said your greatgrandmother  not a word against her i said and he held his peace  i could have fancied he had desisted and i saw him one day talking to three new members about his fatness as though he was in search of other recipes and then quite unexpectedly his telegram came  mr formalyn bawled a pageboy under my nose and i took the telegram and opened it at once  for heavens sake comepyecraft  hm said i and to tell the truth i was so pleased at the rehabilitation of my greatgrandmothers reputation this evidently promised that i made a most excellent lunch  i got pyecrafts address from the hall porter pyecraft inhabited the upper half of a house in bloomsbury and i went there so soon as i had done my coffee and trappistine i did not wait to finish my cigar  mr pyecraft said i at the front door  they believed he was ill he hadnt been out for two days  he expects me said i and they sent me up  i rang the bell at the latticedoor upon the landing  he shouldnt have tried it anyhow i said to myself a man who eats like a pig ought to look like a pig  an obviously worthy woman with an anxious face and a carelessly placed cap came and surveyed me through the lattice  i gave my name and she let me in in a dubious fashion  well said i as we stood together inside pyecrafts piece of the landing  e said you was to come in if you came she said and regarded me making no motion to show me anywhere and then confidentially es locked in sir  locked in  locked imself in yesterday morning and asnt let any one in since sir and ever and again swearing oh my  i stared at the door she indicated by her glances in there i said  yes sir  whats up  she shook her head sadly e keeps on calling for vittles sir eavy vittles e wants i get im what i can pork es had sooit puddin sossiges noo bread everythink like that left outside if you please and me go away es eatin sir somethink awful  there came a piping bawl from inside the door that formalyn  that you pyecraft i shouted and went and banged the door  tell her to go away  i did  then i could hear a curious pattering upon the door almost like some one feeling for the handle in the dark and pyecrafts familiar grunts  its all right i said shes gone  but for a long time the door didnt open  i heard the key turn then pyecrafts voice said come in  i turned the handle and opened the door naturally i expected to see pyecraft  well you know he wasnt there  i never had such a shock in my life there was his sittingroom in a state of untidy disorder plates and dishes among the books and writing things and several chairs overturned but pyecraft  its all right old man shut the door he said and then i discovered him  there he was right up close to the cornice in the corner by the door as though some one had glued him to the ceiling his face was anxious and angry he panted and gesticulated shut the door he said if that woman gets hold of it  i shut the door and went and stood away from him and stared  if anything gives way and you tumble down i said youll break your neck pyecraft  i wish i could he wheezed  a man of your age and weight getting up to kiddish gymnastics  dont he said and looked agonised  ill tell you he said and gesticulated  how the deuce said i are you holding on up there  and then abruptly i realised that he was not holding on at all that he was floating up therejust as a gasfilled bladder might have floated in the same position he began a struggle to thrust himself away from the ceiling and to clamber down the wall to me its that prescription he panted as he did so your greatgran  he took hold of a framed engraving rather carelessly as he spoke and it gave way and he flew back to the ceiling again while the picture smashed on to the sofa bump he went against the ceiling and i knew then why he was all over white on the more salient curves and angles of his person he tried again more carefully coming down by way of the mantel  it was really a most extraordinary spectacle that great fat apoplecticlooking man upside down and trying to get from the ceiling to the floor that prescription he said too successful  how  loss of weightalmost complete  and then of course i understood  by jove pyecraft said i what you wanted was a cure for fatness but you always called it weight you would call it weight  somehow i was extremely delighted i quite liked pyecraft for the time let me help you i said and took his hand and pulled him down he kicked about trying to get foothold somewhere it was very like holding a flag on a windy day  that table he said pointing is solid mahogany and very heavy if you can put me under that  i did and there he wallowed about like a captive balloon while i stood on his hearthrug and talked to him  i lit a cigar tell me i said what happened  i took it he said  how did it taste  oh beastly  i should fancy they all did whether one regards the ingredients or the probable compound or the possible results almost all my greatgrandmothers remedies appear to me at least to be extraordinarily uninviting for my own part  i took a little sip first  yes  and as i felt lighter and better after an hour i decided to take the draught  my dear pyecraft  i held my nose he explained and then i kept on getting lighter and lighterand helpless you know  he gave way suddenly to a burst of passion what the goodness am i to do he said  theres one thing pretty evident i said that you mustnt do if you go out of doors youll go up and up i waved an arm upward theyd have to send santosdumont after you to bring you down again  i suppose it will wear off  i shook my head i dont think you can count on that i said  and then there was another burst of passion and he kicked out at adjacent chairs and banged the floor he behaved just as i should have expected a great fat selfindulgent man to behave under trying circumstancesthat is to say very badly he spoke of me and of my greatgrandmother with an utter want of discretion  i never asked you to take the stuff i said  and generously disregarding the insults he was putting upon me i sat down in his armchair and began to talk to him in a sober friendly fashion  i pointed out to him that this was a trouble he had brought upon himself and that it had almost an air of poetical justice he had eaten too much this he disputed and for a time we argued the point  he became noisy and violent so i desisted from this aspect of his lesson and then said i you committed the sin of euphuism you called it not fat which is just and inglorious but weight you  he interrupted to say that he recognised all that what was he to do  i suggested he should adapt himself to his new conditions so we came to the really sensible part of the business i suggested that it would not be difficult for him to learn to walk about on the ceiling with his hands  i cant sleep he said  but that was no great difficulty it was quite possible i pointed out to make a shakeup under a wire mattress fasten the under things on with tapes and have a blanket sheet and coverlet to button at the side he would have to confide in his housekeeper i said and after some squabbling he agreed to that afterwards it was quite delightful to see the beautifully matteroffact way with which the good lady took all these amazing inversions he could have a library ladder in his room and all his meals could be laid on the top of his bookcase we also hit on an ingenious device by which he could get to the floor whenever he wanted which was simply to put the british encyclopaedia tenth edition on the top of his open shelves he just pulled out a couple of volumes and held on and down he came and we agreed there must be iron staples along the skirting so that he could cling to those whenever he wanted to get about the room on the lower level  as we got on with the thing i found myself almost keenly interested it was i who called in the housekeeper and broke matters to her and it was i chiefly who fixed up the inverted bed in fact i spent two whole days at his flat i am a handy interfering sort of man with a screwdriver and i made all sorts of ingenious adaptations for himran a wire to bring his bells within reach turned all his electric lights up instead of down and so on the whole affair was extremely curious and interesting to me and it was delightful to think of pyecraft like some great fat blowfly crawling about on his ceiling and clambering round the lintel of his doors from one room to another and never never never coming to the club any more  then you know my fatal ingenuity got the better of me i was sitting by his fire drinking his whisky and he was up in his favourite corner by the cornice tacking a turkey carpet to the ceiling when the idea struck me by jove pyecraft i said all this is totally unnecessary  and before i could calculate the complete consequences of my notion i blurted it out lead underclothing said i and the mischief was done  pyecraft received the thing almost in tears to be right ways up again he said  i gave him the whole secret before i saw where it would take me buy sheet lead i said stamp it into discs sew em all over your underclothes until you have enough have leadsoled boots carry a bag of solid lead and the thing is done instead of being a prisoner here you may go abroad again pyecraft you may travel  a still happier idea came to me you need never fear a shipwreck all you need do is just slip off some or all of your clothes take the necessary amount of luggage in your hand and float up in the air  in his emotion he dropped the tackhammer within an ace of my head by jove he said i shall be able to come back to the club again  the thing pulled me up short by jove i said faintly yes of courseyou will  he did he does there he sits behind me now stuffingas i livea third go of buttered teacake and no one in the whole world knowsexcept his housekeeper and methat he weighs practically nothing that he is a mere boring mass of assimilatory matter mere clouds in clothing niente nefas the most inconsiderable of men there he sits watching until i have done this writing then if he can he will waylay me he will come billowing up to me  he will tell me over again all about it how it feels how it doesnt feel how he sometimes hopes it is passing off a little and always somewhere in that fat abundant discourse he will say the secrets keeping eh if any one knew of iti should be so ashamed makes a fellow look such a fool you know crawling about on a ceiling and all that  and now to elude pyecraft occupying as he does an admirable strategic position between me and the door       xxix    the magic shop   i had seen the magic shop from afar several times i had passed it once or twice a shop window of alluring little objects magic balls magic hens wonderful cones ventriloquist dolls the material of the basket trick packs of cards that looked all right and all that sort of thing but never had i thought of going in until one day almost without warning gip hauled me by my finger right up to the window and so conducted himself that there was nothing for it but to take him in i had not thought the place was there to tell the trutha modestsized frontage in regent street between the picture shop and the place where the chicks run about just out of patent incubatorsbut there it was sure enough i had fancied it was down nearer the circus or round the corner in oxford street or even in holborn always over the way and a little inaccessible it had been with something of the mirage in its position but here it was now quite indisputably and the fat end of gips pointing finger made a noise upon the glass  if i was rich said gip dabbing a finger at the disappearing egg id buy myself that and thatwhich was the crying baby very humanand that which was a mystery and called so a neat card asserted buy one and astonish your friends  anything said gip will disappear under one of those cones i have read about it in a book  and there dadda is the vanishing halfpennyonly theyve put it this way up sos we cant see how its done  gip dear boy inherits his mothers breeding and he did not propose to enter the shop or worry in any way only you know quite unconsciously he lugged my finger doorward and he made his interest clear  that he said and pointed to the magic bottle  if you had that i said at which promising inquiry he looked up with a sudden radiance  i could show it to jessie he said thoughtful as ever of others  its less than a hundred days to your birthday gibbles i said and laid my hand on the doorhandle  gip made no answer but his grip tightened on my finger and so we came into the shop  it was no common shop this it was a magic shop and all the prancing precedence gip would have taken in the matter of mere toys was wanting he left the burthen of the conversation to me  it was a little narrow shop not very well lit and the doorbell pinged again with a plaintive note as we closed it behind us for a moment or so we were alone and could glance about us there was a tiger in papiermâché on the glass case that covered the low countera grave kindeyed tiger that waggled his head in a methodical manner there were several crystal spheres a china hand holding magic cards a stock of magic fishbowls in various sizes and an immodest magic hat that shamelessly displayed its springs on the floor were magic mirrors one to draw you out long and thin one to swell your head and vanish your legs and one to make you short and fat like a draught and while we were laughing at these the shopman as i suppose came in  at any rate there he was behind the countera curious sallow dark man with one ear larger than the other and a chin like the toecap of a boot  what can we have the pleasure he said spreading his long magic fingers on the glass case and so with a start we were aware of him  i want i said to buy my little boy a few simple tricks  legerdemain he asked mechanical domestic  anything amusing said i  um said the shopman and scratched his head for a moment as if thinking then quite distinctly he drew from his head a glass ball something in this way he said and held it out  the action was unexpected i had seen the trick done at entertainments endless times beforeits part of the common stock of conjurersbut i had not expected it here thats good i said with a laugh  isnt it said the shopman  gip stretched out his disengaged hand to take this object and found merely a blank palm  its in your pocket said the shopman and there it was  how much will that be i asked  we make no charge for glass balls said the shopman politely we get themhe picked one out of his elbow as he spokefree he produced another from the back of his neck and laid it beside its predecessor on the counter gip regarded his glass ball sagely then directed a look of inquiry at the two on the counter and finally brought his roundeyed scrutiny to the shopman who smiled you may have those two said the shopman and if you dont mind one from my mouth so  gip counselled me mutely for a moment and then in a profound silence put away the four balls resumed my reassuring finger and nerved himself for the next event  we get all our smaller tricks in that way the shopman remarked  i laughed in the manner of one who subscribes to a jest instead of going to the wholesale shop i said of course its cheaper  in a way the shopman said though we pay in the end but not so heavilyas people suppose our larger tricks and our daily provisions and all the other things we want we get out of that hat and you know sir if youll excuse my saying it there isnt a wholesale shop not for genuine magic goods sir i dont know if you noticed our inscriptionthe genuine magic shop he drew a business card from his cheek and handed it to me genuine he said with his finger on the word and added there is absolutely no deception sir  he seemed to be carrying out the joke pretty thoroughly i thought  he turned to gip with a smile of remarkable affability you you know are the right sort of boy  i was surprised at his knowing that because in the interests of discipline we keep it rather a secret even at home but gip received it in unflinching silence keeping a steadfast eye on him  its only the right sort of boy gets through that doorway  and as if by way of illustration there came a rattling at the door and a squeaking little voice could be faintly heard nyar i warn a go in there dadda i warn a go in there nyaaah and then the accents of a downtrodden parent urging consolations and propitiations its locked edward he said  but it isnt said i  it is sir said the shopman alwaysfor that sort of child and as he spoke we had a glimpse of the other youngster a little white face pallid from sweeteating and oversapid food and distorted by evil passions a ruthless little egotist pawing at the enchanted pane its no good sir said the shopman as i moved with my natural helpfulness doorward and presently the spoilt child was carried off howling  how do you manage that i said breathing a little more freely  magic said the shopman with a careless wave of the hand and behold sparks of coloured fire flew out of his fingers and vanished into the shadows of the shop  you were saying he said addressing himself to gip before you came in that you would like one of our buy one and astonish your friends boxes  gip after a gallant effort said yes  its in your pocket  and leaning over the counterhe really had an extraordinary long body this amazing person produced the article in the customary conjurers manner paper he said and took a sheet out of the empty hat with the springs string and behold his mouth was a string box from which he drew an unending thread which when he had tied his parcel he bit off and it seemed to me swallowed the ball of string and then he lit a candle at the nose of one of the ventriloquists dummies stuck one of his fingers which had become sealingwax red into the flame and so sealed the parcel then there was the disappearing egg he remarked and produced one from within my coatbreast and packed it and also the crying baby very human i handed each parcel to gip as it was ready and he clasped them to his chest  he said very little but his eyes were eloquent the clutch of his arms was eloquent he was the playground of unspeakable emotions these you know were real magics  then with a start i discovered something moving about in my hat something soft and jumpy i whipped it off and a ruffled pigeonno doubt a confederatedropped out and ran on the counter and went i fancy into a cardboard box behind the papiermâché tiger  tut tut said the shopman dexterously relieving me of my headdress careless bird andas i livenesting  he shook my hat and shook out into his extended hand two or three eggs a large marble a watch about half a dozen of the inevitable glass balls and then crumpled crinkled paper more and more and more talking all the time of the way in which people neglect to brush their hats inside as well as outpolitely of course but with a certain personal application all sorts of things accumulate sir not you of course in particular nearly every customer astonishing what they carry about with them the crumpled paper rose and billowed on the counter more and more and more until he was nearly hidden from us until he was altogether hidden and still his voice went on and on we none of us know what the fair semblance of a human being may conceal sir are we all then no better than brushed exteriors whited sepulchres  his voice stoppedexactly like when you hit a neighbours gramophone with a wellaimed brick the same instant silenceand the rustle of the paper stopped and everything was still  have you done with my hat i said after an interval  there was no answer  i stared at gip and gip stared at me and there were our distortions in the magic mirrors looking very rum and grave and quiet  i think well go now i said will you tell me how much all this comes to  i say i said on a rather louder note i want the bill and my hat please  it might have been a sniff from behind the paper pile  lets look behind the counter gip i said hes making fun of us  i led gip round the headwagging tiger and what do you think there was behind the counter no one at all only my hat on the floor and a common conjurers lopeared white rabbit lost in meditation and looking as stupid and crumpled as only a conjurers rabbit can do i resumed my hat and the rabbit lolloped a lollop or so out of my way  dadda said gip in a guilty whisper  what is it gip said i  i do like this shop dadda  so should i i said to myself if the counter wouldnt suddenly extend itself to shut one off from the door but i didnt call gips attention to that pussy he said with a hand out to the rabbit as it came lolloping past us pussy do gip a magic and his eyes followed it as it squeezed through a door i had certainly not remarked a moment before then this door opened wider and the man with one ear larger than the other appeared again he was smiling still but his eye met mine with something between amusement and defiance youd like to see our showroom sir he said with an innocent suavity gip tugged my finger forward i glanced at the counter and met the shopmans eye again i was beginning to think the magic just a little too genuine we havent very much time i said but somehow we were inside the showroom before i could finish that  all goods of the same quality said the shopman rubbing his flexible hands together and that is the best nothing in the place that isnt genuine magic and warranted thoroughly rum excuse me sir  i felt him pull at something that clung to my coatsleeve and then i saw he held a little wriggling red demon by the tailthe little creature bit and fought and tried to get at his handand in a moment he tossed it carelessly behind a counter no doubt the thing was only an image of twisted indiarubber but for the moment and his gesture was exactly that of a man who handles some petty biting bit of vermin i glanced at gip but gip was looking at a magic rockinghorse i was glad he hadnt seen the thing i say i said in an undertone and indicating gip and the red demon with my eyes you havent many things like that about have you  none of ours probably brought it with you said the shopmanalso in an undertone and with a more dazzling smile than ever astonishing what people will carry about with them unawares and then to gip do you see anything you fancy here  there were many things that gip fancied there  he turned to this astonishing tradesman with mingled confidence and respect is that a magic sword he said  a magic toy sword it neither bends breaks nor cuts the fingers it renders the bearer invincible in battle against any one under eighteen half a crown to seven and sixpence according to size these panoplies on cards are for juvenile knightserrant and very usefulshield of safety sandals of swiftness helmet of invisibility  oh dadda gasped gip  i tried to find out what they cost but the shopman did not heed me he had got gip now he had got him away from my finger he had embarked upon the exposition of all his confounded stock and nothing was going to stop him presently i saw with a qualm of distrust and something very like jealousy that gip had hold of this persons finger as usually he has hold of mine no doubt the fellow was interesting i thought and had an interestingly faked lot of stuff really good faked stuff still  i wandered after them saying very little but keeping an eye on this prestidigital fellow after all gip was enjoying it and no doubt when the time came to go we should be able to go quite easily  it was a long rambling place that showroom a gallery broken up by stands and stalls and pillars with archways leading off to other departments in which the queerestlooking assistants loafed and stared at one and with perplexing mirrors and curtains so perplexing indeed were these that i was presently unable to make out the door by which we had come  the shopman showed gip magic trains that ran without steam or clockwork just as you set the signals and then some very very valuable boxes of soldiers that all came alive directly you took off the lid and saidi myself havent a very quick ear and it was a tonguetwisting sound but giphe has his mothers eargot it in no time bravo said the shopman putting the men back into the box unceremoniously and handing it to gip now said the shopman and in a moment gip had made them all alive again  youll take that box asked the shopman  well take that box said i unless you charge its full value in which case it would need a trust magnate  dear heart no and the shopman swept the little men back again shut the lid waved the box in the air and there it was in brown paper tied up andwith gips full name and address on the paper  the shopman laughed at my amazement  this is the genuine magic he said the real thing  its a little too genuine for my taste i said again  after that he fell to showing gip tricks odd tricks and still odder the way they were done he explained them he turned them inside out and there was the dear little chap nodding his busy bit of a head in the sagest manner  i did not attend as well as i might hey presto said the magic shopman and then would come the clear small hey presto of the boy but i was distracted by other things it was being borne in upon me just how tremendously rum this place was it was so to speak inundated by a sense of rumness there was something a little rum about the fixtures even about the ceiling about the floor about the casually distributed chairs i had a queer feeling that whenever i wasnt looking at them straight they went askew and moved about and played a noiseless pussinthecorner behind my back and the cornice had a serpentine design with masksmasks altogether too expressive for proper plaster  then abruptly my attention was caught by one of the oddlooking assistants he was some way off and evidently unaware of my presencei saw a sort of threequarter length of him over a pile of toys and through an archand you know he was leaning against a pillar in an idle sort of way doing the most horrid things with his features the particular horrid thing he did was with his nose he did it just as though he was idle and wanted to amuse himself first of all it was a short blobby nose and then suddenly he shot it out like a telescope and then out it flew and became thinner and thinner until it was like a long red flexible whip like a thing in a nightmare it was he flourished it about and flung it forth as a flyfisher flings his line  my instant thought was that gip mustnt see him i turned about and there was gip quite preoccupied with the shopman and thinking no evil they were whispering together and looking at me gip was standing on a little stool and the shopman was holding a sort of big drum in his hand  hide and seek dadda cried gip youre he  and before i could do anything to prevent it the shopman had clapped the big drum over him  i saw what was up directly take that off i cried this instant youll frighten the boy take it off  the shopman with the unequal ears did so without a word and held the big cylinder towards me to show its emptiness and the little stool was vacant in that instant my boy had utterly disappeared  you know perhaps that sinister something that conies like a hand out of the unseen and grips your heart about you know it takes your common self away and leaves you tense and deliberate neither slow nor hasty neither angry nor afraid so it was with me  i came up to this grinning shopman and kicked his stool aside  stop this folly i said where is my boy  you see he said still displaying the drums interior there is no deception  i put out my hand to grip him and he eluded me by a dexterous movement i snatched again and he turned from me and pushed open a door to escape stop i said and he laughed receding i leapt after himinto utter darkness  thud  lor bless my eart i didnt see you coming sir  i was in regent street and i had collided with a decentlooking working man and a yard away perhaps and looking a little perplexed with himself was gip there was some sort of apology and then gip had turned and come to me with a bright little smile as though for a moment he had missed me  and he was carrying four parcels in his arm  he secured immediate possession of my finger  for the second i was rather at a loss i stared round to see the door of the magic shop and behold it was not there there was no door no shop nothing only the common pilaster between the shop where they sell pictures and the window with the chicks   i did the only thing possible in that mental tumult i walked straight to the kerbstone and held up my umbrella for a cab  ansoms said gip in a note of culminating exultation  i helped him in recalled my address with an effort and got in also something unusual proclaimed itself in my tailcoat pocket and i felt and discovered a glass ball with a petulant expression i flung it into the street  gip said nothing  for a space neither of us spoke  dadda said gip at last that was a proper shop  i came round with that to the problem of just how the whole thing had seemed to him he looked completely undamagedso far good he was neither scared nor unhinged he was simply tremendously satisfied with the afternoons entertainment and there in his arms were the four parcels  confound it what could be in them  um i said little boys cant go to shops like that every day  he received this with his usual stoicism and for a moment i was sorry i was his father and not his mother and so couldnt suddenly there coram publico in our hansom kiss him after all i thought the thing wasnt so very bad  but it was only when we opened the parcels that i really began to be reassured three of them contained boxes of soldiers quite ordinary lead soldiers but of so good a quality as to make gip altogether forget that originally these parcels had been magic tricks of the only genuine sort and the fourth contained a kitten a little living white kitten in excellent health and appetite and temper  i saw this unpacking with a sort of provisional relief i hung about in the nursery for quite an unconscionable time  that happened six months ago and now i am beginning to believe it is all right the kitten had only the magic natural to all kittens and the soldiers seemed as steady a company as any colonel could desire and gip  the intelligent parent will understand that i have to go cautiously with gip  but i went so far as this one day i said how would you like your soldiers to come alive gip and march about by themselves  mine do said gip i just have to say a word i know before i open the lid  then they march about alone  oh quite dadda i shouldnt like them if they didnt do that  i displayed no unbecoming surprise and since then i have taken occasion to drop in upon him once or twice unannounced when the soldiers were about but so far i have never discovered them performing in anything like a magical manner  its so difficult to tell  theres also a question of finance i have an incurable habit of paying bills i have been up and down regent street several times looking for that shop i am inclined to think indeed that in that matter honour is satisfied and that since gips name and address are known to them i may very well leave it to these people whoever they may be to send in their bill in their own time       xxx    the empire of the ants   when captain gerilleau received instructions to take his new gunboat the benjamin constant to badama on the batemo arm of the guaramadema and there assist the inhabitants against a plague of ants he suspected the authorities of mockery his promotion had been romantic and irregular the affections of a prominent brazilian lady and the captains liquid eyes had played a part in the process and the diario and o futuro had been lamentably disrespectful in their comments he felt he was to give further occasion for disrespect  he was a creole his conceptions of etiquette and discipline were pureblooded portuguese and it was only to holroyd the lancashire engineer who had come over with the boat and as an exercise in the use of englishhis th sounds were very uncertainthat he opened his heart  it is in effect he said to make me absurd what can a man do against ants dey come dey go  they say said holroyd that these dont go that chap you said was a sambo  zamboit is a sort of mixture of blood  sambo he said the people are going  the captain smoked fretfully for a time dese tings ave to happen he said at last what is it plagues of ants and suchlike as god wills dere was a plague in trinidadthe little ants that carry leaves orl der orangetrees all der mangoes what does it matter sometimes ant armies come into your housesfighting ants a different sort you go and they clean the house then you come back againthe house is clean like new no cockroaches no fleas no jiggers in the floor  that sambo chap said holroyd says these are a different sort of ant  the captain shrugged his shoulders fumed and gave his attention to a cigarette  afterwards he reopened the subject my dear olroyd what am i to do about dese infernal ants  the captain reflected it is ridiculous he said but in the afternoon he put on his full uniform and went ashore and jars and boxes came back to the ship and subsequently he did and holroyd sat on deck in the evening coolness and smoked profoundly and marvelled at brazil they were six days up the amazon some hundreds of miles from the ocean and east and west of him there was a horizon like the sea and to the south nothing but a sandbank island with some tufts of scrub the water was always running like a sluice thick with dirt animated with crocodiles and hovering birds and fed by some inexhaustible source of tree trunks and the waste of it the headlong waste of it filled his soul the town of alemquer with its meagre church its thatched sheds for houses its discoloured ruins of ampler days seemed a little thing lost in this wilderness of nature a sixpence dropped on sahara he was a young man this was his first sight of the tropics he came straight from england where nature is hedged ditched and drained into the perfection of submission and he had suddenly discovered the insignificance of man for six days they had been steaming up from the sea by unfrequented channels and man had been as rare as a rare butterfly one saw one day a canoe another day a distant station the next no men at all he began to perceive that man is indeed a rare animal having but a precarious hold upon this land  he perceived it more clearly as the days passed and he made his devious way to the batemo in the company of this remarkable commander who ruled over one big gun and was forbidden to waste his ammunition holroyd was learning spanish industriously but he was still in the present tense and substantive stage of speech and the only other person who had any words of english was a negro stoker who had them all wrong the second in command was a portuguese da cunha who spoke french but it was a different sort of french from the french holroyd had learnt in southport and their intercourse was confined to politenesses and simple propositions about the weather and the weather like everything else in this amazing new world the weather had no human aspect and was hot by night and hot by day and the air steam even the wind was hot steam smelling of vegetation in decay and the alligators and the strange birds the flies of many sorts and sizes the beetles the ants the snakes and monkeys seemed to wonder what man was doing in an atmosphere that had no gladness in its sunshine and no coolness in its night to wear clothing was intolerable but to cast it aside was to scorch by day and expose an ampler area to the mosquitoes by night to go on deck by day was to be blinded by glare and to stay below was to suffocate and in the daytime came certain flies extremely clever and noxious about ones wrist and ankle captain gerilleau who was holroyds sole distraction from these physical distresses developed into a formidable bore telling the simple story of his hearts affections day by day a string of anonymous women as if he was telling beads sometimes he suggested sport and they shot at alligators and at rare intervals they came to human aggregations in the waste of trees and stayed for a day or so and drank and sat about and one night danced with creole girls who found holroyds poor elements of spanish without either past tense or future amply sufficient for their purposes but these were mere luminous chinks in the long grey passage of the streaming river up which the throbbing engines beat a certain liberal heathen deity in the shape of a demijohn held seductive court aft and it is probable forward  but gerilleau learnt things about the ants more things and more at this stoppingplace and that and became interested in his mission  dey are a new sort of ant he said we have got to bewhat do you call itentomologie big five centimetres some bigger it is ridiculous we are like the monkeyssent to pick insects but dey are eating up the country  he burst out indignantly supposesuddenly there are complications with europe here am isoon we shall be above the rio negroand my gun useless  he nursed his knee and mused  dose people who were dere at de dancing place dey ave come down dey ave lost all they got de ants come to deir house one afternoon everyone run out you know when de ants come one musteveryone runs out and they go over the house if you stayed theyd eat you see well presently dey go back dey say the ants ave gone  de ants avent gone dey try to go inde son e goes in de ants fight  swarm over him  bite im presently he comes out againscreaming and running he runs past them to the river see he gets into de water and drowns de ants yes gerilleau paused brought his liquid eyes close to holroyds face tapped holroyds knee with his knuckle that night he dies just as if he was stung by a snake  poisonedby the ants  who knows gerilleau shrugged his shoulders perhaps they bit him badly when i joined dis service i joined to fight men dese things dese ants dey come and go it is no business for men  after that he talked frequently of the ants to holroyd and whenever they chanced to drift against any speck of humanity in that waste of water and sunshine and distant trees holroyds improving knowledge of the language enabled him to recognise the ascendant word saüba more and more completely dominating the whole  he perceived the ants were becoming interesting and the nearer he drew to them the more interesting they became gerilleau abandoned his old themes almost suddenly and the portuguese lieutenant became a conversational figure he knew something about the leafcutting ant and expanded his knowledge gerilleau sometimes rendered what he had to tell to holroyd he told of the little workers that swarm and fight and the big workers that command and rule and how these latter always crawled to the neck and how their bites drew blood he told how they cut leaves and made fungus beds and how their nests in caracas are sometimes a hundred yards across two days the three men spent disputing whether ants have eyes the discussion grew dangerously heated on the second afternoon and holroyd saved the situation by going ashore in a boat to catch ants and see he captured various specimens and returned and some had eyes and some hadnt also they argued do ants bite or sting  dese ants said gerilleau after collecting information at a rancho have big eyes they dont run about blindnot as most ants do no dey get in corners and watch what you do  and they sting asked holroyd  yes dey sting dere is poison in the sting he meditated i do not see what men can do against ants dey come and go  but these dont go  they will said gerilleau  past tamandu there is a long low coast of eighty miles without any population and then one comes to the confluence of the main river and the batemo arm like a great lake and then the forest came nearer came at last intimately near the character of the channel changes snags abound and the benjamin constant moored by a cable that night under the very shadow of dark trees for the first time for many days came a spell of coolness and holroyd and gerilleau sat late smoking cigars and enjoying this delicious sensation gerilleaus mind was full of ants and what they could do he decided to sleep at last and lay down on a mattress on deck a man hopelessly perplexed his last words when he already seemed asleep were to ask with a flourish of despair what can one do with ants de whole thing is absurd  holroyd was left to scratch his bitten wrists and meditate alone  he sat on the bulwark and listened to the little changes in gerilleaus breathing until he was fast asleep and then the ripple and lap of the stream took his mind and brought back that sense of immensity that had been growing upon him since first he had left para and come up the river the monitor showed but one small light and there was first a little talking forward and then stillness his eyes went from the dim black outlines of the middle works of the gunboat towards the bank to the black overwhelming mysteries of forest lit now and then by a firefly and never still from the murmur of alien and mysterious activities  it was the inhuman immensity of this land that astonished and oppressed him he knew the skies were empty of men the stars were specks in an incredible vastness of space he knew the ocean was enormous and untamable but in england he had come to think of the land as mans in england it is indeed mans the wild things live by sufferance grow on lease everywhere the roads the fences and absolute security runs in an atlas too the land is mans and all coloured to show his claim to it in vivid contrast to the universal independent blueness of the sea he had taken it for granted that a day would come when everywhere about the earth plough and culture light tramways and good roads an ordered security would prevail but now he doubted  this forest was interminable it had an air of being invincible and man seemed at best an infrequent precarious intruder one travelled for miles amidst the still silent struggle of giant trees of strangulating creepers of assertive flowers everywhere the alligator the turtle and endless varieties of birds and insects seemed at home dwelt irreplaceablybut man man at most held a footing upon resentful clearings fought weeds fought beasts and insects for the barest foothold fell a prey to snake and beast insect and fever and was presently carried away in many places down the river he had been manifestly driven back this deserted creek or that preserved the name of a casa and here and there ruinous white walls and a shattered tower enforced the lesson the puma the jaguar were more the masters here  who were the real masters  in a few miles of this forest there must be more ants than there are men in the whole world this seemed to holroyd a perfectly new idea in a few thousand years men had emerged from barbarism to a stage of civilisation that made them feel lords of the future and masters of the earth but what was to prevent the ants evolving also such ants as one knew lived in little communities of a few thousand individuals made no concerted efforts against the greater world but they had a language they had an intelligence why should things stop at that any more than men had stopped at the barbaric stage suppose presently the ants began to store knowledge just as men had done by means of books and records use weapons form great empires sustain a planned and organised war  things came back to him that gerilleau had gathered about these ants they were approaching they used a poison like the poison of snakes they obeyed greater leaders even as the leafcutting ants do they were carnivorous and where they came they stayed  the forest was very still the water lapped incessantly against the side about the lantern overhead there eddied a noiseless whirl of phantom moths  gerilleau stirred in the darkness and sighed what can one do he murmured and turned over and was still again  holroyd was roused from meditations that were becoming sinister by the hum of a mosquito   ii  the next morning holroyd learnt they were within forty kilometres of badama and his interest in the banks intensified he came up whenever an opportunity offered to examine his surroundings he could see no signs of human occupation whatever save for a weedy ruin of a house and the greenstained facade of the longdeserted monastery at mojû with a forest tree growing out of a vacant window space and great creepers netted across its vacant portals several flights of strange yellow butterflies with semitransparent wings crossed the river that morning and many alighted on the monitor and were killed by the men it was towards afternoon that they came upon the derelict cuberta  she did not at first appear to be derelict both her sails were set and hanging slack in the afternoon calm and there was the figure of a man sitting on the fore planking beside the shipped sweeps another man appeared to be sleeping face downwards on the sort of longitudinal bridge these big canoes have in the waist but it was presently apparent from the sway of her rudder and the way she drifted into the course of the gunboat that something was out of order with her gerilleau surveyed her through a fieldglass and became interested in the queer darkness of the face of the sitting man a redfaced man he seemed without a nose crouching he was rather than sitting and the longer the captain looked the less he liked to look at him and the less able he was to take his glasses away  but he did so at last and went a little way to call up holroyd then he went back to hail the cuberta he ailed her again and so she drove past him santa rosa  stood out clearly as her name  as she came by and into the wake of the monitor she pitched a little and suddenly the figure of the crouching an collapsed as though all its joints had given way his hat fell off his head was not nice to look at and his body flopped lax and rolled out of sight behind the bulwarks  caramba cried gerilleau and resorted to holroyd forthwith  holroyd was halfway up the companion did you see dat said the captain  dead said holroyd yes youd better send a boat aboard theres something wrong  did youby any chancesee his face  what was it like  it wasughi have no words and the captain suddenly turned his back on holroyd and became an active and strident commander  the gunboat came about steamed parallel to the erratic course of the canoe and dropped the boat with lieutenant da cunha and three sailors to board her then the curiosity of the captain made him draw up almost alongside as the lieutenant got aboard so that the whole of the santa rosa deck and hold was visible to holroyd  he saw now clearly that the sole crew of the vessel was these two dead men and though he could not see their faces he saw by their outstretched hands which were all of ragged flesh that they had been subjected to some strange exceptional process of decay for a moment his attention concentrated on those two enigmatical bundles of dirty clothes and laxly flung limbs and then his eyes went forward to discover the open hold piled high with trunks and cases and aft to where the little cabin gaped inexplicably empty then he became aware that the planks of the middle decking were dotted with moving black specks  his attention was riveted by these specks they were all walking in directions radiating from the fallen man in a mannerthe image came unsought to his mindlike the crowd dispersing from a bullfight  he became aware of gerilleau beside him capo he said have you your glasses can you focus as closely as those planks there  gerilleau made an effort grunted and handed him the glasses  there followed a moment of scrutiny its ants said the englishman and handed the focused fieldglass back to gerilleau  his impression of them was of a crowd of large black ants very like ordinary ants except for their size and for the fact that some of the larger of them bore a sort of clothing of grey but at the time his inspection was too brief for particulars the head of lieutenant da cunha appeared over the side of the cuberta and a brief colloquy ensued  you must go aboard said gerilleau  the lieutenant objected that the boat was full of ants  you have your boots said gerilleau  the lieutenant changed the subject how did these en die he asked  captain gerilleau embarked upon speculations that holroyd could not follow and the two men disputed with a certain increasing vehemence holroyd took up the fieldglass and resumed his scrutiny first of the ants and then of the dead man amidships  he has described these ants to me very particularly  he says they were as large as any ants he has ever seen black and moving with a steady deliberation very different from the mechanical fussiness of the common ant about one in twenty was much larger than its fellows and with an exceptionally large head these reminded him at once of the master workers who are said to rule over the leafcutter ants like them they seemed to be directing and coordinating the general movements they tilted their bodies back in a manner altogether singular as if they made some use of the fore feet and he had a curious fancy that he was too far off to verify that most of these ants of both kinds were wearing accoutrements had things strapped about their bodies by bright white bands like white metal threads  he put down the glasses abruptly realising that the question of discipline between the captain and his subordinate had become acute  it is your duty said the captain to go aboard it is my instructions  the lieutenant seemed on the verge of refusing the head of one of the mulatto sailors appeared beside him  i believe these men were killed by the ants said holroyd abruptly in english  the captain burst into a rage he made no answer to holroyd i have commanded you to go aboard he screamed to his subordinate in portuguese if you do not go aboard forthwith it is mutinyrank mutiny mutiny and cowardice where is the courage that should animate us i will have you in irons i will have you shot like a dog he began a torrent of abuse and curses he danced to and fro he shook his fists he behaved as if beside himself with rage and the lieutenant white and still stood looking at him the crew appeared forward with amazed faces  suddenly in a pause of this outbreak the lieutenant came to some heroic decision saluted drew himself together and clambered upon the deck of the cuberta  ah said gerilleau and his mouth shut like a trap holroyd saw the ants retreating before da cunhas boots the portuguese walked slowly to the fallen man stooped down hesitated clutched his coat and turned him over a black swarm of ants rushed out of the clothes and da cunha stepped back very quickly and trod two or three times on the deck  holroyd put up the glasses he saw the scattered ants about the invaders feet and doing what he had never seen ants doing before they had nothing of the blind movements of the common ant they were looking at himas a rallying crowd of men might look at some gigantic monster that had dispersed it  how did he die the captain shouted  holroyd understood the portuguese to say the body was too much eaten to tell  what is there forward asked gerilleau  the lieutenant walked a few paces and began his answer in portuguese he stopped abruptly and beat off something from his leg he made some peculiar steps as if he was trying to stamp on something invisible and went quickly towards the side then he controlled himself turned about walked deliberately forward to the hold clambered up to the fore decking from which the sweeps are worked stooped for a time over the second man groaned audibly and made his way back and aft to the cabin moving very rigidly he turned and began a conversation with his captain cold and respectful in tone on either side contrasting vividly with the wrath and insult of a few moments before holroyd gathered only fragments of its purport  he reverted to the fieldglass and was surprised to find the ants had vanished from all the exposed surfaces of the deck he turned towards the shadows beneath the decking and it seemed to him they were full of watching eyes  the cuberta it was agreed was derelict but too full of ants to put men aboard to sit and sleep it must be towed the lieutenant went forward to take in and adjust the cable and the men in the boat stood up to be ready to help him holroyds glasses searched the canoe  he became more and more impressed by the fact that a great if minute and furtive activity was going on he perceived that a number of gigantic antsthey seemed nearly a couple of inches in lengthcarrying oddlyshaped burthens for which he could imagine no usewere moving in rushes from one point of obscurity to another they did not move in columns across the exposed places but in open spacedout lines oddly suggestive of the rushes of modern infantry advancing under fire a number were taking cover under the dead mans clothes and a perfect swarm was gathering along the side over which da cunha must presently go  he did not see them actually rush for the lieutenant as he returned but he has no doubt they did make a concerted rush suddenly the lieutenant was shouting and cursing and beating at his legs im stung he shouted with a face of hate and accusation towards gerilleau  then he vanished over the side dropped into his boat and plunged at once into the water holroyd heard the splash  the three men in the boat pulled him out and brought him aboard and that night he died  iii  holroyd and the captain came out of the cabin in which the swollen and contorted body of the lieutenant lay and stood together at the stern of the monitor staring at the sinister vessel they trailed behind them it was a close dark night that had only phantom flickerings of sheet lightning to illuminate it the cuberta a vague black triangle rocked about in the steamers wake her sails bobbing and flapping and the black smoke from the funnels sparklit ever and again streamed over her swaying masts  gerilleaus mind was inclined to run on the unkind things the lieutenant had said in the heat of his last fever  he says i murdered im he protested it is simply absurd someone ad to go aboard are we to run away from these confounded ants whenever they show up  holroyd said nothing he was thinking of a disciplined rush of little black shapes across bare sunlit planking  it was his place to go harped gerilleau he died in the execution of his duty what has he to complain of murdered but the poor fellow waswhat is itdemented he was not in his right mind the poison swelled him um  they came to a long silence  we will sink that canoeburn it  and then  the inquiry irritated gerilleau his shoulders went up his hands flew out at right angles from his body what is one to do he said his voice going up to an angry squeak  anyhow he broke out vindictively every ant in dat cubertai will burn dem alive  holroyd was not moved to conversation a distant ululation of howling monkeys filled the sultry night with foreboding sounds and as the gunboat drew near the black mysterious banks this was reinforced by a depressing clamour of frogs  what is one to do the captain repeated after a vast interval and suddenly becoming active and savage and blasphemous decided to burn the santa rosa without further delay everyone aboard was pleased by that idea everyone helped with zest they pulled in the cable cut it and dropped the boat and fired her with tow and kerosene and soon the cuberta was crackling and flaring merrily amidst the immensities of the tropical night holroyd watched the mounting yellow flare against the blackness and the livid flashes of sheet lightning that came and went above the forest summits throwing them into momentary silhouette and his stoker stood behind him watching also  the stoker was stirred to the depths of his linguistics saüba go pop pop he said wahaw and laughed richly  but holroyd was thinking that these little creatures on the decked canoe had also eyes and brains  the whole thing impressed him as incredibly foolish and wrong butwhat was one to do this question came back enormously reinforced on the morrow when at last the gunboat reached badama  this place with its leafthatchcovered houses and sheds its creeperinvaded sugarmill its little jetty of timber and canes was very still in the morning heat and showed never a sign of living men whatever ants there were at that distance were too small to see  all the people have gone said gerilleau but we will do one thing anyhow we will oot and vissel  so holroyd hooted and whistled  then the captain fell into a doubting fit of the worst kind dere is one thing we can do he said presently whats that said holroyd  oot and vissel again  so they did  the captain walked his deck and gesticulated to himself he seemed to have many things on his mind fragments of speeches came from his lips he appeared to be addressing some imaginary public tribunal either in spanish or portuguese holroyds improving ear detected something about ammunition he came out of these preoccupations suddenly into english my dear olroyd he cried and broke off with but what can one do  they took the boat and the fieldglasses and went close in to examine the place they made out a number of big ants whose still postures had a certain effect of watching them dotted about the edge of the rude embarkation jetty gerilleau tried ineffectual pistol shots at these holroyd thinks he distinguished curious earthworks running between the nearer houses that may have been the work of the insect conquerors of those human habitations the explorers pulled past the jetty and became aware of a human skeleton wearing a loin cloth and very bright and clean and shining lying beyond they came to a pause regarding this  i ave all dose lives to consider said gerilleau suddenly  holroyd turned and stared at the captain realising slowly that he referred to the unappetising mixture of races that constituted his crew  to send a landing partyit is impossibleimpossible they will be poisoned they will swell they will swell up and abuse me and die it is totally impossible if we land i must land alone alone in thick boots and with my life in my hand perhaps i should live or againi might not land i do not know i do not know  holroyd thought he did but he said nothing  de whole thing said gerilleau suddenly as been got up to make me ridiculous de whole thing  they paddled about and regarded the clean white skeleton from various points of view and then they returned to the gunboat then gerilleaus indecisions became terrible steam was got up and in the afternoon the monitor went on up the river with an air of going to ask somebody something and by sunset came back again and anchored a thunderstorm gathered and broke furiously and then the night became beautifully cool and quiet and everyone slept on deck except gerilleau who tossed about and muttered in the dawn he awakened holroyd  lord said holroyd what now  i have decided said the captain  whatto land said holroyd sitting up brightly  no said the captain and was for a time very reserved i have decided he repeated and holroyd manifested symptoms of impatience  wellyes said the captain i shall fire de big gun  and he did heaven knows what the ants thought of it but he did he fired it twice with great sternness and ceremony all the crew had wadding in their ears and there was an effect of going into action about the whole affair and first they hit and wrecked the old sugarmill and then they smashed the abandoned store behind the jetty and then gerilleau experienced the inevitable reaction  it is no good he said to holroyd no good at all no sort of bally good we must go backfor instructions dere will be de devil of a row about dis ammunitionoh de devil of a row you dont know olroyd  he stood regarding the world in infinite perplexity for a space  but what else was there to do he cried  in the afternoon the monitor started down stream again and in the evening a landing party took the body of the lieutenant and buried it on the bank upon which the new ants have so far not appeared  iv  i heard this story in a fragmentary state from holroyd not three weeks ago  these new ants have got into his brain and he has come back to england with the idea as he says of exciting people about them before it is too late he says they threaten british guiana which cannot be much over a trifle of a thousand miles from their present sphere of activity and that the colonial office ought to get to work upon them at once he declaims with great passion these are intelligent ants just think what that means  there can be no doubt they are a serious pest and that the brazilian government is well advised in offering a prize of five hundred pounds for some effectual method of extirpation it is certain too that since they first appeared in the hills beyond badama about three years ago they have achieved extraordinary conquests the whole of the south bank of the batemo river for nearly sixty miles they have in their effectual occupation they have driven men out completely occupied plantations and settlements and boarded and captured at least one ship it is even said they have in some inexplicable way bridged the very considerable capuarana arm and pushed many miles towards the amazon itself there can be little doubt that they are far more reasonable and with a far better social organisation than any previously known ant species instead of being in dispersed societies they are organised into what is in effect a single nation but their peculiar and immediate formidableness lies not so much in this as in the intelligent use they make of poison against their larger enemies it would seem this poison of theirs is closely akin to snake poison and it is highly probable they actually manufacture it and that the larger individuals among them carry the needlelike crystals of it in their attacks upon men  of course it is extremely difficult to get any detailed information about these new competitors for the sovereignty of the globe no eyewitnesses of their activity except for such glimpses as holroyds have survived the encounter the most extraordinary legends of their prowess and capacity are in circulation in the region of the upper amazon and grow daily as the steady advance of the invader stimulates mens imaginations through their fears these strange little creatures are credited not only with the use of implements and a knowledge of fire and metals and with organised feats of engineering that stagger our northern mindsunused as we are to such feats as that of the saübas of rio de janeiro who in 1841 drove a tunnel under the parahyba where it is as wide as the thames at london bridgebut with an organised and detailed method of record and communication analogous to our books so far their action has been a steady progressive settlement involving the flight or slaughter of every human being in the new areas they invade they are increasing rapidly in numbers and holroyd at least is firmly convinced that they will finally dispossess man over the whole of tropical south america  and why should they stop at tropical south america  well there they are anyhow by 1911 or thereabouts if they go on as they are going they ought to strike the capuarana extension railway and force themselves upon the attention of the european capitalist  by 1920 they will be halfway down the amazon i fix 1950 or 60 at the latest for the discovery of europe       xxxi    the door in the wall   i  one confidential evening not three months ago lionel wallace told me this story of the door in the wall and at the time i thought that so far as he was concerned it was a true story  he told it me with such a direct simplicity of conviction that i could not do otherwise than believe in him but in the morning in my own flat i woke to a different atmosphere and as i lay in bed and recalled the things he had told me stripped of the glamour of his earnest slow voice denuded of the focussed shaded table light the shadowy atmosphere that wrapped about him and me and the pleasant bright things the dessert and glasses and napery of the dinner we had shared making them for the time a bright little world quite cut off from everyday realities i saw it all as frankly incredible he was mystifying i said and then how well he did it it isnt quite the thing i should have expected him of all people to do well  afterwards as i sat up in bed and sipped my morning tea i found myself trying to account for the flavour of reality that perplexed me in his impossible reminiscences by supposing they did in some way suggest present conveyi hardly know which word to useexperiences it was otherwise impossible to tell  well i dont resort to that explanation now i have got over my intervening doubts i believe now as i believed at the moment of telling that wallace did to the very best of his ability strip the truth of his secret for me but whether he himself saw or only thought he saw whether he himself was the possessor of an inestimable privilege or the victim of a fantastic dream i cannot pretend to guess even the facts of his death which ended my doubts for ever throw no light on that  that much the reader must judge for himself  i forget now what chance comment or criticism of mine moved so reticent a man to confide in me he was i think defending himself against an imputation of slackness and unreliability i had made in relation to a great public movement in which he had disappointed me but he plunged suddenly i have he said a preoccupation  i know he went on after a pause i have been negligent the fact is it isnt a case of ghosts or apparitionsbutits an odd thing to tell of redmondi am haunted i am haunted by somethingthat rather takes the light out of things that fills me with longings  he paused checked by that english shyness that so often overcomes us when we would speak of moving or grave or beautiful things you were at saint aethelstans all through he said and for a moment that seemed to me quite irrelevant welland he paused then very haltingly at first but afterwards more easily he began to tell of the thing that was hidden in his life the haunting memory of a beauty and a happiness that filled his heart with insatiable longings that made all the interests and spectacle of worldly life seem dull and tedious and vain to him  now that i have the clue to it the thing seems written visibly in his face i have a photograph in which that look of detachment has been caught and intensified it reminds me of what a woman once said of hima woman who had loved him greatly suddenly she said the interest goes out of him he forgets you he doesnt care a rap for youunder his very nose  yet the interest was not always out of him and when he was holding his attention to a thing wallace could contrive to be an extremely successful man his career indeed is set with successes he left me behind him long ago he soared up over my head and cut a figure in the world that i couldnt cutanyhow he was still a year short of forty and they say now that he would have been in office and very probably in the new cabinet if he had lived at school he always beat me without effortas it were by nature we were at school together at saint aethelstans college in west kensington for almost all our schooltime he came into the school as my coequal but he left far above me in a blaze of scholarships and brilliant performance yet i think i made a fair average running and it was at school i heard first of the door in the wallthat i was to hear of a second time only a month before his death  to him at least the door in the wall was a real door leading through a real wall to immortal realities of that i am now quite assured  and it came into his life quite early when he was a little fellow between five and six i remember how as he sat making his confession to me with a slow gravity he reasoned and reckoned the date of it there was he said a crimson virginia creeper in itall one bright uniform crimson in a clear amber sunshine against a white wall that came into the impression somehow though i dont clearly remember how and there were horsechestnut leaves upon the clean pavement outside the green door they were blotched yellow and green you know not brown nor dirty so that they must have been new fallen i take it that means october i look out for horsechestnut leaves every year and i ought to know  if im right in that i was about five years and four months old  he was he said rather a precocious little boyhe learnt to talk at an abnormally early age and he was so sane and oldfashioned as people say that he was permitted an amount of initiative that most children scarcely attain by seven or eight his mother died when he was two and he was under the less vigilant and authoritative care of a nursery governess his father was a stern preoccupied lawyer who gave him little attention and expected great things of him for all his brightness he found life a little grey and dull i think and one day he wandered  he could not recall the particular neglect that enabled him to get away nor the course he took among the west kensington roads all that had faded among the incurable blurs of memory but the white wall and the green door stood out quite distinctly  as his memory of that childish experience ran he did at the very first sight of that door experience a peculiar emotion an attraction a desire to get to the door and open it and walk in and at the same time he had the clearest conviction that either it was unwise or it was wrong of him he could not tell whichto yield to this attraction he insisted upon it as a curious thing that he knew from the very beginningunless memory has played him the queerest trickthat the door was unfastened and that he could go in as he chose  i seem to see the figure of that little boy drawn and repelled and it was very clear in his mind too though why it should be so was never explained that his father would be very angry if he went in through that door  wallace described all these moments of hesitation to me with the utmost particularity he went right past the door and then with his hands in his pockets and making an infantile attempt to whistle strolled right along beyond the end of the wall there he recalls a number of mean dirty shops and particularly that of a plumber and decorator with a dusty disorder of earthenware pipes sheet lead ball taps pattern books of wall paper and tins of enamel he stood pretending to examine these things and coveting passionately desiring the green door  then he said he had a gust of emotion he made a run for it lest hesitation should grip him again he went plump with outstretched hand through the green door and let it slam behind him and so in a trice he came into the garden that has haunted all his life  it was very difficult for wallace to give me his full sense of that garden into which he came  there was something in the very air of it that exhilarated that gave one a sense of lightness and good happening and wellbeing there was something in the sight of it that made all its colour clean and perfect and subtly luminous in the instant of coming into it one was exquisitely gladas only in rare moments and when one is young and joyful one can be glad in this world and everything was beautiful there  wallace mused before he went on telling me you see he said with the doubtful inflection of a man who pauses at incredible things there were two great panthers there yes spotted panthers and i was not afraid there was a long wide path with marbleedged flower borders on either side and these two huge velvety beasts were playing there with a ball one looked up and came towards me a little curious as it seemed it came right up to me rubbed its soft round ear very gently against the small hand i held out and purred it was i tell you an enchanted garden i know and the size oh it stretched far and wide this way and that i believe there were hills far away heaven knows where west kensington had suddenly got to and somehow it was just like coming home  you know in the very moment the door swung to behind me i forgot the road with its fallen chestnut leaves its cabs and tradesmens carts i forgot the sort of gravitational pull back to the discipline and obedience of home i forgot all hesitations and fear forgot discretion forgot all the intimate realities of this life i became in a moment a very glad and wonderhappy little boyin another world it was a world with a different quality a warmer more penetrating and mellower light with a faint clear gladness in its air and wisps of suntouched cloud in the blueness of its sky and before me ran this long wide path invitingly with weedless beds on either side rich with untended flowers and these two great panthers i put my little hands fearlessly on their soft fur and caressed their round ears and the sensitive corners under their ears and played with them and it was as though they welcomed me home there was a keen sense of homecoming in my mind and when presently a tall fair girl appeared in the pathway and came to meet me smiling and said well to me and lifted me and kissed me and put me down and led me by the hand there was no amazement but only an impression of delightful rightness of being reminded of happy things that had in some strange way been overlooked there were broad red steps i remember that came into view between spikes of delphinium and up these we went to a great avenue between very old and shady dark trees all down this avenue you know between the red chapped stems were marble seats of honour and statuary and very tame and friendly white doves  along this cool avenue my girlfriend led me looking downi recall the pleasant lines the finelymodelled chin of her sweet kind faceasking me questions in a soft agreeable voice and telling me things pleasant things i know though what they were i was never able to recall presently a little capuchin monkey very clean with a fur of ruddy brown and kindly hazel eyes came down a tree to us and ran beside me looking up at me and grinning and presently leapt to my shoulder so we two went on our way in great happiness  he paused  go on i said  i remember little things we passed an old man musing among laurels i remember and a place gay with paroquets and came through a broad shaded colonnade to a spacious cool palace full of pleasant fountains full of beautiful things full of the quality and promise of hearts desire and there were many things and many people some that still seem to stand out clearly and some that are a little vague but all these people were beautiful and kind in some wayi dont know howit was conveyed to me that they all were kind to me glad to have me there and filling me with gladness by their gestures by the touch of their hands by the welcome and love in their eyes yes  he mused for a while playmates i found there that was very much to me because i was a lonely little boy they played delightful games in a grasscovered court where there was a sundial set about with flowers and as one played one loved  butits oddtheres a gap in my memory i dont remember the games we played i never remembered afterwards as a child i spent long hours trying even with tears to recall the form of that happiness i wanted to play it all over againin my nurseryby myself no all i remember is the happiness and two dear playfellows who were most with me then presently came a sombre dark woman with a grave pale face and dreamy eyes a sombre woman wearing a soft long robe of pale purple who carried a book and beckoned and took me aside with her into a gallery above a hallthough my playmates were loth to have me go and ceased their game and stood watching as i was carried away come back to us they cried come back to us soon i looked up at her face but she heeded them not at all her face was very gentle and grave she took me to a seat in the gallery and i stood beside her ready to look at her book as she opened it upon her knee the pages fell open she pointed and i looked marvelling for in the living pages of that book i saw myself it was a story about myself and in it were all the things that had happened to me since ever i was born  it was wonderful to me because the pages of that book were not pictures you understand but realities  wallace paused gravelylooked at me doubtfully  go on i said i understand  they were realitiesyes they must have been people moved and things came and went in them my dear mother whom i had near forgotten then my father stern and upright the servants the nursery all the familiar things of home then the front door and the busy streets with traffic to and fro i looked and marvelled and looked half doubtfully again into the womans face and turned the pages over skipping this and that to see more of this book and more and so at last i came to myself hovering and hesitating outside the green door in the long white wall and felt again the conflict and the fear  and next i cried and would have turned on but the cool hand of the grave woman delayed me  next i insisted and struggled gently with her hand pulling up her fingers with all my childish strength and as she yielded and the page came over she bent down upon me like a shadow and kissed my brow  but the page did not show the enchanted garden nor the panthers nor the girl who had led me by the hand nor the playfellows who had been so loth to let me go it showed a long grey street in west kensington in that chill hour of afternoon before the lamps are lit and i was there a wretched little figure weeping aloud for all that i could do to restrain myself and i was weeping because i could not return to my dear playfellows who had called after me come back to us come back to us soon i was there this was no page in a book but harsh reality that enchanted place and the restraining hand of the grave mother at whose knee i stood had gonewhither had they gone  he halted again and remained for a time staring into the fire  oh the woefulness of that return he murmured  well i said after a minute or so  poor little wretch i wasbrought back to this grey world again as i realised the fulness of what had happened to me i gave way to quite ungovernable grief and the shame and humiliation of that public weeping and my disgraceful homecoming remain with me still i see again the benevolentlooking old gentleman in gold spectacles who stopped and spoke to meprodding me first with his umbrella poor little chap said he and are you lost thenand me a london boy of five and more and he must needs bring in a kindly young policeman and make a crowd of me and so march me home sobbing conspicuous and frightened i came back from the enchanted garden to the steps of my fathers house  that is as well as i can remember my vision of that gardenthe garden that haunts me still of course i can convey nothing of that indescribable quality of translucent unreality that difference from the common things of experience that hung about it all but that that is what happened if it was a dream i am sure it was a daytime and altogether extraordinary dream hmnaturally there followed a terrible questioning by my aunt my father the nurse the governess everyone  i tried to tell them and my father gave me my first thrashing for telling lies when afterwards i tried to tell my aunt she punished me again for my wicked persistence then as i said everyone was forbidden to listen to me to hear a word about it even my fairytale books were taken away from me for a timebecause i was too imaginative eh yes they did that my father belonged to the old school and my story was driven back upon myself i whispered it to my pillowmy pillow that was often damp and salt to my whispering lips with childish tears and i added always to my official and less fervent prayers this one heartfelt request please god i may dream of the garden oh take me back to my garden take me back to my garden i dreamt often of the garden i may have added to it i may have changed it i do not know all this you understand is an attempt to reconstruct from fragmentary memories a very early experience between that and the other consecutive memories of my boyhood there is a gulf a time came when it seemed impossible i should ever speak of that wonder glimpse again  i asked an obvious question  no he said i dont remember that i ever attempted to find my way back to the garden in those early years this seems odd to me now but i think that very probably a closer watch was kept on my movements after this misadventure to prevent my going astray no it wasnt till you knew me that i tried for the garden again and i believe there was a period incredible as it seems nowwhen i forgot the garden altogetherwhen i was about eight or nine it may have been do you remember me as a kid at saint aethelstans  rather  i didnt show any signs did i in those days of having a secret dream   ii  he looked up with a sudden smile  did you ever play northwest passage with me no of course you didnt come my way  it was the sort of game he went on that every imaginative child plays all day the idea was the discovery of a northwest passage to school the way to school was plain enough the game consisted in finding some way that wasnt plain starting off ten minutes early in some almost hopeless direction and working my way round through unaccustomed streets to my goal and one day i got entangled among some rather lowclass streets on the other side of campden hill and i began to think that for once the game would be against me and that i should get to school late i tried rather desperately a street that seemed a culdesac and found a passage at the end i hurried through that with renewed hope i shall do it yet i said and passed a row of frowsy little shops that were inexplicably familiar to me and behold there was my long white wall and the green door that led to the enchanted garden  the thing whacked upon me suddenly then after all that garden that wonderful garden wasnt a dream  he paused  i suppose my second experience with the green door marks the world of difference there is between the busy life of a schoolboy and the infinite leisure of a child anyhow this second time i didnt for a moment think of going in straight away you see for one thing my mind was full of the idea of getting to school in timeset on not breaking my record for punctuality i must surely have felt some little desire at least to try the dooryes i must have felt that but i seem to remember the attraction of the door mainly as another obstacle to my overmastering determination to get to school i was immensely interested by this discovery i had made of coursei went on with my mind full of itbut i went on it didnt check me i ran past tugging out my watch found i had ten minutes still to spare and then i was going downhill into familiar surroundings i got to school breathless it is true and wet with perspiration but in time i can remember hanging up my coat and hat went right by it and left it behind me odd eh  he looked at me thoughtfully of course i didnt know then that it wouldnt always be there schoolboys have limited imaginations i suppose i thought it was an awfully jolly thing to have it there to know my way back to it but there was the school tugging at me i expect i was a good deal distraught and inattentive that morning recalling what i could of the beautiful strange people i should presently see again oddly enough i had no doubt in my mind that they would be glad to see me yes i must have thought of the garden that morning just as a jolly sort of place to which one might resort in the interludes of a strenuous scholastic career  i didnt go that day at all the next day was a half holiday and that may have weighed with me perhaps too my state of inattention brought down impositions upon me and docked the margin of time necessary for the detour i dont know what i do know is that in the meantime the enchanted garden was so much upon my mind that i could not keep it to myself  i told what was his namea ferretylooking youngster we used to call squiff  young hopkins said i  hopkins it was i did not like telling him i had a feeling that in some way it was against the rules to tell him but i did he was walking part of the way home with me he was talkative and if we had not talked about the enchanted garden we should have talked of something else and it was intolerable to me to think about any other subject so i blabbed  well he told my secret the next day in the play interval i found myself surrounded by half a dozen bigger boys half teasing and wholly curious to hear more of the enchanted garden there was that big fawcettyou remember himand carnaby and morley reynolds you werent there by any chance no i think i should have remembered if you were  a boy is a creature of odd feelings i was i really believe in spite of my secret selfdisgust a little flattered to have the attention of these big fellows i remember particularly a moment of pleasure caused by the praise of crawshawyou remember crawshaw major the son of crawshaw the composerwho said it was the best lie he had ever heard but at the same time there was a really painful undertow of shame at telling what i felt was indeed a sacred secret that beast fawcett made a joke about the girl in green  wallaces voice sank with the keen memory of that shame i pretended not to hear he said well then carnaby suddenly called me a young liar and disputed with me when i said the thing was true i said i knew where to find the green door could lead them all there in ten minutes carnaby became outrageously virtuous and said id have toand bear out my words or suffer did you ever have carnaby twist your arm then perhaps youll understand how it went with me i swore my story was true there was nobody in the school then to save a chap from carnaby though crawshaw put in a word or so carnaby had got his game i grew excited and redeared and a little frightened i behaved altogether like a silly little chap and the outcome of it all was that instead of starting alone for my enchanted garden i led the way presentlycheeks flushed ears hot eyes smarting and my soul one burning misery and shamefor a party of six mocking curious and threatening schoolfellows  we never found the white wall and the green door  you mean  i mean i couldnt find it i would have found it if i could  and afterwards when i could go alone i couldnt find it i never found it i seem now to have been always looking for it through my schoolboy days but i never came upon itnever  did the fellowsmake it disagreeable  beastly carnaby held a council over me for wanton lying i remember how i sneaked home and upstairs to hide the marks of my blubbering but when i cried myself to sleep at last it wasnt for carnaby but for the garden for the beautiful afternoon i had hoped for for the sweet friendly women and the waiting playfellows and the game i had hoped to learn again that beautiful forgotten game  i believed firmly that if i had not told i had bad times after thatcrying at night and woolgathering by day for two terms i slackened and had bad reports do you remember of course you would it was youyour beating me in mathematics that brought me back to the grind again   iii  for a time my friend stared silently into the red heart of the fire then he said i never saw it again until i was seventeen  it leapt upon me for the third timeas i was driving to paddington on my way to oxford and a scholarship i had just one momentary glimpse i was leaning over the apron of my hansom smoking a cigarette and no doubt thinking myself no end of a man of the world and suddenly there was the door the wall the dear sense of unforgettable and still attainable things  we clattered byi too taken by surprise to stop my cab until we were well past and round a corner then i had a queer moment a double and divergent movement of my will i tapped the little door in the roof of the cab and brought my arm down to pull out my watch yes sir said the cabman smartly erwellits nothing i cried my mistake we havent much time go on and he went on  i got my scholarship and the night after i was told of that i sat over my fire in my little upper room my study in my fathers house with his praisehis rare praiseand his sound counsels ringing in my ears and i smoked my favourite pipethe formidable bulldog of adolescenceand thought of that door in the long white wall if i had stopped i thought i should have missed my scholarship i should have missed oxfordmuddled all the fine career before me i begin to see things better i fell musing deeply but i did not doubt then this career of mine was a thing that merited sacrifice  those dear friends and that clear atmosphere seemed very sweet to me very fine but remote my grip was fixing now upon the world i saw another door openingthe door of my career  he stared again into the fire its red light picked out a stubborn strength in his face for just one flickering moment and then it vanished again  well he said and sighed i have served that career i have donemuch work much hard work but i have dreamt of the enchanted garden a thousand dreams and seen its door or at least glimpsed its door four times since then yesfour times for a while this world was so bright and interesting seemed so full of meaning and opportunity that the halfeffaced charm of the garden was by comparison gentle and remote who wants to pat panthers on the way to dinner with pretty women and distinguished men i came down to london from oxford a man of bold promise that i have done something to redeem somethingand yet there have been disappointments  twice i have been in lovei will not dwell on thatbut once as i went to someone who i knew doubted whether i dared to come i took a short cut at a venture through an unfrequented road near earls court and so happened on a white wall and a familiar green door odd said i to myself but i thought this place was on campden hill its the place i never could find somehowlike counting stonehengethe place of that queer daydream of mine and i went by it intent upon my purpose it had no appeal to me that afternoon  i had just a moments impulse to try the door three steps aside were needed at the mostthough i was sure enough in my heart that it would open to meand then i thought that doing so might delay me on the way to that appointment in which i thought my honour was involved afterwards i was sorry for my punctualitymight at least have peeped in i thought and waved a hand to those panthers but i knew enough by this time not to seek again belatedly that which is not found by seeking yes that time made me very sorry  years of hard work after that and never a sight of the door its only recently it has come back to me with it there has come a sense as though some thin tarnish had spread itself over my world i began to think of it as a sorrowful and bitter thing that i should never see that door again perhaps i was suffering a little from overworkperhaps it was what ive heard spoken of as the feeling of forty i dont know but certainly the keen brightness that makes effort easy has gone out of things recently and that just at a timewith all these new political developmentswhen i ought to be working odd isnt it but i do begin to find life toilsome its rewards as i come near them cheap i began a little while ago to want the garden quite badly yesand ive seen it three times  the garden  nothe door and i havent gone in  he leant over the table to me with an enormous sorrow in his voice as he spoke thrice i have had my chancethrice if ever that door offers itself to me again i swore i will go in out of this dust and heat out of this dry glitter of vanity out of these toilsome futilities i will go and never return this time i will stay i swore it and when the time camei didnt go  three times in one year have i passed that door and failed to enter three times in the last year  the first time was on the night of the snatch division on the tenants redemption bill on which the government was saved by a majority of three you remember no one on our sideperhaps very few on the opposite side expected the end that night then the debate collapsed like eggshells i and hotchkiss were dining with his cousin at brentford we were both unpaired and we were called up by telephone and set off at once in his cousins motor we got in barely in time and on the way we passed my wall and doorlivid in the moonlight blotched with hot yellow as the glare of our lamps lit it but unmistakable my god cried i what said hotchkiss nothing i answered and the moment passed  ive made a great sacrifice i told the whip as i got in they all have he said and hurried by  i do not see how i could have done otherwise then and the next occasion was as i rushed to my fathers bedside to bid that stern old man farewell then too the claims of life were imperative but the third time was different it happened a week ago it fills me with hot remorse to recall it i was with gurker and ralphsits no secret now you know that ive had my talk with gurker we had been dining at frobishers and the talk had become intimate between us the question of my place in the reconstructed ministry lay always just over the boundary of the discussion yesyes thats all settled it neednt be talked about yet but theres no reason to keep a secret from you yesthanks thanks but let me tell you my story  then on that night things were very much in the air my position was a very delicate one i was keenly anxious to get some definite word from gurker but was hampered by ralphs presence i was using the best power of my brain to keep that light and careless talk not too obviously directed to the point that concerned me i had to ralphs behaviour since has more than justified my caution ralphs i knew would leave us beyond the kensington high street and then i could surprise gurker by a sudden frankness one has sometimes to resort to these little devices and then it was that in the margin of my field of vision i became aware once more of the white wall the green door before us down the road  we passed it talking i passed it i can still see the shadow of gurkers marked profile his opera hat tilted forward over his prominent nose the many folds of his neck wrap going before my shadow and ralphs as we sauntered past  i passed within twenty inches of the door if i say goodnight to them and go in i asked myself what will happen and i was all atingle for that word with gurker  i could not answer that question in the tangle of my other problems they will think me mad i thought and suppose i vanish nowamazing disappearance of a prominent politician that weighed with me a thousand inconceivably petty worldlinesses weighed with me in that crisis  then he turned on me with a sorrowful smile and speaking slowly here i am he said  here i am he repeated and my chance has gone from me three times in one year the door has been offered methe door that goes into peace into delight into a beauty beyond dreaming a kindness no man on earth can know and i have rejected it redmond and it has gone  how do you know  i know i know i am left now to work it out to stick to the tasks that held me so strongly when my moments came you say i have successthis vulgar tawdry irksome envied thing i have it he had a walnut in his big hand if that was my success he said and crushed it and held it out for me to see  let me tell you something redmond this loss is destroying me for two months for ten weeks nearly now i have done no work at all except the most necessary and urgent duties my soul is full of inappeasable regrets at nightswhen it is less likely i shall be recognisedi go out i wander yes i wonder what people would think of that if they knew a cabinet minister the responsible head of that most vital of all departments wandering alonegrievingsometimes near audibly lamenting for a door for a garden   iv  i can see now his rather pallid face and the unfamiliar sombre fire that had come into his eyes i see him very vividly tonight i sit recalling his words his tones and last evenings westminster gazette still lies on my sofa containing the notice of his death at lunch today the club was busy with his death we talked of nothing else  they found his body very early yesterday morning in a deep excavation near east kensington station it is one of two shafts that have been made in connection with an extension of the railway southward it is protected from the intrusion of the public by a hoarding upon the high road in which a small doorway has been cut for the convenience of some of the workmen who live in that direction the doorway was left unfastened through a misunderstanding between two gangers and through it he made his way  my mind is darkened with questions and riddles  it would seem he walked all the way from the house that nighthe has frequently walked home during the past sessionand so it is i figure his dark form coming along the late and empty streets wrapped up intent and then did the pale electric lights near the station cheat the rough planking into a semblance of white did that fatal unfastened door awaken some memory  was there after all ever any green door in the wall at all  i do not know i have told his story as he told it to me there are times when i believe that wallace was no more than the victim of the coincidence between a rare but not unprecedented type of hallucination and a careless trap but that indeed is not my profoundest belief you may think me superstitious if you will and foolish but indeed i am more than half convinced that he had in truth an abnormal gift and a sense somethingi know not whatthat in the guise of wall and door offered him an outlet a secret and peculiar passage of escape into another and altogether more beautiful world at any rate you will say it betrayed him in the end but did it betray him there you touch the inmost mystery of these dreamers these men of vision and the imagination we see our world fair and common the hoarding and the pit by our daylight standard he walked out of security into darkness danger and death  but did he see like that       xxxii    the country of the blind   three hundred miles and more from chimborazo one hundred from the snows of cotopaxi in the wildest wastes of ecuadors andes there lies that mysterious mountain valley cut off from the world of men the country of the blind long years ago that valley lay so far open to the world that men might come at last through frightful gorges and over an icy pass into its equable meadows and thither indeed men came a family or so of peruvian halfbreeds fleeing from the lust and tyranny of an evil spanish ruler then came the stupendous outbreak of mindobamba when it was night in quito for seventeen days and the water was boiling at yaguachi and all the fish floating dying even as far as guayaquil everywhere along the pacific slopes there were landslips and swift thawings and sudden floods and one whole side of the old arauca crest slipped and came down in thunder and cut off the country of the blind for ever from the exploring feet of men but one of these early settlers had chanced to be on the hither side of the gorges when the world had so terribly shaken itself and he perforce had to forget his wife and his child and all the friends and possessions he had left up there and start life over again in the lower world he started it again but ill blindness overtook him and he died of punishment in the mines but the story he told begot a legend that lingers along the length of the cordilleras of the andes to this day  he told of his reason for venturing back from that fastness into which he had first been carried lashed to a llama beside a vast bale of gear when he was a child the valley he said had in it all that the heart of man could desiresweet water pasture and even climate slopes of rich brown soil with tangles of a shrub that bore an excellent fruit and on one side great hanging forests of pine that held the avalanches high far overhead on three sides vast cliffs of greygreen rock were capped by cliffs of ice but the glacier stream came not to them but flowed away by the farther slopes and only now and then huge ice masses fell on the valley side in this valley it neither rained nor snowed but the abundant springs gave a rich green pasture that irrigation would spread over all the valley space the settlers did well indeed there their beasts did well and multiplied and but one thing marred their happiness yet it was enough to mar it greatly a strange disease had come upon them and had made all the children born to them thereand indeed several older children alsoblind it was to seek some charm or antidote against this plague of blindness that he had with fatigue and danger and difficulty returned down the gorge in those days in such cases men did not think of germs and infections but of sins and it seemed to him that the reason of this affliction must lie in the negligence of these priestless immigrants to set up a shrine so soon as they entered the valley he wanted a shrinea handsome cheap effectual shrineto be erected in the valley he wanted relics and suchlike potent things of faith blessed objects and mysterious medals and prayers in his wallet he had a bar of native silver for which he would not account he insisted there was none in the valley with something of the insistence of an inexpert liar they had all clubbed their money and ornaments together having little need for such treasure up there he said to buy them holy help against their ill i figure this dimeyed young mountaineer sunburnt gaunt and anxious hatbrim clutched feverishly a man all unused to the ways of the lower world telling this story to some keeneyed attentive priest before the great convulsion i can picture him presently seeking to return with pious and infallible remedies against that trouble and the infinite dismay with which he must have faced the tumbled vastness where the gorge had once come out but the rest of his story of mischances is lost to me save that i know of his evil death after several years poor stray from that remoteness the stream that had once made the gorge now bursts from the mouth of a rocky cave and the legend his poor illtold story set going developed into the legend of a race of blind men somewhere over there one may still hear today  and amidst the little population of that now isolated and forgotten valley the disease ran its course the old became groping and purblind the young saw but dimly and the children that were born to them saw never at all but life was very easy in that snowrimmed basin lost to all the world with neither thorns nor briars with no evil insects nor any beasts save the gentle breed of llamas they had lugged and thrust and followed up the beds of the shrunken rivers in the gorges up which they had come the seeing had become purblind so gradually that they scarcely noted their loss they guided the sightless youngsters hither and thither until they knew the whole valley marvellously and when at last sight died out among them the race lived on they had even time to adapt themselves to the blind control of fire which they made carefully in stoves of stone they were a simple strain of people at the first unlettered only slightly touched with the spanish civilisation but with something of a tradition of the arts of old peru and of its lost philosophy generation followed generation they forgot many things they devised many things their tradition of the greater world they came from became mythical in colour and uncertain in all things save sight they were strong and able and presently the chance of birth and heredity sent one who had an original mind and who could talk and persuade among them and then afterwards another these two passed leaving their effects and the little community grew in numbers and in understanding and met and settled social and economic problems that arose generation followed generation generation followed generation there came a time when a child was born who was fifteen generations from that ancestor who went out of the valley with a bar of silver to seek gods aid and who never returned thereabouts it chanced that a man came into this community from the outer world and this is the story of that man  he was a mountaineer from the country near quito a man who had been down to the sea and had seen the world a reader of books in an original way an acute and enterprising man and he was taken on by a party of englishmen who had come out to ecuador to climb mountains to replace one of their three swiss guides who had fallen ill he climbed here and he climbed there and then came the attempt on parascotopetl the matterhorn of the andes in which he was lost to the outer world the story of the accident has been written a dozen times pointers narrative is the best he tells how the little party worked their difficult and almost vertical way up to the very foot of the last and greatest precipice and how they built a night shelter amidst the snow upon a little shelf of rock and with a touch of real dramatic power how presently they found nunez had gone from them they shouted and there was no reply shouted and whistled and for the rest of that night they slept no more  as the morning broke they saw the traces of his fall it seems impossible he could have uttered a sound he had slipped eastward towards the unknown side of the mountain far below he had struck a steep slope of snow and ploughed his way down it in the midst of a snow avalanche his track went straight to the edge of a frightful precipice and beyond that everything was hidden far far below and hazy with distance they could see trees rising out of a narrow shutin valleythe lost country of the blind but they did not know it was the lost country of the blind nor distinguish it in any way from any other narrow streak of upland valley unnerved by this disaster they abandoned their attempt in the afternoon and pointer was called away to the war before he could make another attack to this day parascotopetl lifts an unconquered crest and pointers shelter crumbles unvisited amidst the snows  and the man who fell survived  at the end of the slope he fell a thousand feet and came down in the midst of a cloud of snow upon a snow slope even steeper than the one above down this he was whirled stunned and insensible but without a bone broken in his body and then at last came to gentler slopes and at last rolled out and lay still buried amidst a softening heap of the white masses that had accompanied and saved him he came to himself with a dim fancy that he was ill in bed then realised his position with a mountaineers intelligence and worked himself loose and after a rest or so out until he saw the stars he rested flat upon his chest for a space wondering where he was and what had happened to him he explored his limbs and discovered that several of his buttons were gone and his coat turned over his head his knife had gone from his pocket and his hat was lost though he had tied it under his chin he recalled that he had been looking for loose stones to raise his piece of the shelter wall his iceaxe had disappeared  he decided he must have fallen and looked up to see exaggerated by the ghastly light of the rising moon the tremendous flight he had taken for a while he lay gazing blankly at that vast pale cliff towering above rising moment by moment out of a subsiding tide of darkness its phantasmal mysterious beauty held him for a space and then he was seized with a paroxysm of sobbing laughter  after a great interval of time he became aware that he was near the lower edge of the snow below down what was now a moonlit and practicable slope he saw the dark and broken appearance of rockstrewn turf he struggled to his feet aching in every joint and limb got down painfully from the heaped loose snow about him went downward until he was on the turf and there dropped rather than lay beside a boulder drank deep from the flask in his inner pocket and instantly fell asleep  he was awakened by the singing of birds in the trees far below  he sat up and perceived he was on a little alp at the foot of a vast precipice that was grooved by the gully down which he and his snow had come over against him another wall of rock reared itself against the sky the gorge between these precipices ran east and west and was full of the morning sunlight which lit to the westward the mass of fallen mountain that closed the descending gorge below him it seemed there was a precipice equally steep but behind the snow in the gully he found a sort of chimneycleft dripping with snowwater down which a desperate man might venture he found it easier than it seemed and came at last to another desolate alp and then after a rock climb of no particular difficulty to a steep slope of trees he took his bearings and turned his face up the gorge for he saw it opened out above upon green meadows among which he now glimpsed quite distinctly a cluster of stone huts of unfamiliar fashion at times his progress was like clambering along the face of a wall and after a time the rising sun ceased to strike along the gorge the voices of the singing birds died away and the air grew cold and dark about him but the distant valley with its houses was all the brighter for that he came presently to talus and among the rocks he notedfor he was an observant manan unfamiliar fern that seemed to clutch out of the crevices with intense green hands he picked a frond or so and gnawed its stalk and found it helpful  about midday he came at last out of the throat of the gorge into the plain and the sunlight he was stiff and weary he sat down in the shadow of a rock filled up his flask with water from a spring and drank it down and remained for a time resting before he went on to the houses  they were very strange to his eyes and indeed the whole aspect of that valley became as he regarded it queerer and more unfamiliar the greater part of its surface was lush green meadow starred with many beautiful flowers irrigated with extraordinary care and bearing evidence of systematic cropping piece by piece high up and ringing the valley about was a wall and what appeared to be a circumferential waterchannel from which the little trickles of water that fed the meadow plants came and on the higher slopes above this flocks of llamas cropped the scanty herbage sheds apparently shelters or feedingplaces for the llamas stood against the boundary wall here and there the irrigation streams ran together into a main channel down the centre of the valley and this was enclosed on either side by a wall breast high this gave a singularly urban quality to this secluded place a quality that was greatly enhanced by the fact that a number of paths paved with black and white stones and each with a curious little kerb at the side ran hither and thither in an orderly manner the houses of the central village were quite unlike the casual and higgledypiggledy agglomeration of the mountain villages he knew they stood in a continuous row on either side of a central street of astonishing cleanness here and there their particoloured facade was pierced by a door and not a solitary window broke their even frontage they were particoloured with extraordinary irregularity smeared with a sort of plaster that was sometimes grey sometimes drab sometimes slatecoloured or dark brown and it was the sight of this wild plastering first brought the word blind into the thoughts of the explorer the good man who did that he thought must have been as blind as a bat  he descended a steep place and so came to the wall and channel that ran about the valley near where the latter spouted out its surplus contents into the deeps of the gorge in a thin and wavering thread of cascade he could now see a number of men and women resting on piled heaps of grass as if taking a siesta in the remoter part of the meadow and nearer the village a number of recumbent children and then nearer at hand three men carrying pails on yokes along a little path that ran from the encircling wall towards the houses these latter were clad in garments of llama cloth and boots and belts of leather and they wore caps of cloth with back and ear flaps they followed one another in single file walking slowly and yawning as they walked like men who have been up all night there was something so reassuringly prosperous and respectable in their bearing that after a moments hesitation nunez stood forward as conspicuously as possible upon his rock and gave vent to a mighty shout that echoed round the valley  the three men stopped and moved their heads as though they were looking about them they turned their faces this way and that and nunez gesticulated with freedom but they did not appear to see him for all his gestures and after a time directing themselves towards the mountains far away to the right they shouted as if in answer nunez bawled again and then once more and as he gestured ineffectually the word blind came up to the top of his thoughts the fools must be blind he said  when at last after much shouting and wrath nunez crossed the stream by a little bridge came through a gate in the wall and approached them he was sure that they were blind he was sure that this was the country of the blind of which the legends told conviction had sprung upon him and a sense of great and rather enviable adventure the three stood side by side not looking at him but with their ears directed towards him judging him by his unfamiliar steps they stood close together like men a little afraid and he could see their eyelids closed and sunken as though the very balls beneath had shrunk away there was an expression near awe on their faces  a man one said in hardly recognisable spanisha man it isa man or a spiritcoming down from the rocks  but nunez advanced with the confident steps of a youth who enters upon life all the old stories of the lost valley and the country of the blind had come back to his mind and through his thoughts ran this old proverb as if it were a refrain  in the country of the blind the oneeyed man is king  in the country of the blind the oneeyed man is king  and very civilly he gave them greeting he talked to them and used his eyes  where does he come from brother pedro asked one  down out of the rocks  over the mountains i come said nunez out of the country beyond therewhere men can see from near bogota where there are a hundred thousands of people and where the city passes out of sight  sight muttered pedro sight  he comes said the second blind man out of the rocks  the cloth of their coats nunez saw was curiously fashioned each with a different sort of stitching  they startled him by a simultaneous movement towards him each with a hand outstretched he stepped back from the advance of these spread fingers  come hither said the third blind man following his motion and clutching him neatly  and they held nunez and felt him over saying no word further until they had done so  carefully he cried with a finger in his eye and found they thought that organ with its fluttering lids a queer thing in him they went over it again  a strange creature correa said the one called pedro feel the coarseness of his hair like a llamas hair  rough he is as the rocks that begot him said correa investigating nunezs unshaven chin with a soft and slightly moist hand perhaps he will grow finer nunez struggled a little under their examination but they gripped him firm  carefully he said again  he speaks said the third man certainly he is a man  ugh said pedro at the roughness of his coat  and you have come into the world asked pedro  out of the world over mountains and glaciers right over above there halfway to the sun out of the great big world that goes down twelve days journey to the sea  they scarcely seemed to heed him our fathers have told us men may be made by the forces of nature said correa it is the warmth of things and moisture and rottennessrottenness  let us lead him to the elders said pedro  shout first said correa lest the children be afraid this is a marvellous occasion  so they shouted and pedro went first and took nunez by the hand to lead him to the houses  he drew his hand away i can see he said  see said correa  yes see said nunez turning towards him and stumbled against pedros pail  his senses are still imperfect said the third blind man he stumbles and talks unmeaning words lead him by the hand  as you will said nunez and was led along laughing  it seemed they knew nothing of sight  well all in good time he would teach them  he heard people shouting and saw a number of figures gathering together in the middle roadway of the village  he found it tax his nerve and patience more than he had anticipated that first encounter with the population of the country of the blind the place seemed larger as he drew near to it and the smeared plasterings queerer and a crowd of children and men and women the women and girls he was pleased to note had some of them quite sweet faces for all that their eyes were shut and sunken came about him holding on to him touching him with soft sensitive hands smelling at him and listening at every word he spoke some of the maidens and children however kept aloof as if afraid and indeed his voice seemed coarse and rude beside their softer notes they mobbed him his three guides kept close to him with an effect of proprietorship and said again and again a wild man out of the rock  bogota he said bogota over the mountain crests  a wild manusing wild words said pedro did you hear that bogota his mind is hardly formed yet he has only the beginnings of speech  a little boy nipped his hand bogota he said mockingly  ay a city to your village i come from the great worldwhere men have eyes and see  his names bogota they said  he stumbled said correa stumbled twice as we came hither  bring him to the elders  and they thrust him suddenly through a doorway into a room as black as pitch save at the end there faintly glowed a fire the crowd closed in behind him and shut out all but the faintest glimmer of day and before he could arrest himself he had fallen headlong over the feet of a seated man his arm outflung struck the face of someone else as he went down he felt the soft impact of features and heard a cry of anger and for a moment he struggled against a number of hands that clutched him it was a onesided fight an inkling of the situation came to him and he lay quiet  i fell down he said i couldnt see in this pitchy darkness  there was a pause as if the unseen persons about him tried to understand his words then the voice of correa said he is but newly formed he stumbles as he walks and mingles words that mean nothing with his speech  others also said things about him that he heard or understood imperfectly  may i sit up he asked in a pause i will not struggle against you again  they consulted and let him rise  the voice of an older man began to question him and nunez found himself trying to explain the great world out of which he had fallen and the sky and mountains and sight and suchlike marvels to these elders who sat in darkness in the country of the blind and they would believe and understand nothing whatever he told them a thing quite outside his expectation they would not even understand many of his words for fourteen generations these people had been blind and cut off from all the seeing world the names for all the things of sight had faded and changed the story of the outer world was faded and changed to a childs story and they had ceased to concern themselves with anything beyond the rocky slopes above their circling wall blind men of genius had arisen among them and questioned the shreds of belief and tradition they had brought with them from their seeing days and had dismissed all these things as idle fancies and replaced them with new and saner explanations much of their imagination had shrivelled with their eyes and they had made for themselves new imaginations with their ever more sensitive ears and fingertips slowly nunez realised this that his expectation of wonder and reverence at his origin and his gifts was not to be borne out and after his poor attempt to explain sight to them had been set aside as the confused version of a newmade being describing the marvels of his incoherent sensations he subsided a little dashed into listening to their instruction and the eldest of the blind men explained to him life and philosophy and religion how that the world meaning their valley had been first an empty hollow in the rocks and then had come first inanimate things without the gift of touch and llamas and a few other creatures that had little sense and then men and at last angels whom one could hear singing and making fluttering sounds but whom no one could touch at all which puzzled nunez greatly until he thought of the birds  he went on to tell nunez how this time had been divided into the warm and the cold which are the blind equivalents of day and night and how it was good to sleep in the warm and work during the cold so that now but for his advent the whole town of the blind would have been asleep he said nunez must have been specially created to learn and serve the wisdom they had acquired and that for all his mental incoherency and stumbling behaviour he must have courage and do his best to learn and at that all the people in the doorway murmured encouragingly he said the nightfor the blind call their day nightwas now far gone and it behoved every one to go back to sleep he asked nunez if he knew how to sleep and nunez said he did but that before sleep he wanted food  they brought him foodllamas milk in a bowl and rough salted breadand led him into a lonely place to eat out of their hearing and afterwards to slumber until the chill of the mountain evening roused them to begin their day again but nunez slumbered not at all  instead he sat up in the place where they had left him resting his limbs and turning the unanticipated circumstances of his arrival over and over in his mind  every now and then he laughed sometimes with amusement and sometimes with indignation  unformed mind he said got no senses yet they little know theyve been insulting their heavensent king and master i see i must bring them to reason let me thinklet me think  he was still thinking when the sun set  nunez had an eye for all beautiful things and it seemed to him that the glow upon the snowfields and glaciers that rose about the valley on every side was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen his eyes went from that inaccessible glory to the village and irrigated fields fast sinking into the twilight and suddenly a wave of emotion took him and he thanked god from the bottom of his heart that the power of sight had been given him  he heard a voice calling to him from out of the village ya ho there bogota come hither  at that he stood up smiling he would show these people once and for all what sight would do for a man they would seek him but not find him  you move not bogota said the voice  he laughed noiselessly and made two stealthy steps aside from the path  trample not on the grass bogota that is not allowed  nunez had scarcely heard the sound he made himself he stopped amazed  the owner of the voice came running up the piebald path towards him  he stepped back into the pathway here i am he said  why did you not come when i called you said the blind man must you be led like a child cannot you hear the path as you walk  nunez laughed i can see it he said  there is no such word as see said the blind man after a pause cease this folly and follow the sound of my feet  nunez followed a little annoyed  my time will come he said  youll learn the blind man answered there is much to learn in the world  has no one told you in the country of the blind the oneeyed man is king  what is blind asked the blind man carelessly over his shoulder  four days passed and the fifth found the king of the blind still incognito as a clumsy and useless stranger among his subjects  it was he found much more difficult to proclaim himself than he had supposed and in the meantime while he meditated his coup détat he did what he was told and learnt the manners and customs of the country of the blind he found working and going about at night a particularly irksome thing and he decided that that should be the first thing he would change  they led a simple laborious life these people with all the elements of virtue and happiness as these things can be understood by men they toiled but not oppressively they had food and clothing sufficient for their needs they had days and seasons of rest they made much of music and singing and there was love among them and little children  it was marvellous with what confidence and precision they went about their ordered world everything you see had been made to fit their needs each of the radiating paths of the valley area had a constant angle to the others and was distinguished by a special notch upon its kerbing all obstacles and irregularities of path or meadow had long since been cleared away all their methods and procedure arose naturally from their special needs their senses had become marvellously acute they could hear and judge the slightest gesture of a man a dozen paces awaycould hear the very beating of his heart intonation had long replaced expression with them and touches gesture and their work with hoe and spade and fork was as free and confident as garden work can be their sense of smell was extraordinarily fine they could distinguish individual differences as readily as a dog can and they went about the tending of the llamas who lived among the rocks above and came to the wall for food and shelter with ease and confidence it was only when at last nunez sought to assert himself that he found how easy and confident their movements could be  he rebelled only after he had tried persuasion  he tried at first on several occasions to tell them of sight look you here you people he said there are things you do not understand in me  once or twice one or two of them attended to him they sat with faces downcast and ears turned intelligently towards him and he did his best to tell them what it was to see among his hearers was a girl with eyelids less red and sunken than the others so that one could almost fancy she was hiding eyes whom especially he hoped to persuade he spoke of the beauties of sight of watching the mountains of the sky and the sunrise and they heard him with amused incredulity that presently became condemnatory they told him there were indeed no mountains at all but that the end of the rocks where the llamas grazed was indeed the end of the world thence sprang a cavernous roof of the universe from which the dew and the avalanches fell and when he maintained stoutly the world had neither end nor roof such as they supposed they said his thoughts were wicked so far as he could describe sky and clouds and stars to them it seemed to them a hideous void a terrible blankness in the place of the smooth roof to things in which they believedit was an article of faith with them that the cavern roof was exquisitely smooth to the touch he saw that in some manner he shocked them and gave up that aspect of the matter altogether and tried to show them the practical value of sight one morning he saw pedro in the path called seventeen and coming towards the central houses but still too far off for hearing or scent and he told them as much in a little while he prophesied pedro will be here an old man remarked that pedro had no business on path seventeen and then as if in confirmation that individual as he drew near turned and went transversely into path ten and so back with nimble paces towards the outer wall they mocked nunez when pedro did not arrive and afterwards when he asked pedro questions to clear his character pedro denied and outfaced him and was afterwards hostile to him  then he induced them to let him go a long way up the sloping meadows towards the wall with one complacent individual and to him he promised to describe all that happened among the houses he noted certain goings and comings but the things that really seemed to signify to these people happened inside of or behind the windowless housesthe only things they took note of to test him byand of these he could see or tell nothing and it was after the failure of this attempt and the ridicule they could not repress that he resorted to force he thought of seizing a spade and suddenly smiting one or two of them to earth and so in fair combat showing the advantage of eyes he went so far with that resolution as to seize his spade and then he discovered a new thing about himself and that was that it was impossible for him to hit a blind man in cold blood  he hesitated and found them all aware that he had snatched up the spade they stood alert with their heads on one side and bent ears towards him for what he would do next  put that spade down said one and he felt a sort of helpless horror he came near obedience  then he thrust one backwards against a house wall and fled past him and out of the village  he went athwart one of their meadows leaving a track of trampled grass behind his feet and presently sat down by the side of one of their ways he felt something of the buoyancy that comes to all men in the beginning of a fight but more perplexity he began to realise that you cannot even fight happily with creatures who stand upon a different mental basis to yourself far away he saw a number of men carrying spades and sticks come out of the street of houses and advance in a spreading line along the several paths towards him they advanced slowly speaking frequently to one another and ever and again the whole cordon would halt and sniff the air and listen  the first time they did this nunez laughed but afterwards he did not laugh  one struck his trail in the meadow grass and came stooping and feeling his way along it  for five minutes he watched the slow extension of the cordon and then his vague disposition to do something forthwith became frantic he stood up went a pace or so towards the circumferential wall turned and went back a little way there they all stood in a crescent still and listening  he also stood still gripping his spade very tightly in both hands should he charge them  the pulse in his ears ran into the rhythm of in the country of the blind the oneeyed man is king  should he charge them  he looked back at the high and unclimbable wall behindunclimbable because of its smooth plastering but withal pierced with many little doors and at the approaching line of seekers behind these others were now coming out of the street of houses  should he charge them  bogota called one bogota where are you  he gripped his spade still tighter and advanced down the meadows towards the place of habitations and directly he moved they converged upon him ill hit them if they touch me he swore by heaven i will ill hit he called aloud look here im going to do what i like in this valley do you hear im going to do what i like and go where i like  they were moving in upon him quickly groping yet moving rapidly it was like playing blind mans buff with everyone blindfolded except one get hold of him cried one he found himself in the arc of a loose curve of pursuers he felt suddenly he must be active and resolute  you dont understand he cried in a voice that was meant to be great and resolute and which broke you are blind and i can see leave me alone  bogota put down that spade and come off the grass  the last order grotesque in its urban familiarity produced a gust of anger  ill hurt you he said sobbing with emotion by heaven ill hurt you leave me alone  he began to run not knowing clearly where to run he ran from the nearest blind man because it was a horror to hit him he stopped and then made a dash to escape from their closing ranks he made for where a gap was wide and the men on either side with a quick perception of the approach of his paces rushed in on one another he sprang forward and then saw he must be caught and swish the spade had struck he felt the soft thud of hand and arm and the man was down with a yell of pain and he was through  through and then he was close to the street of houses again and blind men whirling spades and stakes were running with a sort of reasoned swiftness hither and thither  he heard steps behind him just in time and found a tall man rushing forward and swiping at the sound of him he lost his nerve hurled his spade a yard wide at his antagonist and whirled about and fled fairly yelling as he dodged another  he was panicstricken he ran furiously to and fro dodging when there was no need to dodge and in his anxiety to see on every side of him at once stumbling for a moment he was down and they heard his fall far away in the circumferential wall a little doorway looked like heaven and he set off in a wild rush for it he did not even look round at his pursuers until it was gained and he had stumbled across the bridge clambered a little way among the rocks to the surprise and dismay of a young llama who went leaping out of sight and lay down sobbing for breath  and so his coup détat came to an end  he stayed outside the wall of the valley of the blind for two nights and days without food or shelter and meditated upon the unexpected during these meditations he repeated very frequently and always with a profounder note of derision the exploded proverb in the country of the blind the oneeyed man is king he thought chiefly of ways of fighting and conquering these people and it grew clear that for him no practicable way was possible he had no weapons and now it would be hard to get one  the canker of civilisation had got to him even in bogota and he could not find it in himself to go down and assassinate a blind man of course if he did that he might then dictate terms on the threat of assassinating them all butsooner or later he must sleep  he tried also to find food among the pine trees to be comfortable under pine boughs while the frost fell at night andwith less confidenceto catch a llama by artifice in order to try to kill itperhaps by hammering it with a stoneand so finally perhaps to eat some of it but the llamas had a doubt of him and regarded him with distrustful brown eyes and spat when he drew near fear came on him the second day and fits of shivering finally he crawled down to the wall of the country of the blind and tried to make terms he crawled along by the stream shouting until two blind men came out to the gate and talked to him  i was mad he said but i was only newly made  they said that was better  he told them he was wiser now and repented of all he had done  then he wept without intention for he was very weak and ill now and they took that as a favourable sign  they asked him if he still thought he could see  no he said that was folly the word means nothingless than nothing  they asked him what was overhead  about ten times ten the height of a man there is a roof above the world of rockand very very smooth   he burst again into hysterical tears before you ask me any more give me some food or i shall die  he expected dire punishments but these blind people were capable of toleration they regarded his rebellion as but one more proof of his general idiocy and inferiority and after they had whipped him they appointed him to do the simplest and heaviest work they had for anyone to do and he seeing no other way of living did submissively what he was told  he was ill for some days and they nursed him kindly that refined his submission but they insisted on his lying in the dark and that was a great misery and blind philosophers came and talked to him of the wicked levity of his mind and reproved him so impressively for his doubts about the lid of rock that covered their cosmic casserole that he almost doubted whether indeed he was not the victim of hallucination in not seeing it overhead  so nunez became a citizen of the country of the blind and these people ceased to be a generalised people and became individualities and familiar to him while the world beyond the mountains became more and more remote and unreal there was yacob his master a kindly man when not annoyed there was pedro yacobs nephew and there was medinasaroté who was the youngest daughter of yacob she was little esteemed in the world of the blind because she had a clearcut face and lacked that satisfying glossy smoothness that is the blind mans ideal of feminine beauty but nunez thought her beautiful at first and presently the most beautiful thing in the whole creation her closed eyelids were not sunken and red after the common way of the valley but lay as though they might open again at any moment and she had long eyelashes which were considered a grave disfigurement and her voice was strong and did not satisfy the acute hearing of the valley swains so that she had no lover  there came a time when nunez thought that could he win her he would be resigned to live in the valley for all the rest of his days  he watched her he sought opportunities of doing her little services and presently he found that she observed him once at a restday gathering they sat side by side in the dim starlight and the music was sweet his hand came upon hers and he dared to clasp it then very tenderly she returned his pressure and one day as they were at their meal in the darkness he felt her hand very softly seeking him and as it chanced the fire leapt then and he saw the tenderness of her face  he sought to speak to her  he went to her one day when she was sitting in the summer moonlight spinning the light made her a thing of silver and mystery he sat down at her feet and told her he loved her and told her how beautiful she seemed to him he had a lovers voice he spoke with a tender reverence that came near to awe and she had never before been touched by adoration she made him no definite answer but it was clear his words pleased her  after that he talked to her whenever he could take an opportunity the valley became the world for him and the world beyond the mountains where men lived in sunlight seemed no more than a fairy tale he would some day pour into her ears very tentatively and timidly he spoke to her of sight  sight seemed to her the most poetical of fancies and she listened to his description of the stars and the mountains and her own sweet whitelit beauty as though it was a guilty indulgence she did not believe she could only half understand but she was mysteriously delighted and it seemed to him that she completely understood  his love lost its awe and took courage presently he was for demanding her of yacob and the elders in marriage but she became fearful and delayed and it was one of her elder sisters who first told yacob that medinasaroté and nunez were in love  there was from the first very great opposition to the marriage of nunez and medinasaroté not so much because they valued her as because they held him as a being apart an idiot incompetent thing below the permissible level of a man her sisters opposed it bitterly as bringing discredit on them all and old yacob though he had formed a sort of liking for his clumsy obedient serf shook his head and said the thing could not be the young men were all angry at the idea of corrupting the race and one went so far as to revile and strike nunez he struck back then for the first time he found an advantage in seeing even by twilight and after that fight was over no one was disposed to raise a hand against him but they still found his marriage impossible  old yacob had a tenderness for his last little daughter and was grieved to have her weep upon his shoulder  you see my dear hes an idiot he has delusions he cant do anything right  i know wept medinasaroté but hes better than he was hes getting better and hes strong dear father and kindstronger and kinder than any i other man in the world and he loves meand father i love him  old yacob was greatly distressed to find her inconsolable and besides what made it more distressinghe liked nunez for many things so he went and sat in the windowless councilchamber with the other elders and watched the trend of the talk and said at the proper time hes better than he was very likely some day we shall find him as sane as ourselves  then afterwards one of the elders who thought deeply had an idea he was the great doctor among these people their medicineman and he had a very philosophical and inventive mind and the idea of curing nunez of his peculiarities appealed to him one day when yacob was present he returned to the topic of nunez  i have examined bogota he said and the case is clearer to me i think very probably he might be cured  that is what i have always hoped said old yacob  his brain is affected said the blind doctor  the elders murmured assent  now what affects it  ah said old yacob  this said the doctor answering his own question those queer things that are called the eyes and which exist to make an agreeable soft depression in the face are diseased in the case of bogota in such a way as to affect his brain they are greatly distended he has eyelashes and his eyelids move and consequently his brain is in a state of constant irritation and distraction  yes said old yacob yes  and i think i may say with reasonable certainty that in order to cure him completely all that we need do is a simple and easy surgical operationnamely to remove these irritant bodies  and then he will be sane  then he will be perfectly sane and a quite admirable citizen  thank heaven for science said old yacob and went forth at once to tell nunez of his happy hopes  but nunezs manner of receiving the good news struck him as being cold and disappointing  one might think he said from the tone you take that you did not care for my daughter  it was medinasaroté who persuaded nunez to face the blind surgeons  you do not want me he said to lose my gift of sight  she shook her head  my world is sight  her head drooped lower  there are the beautiful things the beautiful little thingsthe flowers the lichens among the rocks the lightness and softness on a piece of fur the far sky with its drifting down of clouds the sunsets and the stars and there is you for you alone it is good to have sight to see your sweet serene face your kindly lips your dear beautiful hands folded together it is these eyes of mine you won these eyes that hold me to you that these idiots seek instead i must touch you hear you and never see you again i must come under that roof of rock and stone and darkness that horrible roof under which your imagination stoops no you would not have me do that  a disagreeable doubt had arisen in him he stopped and left the thing a question  i wish she said sometimes she paused  yes said he a little apprehensively  i wish sometimesyou would not talk like that  like what  i know its prettyits your imagination i love it but now  he felt cold now he said faintly  she sat quite still  you meanyou thinki should be better better perhaps  he was realising things very swiftly he felt anger indeed anger at the dull course of fate but also sympathy for her lack of understandinga sympathy near akin to pity  dear he said and he could see by her whiteness how intensely her spirit pressed against the things she could not say he put his arms about her he kissed her ear and they sat for a time in silence  if i were to consent to this he said at last in a voice that was very gentle  she flung her arms about him weeping wildly oh if you would she sobbed if only you would                                       for a week before the operation that was to raise him from his servitude and inferiority to the level of a blind citizen nunez knew nothing of sleep and all through the warm sunlit hours while the others slumbered happily he sat brooding or wandered aimlessly trying to bring his mind to bear on his dilemma he had given his answer he had given his consent and still he was not sure and at last worktime was over the sun rose in splendour over the golden crests and his last day of vision began for him he had a few minutes with medinasaroté before she went apart to sleep  tomorrow he said i shall see no more  dear heart she answered and pressed his hands with all her strength  they will hurt you but little she said and you are going through this painyou are going through it dear lover for me dear if a womans heart and life can do it i will repay you my dearest one my dearest with the tender voice i will repay  he was drenched in pity for himself and her  he held her in his arms and pressed his lips to hers and looked on her sweet face for the last time goodbye he whispered at that dear sight goodbye  and then in silence he turned away from her  she could hear his slow retreating footsteps and something in the rhythm of them threw her into a passion of weeping  he had fully meant to go to a lonely place where the meadows were beautiful with white narcissus and there remain until the hour of his sacrifice should come but as he went he lifted up his eyes and saw the morning the morning like an angel in golden armour marching down the steeps  it seemed to him that before this splendour he and this blind world in the valley and his love and all were no more than a pit of sin  he did not turn aside as he had meant to do but went on and passed through the wall of the circumference and out upon the rocks and his eyes were always upon the sunlit ice and snow  he saw their infinite beauty and his imagination soared over them to the things beyond he was now to resign for ever  he thought of that great free world he was parted from the world that was his own and he had a vision of those further slopes distance beyond distance with bogota a place of multitudinous stirring beauty a glory by day a luminous mystery by night a place of palaces and fountains and statues and white houses lying beautifully in the middle distance he thought how for a day or so one might come down through passes drawing ever nearer and nearer to its busy streets and ways he thought of the river journey day by day from great bogota to the still vaster world beyond through towns and villages forest and desert places the rushing river day by day until its banks receded and the big steamers came splashing by and one had reached the seathe limitless sea with its thousand islands its thousands of islands and its ships seen dimly far away in their incessant journeyings round and about that greater world and there unpent by mountains one saw the skythe sky not such a disc as one saw it here but an arch of immeasurable blue a deep of deeps in which the circling stars were floating  his eyes scrutinised the great curtain of the mountains with a keener inquiry  for example if one went so up that gully and to that chimney there then one might come out high among those stunted pines that ran round in a sort of shelf and rose still higher and higher as it passed above the gorge and then that talus might be managed thence perhaps a climb might be found to take him up to the precipice that came below the snow and if that chimney failed then another farther to the east might serve his purpose better and then then one would be out upon the amberlit snow there and halfway up to the crest of those beautiful desolations  he glanced back at the village then turned right round and regarded it steadfastly  he thought of medinasaroté and she had become small and remote  he turned again towards the mountain wall down which the day had come to him  then very circumspectly he began to climb  when sunset came he was no longer climbing but he was far and high he had been higher but he was still very high his clothes were torn his limbs were bloodstained he was bruised in many places but he lay as if he were at his ease and there was a smile on his face  from where he rested the valley seemed as if it were in a pit and nearly a mile below already it was dim with haze and shadow though the mountain summits around him were things of light and fire the mountain summits around him were things of light and fire and the little details of the rocks near at hand were drenched with subtle beautya vein of green mineral piercing the grey the flash of crystal faces here and there a minute minutelybeautiful orange lichen close beside his face there were deep mysterious shadows in the gorge blue deepening into purple and purple into a luminous darkness and overhead was the illimitable vastness of the sky but he heeded these things no longer but lay quite inactive there smiling as if he were satisfied merely to have escaped from the valley of the blind in which he had thought to be king  the glow of the sunset passed and the night came and still he lay peacefully contented under the cold clear stars       xxxiii    the beautiful suit   there was once a little man whose mother made him a beautiful suit of clothes it was green and gold and woven so that i cannot describe how delicate and fine it was and there was a tie of orange fluffiness that tied up under his chin and the buttons in their newness shone like stars he was proud and pleased by his suit beyond measure and stood before the long lookingglass when first he put it on so astonished and delighted with it that he could hardly turn himself away he wanted to wear it everywhere and show it to all sorts of people he thought over all the places he had ever visited and all the scenes he had ever heard described and tried to imagine what the feel of it would be if he were to go now to those scenes and places wearing his shining suit and he wanted to go out forthwith into the long grass and the hot sunshine of the meadow wearing it just to wear it but his mother told him no she told him he must take great care of his suit for never would he have another nearly so fine he must save it and save it and only wear it on rare and great occasions it was his weddingsuit she said and she took the buttons and twisted them up with tissue paper for fear their bright newness should be tarnished and she tacked little guards over the cuffs and elbows and wherever the suit was most likely to come to harm he hated and resisted these things but what could he do and at last her warnings and persuasions had effect and he consented to take off his beautiful suit and fold it into its proper creases and put it away it was almost as though he gave it up again but he was always thinking of wearing it and of the supreme occasions when some day it might be worn without the guards without the tissue paper on the buttons utterly and delightfully never caring beautiful beyond measure  one night when he was dreaming of it after his habit he dreamt he took the tissue paper from one of the buttons and found its brightness a little faded and that distressed him mightily in his dream he polished the poor faded button and polished it and if anything it grew duller he woke up and lay awake thinking of the brightness a little dulled and wondering how he would feel if perhaps when the great occasion whatever it might be should arrive one button should chance to be ever so little short of its first glittering freshness and for days and days that thought remained with him distressingly and when next his mother let him wear his suit he was tempted and nearly gave way to the temptation just to fumble off one little bit of tissue paper and see if indeed the buttons were keeping as bright as ever  he went trimly along on his way to church full of this wild desire for you must know his mother did with repeated and careful warnings let him wear his suit at times on sundays for example to and fro from church when there was no threatening of rain no dust blowing nor anything to injure it with its buttons covered and its protections tacked upon it and a sunshade in his hand to shadow it if there seemed too strong a sunlight for its colours and always after such occasions he brushed it over and folded it exquisitely as she had taught him and put it away again  now all these restrictions his mother set to the wearing of his suit he obeyed always he obeyed them until one strange night he woke up and saw the moonlight shining outside his window it seemed to him the moonlight was not common moonlight nor the night a common night and for awhile he lay quite drowsily with this odd persuasion in his mind thought joined on to thought like things that whisper warmly in the shadows then he sat up in his little bed suddenly very alert with his heart beating very fast and a quiver in his body from top to toe he had made up his mind he knew that now he was going to wear his suit as it should be worn he had no doubt in the matter he was afraid terribly afraid but glad glad  he got out of his bed and stood for a moment by the window looking at the moonshineflooded garden and trembling at the thing he meant to do the air was full of a minute clamour of crickets and murmurings of the infinitesimal shoutings of little living things he went very gently across the creaking boards for fear that he might wake the sleeping house to the big dark clothespress wherein his beautiful suit lay folded and he took it out garment by garment and softly and very eagerly tore off its tissuepaper covering and its tacked protections until there it was perfect and delightful as he had seen it when first his mother had given it to hima long time it seemed ago not a button had tarnished not a thread had faded on this dear suit of his he was glad enough for weeping as in a noiseless hurry he put it on and then back he went soft and quick to the window that looked out upon the garden and stood there for a minute shining in the moonlight with his buttons twinkling like stars before he got out on the sill and making as little of a rustling as he could clambered down to the garden path below he stood before his mothers house and it was white and nearly as plain as by day with every windowblind but his own shut like an eye that sleeps the trees cast still shadows like intricate black lace upon the wall  the garden in the moonlight was very different from the garden by day moonshine was tangled in the hedges and stretched in phantom cobwebs from spray to spray every flower was gleaming white or crimson black and the air was aquiver with the thridding of small crickets and nightingales singing unseen in the depths of the trees  there was no darkness in the world but only warm mysterious shadows and all the leaves and spikes were edged and lined with iridescent jewels of dew the night was warmer than any night had ever been the heavens by some miracle at once vaster and nearer and spite of the great ivorytinted moon that ruled the world the sky was full of stars  the little man did not shout nor sing for all his infinite gladness he stood for a time like one awestricken and then with a queer small cry and holding out his arms he ran out as if he would embrace at once the whole round immensity of the world he did not follow the neat set paths that cut the garden squarely but thrust across the beds and through the wet tall scented herbs through the nightstock and the nicotine and the clusters of phantom white mallow flowers and through the thickets of southernwood and lavender and kneedeep across a wide space of mignonette he came to the great hedge and he thrust his way through it and though the thorns of the brambles scored him deeply and tore threads from his wonderful suit and though burrs and goosegrass and havers caught and clung to him he did not care he did not care for he knew it was all part of the wearing for which he had longed i am glad i put on my suit he said i am glad i wore my suit  beyond the hedge he came to the duckpond or at least to what was the duckpond by day but by night it was a great bowl of silver moonshine all noisy with singing frogs of wonderful silver moonshine twisted and clotted with strange patternings and the little man ran down into its waters between the thin black rushes kneedeep and waistdeep and to his shoulders smiting the water to black and shining wavelets with either hand swaying and shivering wavelets amidst which the stars were netted in the tangled reflections of the brooding trees upon the bank he waded until he swam and so he crossed the pond and came out upon the other side trailing as it seemed to him not duckweed but very silver in long clinging dripping masses and up he went through the transfigured tangles of the willowherb and the uncut seeding grasses of the farther bank he came glad and breathless into the highroad i am glad he said beyond measure that i had clothes that fitted this occasion  the highroad ran straight as an arrow flies straight into the deepblue pit of sky beneath the moon a white and shining road between the singing nightingales and along it he went running now and leaping and now walking and rejoicing in the clothes his mother had made for him with tireless loving hands the road was deep in dust but that for him was only soft whiteness and as he went a great dim moth came fluttering round his wet and shimmering and hastening figure at first he did not heed the moth and then he waved his hands at it and made a sort of dance with it as it circled round his head soft moth he cried dear moth and wonderful night wonderful night of the world do you think my clothes are beautiful dear moth as beautiful as your scales and all this silver vesture of the earth and sky  and the moth circled closer and closer until at last its velvet wings just brushed his lips                                       and next morning they found him dead with his neck broken in the bottom of the stone pit with his beautiful clothes a little bloody and foul and stained with the duckweed from the pond but his face was a face of such happiness that had you seen it you would have understood indeed how that he had died happy never knowing that cool and streaming silver for the duckweed in the pond
