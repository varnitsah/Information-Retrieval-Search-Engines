nineteenth century and of the fortnightly review for permission to reprint such of the following essays as have appeared in the pages of those periodicals and so large a proportion of the papers has been published in the nineteenth century that my acknowledgments are especially due to mr knowles    t h h    may 4 1892                                      1   prologue      le plus grand service quon puisse rendre à la science est dy faire     place nette avant dy rien construirecuvier  most of the essays comprised in the present volume have been written during the last six or seven years without premeditated purpose or intentional connection in reply to attacks upon doctrines which i hold to be well founded or in refutation of allegations respecting matters lying within the province of natural knowledge which i believe to be erroneous and they bear the mark of their origin in the controversial tone which pervades them  of polemical writing as of other kinds of warfare i think it may be said that it is often useful sometimes necessary and always more or less of an evil it is useful when it attracts attention to topics which might otherwise be neglected and when as does sometimes happen those who come to see a contest remain to think it is necessary when the interests of truth and of justice are at stake it is an evil in so far as controversy always tends to degenerate into quarrelling to swerve from the great issue of what is right and what is wrong to the very small question 2 of who is right and who is wrong i venture to hope that the useful and the necessary were more conspicuous than the evil attributes of literary militancy when these papers were first published but i have had some hesitation about reprinting them if i may judge by my own taste few literary dishes are less appetising than cold controversy moreover there is an air of unfairness about the presentation of only one side of a discussion and a flavour of unkindness in the reproduction of winged words which however appropriate at the time of their utterance would find a still more appropriate place in oblivion yet since i could hardly ask those who have honoured me by their polemical attentions to confer lustre on this collection by permitting me to present their lucubrations along with my own and since it would be a manifest wrong to them to deprive their by no means rare vivacities of language of such justification as they may derive from similar freedoms on my part i came to the conclusion that my best course was to leave the essays just as they were written1 assuring my honourable adversaries that any heat of which signs may remain was generated in accordance with the law of the conservation of energy by the force of their own blows and has long since been dissipated into space  but however the polemical concomitants of these discussions may be regardedor better 3 disregardedthere is no doubt either about the importance of the topics of which they treat or as to the public interest in the controverted questions with which they deal or rather the controverted question for disconnected as these pieces may perhaps appear to be they are in fact concerned only with different aspects of a single problem with which thinking men have been occupied ever since they began seriously to consider the wonderful frame of things in which their lives are set and to seek for trustworthy guidance among its intricacies  experience speedily taught them that the shifting scenes of the worlds stage have a permanent background that there is order amidst the seeming confusion and that many events take place according to unchanging rules to this region of familiar steadiness and customary regularity they gave the name of nature but at the same time their infantile and untutored reason little more as yet than the playfellow of the imagination led them to believe that this tangible commonplace orderly world of nature was surrounded and interpenetrated by another intangible and mysterious world no more bound by fixed rules than as they fancied were the thoughts and passions which coursed through their minds and seemed to exercise an intermittent and capricious rule over their bodies they attributed to the entities with which they peopled this dim and dreadful region an unlimited amount of that power of modifying the course of events of which they themselves possessed a small share and thus 4 came to regard them as not merely beyond but above nature  hence arose the conception of a supernature antithetic to naturethe primitive dualism of a natural world fixed in fate and a supernatural left to the free play of volitionwhich has pervaded all later speculation and for thousands of years has exercised a profound influence on practice for it is obvious that on this theory of the universe the successful conduct of life must demand careful attention to both worlds and if either is to be neglected it may be safer that it should be nature in any given contingency it must doubtless be desirable to know what may be expected to happen in the ordinary course of things but it must be quite as necessary to have some inkling of the line likely to be taken by supernatural agencies able and possibly willing to suspend or reverse that course indeed logically developed the dualistic theory must needs end in almost exclusive attention to supernature and in trust that its overruling strength will be exerted in favour of those who stand well with its denizens on the other hand the lessons of the great schoolmaster experience have hardly seemed to accord with this conclusion they have taught with considerable emphasis that it does not answer to neglect nature and that on the whole the more attention paid to her dictates the better men fare  thus the theoretical antithesis brought about a practical antagonism from the earliest times of which we have any knowledge naturalism and 5 supernaturalism have consciously or unconsciously competed and struggled with one another and the varying fortunes of the contest are written in the records of the course of civilisation from those of egypt and babylonia six thousand years ago down to those of our own time and people  these records inform us that so far as men have paid attention to nature they have been rewarded for their pains they have developed the arts which have furnished the conditions of civilised existence and the sciences which have been a progressive revelation of reality and have afforded the best discipline of the mind in the methods of discovering truth they have accumulated a vast body of universally accepted knowledge and the conceptions of man and of society of morals and of law based upon that knowledge are every day more and more either openly or tacitly acknowledged to be the foundations of right action  history also tells us that the field of the supernatural has rewarded its cultivators with a harvest perhaps not less luxuriant but of a different character it has produced an almost infinite diversity of religions these if we set aside the ethical concomitants upon which natural knowledge also has a claim are composed of information about supernature they tell us of the attributes of supernatural beings of their relations with nature and of the operations by which their interference with the ordinary course of events can be secured or averted it does not appear however that supernaturalists have attained 6 to any agreement about these matters or that history indicates a widening of the influence of supernaturalism on practice with the onward flow of time on the contrary the various religions are to a great extent mutually exclusive and their adherents delight in charging each other not merely with error but with criminality deserving an ensuing punishment of infinite severity in singular contrast with natural knowledge again the acquaintance of mankind with the supernatural appears the more extensive and the more exact and the influence of supernatural doctrines upon conduct the greater the further back we go in time and the lower the stage of civilisation submitted to investigation historically indeed there would seem to be an inverse relation between supernatural and natural knowledge as the latter has widened gained in precision and in trustworthiness so has the former shrunk grown vague and questionable as the one has more and more filled the sphere of action so has the other retreated into the region of meditation or vanished behind the screen of mere verbal recognition  whether this difference of the fortunes of naturalism and of supernaturalism is an indication of the progress or of the regress of humanity of a fall from or an advance towards the higher life is a matter of opinion the point to which i wish to direct attention is that the difference exists and is making itself felt men are growing to be seriously alive to the fact that the historical evolution of humanity which is generally and i venture to 7 think not unreasonably regarded as progress has been and is being accompanied by a coordinate elimination of the supernatural from its originally large occupation of mens thoughts the questionhow far is this process to gois in my apprehension the controverted question of our time    controversy on this matterprolonged bitter and fought out with the weapons of the flesh as well as with those of the spiritis no new thing to englishmen we have been more or less occupied with it these five hundred years and during that time we have made attempts to establish a modus vivendi between the antagonists some of which have had a worldwide influence though unfortunately none have proved universally and permanently satisfactory  in the fourteenth century the controverted question among us was whether certain portions of the supernaturalism of mediæval christianity were wellfounded john wicliff proposed a solution of the problem which in the course of the following two hundred years acquired wide popularity and vast historical importance lollards hussites lutherans calvinists zwinglians socinians and anabaptists whatever their disagreements concurred in the proposal to reduce the supernaturalism of christianity within the limits sanctioned by the scriptures none of the chiefs of protestantism called in question either the supernatural origin and infallible authority of the bible or the exactitude of the account of the 8 supernatural world given in its pages in fact they could not afford to entertain any doubt about these points since the infallible bible was the fulcrum of the lever with which they were endeavouring to upset the chair of st peter the freedom of private judgment which they proclaimed meant no more in practice than permission to themselves to make free with the public judgment of the roman church in respect of the canon and of the meaning to be attached to the words of the canonical books private judgmentthat is to say reasonwas theoretically at any rate at liberty to decide what books were and what were not to take the rank of scripture and to determine the sense of any passage in such books but this sense once ascertained to the mind of the sectary was to be taken for pure truthfor the very word of god the controversial efficiency of the principle of biblical infallibility lay in the fact that the conservative adversaries of the reformers were not in a position to contravene it without entangling themselves in serious difficulties while since both papists and protestants agreed in taking efficient measures to stop the mouths of any more radical critics these did not count  the impotence of their adversaries however did not remove the inherent weakness of the position of the protestants the dogma of the infallibility of the bible is no more selfevident than is that of the infallibility of the pope if the former is held by faith then the latter may be if the latter is 9 to be accepted or rejected by private judgment why not the former even if the bible could be proved anywhere to assert its own infallibility the value of that selfassertion to those who dispute the point is not obvious on the other hand if the infallibility of the bible was rested on that of a primitive church the admission that the church was formerly infallible was awkward in the extreme for those who denied its present infallibility moreover no sooner was the protestant principle applied to practice than it became evident that even an infallible text when manipulated by private judgment will impartially countenance contradictory deductions and furnish forth creeds and confessions as diverse as the quality and the information of the intellects which exercise and the prejudices and passions which sway such judgments every sect confident in the derivative infallibility of its wiredrawing of infallible materials was ready to supply its contingent of martyrs and to enable history once more to illustrate the truth that steadfastness under persecution says much for the sincerity and still more for the tenacity of the believer but very little for the objective truth of that which he believes no martyrs have sealed their faith with their blood more steadfastly than the anabaptists  last but not least the protestant principle contained within itself the germs of the destruction of the finality which the lutheran calvinistic and other protestant churches fondly imagined they had reached since their creeds were professedly based 10 on the canonical scriptures it followed that in the long run whoso settled the canon defined the creed if the private judgment of luther might legitimately conclude that the epistle of james was contemptible while the epistles of paul contained the very essence of christianity it must be permissible for some other private judgment on as good or as bad grounds to reverse these conclusions the critical process which excluded the apocrypha could not be barred at any rate by people who rejected the authority of the church from extending its operations to daniel the canticles and ecclesiastes nor having got so far was it easy to allege any good ground for staying the further progress of criticism in fact the logical development of protestantism could not fail to lay the authority of the scriptures at the feet of reason and in the hands of latitudinarian and rationalistic theologians the despotism of the bible was rapidly converted into an extremely limited monarchy treated with as much respect as ever the sphere of its practical authority was minimised and its decrees were valid only so far as they were countersigned by common sense the responsible minister  the champions of protestantism are much given to glorify the reformation of the sixteenth century as the emancipation of reason but it may be doubted if their contention has any solid ground while there is a good deal of evidence to show that aspirations after intellectual freedom had nothing whatever to do with the movement dante who struck the papacy 11 as hard blows as wicliff wicliff himself and luther himself when they began their work were far enough from any intention of meddling with even the most irrational of the dogmas of mediæval supernaturalism from wicliff to socinus or even to münzer rothmann and john of leyden i fail to find a trace of any desire to set reason free the most that can be discovered is a proposal to change masters from being the slave of the papacy the intellect was to become the serf of the bible or to speak more accurately of somebodys interpretation of the bible which rapidly shifting its attitude from the humility of a private judgment to the arrogant cæsaropapistry of a stateenforced creed had no more hesitation about forcibly extinguishing opponent private judgments and judges than had the oldfashioned pontiffpapistry  it was the iniquities and not the irrationalities of the papal system that lay at the bottom of the revolt of the laity which was essentially an attempt to shake off the intolerable burden of certain practical deductions from a supernaturalism in which everybody in principle acquiesced what was the gain to intellectual freedom of abolishing transubstantiation image worship indulgences ecclesiastical infallibility if consubstantiation realunreal presence mystifications the bibliolatry the innerlight pretensions and the demonology which are fruits of the same supernaturalistic tree remained in enjoyment of the spiritual and temporal support of a new infallibility one does not free a 12 prisoner by merely scraping away the rust from his shackles  it will be asked perhaps was not the reformation one of the products of that great outbreak of manysided free mental activity included under the general head of the renascence melanchthon ulrich von hutten beza were they not all humanists was not the archhumanist erasmus fautorinchief of the reformation until he got frightened and basely deserted it  from the language of protestant historians it would seem that they often forget that reformation and protestantism are by no means convertible terms there were plenty of sincere and indeed zealous reformers before during and after the birth and growth of protestantism who would have nothing to do with it assuredly the rejuvenescence of science and of art the widening of the field of nature by geographical and astronomical discovery the revelation of the noble ideals of antique literature by the revival of classical learning the stir of thought throughout all classes of society by the printers work loosened traditional bonds and weakened the hold of mediæval supernaturalism in the interests of liberal culture and of national welfare the humanists were eager to lend a hand to anything which tended to the discomfiture of their sworn enemies the monks and they willingly supported every movement in the direction of weakening ecclesiastical interference with civil life but the bond of a common enemy was the only real tie between the humanist 13 and the protestant their alliance was bound to be of short duration and sooner or later to be replaced by internecine warfare the goal of the humanists whether they were aware of it or not was the attainment of the complete intellectual freedom of the antique philosopher than which nothing could be more abhorrent to a luther a calvin a beza or a zwingli  the key to the comprehension of the conduct of erasmus seems to me to lie in the clear apprehension of this fact that he was a man of many weaknesses may be true in fact he was quite aware of them and professed himself no hero but he never deserted that reformatory movement which he originally contemplated and it was impossible he should have deserted the specifically protestant reformation in which he never took part he was essentially a theological whig to whom radicalism was as hateful as it is to all whigs or to borrow a still more appropriate comparison from modern times a broad churchman who refused to enlist with either the high church or the low church zealots and paid the penalty of being called coward timeserver and traitor by both yet really there is a good deal in his pathetic remonstrance that he does not see why he is bound to become a martyr for that in which he does not believe and a fair consideration of the circumstances and the consequences of the protestant reformation seems to me to go a long way towards justifying the course he adopted  few men had better means of being acquainted 14 with the condition of europe none could be more competent to gauge the intellectual shallowness and selfcontradiction of the protestant criticism of catholic doctrine and to estimate at its proper value the fond imagination that the waters let out by the renascence would come to rest amidst the blind alleys of the new ecclesiasticism the bastard whilom poor student and monk become the familiar of bishops and princes at home in all grades of society could not fail to be aware of the gravity of the social position of the dangers imminent from the profligacy and indifference of the ruling classes no less than from the anarchical tendencies of the people who groaned under their oppression the wanderer who had lived in germany in france in england in italy and who counted many of the best and most influential men in each country among his friends was not likely to estimate wrongly the enormous forces which were still at the command of the papacy bad as the churchmen might be the statesmen were worse and a person of far more sanguine temperament than erasmus might have seen no hope for the future except in gradually freeing the ubiquitous organisation of the church from the corruptions which alone as he imagined prevented it from being as beneficent as it was powerful the broad tolerance of the scholar and man of the world might well be revolted by the ruffianism however genial of one great light of protestantism and the narrow fanaticism however learned and logical of others and to a cautious thinker by whom whatever his shortcomings the 15 ethical ideal of the christian evangel was sincerely prized it really was a fair question whether it was worth while to bring about a political and social deluge the end of which no mortal could foresee for the purpose of setting up lutheran zwinglian and other peterkins in the place of the actual claimant to the reversion of the spiritual wealth of the galilean fisherman  let us suppose that at the beginning of the lutheran and zwinglian movement a vision of its immediate consequences had been granted to erasmus imagine that to the spectre of the fierce outbreak of anabaptist communism which opened the apocalypse had succeeded in shadowy procession the reign of terror and of spoliation in england with the judicial murders of his friends more and fisher the bitter tyranny of evangelistic clericalism in geneva and in scotland the long agony of religious wars persecutions and massacres which devastated france and reduced germany almost to savagery finishing with the spectacle of lutheranism in its native country sunk into mere dead erastian formalism before it was a century old while jesuitry triumphed over protestantism in threefourths of europe bringing in its train a recrudescence of all the corruptions erasmus and his friends sought to abolish might not he have quite honestly thought this a somewhat too heavy price to pay for protestantism more especially since no one was in a better position than himself to know how little the dogmatic foundation of the new confessions was able to bear the light 16 which the inevitable progress of humanistic criticism would throw upon them as the wiser of his contemporaries saw erasmus was at heart neither protestant nor papist but an independent christian and as the wiser of his modern biographers have discerned he was the precursor not of sixteenth century reform but of eighteenth century enlightenment a sort of broadchurch voltaire who held by his independent christianity as stoutly as voltaire by his deism  in fact the stream of the renascence which bore erasmus along left protestantism stranded amidst the mudbanks of its articles and creeds while its true course became visible to all men two centuries later by this time those in whom the movement of the renascence was incarnate became aware what spirit they were of and they attacked supernaturalism in its biblical stronghold defended by protestants and romanists with equal zeal in the eyes of the patriarch ultramontanism jansenism and calvinism were merely three persons of the one infâme which it was the object of his life to crush if he hated one more than another it was probably the last while dholbach and the extreme left of the freethinking host were disposed to show no more mercy to deism and pantheism  the sceptical insurrection of the eighteenth century made a terrific noise and frightened not a few worthy people out of their wits but cool judges might have foreseen at the outset that the efforts of the later rebels were no more likely 17 than those of the earlier to furnish permanent restingplaces for the spirit of scientific inquiry however worthy of admiration may be the acuteness the commonsense the wit the broad humanity which abound in the writings of the best of the freethinkers there is rarely much to be said for their work as an example of the adequate treatment of a grave and difficult investigation i do not think any impartial judge will assert that from this point of view they are much better than their adversaries it must be admitted that they share to the full the fatal weakness of à priori philosophising no less than the moral frivolity common to their age while a singular want of appreciation of history as the record of the moral and social evolution of the human race permitted them to resort to preposterous theories of imposture in order to account for the religious phenomena which are natural products of that evolution  for the most part the romanist and protestant adversaries of the freethinkers met them with arguments no better than their own and with vituperation so far inferior that it lacked the wit but one great christian apologist fairly captured the guns of the freethinking array and turned their batteries upon themselves speculative infidelity of the eighteenth century type was mortally wounded by the analogy while the progress of the historical and psychological sciences brought to light the important part played by the mythopoeic faculty and by demonstrating the extreme readiness of men 18 to impose upon themselves rendered the calling in of sacerdotal cooperation in most cases a superfluity  again as in the fourteenth and the sixteenth centuries social and political influences came into play the freethinking philosophes who objected to rousseaus sentimental religiosity almost as much as they did to linfâme were credited with the responsibility for all the evil deeds of rousseaus jacobin disciples with about as much justification as wicliff was held responsible for the peasants revolt or luther for the bauernkrieg in england though our ancien régime was not altogether lovely the social edifice was never in such a bad way as in france it was still capable of being repaired and our forefathers very wisely preferred to wait until that operation could be safely performed rather than pull it all down about their ears in order to build a philosophically planned house on brandnew speculative foundations under these circumstances it is not wonderful that in this country practical men preferred the gospel of wesley and whitfield to that of jean jacques while enough of the old leaven of puritanism remained to ensure the favour and support of a large number of religious men to a revival of evangelical supernaturalism thus by degrees the freethinking or the indifference prevalent among us in the first half of the eighteenth century was replaced by a strong supernaturalistic reaction which submerged the work of the freethinkers and even seemed for a time to have arrested the naturalistic movement of 19 which that work was an imperfect indication yet like lollardry four centuries earlier freethought merely took to running underground safe sooner or later to return to the surface    my memory unfortunately carries me back to the fourth decade of the nineteenth century when the evangelical flood had a little abated and the tops of certain mountains were soon to appear chiefly in the neighbourhood of oxford but when nevertheless bibliolatry was rampant when church and chapel alike proclaimed as the oracles of god the crude assumptions of the worst informed and in natural sequence the most presumptuously bigoted of all theological schools  in accordance with promises made on my behalf but certainly without my authorisation i was very early taken to hear sermons in the vulgar tongue and vulgar enough often was the tongue in which some preacher ignorant alike of literature of history of science and even of theology outside that patronised by his own narrow school poured forth from the safe entrenchment of the pulpit invectives against those who deviated from his notion of orthodoxy from dark allusions to sceptics and infidels i became aware of the existence of people who trusted in carnal reason who audaciously doubted that the world was made in six natural days or that the deluge was universal perhaps even went so far as to question the literal accuracy of the story of eves temptation or of 20 balaams ass and from the horror of the tones in which they were mentioned i should have been justified in drawing the conclusion that these rash men belonged to the criminal classes at the same time those who were more directly responsible for providing me with the knowledge essential to the right guidance of life and who sincerely desired to do so imagined they were discharging that most sacred duty by impressing upon my childish mind the necessity on pain of reprobation in this world and damnation in the next of accepting in the strict and literal sense every statement contained in the protestant bible i was told to believe and i did believe that doubt about any of them was a sin not less reprehensible than a moral delict i suppose that out of a thousand of my contemporaries nine hundred at least had their minds systematically warped and poisoned in the name of the god of truth by like discipline i am sure that even a score of years later those who ventured to question the exact historical accuracy of any part of the old testament and à fortiori of the gospels had to expect a pitiless shower of verbal missiles to say nothing of the other disagreeable consequences which visit those who in any way run counter to that chaos of prejudices called public opinion  my recollections of this time have recently been revived by the perusal of a remarkable document2 21 signed by as many as thirtyeight out of the twenty odd thousand clergymen of the established church it does not appear that the signataries are officially accredited spokesmen of the ecclesiastical corporation to which they belong but i feel bound to take their word for it that they are stewards of the lord who have received the holy ghost and therefore to accept this memorial as evidence that though the evangelicism of my early days may be deposed from its place of power though so many of the colleagues of the thirtyeight even repudiate the title of protestants yet the green bay tree of bibliolatry flourishes as it did sixty years ago and as in those good old times whoso refuses to offer incense to the idol is held to be guilty of a dishonour to god imperilling his salvation  it is to the credit of the perspicacity of the memorialists that they discern the real nature of the controverted question of the age they are awake to the unquestionable fact that if scripture has been discovered not to be worthy of unquestioning belief faith in the supernatural itself is so far undermined and i may congratulate myself upon such weighty confirmation of an opinion in which i have had the fortune to anticipate them but whether it is more to the credit of the courage than to the intelligence of the thirtyeight that they should go on to proclaim that the canonical scriptures of the old and new testaments declare incontrovertibly the actual historical truth in all records both of past events and of the delivery of predictions 22 to be thereafter fulfilled must be left to the coming generation to decide  the interest which attaches to this singular document will i think be based by most thinking men not upon what it is but upon that of which it is a sign it is an open secret that the memorial is put forth as a counterblast to a manifestation of opinion of a contrary character on the part of certain members of the same ecclesiastical body who therefore have as i suppose an equal right to declare themselves stewards of the lord and recipients of the holy ghost in fact the stream of tendency towards naturalism the course of which i have briefly traced has of late years flowed so strongly that even the churches have begun i dare not say to drift but at any rate to swing at their moorings within the pale of the anglican establishment i venture to doubt whether at this moment there are as many thoroughgoing defenders of plenary inspiration as there were timid questioners of that doctrine half a century ago commentaries sanctioned by the highest authority give up the actual historical truth of the cosmogonical and diluvial narratives university professors of deservedly high repute accept the critical decision that the hexateuch is a compilation in which the share of moses either as author or as editor is not quite so clearly demonstrable as it might be highly placed divines tell us that the preabrahamic scripture narratives may be ignored that the book of daniel may be regarded as a patriotic romance of 23 the second century bc that the words of the writer of the fourth gospel are not always to be distinguished from those which he puts into the mouth of jesus conservative but conscientious revisers decide that whole passages some of dogmatic and some of ethical importance are interpolations an uneasy sense of the weakness of the dogma of biblical infallibility seems to be at the bottom of a prevailing tendency once more to substitute the authority of the church for that of the bible in my old age it has happened to me to be taken to task for regarding christianity as a religion of a book as gravely as in my youth i should have been reprehended for doubting that proposition it is a no less interesting symptom that the state church seems more and more anxious to repudiate all complicity with the principles of the protestant reformation and to call itself anglocatholic inspiration deprived of its old intelligible sense is watered down into a mystification the scriptures are indeed inspired but they contain a wholly undefined and indefinable human element and this unfortunate intruder is converted into a sort of biblical whipping boy whatsoever scientific investigation historical or physical proves to be erroneous the human element bears the blame while the divine inspiration of such statements as by their nature are out of reach of proof or disproof is still asserted with all the vigour inspired by conscious safety from attack though the proposal to treat the bible like any other book which caused so much 24 scandal forty years ago may not yet be generally accepted and though bishop colensos criticisms may still lie formally under ecclesiastical ban yet the church has not wholly turned a deaf ear to the voice of the scientific tempter and many a coy divine while crying i will neer consent has consented to the proposals of that scientific criticism which the memorialists renounce and denounce  a humble layman to whom it would seem the height of presumption to assume even the unconsidered dignity of a steward of science may well find this conflict of apparently equal ecclesiastical authorities perplexingsuggestive indeed of the wisdom of postponing attention to either until the question of precedence between them is settled and this course will probably appear the more advisable the more closely the fundamental position of the memorialists is examined  no opinion of the fact or form of divine revelation founded on literary criticism and i suppose i may add historical or physical criticism of the scriptures themselves can be admitted to interfere with the traditionary testimony of the church when that has been once ascertained and verified by appeal to antiquity3  grant that it is the traditionary testimony of the church which guarantees the canonicity of each and all of the books of the old and new testaments grant also that canonicity means infallibility yet according to the thirtyeight this traditionary 25 testimony has to be ascertained and verified by appeal to antiquity but ascertainment and verification are purely intellectual processes which must be conducted according to the strict rules of scientific investigation or be selfconvicted of worthlessness moreover before we can set about the appeal to antiquity the exact sense of that usefully vague term must be defined by similar means antiquity may include any number of centuries great or small and whether antiquity is to comprise the council of trent or to stop a little beyond that of nicæa or to come to an end in the time of irenæus or in that of justin martyr are knotty questions which can be decided if at all only by those critical methods which the signataries treat so cavalierly and yet the decision of these questions is fundamental for as the limits of the canonical scriptures vary so may the dogmas deduced from them require modification christianity is one thing if the fourth gospel the epistle to the hebrews the pastoral epistles and the apocalypse are canonical and by the hypothesis infallibly true and another thing if they are not as i have already said whoso defines the canon defines the creed  now it is quite certain with respect to some of these books such as the apocalypse and the epistle to the hebrews that the eastern and the western church differed in opinion for centuries and yet neither the one branch nor the other can have considered its judgment infallible since they eventually agreed to a transaction by which each gave up its 26 objection to the book patronised by the other moreover the fathers argue in a more or less rational manner about the canonicity of this or that book and are by no means above producing evidence internal and external in favour of the opinions they advocate in fact imperfect as their conceptions of scientific method may be they not unfrequently used it to the best of their ability thus it would appear that though science like nature may be driven out with a fork ecclesiastical or other yet she surely comes back again the appeal to antiquity is in fact an appeal to science first to define what antiquity is secondly to determine what antiquity so defined says about canonicity thirdly to prove that canonicity means infallibility and when science largely in the shape of the abhorred criticism has done this and has shown that antiquity used her own methods however clumsily and imperfectly she naturally turns round upon the appealers to antiquity and demands that they should show cause why in these days science should not resume the work the ancients did so imperfectly and carry it out efficiently  but no such cause can be shown if antiquity permitted eusebius origen tertullian irenæus to argue for the reception of this book into the canon and the rejection of that upon rational grounds antiquity admitted the whole principle of modern criticism if irenæus produces ridiculous reasons for limiting the gospels to four it was open to any one else to produce good reasons if he had them for cutting them down to three or increasing them to 27 five if the eastern branch of the church had a right to reject the apocalypse and accept the epistle to the hebrews and the western an equal right to accept the apocalypse and reject the epistle down to the fourth century any other branch would have an equal right on cause shown to reject both or as the catholic church afterwards actually did to accept both  thus i cannot but think that the thirtyeight are hoist with their own petard their appeal to antiquity turns out to be nothing but a roundabout way of appealing to the tribunal the jurisdiction of which they affect to deny having rested the world of christian supernaturalism on the elephant of biblical infallibility and furnished the elephant with standing ground on the tortoise of antiquity they like their famous hindoo analogue have been content to look no further and have thereby been spared the horror of discovering that the tortoise rests on a grievously fragile construction to a great extent the work of that very intellectual operation which they anathematise and repudiate  moreover there is another point to be considered it is of course true that a christian church whether the christian church or not depends on the connotation of the definite article existed before the christian scriptures and that the infallibility of these depends upon the infallibility of the judgment of the persons who selected the books of which they are composed out of the mass of literature current among the early christians the logical acumen of augustine showed him that the authority of the gospel he preached 28 must rest on that of the church to which he belonged4 but it is no less true that the hebrew and the septuagint versions of most if not all of the old testament books existed before the birth of jesus of nazareth and that their divine authority is presupposed by and therefore can hardly depend upon the religious body constituted by his disciples as everybody knows the very conception of a christ is purely jewish the validity of the argument from the messianic prophecies vanishes unless their infallible authority is granted and as a matter of fact whether we turn to the gospels the epistles or the writings of the early apologists the jewish scriptures are recognised as the highest court of appeal of the christian  the proposal to cite christian antiquity as a witness to the infallibility of the old testament when its own claims to authority vanish if certain propositions contained in the old testament are erroneous hardly satisfies the requirements of lay logic it is as if a claimant to be sole legatee under another kind of testament should offer his assertion as sufficient evidence of the validity of the will and even were not such a circular or rather rotatory argument that the infallibility of the bible is testified by the infallible church whose infallibility is testified by the infallible bible too absurd for serious consideration it remains permissible to ask where and when the church during the period of its infallibility as 29 limited by anglican dogmatic necessities has officially decreed the actual historical truth of all records in the old testament was augustine heretical when he denied the actual historical truth of the record of the creation father suarez standing on later roman tradition may have a right to declare that he was but it does not lie in the mouth of those who limit their appeal to that early antiquity in which augustine played so great a part to say so    among the watchers of the course of the world of thought some view with delight and some with horror the recrudescence of supernaturalism which manifests itself among us in shapes ranged along the whole flight of steps which in this case separates the sublime from the ridiculousfrom neocatholicism and innerlight mysticism at the top to unclean things not worthy of mention in the same breath at the bottom in my poor opinion the importance of these manifestations is often greatly overestimated the extant forms of supernaturalism have deep roots in human nature and will undoubtedly die hard but in these latter days they have to cope with an enemy whose full strength is only just beginning to be put out and whose forces gathering strength year by year are hemming them round on every side this enemy is science in the acceptation of systematised natural knowledge which during the last two centuries has extended those methods of investigation the worth of which is confirmed by daily appeal to nature to every 30 region in which the supernatural has hitherto been recognised  when scientific historical criticism reduced the annals of heroic greece and of regal rome to the level of fables when the unity of authorship of the iliad was successfully assailed by scientific literary criticism when scientific physical criticism after exploding the geocentric theory of the universe and reducing the solar system itself to one of millions of groups of like cosmic specks circling at unimaginable distances from one another through infinite space showed the supernaturalistic theories of the duration of the earth and of life upon it to be as inadequate as those of its relative dimensions and importance had been it needed no prophetic gift to see that sooner or later the jewish and the early christian records would be treated in the same manner that the authorship of the hexateuch and of the gospels would be as severely tested and that the evidence in favour of the veracity of many of the statements found in the scriptures would have to be strong indeed if they were to be opposed to the conclusions of physical science in point of fact so far as i can discover no one competent to judge of the evidential strength of these conclusions ventures now to say that the biblical accounts of the creation and of the deluge are true in the natural sense of the words of the narratives the most the modern reconciler ventures upon is to affirm that some quite different sense may be put upon the words and that this nonnatural sense may with a little trouble be manipulated 31 into some sort of noncontradiction of scientific truth  my purpose in the essay xvi which treats of the narrative of the deluge was to prove by physical criticism that no such event as that described ever took place to exhibit the untrustworthy character of the narrative demonstrated by literary criticism and finally to account for its origin by producing a form of those ancient legends of pagan chaldæa from which the biblical compilation is manifestly derived i have yet to learn that the main propositions of this essay can be seriously challenged  in the essays ii iii on the narrative of the creation i have endeavoured to controvert the assertion that modern science supports either the interpretation put upon it by mr gladstone or any interpretation which is compatible with the general sense of the narrative quite apart from particular details the first chapter of genesis teaches the supernatural creation of the present forms of life modern science teaches that they have come about by evolution the first chapter of genesis teaches the successive originfirstly of all the plants secondly of all the aquatic and aerial animals thirdly of all the terrestrial animals which now existduring distinct intervals of time modern science teaches that throughout all the duration of an immensely long past so far as we have any adequate knowledge of it that is as far back as the silurian epoch plants aquatic aerial and terrestrial animals have 32 coexisted that the earliest known are unlike those which at present exist and that the modern species have come into existence as the last terms of a series the members of which have appeared one after another thus far from confirming the account in genesis the results of modern science so far as they go are in principle as in detail hopelessly discordant with it  yet if the pretensions to infallibility set up not by the ancient hebrew writings themselves but by the ecclesiastical champions and friends from whom they may well pray to be delivered thus shatter themselves against the rock of natural knowledge in respect of the two most important of all events the origin of things and the palingenesis of terrestrial life what historical credit dare any serious thinker attach to the narratives of the fabrication of eve of the fall of the commerce between the bene elohim and the daughters of men which lie between the creational and the diluvial legends and if these are to lose all historical worth what becomes of the infallibility of those who according to the later scriptures have accepted them argued from them and staked farreaching dogmatic conclusions upon their historical accuracy  it is the merest ostrich policy for contemporary ecclesiasticism to try to hide its hexateuchal headin the hope that the inseparable connection of its body with preabrahamic legends may be overlooked the question will still be asked if the first nine chapters of the pentateuch are unhistorical how is 33 the historical accuracy of the remainder to be guaranteed what more intrinsic claim has the story of the exodus than that of the deluge to belief if god did not walk in the garden of eden how can we be assured that he spoke from sinai    in some other of the following essays ix x xi xii xiv xv i have endeavoured to show that sober and wellfounded physical and literary criticism plays no less havoc with the doctrine that the canonical scriptures of the new testament declare incontrovertibly the actual historical truth in all records we are told that the gospels contain a true revelation of the spiritual worlda proposition which in one sense of the word spiritual i should not think it necessary to dispute but when it is taken to signify that everything we are told about the world of spirits in these books is infallibly true that we are bound to accept the demonology which constitutes an inseparable part of their teaching and to profess belief in a supernaturalism as gross as that of any primitive peopleit is at any rate permissible to ask why science may be unable to define the limits of possibility but it cannot escape from the moral obligation to weigh the evidence in favour of any alleged wonderful occurrence and i have endeavoured to show that the evidence for the gadarene miracle is altogether worthless we have simply three partially discrepant versions of a story about the primitive form the origin and the authority for which we know absolutely nothing but the 34 evidence in favour of the gadarene miracle is as good as that for any other  elsewhere i have pointed out that it is utterly beside the mark to declaim against these conclusions on the ground of their asserted tendency to deprive mankind of the consolations of the christian faith and to destroy the foundations of morality still less to brand them with the questionbegging vituperative appellation of infidelity the point is not whether they are wicked but whether from the point of view of scientific method they are irrefragably true if they are they will be accepted in time whether they are wicked or not wicked nature so far as we have been able to attain to any insight into her ways recks little about consolation and makes for righteousness by very roundabout paths and at any rate whatever may be possible for other people it is becoming less and less possible for the man who puts his faith in scientific methods of ascertaining truth and is accustomed to have that faith justified by daily experience to be consciously false to his principle in any matter but the number of such men driven into the use of scientific methods of inquiry and taught to trust them by their education their daily professional and business needs is increasing and will continually increase the phraseology of supernaturalism may remain on mens lips but in practice they are naturalists the magistrate who listens with devout attention to the precept thou shalt not suffer a witch to live on sunday on monday dismisses as intrinsically absurd a charge 35 of bewitching a cow brought against some old woman the superintendent of a lunatic asylum who substituted exorcism for rational modes of treatment would have but a short tenure of office even parish clerks doubt the utility of prayers for rain so long as the wind is in the east and an outbreak of pestilence sends men not to the churches but to the drains in spite of prayers for the success of our arms and te deums for victory our real faith is in big battalions and keeping our powder dry in knowledge of the science of warfare in energy courage and discipline in these as in all other practical affairs we act on the aphorism laborare est orare we admit that intelligent work is the only acceptable worship and that whether there be a supernature or not our business is with nature    it is important to note that the principle of the scientific naturalism of the latter half of the nineteenth century in which the intellectual movement of the renascence has culminated and which was first clearly formulated by descartes leads not to the denial of the existence of any supernature5 but simply to the denial of the validity of the evidence adduced in favour of this or of that extant form of supernaturalism  36  looking at the matter from the most rigidly scientific point of view the assumption that amidst the myriads of worlds scattered through endless space there can be no intelligence as much greater than mans as his is greater than a blackbeetles no being endowed with powers of influencing the course of nature as much greater than his as his is greater than a snails seems to me not merely baseless but impertinent without stepping beyond the analogy of that which is known it is easy to people the cosmos with entities in ascending scale until we reach something practically indistinguishable from omnipotence omnipresence and omniscience if our intelligence can in some matters surely reproduce the past of thousands of years ago and anticipate the future thousands of years hence it is clearly within the limits of possibility that some greater intellect even of the same order may be able to mirror the whole past and the whole future if the universe is penetrated by a medium of such a nature that a magnetic needle on the earth answers to a commotion in the sun an omnipresent agent is also conceivable if our insignificant knowledge gives us some influence over events practical omniscience may confer indefinably greater power finally if evidence that a thing may be were equivalent to proof that it is analogy might justify the construction of a naturalistic theology and demonology not less wonderful than the current supernatural just as it might justify the peopling of mars or of jupiter with living forms to which terrestrial biology offers no 37 parallel until human life is longer and the duties of the present press less heavily i do not think that wise men will occupy themselves with jovian or martian natural history and they will probably agree to a verdict of not proven in respect of naturalistic theology taking refuge in that agnostic confession which appears to me to be the only position for people who object to say that they know what they are quite aware they do not know as to the interests of morality i am disposed to think that if mankind could be got to act up to this last principle in every relation of life a reformation would be effected such as the world has not yet seen an approximation to the millennium such as no supernaturalistic religion has ever yet succeeded or seems likely ever to succeed in effecting    i have hitherto dwelt upon scientific naturalism chiefly in its critical and destructive aspect but the present incarnation of the spirit of the renascence differs from its predecessor in the eighteenth century in that it builds up as well as pulls down  that of which it has laid the foundation of which it is already raising the superstructure is the doctrine of evolution but so many strange misconceptions are current about this doctrineit is attacked on such false grounds by its enemies and made to cover so much that is disputable by some of its friends that i think it well to define as clearly as i can what i do not and what i do understand by the doctrine 38  i have nothing to say to any philosophy of evolution attempts to construct such a philosophy may be as useful nay even as admirable as was the attempt of descartes to get at a theory of the universe by the same à priori road but in my judgment they are as premature nor for this purpose have i to do with any theory of the origin of species much as i value that which is known as the darwinian theory that the doctrine of natural selection presupposes evolution is quite true but it is not true that evolution necessarily implies natural selection in fact evolution might conceivably have taken place without the development of groups possessing the characters of species  for me the doctrine of evolution is no speculation but a generalisation of certain facts which may be observed by any one who will take the necessary trouble these facts are those which are classed by biologists under the heads of embryology and of palæontology embryology proves that every higher form of individual life becomes what it is by a process of gradual differentiation from an extremely low form palæontology proves in some cases and renders probable in all that the oldest types of a group are the lowest and that they have been followed by a gradual succession of more and more differentiated forms it is simply a fact that evolution of the individual animal and plant is taking place as a natural process in millions and millions of cases every day it is a fact that the species which have succeeded one another in the past do in many 39 cases present just those morphological relations which they must possess if they had proceeded one from the other by an analogous process of evolution  the alternative presented therefore is either the forms of one and the same typesay eg that of the horse tribe6arose successively but independently of one another at intervals during myriads of years or the later forms are modified descendants of the earlier and the latter supposition is so vastly more probable than the former that rational men will adopt it unless satisfactory evidence to the contrary can be produced the objection sometimes put forward that no one yet professes to have seen one species pass into another comes oddly from those who believe that mankind are all descended from adam has any one then yet seen the production of negroes from a white stock or vice versa moreover is it absolutely necessary to have watched every step of the progress of a planet to be justified in concluding that it really does go round the sun if so astronomy is in a bad way  i do not for a moment presume to suggest that some one far better acquainted than i am with astronomy and physics or that a master of the new chemistry with its extraordinary revelations or that a student of the development of human society of language and of religions may not find a sufficient foundation for the doctrine of evolution in these several regions 40 on the contrary i rejoice to see that scientific investigation in all directions is tending to the same result and it may well be that it is only my long occupation with biological matters that leads me to feel safer among them than anywhere else be that as it may i take my stand on the facts of embryology and of palæontology and i hold that our present knowledge of these facts is sufficiently thorough and extensive to justify the assertion that all future philosophical and theological speculations will have to accommodate themselves to some such common body of established truths as the following  1 plants and animals have existed on our planet for many hundred thousand probably millions of years during this time their forms or species have undergone a succession of changes which eventually gave rise to the species which constitute the present living population of the earth there is no evidence nor any reason to suspect that this secular process of evolution is other than a part of the ordinary course of nature there is no more ground for imagining the occurrence of supernatural intervention at any moment in the development of species in the past than there is for supposing such intervention to take place at any moment in the development of an individual animal or plant at the present day  2 at present every individual animal or plant commences its existence as an organism of extremely simple anatomical structure and it acquires all the complexity it ultimately possesses by gradual 41 differentiation into parts of various structure and function when a series of specific forms of the same type extending over a long period of past time is examined the relation between the earlier and the later forms is analogous to that between earlier and later stages of individual development therefore it is a probable conclusion that if we could follow living beings back to their earliest states we should find them to present forms similar to those of the individual germ or what comes to the same thing of those lowest known organisms which stand upon the boundary line between plants and animals at present our knowledge of the ancient living world stops very far short of this point  3 it is generally agreed and there is certainly no evidence to the contrary that all plants are devoid of consciousness that they neither feel desire nor think it is conceivable that the evolution of the primordial living substance should have taken place only along the plant line in that case the result might have been a wealth of vegetable life as great perhaps as varied as at present though certainly widely different from the present flora in the evolution of which animals have played so great a part but the living world thus constituted would be simply an admirable piece of unconscious machinery the working out of which lay potentially in its primitive composition pleasure and pain would have no place in it it would be a veritable garden of eden without any tree of the knowledge of good and evil the question of the moral government of such a world 42 could no more be asked than we could reasonably seek for a moral purpose in a kaleidoscope  4 how far down the scale of animal life the phenomena of consciousness are manifested it is impossible to say no one doubts their presence in his fellowmen and unless any strict cartesians are left no one doubts that mammals and birds are to be reckoned creatures that have feelings analogous to our smell taste sight hearing touch pleasure and pain for my own part i should be disposed to extend this analogical judgment a good deal further on the other hand if the lowest forms of plants are to be denied consciousness i do not see on what ground it is to be ascribed to the lowest animals i find it hard to believe that an infusory animalcule a foraminifer or a freshwater polype is capable of feeling and in spite of shakspere i have doubts about the great sensitiveness of the poor beetle that we tread upon the question is equally perplexing when we turn to the stages of development of the individual granted a fowl feels that the chick just hatched feels that the chick when it chirps within the egg may possibly feel what is to be said of it on the fifth day when the bird is there but with all its tissues nascent still more on the first day when it is nothing but a flat cellular disk i certainly cannot bring myself to believe that this disk feels yet if it does not there must be some time in the three weeks between the first day and the day of hatching when as a concomitant or a consequence of the attainment by the brain of 43 the chick of a certain stage of structural evolution consciousness makes its appearance i have frequently expressed my incapacity to understand the nature of the relation between consciousness and a certain anatomical tissue which is thus established by observation but the fact remains that so far as observation and experiment go they teach us that the psychical phenomena are dependent on the physical  in like manner if fishes insects scorpions and such animals as the pearly nautilus possess feeling then undoubtedly consciousness was present in the world as far back as the silurian epoch but if the earliest animals were similar to our rhizopods and monads there must have been some time between the much earlier epoch in which they constituted the whole animal population and the silurian in which feeling dawned in consequence of the organism having reached the stage of evolution on which it depends  5 consciousness has various forms which may be manifested independently of one another the feelings of light and colour of sound of touch though so often associated with those of pleasure and pain are by nature as entirely independent of them as is thinking an animal devoid of the feelings of pleasure and of pain may nevertheless exhibit all the effects of sensation and purposive action therefore it would be a justifiable hypothesis that long after organic evolution had attained to consciousness pleasure and pain were still absent such a world 44 would be without either happiness or misery no act could be punished and none could be rewarded and it could have no moral purpose  6 suppose for arguments sake that all mammals and birds are subjects of pleasure and pain then we may be certain that these forms of consciousness were in existence at the beginning of the mesozoic epoch from that time forth pleasure has been distributed without reference to merit and pain inflicted without reference to demerit throughout all but a mere fraction of the higher animals moreover the amount and the severity of the pain no less than the variety and acuteness of the pleasure have increased with every advance in the scale of evolution as suffering came into the world not in consequence of a fall but of a rise in the scale of being so every further rise has brought more suffering as the evidence stands it would appear that the sort of brain which characterises the highest mammals and which so far as we know is the indispensable condition of the highest sensibility did not come into existence before the tertiary epoch the primordial anthropoid was probably in this respect on much the same footing as his pithecoid kin like them he stood upon his natural rights gratified all his desires to the best of his ability and was as incapable of either right or wrong doing as they it would be as absurd as in their case to regard his pleasures any more than theirs as moral rewards and his pains any more than theirs as moral punishments 45  7 from the remotest ages of which we have any cognizance death has been the natural and apparently the necessary concomitant of life in our hypothetical world 3 inhabited by nothing but plants death must have very early resulted from the struggle for existence many of the crowd must have jostled one another out of the conditions on which life depends the occurrence of death as far back as we have any fossil record of life however needs not to be proved by such arguments for if there had been no death there would have been no fossil remains such as the great majority of those we meet with not only was there death in the world as far as the record of life takes us but ever since mammals and birds have been preyed upon by carnivorous animals there has been painful death inflicted by mechanisms specially adapted for inflicting it  8 those who are acquainted with the closeness of the structural relations between the human organisation and that of the mammals which come nearest to him on the one hand and with the palæontological history of such animals as horses and dogs on the other will not be disposed to question the origin of man from forms which stand in the same sort of relation to homo sapiens as hipparion does to equus i think it a conclusion fully justified by analogy that sooner or later we shall discover the remains of our less specialised primatic ancestors in the strata which have yielded the less specialised equine and canine quadrupeds at present fossil remains of men do not take us back further than the later 46 part of the quaternary epoch and as was to be expected they do not differ more from existing men than quaternary horses differ from existing horses still earlier we find traces of man in implements such as are used by the ruder savages at the present day later the remains of the palæolithic and neolithic conditions take us gradually from the savage state to the civilisations of egypt and of mycenæ though the true chronological order of the remains actually discovered may be uncertain  9 much has yet to be learned but at present natural knowledge affords no support to the notion that men have fallen from a higher to a lower state on the contrary everything points to a slow natural evolution which favoured by the surrounding conditions in such localities as the valleys of the yangtsekang the euphrates and the nile reached a relatively high pitch five or six thousand years ago while in many other regions the savage condition has persisted down to our day in all this vast lapse of time there is not a trace of the occurrence of any general destruction of the human race not the smallest indication that man has been treated on any other principles than the rest of the animal world  10 the results of the process of evolution in the case of man and in that of his more nearly allied contemporaries have been marvellously different yet it is easy to see that small primitive differences of a certain order must in the long run bring about a wide divergence of the human stock from the others 47 it is a reasonable supposition that in the earliest human organisms an improved brain a voice more capable of modulation and articulation limbs which lent themselves better to gesture a more perfect hand capable among other things of imitating form in plastic or other material were combined with the curiosity the mimetic tendency the strong family affection of the next lower group and that they were accompanied by exceptional length of life and a prolonged minority the last two peculiarities are obviously calculated to strengthen the family organisation and to give great weight to its educative influences the potentiality of language as the vocal symbol of thought lay in the faculty of modulating and articulating the voice the potentiality of writing as the visual symbol of thought lay in the hand that could draw and in the mimetic tendency which as we know was gratified by drawing as far back as the days of quaternary man with speech as the record in tradition of the experience of more than one generation with writing as the record of that of any number of generations the experience of the race tested and corrected generation after generation could be stored up and made the starting point for fresh progress having these perfectly natural factors of the evolutionary process in man before us it seems unnecessary to go further afield in search of others  11 that the doctrine of evolution implies a former state of innocence of mankind is quite true but as i have remarked it is the innocence of the ape and of 48 the tiger whose acts however they may run counter to the principles of morality it would be absurd to blame the lust of the one and the ferocity of the other are as much provided for in their organisation are as clear evidences of design as any other features that can be named  observation and experiment upon the phenomena of society soon taught men that in order to obtain the advantages of social existence certain rules must be observed morality commenced with society society is possible only upon the condition that the members of it shall surrender more or less of their individual freedom of action in primitive societies individual selfishness is a centrifugal force of such intensity that it is constantly bringing the social organisation to the verge of destruction hence the prominence of the positive rules of obedience to the elders of standing by the family or the tribe in all emergencies of fulfilling the religious rites nonobservance of which is conceived to damage it with the supernatural powers belief in whose existence is one of the earliest products of human thought and of the negative rules which restrain each from meddling with the life or property of another  12 the highest conceivable form of human society is that in which the desire to do what is best for the whole dominates and limits the action of every member of that society the more complex the social organisation the greater the number of acts from which each man must abstain if he desires to do that which is best for all thus the progressive 49 evolution of society means increasing restriction of individual freedom in certain directions  with the advance of civilisation and the growth of cities and of nations by the coalescence of families and of tribes the rules which constitute the common foundation of morality and of law became more numerous and complicated and the temptations to break or evade many of them stronger in the absence of a clear apprehension of the natural sanctions of these rules a supernatural sanction was assumed and imagination supplied the motives which reason was supposed to be incompetent to furnish religion at first independent of morality gradually took morality under its protection and the supernaturalists have ever since tried to persuade mankind that the existence of ethics is bound up with that of supernaturalism  i am not of that opinion but whether it is correct or otherwise it is very clear to me that as beelzebub is not to be cast out by the aid of beelzebub so morality is not to be established by immorality it is we are told the special peculiarity of the devil that he was a liar from the beginning if we set out in life with pretending to know that which we do not know with professing to accept for proof evidence which we are well aware is inadequate with wilfully shutting our eyes and our ears to facts which militate against this or that comfortable hypothesis we are assuredly doing our best to deserve the same character    i have not the presumption to imagine that in 50 spite of all my efforts errors may not have crept into these propositions but i am tolerably confident that time will prove them to be substantially correct and if they are so i confess i do not see how any extant supernaturalistic system can also claim exactness that they are irreconcilable with the biblical cosmogony anthropology and theodicy is obvious but they are no less inconsistent with the sentimental deism of the vicaire savoyard and his numerous modern progeny it is as impossible to my mind to suppose that the evolutionary process was set going with full foreknowledge of the result and yet with what we should understand by a purely benevolent intention as it is to imagine that the intention was purely malevolent and the prevalence of dualistic theories from the earliest times to the present daywhether in the shape of the doctrine of the inherently evil nature of matter of an ahriman of a hard and cruel demiurge of a diabolical prince of this world show how widely this difficulty has been felt  many seem to think that when it is admitted that the ancient literature contained in our bibles has no more claim to infallibility than any other ancient literature when it is proved that the israelites and their christian successors accepted a great many supernaturalistic theories and legends which have no better foundation than those of heathenism nothing remains to be done but to throw the bible aside as so much waste paper  i have always opposed this opinion it appears to 51 me that if there is anybody more objectionable than the orthodox bibliolater it is the heterodox philistine who can discover in a literature which in some respects has no superior nothing but a subject for scoffing and an occasion for the display of his conceited ignorance of the debt he owes to former generations  twentytwo years ago i pleaded for the use of the bible as an instrument of popular education and i venture to repeat what i then said  consider the great historical fact that for three centuries this book has been woven into the life of all that is best and noblest in english history that it has become the national epic of britain and is as familiar to gentle and simple from john o groats house to lands end as dante and tasso once were to the italians that it is written in the noblest and purest english and abounds in exquisite beauties of mere literary form and finally that it forbids the veriest hind who never left his village to be ignorant of the existence of other countries and other civilisations and of a great past stretching back to the furthest limits of the oldest nations in the world by the study of what other book could children be so much humanised and made to feel that each figure in that vast historical procession fills like themselves but a momentary space in the interval between the eternities and earns the blessings or the curses of all time according to its effort to do good and hate evil even as they also are earning their payment for their work7  52  at the same time i laid stress upon the necessity of placing such instruction in lay hands in the hope and belief that it would thus gradually accommodate itself to the coming changes of opinion that the theology and the legend would drop more and more out of sight while the perennially interesting historical literary and ethical contents would come more and more into view  i may add yet another claim of the bible to the respect and the attention of a democratic age throughout the history of the western world the scriptures jewish and christian have been the great instigators of revolt against the worst forms of clerical and political despotism the bible has been the magna charta of the poor and of the oppressed down to modern times no state has had a constitution in which the interests of the people are so largely taken into account in which the duties so much more than the privileges of rulers are insisted upon as that drawn up for israel in deuteronomy and in leviticus nowhere is the fundamental truth that the welfare of the state in the long run depends on the uprightness of the citizen so strongly laid down assuredly the bible talks no trash about the rights of man but it insists on the equality of duties on the liberty to bring about that righteousness which is somewhat different from struggling for rights on the fraternity of taking thought for ones neighbour as for oneself  so far as such equality liberty and fraternity are included under the democratic principles which assume the same names the bible is the most 53 democratic book in the world as such it began through the heretical sects to undermine the clericopolitical despotism of the middle ages almost as soon as it was formed in the eleventh century pope and king had as much as they could do to put down the albigenses and the waldenses in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the lollards and the hussites gave them still more trouble in the fourteenth and fifteenth from the sixteenth century onward the protestant sects have favoured political freedom in proportion to the degree in which they have refused to acknowledge any ultimate authority save that of the bible  but the enormous influence which has thus been exerted by the jewish and christian scriptures has had no necessary connection with cosmogonies demonologies and miraculous interferences their strength lies in their appeals not to the reason but to the ethical sense i do not say that even the highest biblical ideal is exclusive of others or needs no supplement but i do believe that the human race is not yet possibly may never be in a position to dispense with it                                        55  i  the rise and progress of palÆontology  that application of the sciences of biology and geology which is commonly known as palæontology took its origin in the mind of the first person who finding something like a shell or a bone naturally embedded in gravel or rock indulged in speculations upon the nature of this thing which he had dug outthis fossiland upon the causes which had brought it into such a position in this rudimentary form a high antiquity may safely be ascribed to palæontology inasmuch as we know that 500 years before the christian era the philosophic doctrines of xenophanes were influenced by his observations upon the fossil remains exposed in the quarries of syracuse from this time forth not only the philosophers but the poets the historians the geographers of antiquity occasionally refer to fossils and after the revival of learning lively controversies arose respecting their real nature but hardly more than two centuries have elapsed since this fundamental problem was first exhaustively treated it was only in the last century that the archæological value of fossilstheir importance i mean as records of the history of the earthwas fully 56 recognised the first adequate investigation of the fossil remains of any large group of vertebrated animals is to be found in cuviers recherches sur les ossemens fossiles completed in 1822 and so modern is stratigraphical palæontology that its founder william smith lived to receive the just recognition of his services by the award of the first wollaston medal in 1831  but although palæontology is a comparatively youthful scientific speciality the mass of materials with which it has to deal is already prodigious in the last fifty years the number of known fossil remains of invertebrated animals has been trebled or quadrupled the work of interpretation of vertebrate fossils the foundations of which were so solidly laid by cuvier was carried on with wonderful vigour and success by agassiz in switzerland by von meyer in germany and last but not least by owen in this country while in later years a multitude of workers have laboured in the same field in many groups of the animal kingdom the number of fossil forms already known is as great as that of the existing species in some cases it is much greater and there are entire orders of animals of the existence of which we should know nothing except for the evidence afforded by fossil remains with all this it may be safely assumed that at the present moment we are not acquainted with a tithe of the fossils which will sooner or later be discovered if we may judge by the profusion yielded within the last few years by the tertiary formations of north america there seems to be no limit to the 57 multitude of mammalian remains to be expected from that continent and analogy leads us to expect similar riches in eastern asia whenever the tertiary formations of that region are as carefully explored again we have as yet almost everything to learn respecting the terrestrial population of the mesozoic epochand it seems as if the western territories of the united states were about to prove as instructive in regard to this point as they have in respect of tertiary life my friend professor marsh informs me that within two years remains of more than 160 distinct individuals of mammals belonging to twenty species and nine genera have been found in a space not larger than the floor of a goodsized room while beds of the same age have yielded 300 reptiles varying in size from a length of 60 feet or 80 feet to the dimensions of a rabbit  the task which i have set myself tonight is to endeavour to lay before you as briefly as possible a sketch of the successive steps by which our present knowledge of the facts of palæontology and of those conclusions from them which are indisputable has been attained and i beg leave to remind you at the outset that in attempting to sketch the progress of a branch of knowledge to which innumerable labours have contributed my business is rather with generalisations than with details it is my object to mark the epochs of palæontology not to recount all the events of its history  that which i just now called the fundamental problem of palæontology the question which has to be 58 settled before any other can be profitably discussed is this what is the nature of fossils are they as the healthy common sense of the ancient greeks appears to have led them to assume without hesitation the remains of animals and plants or are they as was so generally maintained in the fifteenth sixteenth and seventeenth centuries mere figured stones portions of mineral matter which have assumed the forms of leaves and shells and bones just as those portions of mineral matter which we call crystals take on the form of regular geometrical solids or again are they as others thought the products of the germs of animals and of the seeds of plants which have lost their way as it were in the bowels of the earth and have achieved only an imperfect and abortive development it is easy to sneer at our ancestors for being disposed to reject the first in favour of one or other of the last two hypotheses but it is much more profitable to try to discover why they who were really not one whit less sensible persons than our excellent selves should have been led to entertain views which strike us as absurd the belief in what is erroneously called spontaneous generation that is to say in the development of living matter out of mineral matter apart from the agency of preexisting living matter as an ordinary occurrence at the present daywhich is still held by some of us was universally accepted as an obvious truth by them they could point to the arborescent forms assumed by hoarfrost and by sundry metallic minerals as evidence of the existence in nature of a plastic 59 force competent to enable inorganic matter to assume the form of organised bodies then as every one who is familiar with fossils knows they present innumerable gradations from shells and bones which exactly resemble the recent objects to masses of mere stone which however accurately they repeat the outward form of the organic body have nothing else in common with it and thence to mere traces and faint impressions in the continuous substance of the rock what we now know to be the results of the chemical changes which take place in the course of fossilisation by which mineral is substituted for organic substance might in the absence of such knowledge be fairly interpreted as the expression of a process of development in the opposite directionfrom the mineral to the organic moreover in an age when it would have seemed the most absurd of paradoxes to suggest that the general level of the sea is constant while that of the solid land fluctuates up and down through thousands of feet in a secular ground swell it may well have appeared far less hazardous to conceive that fossils are sports of nature than to accept the necessary alternative that all the inland regions and highlands in the rocks of which marine shells had been found had once been covered by the ocean it is not so surprising therefore as it may at first seem that although such men as leonardo da vinci and bernard palissy took just views of the nature of fossils the opinion of the majority of their contemporaries set strongly the other way nor even that error maintained itself long after the 60 scientific grounds of the true interpretation of fossils had been stated in a manner that left nothing to be desired in the latter half of the seventeenth century the person who rendered this good service to palæontology was nicolas steno professor of anatomy in florence though a dane by birth collectors of fossils at that day were familiar with certain bodies termed glossopetræ and speculation was rife as to their nature in the first half of the seventeenth century fabio colonna had tried to convince his colleagues of the famous accademia dei lincei that the glossopetræ were merely fossil sharks teeth but his arguments made no impression fifty years later steno reopened the question and by dissecting the head of a shark and pointing out the very exact correspondence of its teeth with the glossopetræ left no rational doubt as to the origin of the latter thus far the work of steno went little further than that of colonna but it fortunately occurred to him to think out the whole subject of the interpretation of fossils and the result of his meditations was the publication in 1669 of a little treatise with the very quaint title of de solido intra solidum naturaliter contento the general course of stenos argument may be stated in a few words fossils are solid bodies which by some natural process have come to be contained within other solid bodies namely the rocks in which they are embedded and the fundamental problem of palæontology stated generally is this given a body endowed with a certain shape and produced in accordance with natural laws to find 61 in that body itself the evidence of the place and manner of its production8 the only way of solving this problem is by the application of the axiom that like effects imply like causes or as steno puts it in reference to this particular case that bodies which are altogether similar have been produced in the same way9 hence since the glossopetræ are altogether similar to sharks teeth they must have been produced by sharklike fishes and since many fossil shells correspond down to the minutest details of structure with the shells of existing marine or freshwater animals they must have been produced by similar animals and the like reasoning is applied by steno to the fossil bones of vertebrated animals whether aquatic or terrestrial to the obvious objection that many fossils are not altogether similar to their living analogues differing in substance while agreeing in form or being mere hollows or impressions the surfaces of which are figured in the same way as those of animal or vegetable organisms steno replies by pointing out the changes which take place in organic remains embedded in the earth and how their solid substance may be dissolved away entirely or replaced by mineral matter until nothing is left of the original but a cast an impression or a mere trace of its contours the principles of investigation thus excellently stated and illustrated by steno in 1669 are those which have 62 consciously or unconsciously guided the researches of palæontologists ever since even that feat of palæontology which has so powerfully impressed the popular imagination the reconstruction of an extinct animal from a tooth or a bone is based upon the simplest imaginable application of the logic of steno a moments consideration will show in fact that stenos conclusion that the glossopetræ are sharks teeth implies the reconstruction of an animal from its tooth it is equivalent to the assertion that the animal of which the glossopetræ are relics had the form and organisation of a shark that it had a skull a vertebral column and limbs similar to those which are characteristic of this group of fishes that its heart gills and intestines presented the peculiarities which those of all sharks exhibit nay even that any hard parts which its integument contained were of a totally different character from the scales of ordinary fishes these conclusions are as certain as any based upon probable reasonings can be and they are so simply because a very large experience justifies us in believing that teeth of this particular form and structure are invariably associated with the peculiar organisation of sharks and are never found in connection with other organisms why this should be we are not at present in a position even to imagine we must take the fact as an empirical law of animal morphology the reason of which may possibly be one day found in the history of the evolution of the shark tribe but for which it is hopeless to seek for an explanation in ordinary physiological reasonings every one 63 practically acquainted with palæontology is aware that it is not every tooth nor every bone which enables us to form a judgment of the character of the animal to which it belonged and that it is possible to possess many teeth and even a large portion of the skeleton of an extinct animal and yet be unable to reconstruct its skull or its limbs it is only when the tooth or bone presents peculiarities which we know by previous experience to be characteristic of a certain group that we can safely predict that the fossil belonged to an animal of the same group any one who finds a cows grinder may be perfectly sure that it belonged to an animal which had two complete toes on each foot and ruminated any one who finds a horses grinder may be as sure that it had one complete toe on each foot and did not ruminate but if ruminants and horses were extinct animals of which nothing but the grinders had ever been discovered no amount of physiological reasoning could have enabled us to reconstruct either animal still less to have divined the wide differences between the two cuvier in the discours sur les révolutions de la surface du globe strangely credits himself and has ever since been credited by others with the invention of a new method of palæontological research but if you will turn to the recherches sur les ossemens fossiles and watch cuvier not speculating but working you will find that his method is neither more nor less than that of steno if he was able to make his famous prophecy from the jaw which lay upon the surface of a block of stone to the pelvis of the same animal which lay hidden in it it was not 64 because either he or any one else knew or knows why a certain form of jaw is as a rule constantly accompanied by the presence of marsupial bones but simply because experience has shown that these two structures are coordinated  the settlement of the nature of fossils led at once to the next advance of palæontology viz its application to the deciphering of the history of the earth when it was admitted that fossils are remains of animals and plants it followed that in so far as they resemble terrestrial or freshwater animals and plants they are evidences of the existence of land or fresh water and in so far as they resemble marine organisms they are evidences of the existence of the sea at the time at which they were parts of actually living animals and plants moreover in the absence of evidence to the contrary it must be admitted that the terrestrial or the marine organisms implied the existence of land or sea at the place in which they were found while they were yet living in fact such conclusions were immediately drawn by everybody from the time of xenophanes downwards who believed that fossils were really organic remains steno discusses their value as evidence of repeated alteration of marine and terrestrial conditions upon the soil of tuscany in a manner worthy of a modern geologist the speculations of de maillet in the beginning of the eighteenth century turn upon fossils and buffon follows him very closely in those two remarkable works the théorie de la terre and the Époques de la nature with 65 which he commenced and ended his career as a naturalist  the opening sentences of the Époques de la nature show us how fully buffon recognised the analogy of geological with archæological inquiries as in civil history we consult deeds seek for coins or decipher antique inscriptions in order to determine the epochs of human revolutions and fix the date of moral events so in natural history we must search the archives of the world recover old monuments from the bowels of the earth collect their fragmentary remains and gather into one body of evidence all the signs of physical change which may enable us to look back upon the different ages of nature it is our only means of fixing some points in the immensity of space and of setting a certain number of waymarks along the eternal path of time  buffon enumerates five classes of these monuments of the past history of the earth and they are all facts of palæontology in the first place he says shells and other marine productions are found all over the surface and in the interior of the dry land and all calcareous rocks are made up of their remains secondly a great many of these shells which are found in europe are not now to be met with in the adjacent seas and in the slates and other deepseated deposits there are remains of fishes and of plants of which no species now exist in our latitudes and which are either extinct or exist only in more northern climates thirdly in siberia and in other northern regions of europe and of asia bones and 66 teeth of elephants rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses occur in such numbers that these animals must once have lived and multiplied in those regions although at the present day they are confined to southern climates the deposits in which these remains are found are superficial while those which contain shells and other marine remains lie much deeper fourthly tusks and bones of elephants and hippopotamuses are found not only in the northern regions of the old world but also in those of the new world although at present neither elephants nor hippopotamuses occur in america fifthly in the middle of the continents in regions most remote from the sea we find an infinite number of shells of which the most part belong to animals of those kinds which still exist in southern seas but of which many others have no living analogues so that these species appear to be lost destroyed by some unknown cause it is needless to inquire how far these statements are strictly accurate they are sufficiently so to justify buffons conclusions that the dry land was once beneath the sea that the formation of the fossiliferous rocks must have occupied a vastly greater lapse of time than that traditionally ascribed to the age of the earth that fossil remains indicate different climatal conditions to have obtained in former times and especially that the polar regions were once warmer that many species of animals and plants have become extinct and that geological change has had something to do with geographical distribution  but these propositions almost constitute the framework of palæontology in order to complete it but 67 one addition was needed and that was made in the last years of the eighteenth century by william smith whose work comes so near our own times that many living men may have been personally acquainted with him this modest landsurveyor whose business took him into many parts of england profited by the peculiarly favourable conditions offered by the arrangement of our secondary strata to make a careful examination and comparison of their fossil contents at different points of the large area over which they extend the result of his accurate and widelyextended observations was to establish the important truth that each stratum contains certain fossils which are peculiar to it and that the order in which the strata characterised by these fossils are superimposed one upon the other is always the same this most important generalisation was rapidly verified and extended to all parts of the world accessible to geologists and now it rests upon such an immense mass of observations as to be one of the best established truths of natural science to the geologist the discovery was of infinite importance as it enabled him to identify rocks of the same relative age however their continuity might be interrupted or their composition altered but to the biologist it had a still deeper meaning for it demonstrated that throughout the prodigious duration of time registered by the fossiliferous rocks the living population of the earth had undergone continual changes not merely by the extinction of a certain number of the species which had at first existed but by the continual generation 68 of new species and the no less constant extinction of old ones  thus the broad outlines of palæontology in so far as it is the common property of both the geologist and the biologist were marked out at the close of the last century in tracing its subsequent progress i must confine myself to the province of biology and indeed to the influence of palæontology upon zoological morphology and i accept this limitation the more willingly as the no less important topic of the bearing of geology and of palæontology upon distribution has been luminously treated in the address of the president of the geographical section10  the succession of the species of animals and plants in time being established the first question which the zoologist or the botanist had to ask himself was what is the relation of these successive species one to another and it is a curious circumstance that the most important event in the history of palæontology which immediately succeeded william smiths generalisation was a discovery which could it have been rightly appreciated at the time would have gone far towards suggesting the answer which was in fact delayed for more than half a century i refer to cuviers investigation of the mammalian fossils yielded by the quarries in the older tertiary rocks of montmartre among the chief results of which was the bringing to light of two genera of extinct hoofed quadrupeds the anoplotherium and the palæotherium the rich materials at cuviers disposition enabled him 69 to obtain a full knowledge of the osteology and of the dentition of these two forms and consequently to compare their structure critically with that of existing hoofed animals the effect of this comparison was to prove that the anoplotherium though it presented many points of resemblance with the pigs on the one hand and with the ruminants on the other differed from both to such an extent that it could find a place in neither group in fact it held in some respects an intermediate position tending to bridge over the interval between these two groups which in the existing fauna are so distinct in the same way the palæotherium tended to connect forms so different as the tapir the rhinoceros and the horse subsequent investigations have brought to light a variety of facts of the same order the most curious and striking of which are those which prove the existence in the mesozoic epoch of a series of forms intermediate between birds and reptilestwo classes of vertebrate animals which at present appear to be more widely separated than any others yet the interval between them is completely filled in the mesozoic fauna by birds which have reptilian characters on the one side and reptiles which have ornithic characters on the other so again while the group of fishes termed ganoids is at the present time so distinct from that of the dipnoi or mudfishes that they have been reckoned as distinct orders the devonian strata present us with forms of which it is impossible to say with certainty whether they are dipnoi or whether they are ganoids 70  agassizs long and elaborate researches upon fossil fishes published between 1833 and 1842 led him to suggest the existence of another kind of relation between ancient and modern forms of life he observed that the oldest fishes present many characters which recall the embryonic conditions of existing fishes and that not only among fishes but in several groups of the invertebrata which have a long palæontological history the latest forms are more modified more specialised than the earlier the fact that the dentition of the older tertiary ungulate and carnivorous mammals is always complete noticed by professor owen illustrated the same generalisation  another no less suggestive observation was made by mr darwin whose personal investigations during the voyage of the beagle led him to remark upon the singular fact that the fauna which immediately precedes that at present existing in any geographical province of distribution presents the same peculiarities as its successor thus in south america and in australia the later tertiary or quaternary fossils show that the fauna which immediately preceded that of the present day was in the one case as much characterised by edentates and in the other by marsupials as it is now although the species of the older are largely different from those of the newer fauna  however clearly these indications might point in one direction the question of the exact relation of the successive forms of animal and vegetable life could be satisfactorily settled only in one way namely by comparing stage by stage the series of 71 forms presented by one and the same type throughout a long space of time within the last few years this has been done fully in the case of the horse less completely in the case of the other principal types of the ungulata and of the carnivora and all these investigations tend to one general result namely that in any given series the successive members of that series present a gradually increasing specialisation of structure that is to say if any such mammal at present existing has specially modified and reduced limbs or dentition and complicated brain its predecessors in time show less and less modification and reduction in limbs and teeth and a less highly developed brain the labours of gaudry marsh and cope furnish abundant illustrations of this law from the marvellous fossil wealth of pikermi and the vast uninterrupted series of tertiary rocks in the territories of north america    i will now sum up the results of this sketch of the rise and progress of palæontology the whole fabric of palæontology is based upon two propositions the first is that fossils are the remains of animals and plants and the second is that the stratified rocks in which they are found are sedimentary deposits and each of these propositions is founded upon the same axiom that like effects imply like causes if there is any cause competent to produce a fossil stem or shell or bone except a living being then palæontology has no foundation if the stratification of the rocks is not the effect of such causes as at present produce 72 stratification we have no means of judging of the duration of past time or of the order in which the forms of life have succeeded one another but if these two propositions are granted there is no escape as it appears to me from three very important conclusions the first is that living matter has existed upon the earth for a vast length of time certainly for millions of years the second is that during this lapse of time the forms of living matter have undergone repeated changes the effect of which has been that the animal and vegetable population at any period of the earths history contains some species which did not exist at some antecedent period and others which ceased to exist at some subsequent period the third is that in the case of many groups of mammals and some of reptiles in which one type can be followed through a considerable extent of geological time the series of different forms by which the type is represented at successive intervals of this time is exactly such as it would be if they had been produced by the gradual modification of the earliest forms of the series these are facts of the history of the earth guaranteed by as good evidence as any facts in civil history  hitherto i have kept carefully clear of all the hypotheses to which men have at various times endeavoured to fit the facts of palæontology or by which they have endeavoured to connect as many of these facts as they happened to be acquainted with i do not think it would be a profitable employment of our time to discuss conceptions which doubtless have had their justification and even their use but which 73 are now obviously incompatible with the wellascertained truths of palæontology at present these truths leave room for only two hypotheses the first is that in the course of the history of the earth innumerable species of animals and plants have come into existence independently of one another innumerable times this of course implies either that spontaneous generation on the most astounding scale and of animals such as horses and elephants has been going on as a natural process through all the time recorded by the fossiliferous rocks or it necessitates the belief in innumerable acts of creation repeated innumerable times the other hypothesis is that the successive species of animals and plants have arisen the later by the gradual modification of the earlier this is the hypothesis of evolution and the palæontological discoveries of the last decade are so completely in accordance with the requirements of this hypothesis that if it had not existed the palæontologist would have had to invent it  i have always had a certain horror of presuming to set a limit upon the possibilities of things therefore i will not venture to say that it is impossible that the multitudinous species of animals and plants may have been produced one separately from the other by spontaneous generation nor that it is impossible that they should have been independently originated by an endless succession of miraculous creative acts but i must confess that both these hypotheses strike me as so astoundingly improbable so devoid of a shred of either scientific or traditional support that even if 74 there were no other evidence than that of palæontology in its favour i should feel compelled to adopt the hypothesis of evolution happily the future of palæontology is independent of all hypothetical considerations fifty years hence whoever undertakes to record the progress of palæontology will note the present time as the epoch in which the law of succession of the forms of the higher animals was determined by the observation of palæontological facts he will point out that just as steno and as cuvier were enabled from their knowledge of the empirical laws of coexistence of the parts of animals to conclude from a part to the whole so the knowledge of the law of succession of forms empowered their successors to conclude from one or two terms of such a succession to the whole series and thus to divine the existence of forms of life of which perhaps no trace remains at epochs of inconceivable remoteness in the past                                        75  ii  the interpreters of genesis and the interpreters of nature  our fabulist warns those who in quarrels interpose of the fate which is probably in store for them and in venturing to place myself between so powerful a controversialist as mr gladstone and the eminent divine whom he assaults with such vigour in the last number of this review11 i am fully aware that i run great danger of verifying gays prediction moreover it is quite possible that my zeal in offering aid to a combatant so extremely well able to take care of himself as m réville may be thought to savour of indiscretion  two considerations however have led me to face the double risk the one is that though in my judgment m réville is wholly in the right in that part of the controversy to which i propose to restrict my observations nevertheless he as a foreigner has very little chance of making the truth prevail with englishmen against the authority and the dialectic skill of the greatest master of persuasive rhetoric among englishspeaking men of our time 76 as the queens proctor intervenes in certain cases between two litigants in the interests of justice so it may be permitted me to interpose as a sort of uncommissioned science proctor my second excuse for my meddlesomeness is that important questions of natural sciencerespecting which neither of the combatants professes to speak as an expertare involved in the controversy and i think it is desirable that the public should know what it is that natural science really has to say on these topics to the best belief of one who has been a diligent student of natural science for the last forty years  the original prolégomènes de lhistoire des religions has not come in my way but i have read the translation of m révilles work published in england under the auspices of professor max müller with very great interest it puts more fairly and clearly than any book previously known to me the view which a man of strong religious feelings but at the same time possessing the information and the reasoning power which enable him to estimate the strength of scientific methods of inquiry and the weight of scientific truth may be expected to take of the relation between science and religion  in the chapter on the primitive revelation the scientific worth of the account of the creation given in the book of genesis is estimated in terms which are as unquestionably respectful as in my judgment they are just and at the end of the chapter on primitive tradition m réville appraises the value of pentateuchal anthropology in a way which i should 77 have thought sure of enlisting the assent of all competent judges even if it were extended to the whole of the cosmogony and biology of genesis      as however the original traditions of nations sprang up in an epoch     less remote than our own from the primitive life it is indispensable     to consult them to compare them and to associate them with other     sources of information which are available from this point of view     the traditions recorded in genesis possess in addition to their own     peculiar charm a value of the highest order but we cannot ultimately     see in them more than a venerable fragment well deserving attention     of the great genesis of mankind  mr gladstone is of a different mind he dissents from m révilles views respecting the proper estimation of the pentateuchal traditions no less than he does from his interpretation of those homeric myths which have been the object of his own special study in the latter case mr gladstone tells m réville that he is wrong on his own authority to which in such a matter all will pay due respect in the former he affirms himself to be wholly destitute of that kind of knowledge which carries authority and his rebuke is administered in the name and by the authority of natural science  an air of magisterial gravity hangs about the following passage      but the question is not here of a lofty poem or a skilfully     constructed narrative it is whether natural science in the patient     exercise of its high calling to examine facts finds that the works of     god cry out against what we have fondly believed to be his word and     tell another tale or whether in this nineteenth century of christian     progress it substantially echoes back the majestic sound which     before it existed as a pursuit went forth into all lands 78      first looking largely at the latter portion of the narrative which     describes the creation of living organisms and waiving details on     some of which as in v 24 the septuagint seems to vary from the     hebrew there is a grand fourfold division set forth in an orderly     succession of times as follows on the fifth day        1 the waterpopulation       2 the airpopulation      and on the sixth day        3 the landpopulation of animals       4 the landpopulation consummated in man      now this same fourfold order is understood to have been so affirmed in     our time by natural science that it may be taken as a demonstrated     conclusion and established fact p 696  understood by whom i cannot bring myself to imagine that mr gladstone has made so solemn and authoritative a statement on a matter of this importance without due inquirywithout being able to found himself upon recognised scientific authority but i wish he had thought fit to name the source from whence he has derived his information as in that case i could have dealt with his authority and i should have thereby escaped the appearance of making an attack on mr gladstone himself which is in every way distasteful to me  for i can meet the statement in the last paragraph of the above citation with nothing but a direct negative if i know anything at all about the results attained by the natural science of our time it is a demonstrated conclusion and established fact that the fourfold order given by mr gladstone is not that in which the evidence at our disposal 79 tends to show that the water air and landpopulations of the globe have made their appearance  perhaps i may be told that mr gladstone does give his authoritythat he cites cuvier sir john herschel and dr whewell in support of his case if that has been mr gladstones intention in mentioning these eminent names i may remark that on this particular question the only relevant authority is that of cuvier but great as cuvier was it is to be remembered that as mr gladstone incidentally remarks he cannot now be called a recent authority in fact he has been dead more than half a century and the palæontology of our day is related to that of his very much as the geography of the sixteenth century is related to that of the fourteenth since 1832 when cuvier died not only a new world but new worlds of ancient life have been discovered and those who have most faithfully carried on the work of the chief founder of palæontology have done most to invalidate the essentially negative grounds of his speculative adherence to tradition  if mr gladstones latest information on these matters is derived from the famous discourse prefixed to the ossemens fossiles i can understand the position he has taken up if he has ever opened a respectable modern manual of palæontology or geology i cannot for the facts which demolish his whole argument are of the commonest notoriety but before proceeding to consider the evidence for this assertion we must be clear about the meaning of the phraseology employed 80  i apprehend that when mr gladstone uses the term waterpopulation he means those animals which in genesis i 21 revised version are spoken of as the great sea monsters and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and i presume that it will be agreed that whales and porpoises sea fishes and the innumerable hosts of marine invertebrated animals are meant thereby so airpopulation must be the equivalent of fowl in verse 20 and every winged fowl after its kind verse 21 i suppose i may take it for granted that by fowl we have here to understand birdsat any rate primarily secondarily it may be that the bats and the extinct pterodactyles which were flying reptiles come under the same head but whether all insects are creeping things of the landpopulation or whether flying insects are to be included under the denomination of winged fowl is a point for the decision of hebrew exegetes lastly i suppose i may assume that landpopulation signifies the cattle and the beast of the earth and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth in verses 25 and 26 presumably it comprehends all kinds of terrestrial animals vertebrate and invertebrate except such as may be comprised under the head of the airpopulation  now what i want to make clear is this that if the terms waterpopulation airpopulation and landpopulation are understood in the senses here defined natural science has nothing to say in favour of the proposition that they succeeded one another in 81 the order given by mr gladstone but that on the contrary all the evidence we possess goes to prove that they did not whence it will follow that if mr gladstone has interpreted genesis rightly on which point i am most anxious to be understood to offer no opinion that interpretation is wholly irreconcilable with the conclusions at present accepted by the interpreters of naturewith everything that can be called a demonstrated conclusion and established fact of natural science and be it observed that i am not here dealing with a question of speculation but with a question of fact  either the geological record is sufficiently complete to afford us a means of determining the order in which animals have made their appearance on the globe or it is not if it is the determination of that order is little more than a mere matter of observation if it is not then natural science neither affirms nor refutes the fourfold order but is simply silent  the series of the fossiliferous deposits which contain the remains of the animals which have lived on the earth in past ages of its history and which can alone afford the evidence required by natural science of the order of appearance of their different species may be grouped in the manner shown in the lefthand column of the following table the oldest being at the bottom        formations         first known appearance of   quaternary   pliocene   miocene   eocene              vertebrate airpopulation bats   82   cretaceous   jurassic             vertebrate airpopulation birds and       pterodactyles   triassic   upper palæozoic   middle

and landpopulation flying                          insects and scorpions     cambrian           invertebrate waterpopulation much                          earlier if eozoon is animal  in the righthand column i have noted the group of strata in which according to our present information the land air and waterpopulations respectively appear for the first time and in consequence of the ambiguity about the meaning of fowl i have separately indicated the first appearance of bats birds flying reptiles and flying insects it will be observed that if fowl means only bird or at most flying vertebrate then the first certain evidence of the latter in the jurassic epoch is posterior to the first appearance of truly terrestrial amphibia and possibly of true reptiles in the carboniferous epoch middle palæozoic by a prodigious interval of time  the waterpopulation of vertebrated animals first appears in the upper silurian12 therefore if we found ourselves on vertebrated animals and take fowl to mean birds only or at most flying vertebrates natural science says that the order of succession was water land and airpopulation and 83 notas mr gladstone founding himself on genesis sayswater air landpopulation if a chronicler of greece affirmed that the age of alexander preceded that of pericles and immediately succeeded that of the trojan war mr gladstone would hardly say that this order is understood to have been so affirmed by historical science that it may be taken as a demonstrated conclusion and established fact yet natural science affirms his fourfold order to exactly the same extentneither more nor less  suppose however that fowl is to be taken to include flying insects in that case the first appearance of an airpopulation must be shifted back for long ages recent discovery having shown that they occur in rocks of silurian age hence there might still have been hope for the fourfold order were it not that the fates unkindly determined that scorpionscreeping things that creep on the earth par excellenceturned up in silurian strata nearly at the same time so that if the word in the original hebrew translated fowl should really after all mean cockroachand i have great faith in the elasticity of that tongue in the hands of biblical exegetesthe order primarily suggested by the existing evidence    2 land and airpopulation   1 waterpopulation  and mr gladstones order    3 landpopulation   2 airpopulation   1 waterpopulation  84 can by no means be made to coincide as a matter of fact then the statement so confidently put forward turns out to be devoid of foundation and in direct contradiction of the evidence at present at our disposal13  if stepping beyond that which may be learned from the facts of the successive appearance of the forms of animal life upon the surface of the globe in so far as they are yet made known to us by natural science we apply our reasoning faculties to the task of finding out what those observed facts mean the present conclusions of the interpreters of nature appear to be no less directly in conflict with those of the latest interpreter of genesis  mr gladstone appears to admit that there is some truth in the doctrine of evolution and indeed places it under very high patronage      i contend that evolution in its highest form has not been a 85 thing     heretofore unknown to history to philosophy or to theology i contend     that it was before the mind of saint paul when he taught that in the     fulness of time god sent forth his son and of eusebius when he wrote     the preparation for the gospel and of augustine when he composed the     city of god p 706  has any one ever disputed the contention thus solemnly enunciated that the doctrine of evolution was not invented the day before yesterday has any one ever dreamed of claiming it as a modern innovation is there any one so ignorant of the history of philosophy as to be unaware that it is one of the forms in which speculation embodied itself long before the time either of the bishop of hippo or of the apostle to the gentiles is mr gladstone of all people in the world disposed to ignore the founders of greek philosophy to say nothing of indian sages to whom evolution was a familiar notion ages before paul of tarsus was born but it is ungrateful to cavil at even the most oblique admission of the possible value of one of those affirmations of natural science which really may be said to be a demonstrated conclusion and established fact i note it with pleasure if only for the purpose of introducing the observation that if there is any truth whatever in the doctrine of evolution as applied to animals mr gladstones gloss on genesis in the following passage is hardly happy    god created   a the waterpopulation   b the airpopulation   and they receive his benediction v 2023  86      6 pursuing this regular progression from the lower to the higher from     the simple to the complex the text now gives us the work of the sixth     day which supplies the landpopulation air and water having been     already supplied pp 695 696  the gloss to which i refer is the assumption that the airpopulation forms a term in the order of progression from lower to higher from simple to complexthe place of which lies between the waterpopulation below and the landpopulation aboveand i speak of it as a gloss because the pentateuchal writer is nowise responsible for it  but it is not true that the airpopulation as a whole is lower or less complex than the landpopulation on the contrary every beginner in the study of animal morphology is aware that the organisation of a bat of a bird or of a pterodactyle presupposes that of a terrestrial quadruped and that it is intelligible only as an extreme modification of the organisation of a terrestrial mammal or reptile in the same way winged insects if they are to be counted among the airpopulation presuppose insects which were wingless and therefore as creeping things were part of the landpopulation thus theory is as much opposed as observation to the admission that natural science endorses the succession of animal life which mr gladstone finds in genesis on the contrary a good many representatives of natural science would be prepared to say on theoretical grounds alone that it is incredible that the airpopulation should have appeared before the landpopulationand that if this assertion is to be 87 found in genesis it merely demonstrates the scientific worthlessness of the story of which it forms a part  indeed we may go further it is not even admissible to say that the waterpopulation as a whole appeared before the air and the landpopulations according to the authorised version genesis especially mentions among the animals created on the fifth day great whales in place of which the revised version reads great sea monsters far be it from me to give an opinion which rendering is right or whether either is right all i desire to remark is that if whales and porpoises dugongs and manatees are to be regarded as members of the waterpopulation and if they are not what animals can claim the designation then that much of the waterpopulation has as certainly originated later than the landpopulation as bats and birds have for i am not aware that any competent judge would hesitate to admit that the organisation of these animals shows the most obvious signs of their descent from terrestrial quadrupeds  a similar criticism applies to mr gladstones assumption that as the fourth act of that orderly succession of times enunciated in genesis the landpopulation consummated in man  if this means simply that man is the final term in the evolutional series of which he forms a part i do not suppose that any objection will be raised to that statement on the part of students of natural science but if the pentateuchal author goes further than this and intends to say that which is ascribed to him by 88 mr gladstone i think natural science will have to enter a caveat it is by not any means certain that mani mean the species homo sapiens of zoological terminologyhas consummated the landpopulation in the sense of appearing at a later period of time than any other let me make my meaning clear by an example from a morphological point of view our beautiful and useful contemporaryi might almost call him colleaguethe horse equus caballus is the last term of the evolutional series to which he belongs just as homo sapiens is the last term of the series of which he is a member if i want to know whether the species equus caballus made its appearance on the surface of the globe before or after homo sapiens deduction from known laws does not help me there is no reason that i know of why one should have appeared sooner or later than the other if i turn to observation i find abundant remains of equus caballus in quaternary strata perhaps a little earlier the existence of homo sapiens in the quaternary epoch is also certain evidence has been adduced in favour of mans existence in the pliocene or even in the miocene epoch it does not satisfy me but i have no reason to doubt that the fact may be so nevertheless indeed i think it is quite possible that further research will show that homo sapiens existed not only before equus caballus but before many other of the existing forms of animal life so that if all the species of animals have been separately created man in this case would by no means be the consummation of the landpopulation 89  i am raising no objection to the position of the fourth term in mr gladstones orderon the facts as they stand it is quite open to any one to hold as a pious opinion that the fabrication of man was the acme and final achievement of the process of peopling the globe but it must not be said that natural science counts this opinion among her demonstrated conclusions and established facts for there would be just as much or as little reason for ranging the contrary opinion among them  it may seem superfluous to add to the evidence that mr gladstone has been utterly misled in supposing that his interpretation of genesis receives any support from natural science but it is as well to do ones work thoroughly while one is about it and i think it may be advisable to point out that the facts as they are at present known not only refute mr gladstones interpretation of genesis in detail but are opposed to the central idea on which it appears to be based  there must be some position from which the reconcilers of science and genesis will not retreat some central idea the maintenance of which is vital and its refutation fatal even if they now allow that the words the evening and the morning have not the least reference to a natural day but mean a period of any number of millions of years that may be necessary even if they are driven to admit that the word creation which so many millions of pious jews and christians have held and still hold to mean a sudden act of the deity signifies a process of gradual 90 evolution of one species from another extending through immeasurable time even if they are willing to grant that the asserted coincidence of the order of nature with the fourfold order ascribed to genesis is an obvious error instead of an established truth they are surely prepared to make a last stand upon the conception which underlies the whole and which constitutes the essence of mr gladstones fourfold division set forth in an orderly succession of times it is that the animal species which compose the waterpopulation the airpopulation and the landpopulation respectively originated during three distinct and successive periods of time and only during those periods of time  this statement appears to me to be the interpretation of genesis which mr gladstone supports reduced to its simplest expression period of time is substituted for day originated is substituted for created and any order required for that adopted by mr gladstone it is necessary to make this proviso for if day may mean a few million years and creation may mean evolution then it is obvious that the order 1 waterpopulation 2 airpopulation 3 landpopulation may also mean 1 waterpopulation 2 landpopulation 3 airpopulation and it would be unkind to bind down the reconcilers to this detail when one has parted with so many others to oblige them  but even this sublimated essence of the pentateuchal doctrine if it be such remains as discordant with natural science as ever 91  it is not true that the species composing any one of the three populations originated during any one of three successive periods of time and not at any other of these  undoubtedly it is in the highest degree probable that animal life appeared first under aquatic conditions that terrestrial forms appeared later and flying animals only after land animals but it is at the same time testified by all the evidence we possess that the great majority if not the whole of the primordial species of each division have long since died out and have been replaced by a vast succession of new forms hundreds of thousands of animal species as distinct as those which now compose our water land and airpopulations have come into existence and died out again throughout the æons of geological time which separate us from the lower palæozoic epoch when as i have pointed out our present evidence of the existence of such distinct populations commences if the species of animals have all been separately created then it follows that hundreds of thousands of acts of creative energy have occurred at intervals throughout the whole time recorded by the fossiliferous rocks and during the greater part of that time the creation of the members of the water land and airpopulations must have gone on contemporaneously  if we represent the water land and airpopulations by a b and c respectively and take vertical succession on the page to indicate order in time then the following schemes will roughly shadow forth the contrast i have been endeavouring to explain 92        genesis as interpreted by   nature as interpreted by           mr gladstone             natural science               b b b                   c1 a3  b2               c c c                   c   a2  b1               a a a                   b   a1  b                                       a   a    a  so far as i can see there is only one resource left for those modern representatives of sisyphus the reconcilers of genesis with science and it has the advantage of being founded on a perfectly legitimate appeal to our ignorance it has been seen that on any interpretation of the terms waterpopulation and landpopulation it must be admitted that invertebrate representatives of these populations existed during the lower palæozoic epoch no evolutionist can hesitate to admit that other land animals and possibly vertebrates among them may have existed during that time of the history of which we know so little and further that scorpions are animals of such high organisation that it is highly probable their existence indicates that of a long antecedent landpopulation of a similar character  then since the landpopulation is said not to have been created until the sixth day it necessarily follows that the evidence of the order in which animals appeared must be sought in the record of those older palæozoic times in which only traces of the waterpopulation have as yet been discovered  therefore if any one chooses to say that the creative work took place in the cambrian or laurentian epoch in exactly that manner which mr gladstone does and natural science does not affirm natural 93 science is not in a position to disprove the accuracy of the statement only one cannot have ones cake and eat it too and such safety from the contradiction of science means the forfeiture of her support  whether the account of the work of the first second and third days in genesis would be confirmed by the demonstration of the truth of the nebular hypothesis whether it is corroborated by what is known of the nature and probable relative antiquity of the heavenly bodies whether if the hebrew word translated firmament in the authorised version really means expanse the assertion that the waters are partly under this expanse and partly above it would be any more confirmed by the ascertained facts of physical geography and meteorology than it was before whether the creation of the whole vegetable world and especially of grass herb yielding seed after its kind and tree bearing fruit before any kind of animal is affirmed by the apparently plain teaching of botanical palæontology that grasses and fruittrees originated long subsequently to animalsall these are questions which if i mistake not would be answered decisively in the negative by those who are specially conversant with the sciences involved and it must be recollected that the issue raised by mr gladstone is not whether by some effort of ingenuity the pentateuchal story can be shown to be not disprovable by scientific knowledge but whether it is supported thereby      there is nothing then in the criticisms of dr réville but what     rather tends to confirm than to impair the oldfashioned 94 belief     that there is a revelation in the book of genesis p 694  the form into which mr gladstone has thought fit to throw this opinion leaves me in doubt as to its substance i do not understand how a hostile criticism can under any circumstances tend to confirm that which it attacks if however mr gladstone merely means to express his personal impression as one wholly destitute of that kind of knowledge which carries authority that he has destroyed the value of these criticisms i have neither the wish nor the right to attempt to disturb his faith on the other hand i may be permitted to state my own conviction that so far as natural science is involved m révilles observations retain the exact value they possessed before mr gladstone attacked them    trusting that i have now said enough to secure the author of a wise and moderate disquisition upon a topic which seems fated to stir unwisdom and fanaticism to their depths a fuller measure of justice than has hitherto been accorded to him i retire from my selfappointed championship with the hope that i shall not hereafter be called upon by m réville to apologise for damage done to his strong case by imperfect or impulsive advocacy but perhaps i may be permitted to add a word or two on my own account in reference to the great question of the relations between science and religion since it is one about which i have thought a good deal ever since i have been able to think at all and about which i have 95 ventured to express my views publicly more than once in the course of the last thirty years  the antagonism between science and religion about which we hear so much appears to me to be purely factitiousfabricated on the one hand by shortsighted religious people who confound a certain branch of science theology with religion and on the other by equally shortsighted scientific people who forget that science takes for its province only that which is susceptible of clear intellectual comprehension and that outside the boundaries of that province they must be content with imagination with hope and with ignorance  it seems to me that the moral and intellectual life of the civilised nations of europe is the product of that interaction sometimes in the way of antagonism sometimes in that of profitable interchange of the semitic and the aryan races which commenced with the dawn of history when greek and phoenician came in contact and has been continued by carthaginian and roman by jew and gentile down to the present day our art except perhaps music and our science are the contributions of the aryan but the essence of our religion is derived from the semite in the eighth century bc in the heart of a world of idolatrous polytheists the hebrew prophets put forth a conception of religion which appears to me to be as wonderful an inspiration of genius as the art of pheidias or the science of aristotle  and what doth the lord require of thee but to 96 do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god  if any socalled religion takes away from this great saying of micah i think it wantonly mutilates while if it adds thereto i think it obscures the perfect ideal of religion  but what extent of knowledge what acuteness of scientific criticism can touch this if any one possessed of knowledge or acuteness could be absurd enough to make the attempt will the progress of research prove that justice is worthless and mercy hateful will it ever soften the bitter contrast between our actions and our aspirations or show us the bounds of the universe and bid us say go to now we comprehend the infinite a faculty of wrath lay in those ancient israelites and surely the prophets staff would have made swift acquaintance with the head of the scholar who had asked micah whether peradventure the lord further required of him an implicit belief in the accuracy of the cosmogony of genesis  what we are usually pleased to call religion nowadays is for the most part hellenised judaism and not unfrequently the hellenic element carries with it a mighty remnant of oldworld paganism and a great infusion of the worst and weakest products of greek scientific speculation while fragments of persian and babylonian or rather accadian mythology burden the judaic contribution to the common stock  the antagonism of science is not to religion but to the heathen survivals and the bad philosophy under which religion herself is often wellnigh crushed 97 and for my part i trust that this antagonism will never cease but that to the end of time true science will continue to fulfil one of her most beneficent functions that of relieving men from the burden of false science which is imposed upon them in the name of religion  this is the work that m réville and men such as he are doing for us this is the work which his opponents are endeavouring consciously or unconsciously to hinder                                        98  iii  mr gladstone and genesis  in controversy as in courtship the good old rule to be off with the old before one is on with the new greatly commends itself to my sense of expediency and therefore it appears to me desirable that i should preface such observations as i may have to offer upon the cloud of arguments the relevancy of which to the issue which i had ventured to raise is not always obvious put forth by mr gladstone in the january number of this review14 by an endeavour to make clear to such of our readers as have not had the advantage of a forensic education the present net result of the discussion  i am quite aware that in undertaking this task i run all the risks to which the man who presumes to deal judicially with his own cause is liable but it is exactly because i do not shun that risk but rather earnestly desire to be judged by him who cometh after me provided that he has the knowledge and impartiality appropriate to a judge that i adopt my present course  99  in the article on the dawn of creation and worship it will be remembered that mr gladstone unreservedly commits himself to three propositions the first is that according to the writer of the pentateuch the waterpopulation the airpopulation and the landpopulation of the globe were created successively in the order named in the second place mr gladstone authoritatively asserts that this as part of his fourfold order has been so affirmed in our time by natural science that it may be taken as a demonstrated conclusion and established fact in the third place mr gladstone argues that the fact of this coincidence of the pentateuchal story with the results of modern investigation makes it impossible to avoid the conclusion first that either this writer was gifted with faculties passing all human experience or else his knowledge was divine and having settled to his own satisfaction that the first branch of the alternative is truly nominal and unreal mr gladstone continues so stands the plea for a revelation of truth from god a plea only to be met by questioning its possibility p 697  i am a simpleminded person wholly devoid of subtlety of intellect so that i willingly admit that there may be depths of alternative meaning in these propositions out of all soundings attainable by my poor plummet still there are a good many people who suffer under a like intellectual limitation and for once in my life i feel that i have the chance of attaining that position of a representative of average opinion which appears to be the modern ideal of a 100 leader of men when i make free confession that after turning the matter over in my mind with all the aid derived from a careful consideration of mr gladstones reply i cannot get away from my original conviction that if mr gladstones second proposition can be shown to be not merely inaccurate but directly contradictory of facts known to every one who is acquainted with the elements of natural science the third proposition collapses of itself  and it was this conviction which led me to enter upon the present discussion i fancied that if my respected clients the people of average opinion and capacity could once be got distinctly to conceive that mr gladstones views as to the proper method of dealing with grave and difficult scientific and religious problems had permitted him to base a solemn plea for a revelation of truth from god upon an error as to a matter of fact from which the intelligent perusal of a manual of palæontology would have saved him i need not trouble myself to occupy their time and attention with further comments upon his contribution to apologetic literature it is for others to judge whether i have efficiently carried out my project or not it certainly does not count for much that i should be unable to find any flaw in my own case but i think it counts for a good deal that mr gladstone appears to have been equally unable to do so he does indeed make a great parade of authorities and i have the greatest respect for those authorities whom mr gladstone mentions if he will get them to sign a joint memorial to the effect that our present 101 palæontological evidence proves that birds appeared before the landpopulation of terrestrial reptiles i shall think it my duty to reconsider my positionbut not till then  it will be observed that i have cautiously used the word appears in referring to what seems to me to be absence of any real answer to my criticisms in mr gladstones reply for i must honestly confess that notwithstanding long and painful strivings after clear insight i am still uncertain whether mr gladstones defence means that the great plea for a revelation from god is to be left to perish in the dialectic desert or whether it is to be withdrawn under the protection of such skirmishers as are available for covering retreat  in particular the remarkable disquisition which covers pages 11 to 14 of mr gladstones last contribution has greatly exercised my mind socrates is reported to have said of the works of heraclitus that he who attempted to comprehend them should be a delian swimmer but that for his part what he could understand was so good that he was disposed to believe in the excellence of that which he found unintelligible in endeavouring to make myself master of mr gladstones meaning in these pages i have often been overcome by a feeling analogous to that of socrates but not quite the same that which i do understand in fact has appeared to me so very much the reverse of good that i have sometimes permitted myself to doubt the value of that which i do not understand 102  in this part of mr gladstones reply in fact i find nothing of which the bearing upon my arguments is clear to me except that which relates to the question whether reptiles so far as they are represented by tortoises and the great majority of lizards and snakes which are land animals are creeping things in the sense of the pentateuchal writer or not  i have every respect for the singer of the song of the three children whoever he may have been i desire to cast no shadow of doubt upon but on the contrary marvel at the exactness of mr gladstones information as to the considerations which affected the method of the mosaic writer nor do i venture to doubt that the inconvenient intrusion of these contemptible reptilesa family fallen from greatness p 14 a miserable decayed aristocracy reduced to mere skulkers about the earth ibidin consequence apparently of difficulties about the occupation of land arising out of the earthhunger of their former serfs the mammalsinto an apologetic argument which otherwise would run quite smoothly is in every way to be deprecated still the wretched creatures stand there importunately demanding notice and however different may be the practice in that contentious atmosphere with which mr gladstone expresses and laments his familiarity in the atmosphere of science it really is of no avail whatever to shut ones eyes to facts or to try to bury them out of sight under a tumulus of rhetoric that is my experience of the elysian regions of science wherein it is a pleasure to me to think that a man of mr gladstones 103 intimate knowledge of english life during the last quarter of a century believes my philosophic existence to have been rounded off in unbroken equanimity  however reprehensible and indeed contemptible terrestrial reptiles may be the only question which appears to me to be relevant to my argument is whether these creatures are or are not comprised under the denomination of everything that creepeth upon the ground  mr gladstone speaks of the author of the first chapter of genesis as the mosaic writer i suppose therefore that he will admit that it is equally proper to speak of the author of leviticus as the mosaic writer whether such a phrase would be used by any one who had an adequate conception of the assured results of modern biblical criticism is another matter but at any rate it cannot be denied that leviticus has as much claim to mosaic authorship as genesis therefore if one wants to know the sense of a phrase used in genesis it will be well to see what leviticus has to say on the matter hence i commend the following extract from the eleventh chapter of leviticus to mr gladstones serious attention      and these are they which are unclean unto you among the creeping things     that creep upon the earth the weasel and the mouse and the great     lizard after its kind and the gecko and the landcrocodile and the     sandlizard and the chameleon these are they which are unclean to you     among all that creep v 2931  the merest sundayschool exegesis therefore suffices 104 to prove that when the mosaic writer in genesis i 24 speaks of creeping things he means to include lizards among them  this being so it is agreed on all hands that terrestrial lizards and other reptiles allied to lizards occur in the permian strata it is further agreed that the triassic strata were deposited after these moreover it is well known that even if certain footprints are to be taken as unquestionable evidence of the existence of birds they are not known to occur in rocks earlier than the trias while indubitable remains of birds are to be met with only much later hence it follows that natural science does not affirm the statement that birds were made on the fifth day and everything that creepeth on the ground on the sixth on which mr gladstone rests his order for as is shown by leviticus the mosaic writer includes lizards among his creeping things  perhaps i have given myself superfluous trouble in the preceding argument for i find that mr gladstone is willing to assume he does not say to admit that the statement in the text of genesis as to reptiles cannot in all points be sustained p 16 but my position is that it cannot be sustained in any point so that after all it has perhaps been as well to go over the evidence again and then mr gladstone proceeds as if nothing had happened to tell us that      there remain great unshaken facts to be weighed first the fact that     such a record should have been made at all  as most peoples have their cosmogonies this fact does not strike me as having much value 105      secondly the fact that instead of dwelling in generalities it has     placed itself under the severe conditions of a chronological order     reaching from the first nisus of chaotic matter to the consummated     production of a fair and goodly a furnished and a peopled world  this fact can be regarded as of value only by ignoring the fact demonstrated in my previous paper that natural science does not confirm the order asserted so far as living things are concerned and by upsetting a fact to be brought to light presently to wit that in regard to the rest of the pentateuchal cosmogony prudent science has very little to say one way or the other      thirdly the fact that its cosmogony seems in the light of the     nineteenth century to draw more and more of countenance from the best     natural philosophy  i have already questioned the accuracy of this statement and i do not observe that mere repetition adds to its value      and fourthly that it has described the successive origins of the five     great categories of present life with which human experience was and is     conversant in that order which geological authority confirms  by comparison with a sentence on page 14 in which a fivefold order is substituted for the fourfold order on which the plea for revelation was originally founded it appears that these five categories are plants fishes birds mammals and man which mr gladstone affirms are given to us in genesis in the order of succession in which they are also given by the latest geological authorities 106  i must venture to demur to this statement i showed in my previous paper that there is no reason to doubt that the term great sea monster used in gen i 21 includes the most conspicuous of great sea animalsnamely whales dolphins porpoises manatees and dugongs15 and as these are indubitable mammals it is impossible to affirm that mammals come after birds which are said to have been created on the same day moreover i pointed out that as these cetacea and sirenia are certainly modified land animals their existence implies the antecedent existence of land mammals  furthermore i have to remark that the term fishes as used technically in zoology by no means covers all the moving creatures that have life which are bidden to fill the waters in the seas gen i 2022 marine mollusks and crustacea echinoderms corals and foraminifera are not technically fishes but they are abundant in the palæozoic rocks ages upon ages older than those in which the first evidences of true fishes appear and if in a geological book mr gladstone finds the quite true statement that plants appeared before fishes it is only by a complete misunderstanding that he can be led to imagine it serves his purpose as a matter of fact at the present moment it is a question whether on the bare evidence afforded by fossils the marine creeping thing or the marine plant has the seniority 107 no cautious palæontologist would express a decided opinion on the matter but if we are to read the pentateuchal statement as a scientific document and in spite of all protests to the contrary those who bring it into comparison with science do seek to make a scientific document of it then as it is quite clear that only terrestrial plants of high organisation are spoken of in verses 11 and 12 no palæontologist would hesitate to say that at present the records of sea animal life are vastly older than those of any land plant describable as grass herb yielding seed or fruittree  thus although in mr gladstones defence the old order passeth into new his case is not improved the fivefold order is no more affirmed in our time by natural science to be a demonstrated conclusion and established fact than the fourfold order was natural science appears to me to decline to have anything to do with either they are as wrong in detail as they are mistaken in principle  there is another change of position the value of which is not so apparent to me as it may well seem to be to those who are unfamiliar with the subject under discussion mr gladstone discards his three groups of waterpopulation airpopulation and landpopulation and substitutes for them 1 fishes 2 birds 3 mammals 4 man moreover it is assumed in a note that the higher or ordinary mammals alone were known to the mosaic writer p 6 no doubt it looks at first as if something 108 were gained by this alteration for as i have just pointed out the word fishes can be used in two senses one of which has a deceptive appearance of adjustability to the mosaic account then the inconvenient reptiles are banished out of sight and finally the question of the exact meaning of higher and ordinary in the case of mammals opens up the prospect of a hopeful logomachy but what is the good of it all in the face of leviticus on the one hand and of palæontology on the other  as in my apprehension there is not a shadow of justification for the suggestion that when the pentateuchal writer says fowl he excludes bats which as we shall see directly are expressly included under fowl in leviticus and as i have already shown that he demonstrably includes reptiles as well as mammals among the creeping things of the land i may be permitted to spare my readers further discussion of the fivefold order on the whole it is seen to be rather more inconsistent with genesis than its fourfold predecessor  but i have yet a fresh order to face mr gladstone p 11 understands the main statements of genesis in successive order of time but without any measurement of its divisions to be as follows    1 a period of land anterior to all life v 9 10   2 a period of vegetable life anterior to animal life v 11 12   3 a period of animal life in the order of fishes v 20   4 another stage of animal life in the order of birds   5 another in the order of beasts v 24 25   6 last of all man v 26 27  109  mr gladstone then tries to find the proof of the occurrence of a similar succession in sundry excellent works on geology  i am really grieved to be obliged to say that this third or is it fourth modification of the foundation of the plea for revelation originally set forth satisfies me as little as any of its predecessors  for in the first place i cannot accept the assertion that this order is to be found in genesis with respect to no 5 for example i hold as i have already said that great sea monsters includes the cetacea in which case mammals which is what i suppose mr gladstone means by beasts come in under head no 3 and not under no 5 again fowl are said in genesis to be created on the same day as fishes therefore i cannot accept an order which makes birds succeed fishes once more as it is quite certain that the term fowl includes the batsfor in leviticus xi 1319 we read and these shall ye have in abomination among the fowls  the heron after its kind and the hoopoe and the batit is obvious that bats are also said to have been created at stage no 3 and as bats are mammals and their existence obviously presupposes that of terrestrial beasts it is quite clear that the latter could not have first appeared as no 5 i need not repeat my reasons for doubting whether man came last of all  as the latter half of mr gladstones sixfold order thus shows itself to be wholly unauthorised by and inconsistent with the plain language of the pentateuch 110 i might decline to discuss the admissibility of its former half  but i will add one or two remarks on this point also does mr gladstone mean to say that in any of the works he has cited or indeed anywhere else he can find scientific warranty for the assertion that there was a period of landby which i suppose he means dry land for submerged land must needs be as old as the separate existence of the seaanterior to all life  it may be so or it may not be so but where is the evidence which would justify any one in making a positive assertion on the subject what competent palæontologist will affirm at this present moment that he knows anything about the period at which life originated or will assert more than the extreme probability that such origin was a long way antecedent to any traces of life at present known what physical geologist will affirm that he knows when dry land began to exist or will say more than that it was probably very much earlier than any extant direct evidence of terrestrial conditions indicates  i think i know pretty well the answers which the authorities quoted by mr gladstone would give to these questions but i leave it to them to give them if they think fit  if i ventured to speculate on the matter at all i should say it is by no means certain that sea is older than dry land inasmuch as a solid terrestrial surface may very well have existed before the earth was cool enough to allow of the existence of fluid water and 111 in this case dry land may have existed before the sea as to the first appearance of life the whole argument of analogy whatever it may be worth in such a case is in favour of the absence of living beings until long after the hot water seas had constituted themselves and of the subsequent appearance of aquatic before terrestrial forms of life but whether these protoplasts would if we could examine them be reckoned among the lowest microscopic algæ or fungi or among those doubtful organisms which lie in the debatable land between animals and plants is in my judgment a question on which a prudent biologist will reserve his opinion    i think that i have now disposed of those parts of mr gladstones defence in which i seem to discover a design to rescue his solemn plea for revelation but a great deal of the proem to genesis remains which i would gladly pass over in silence were such a course consistent with the respect due to so distinguished a champion of the reconcilers  i hope that my clientsthe people of average opinionshave by this time some confidence in me for when i tell them that after all mr gladstone is of opinion that the mosaic record was meant to give moral and not scientific instruction to those for whom it was written they may be disposed to think that i must be misleading them but let them listen further to what mr gladstone says in a compendious but not exactly correct statement respecting my opinions 112      he holds the writer responsible for scientific precision i look for     nothing of the kind but assign to him a statement general which     admits exceptions popular which aims mainly at producing moral     impression summary which cannot but be open to more or less of     criticism of detail he thinks it is a lecture i think it is a sermon     p 5  i note incidentally that mr gladstone appears to consider that the differentia between a lecture and a sermon is that the former so far as it deals with matters of fact may be taken seriously as meaning exactly what it says while a sermon may not i have quite enough on my hands without taking up the cudgels for the clergy who will probably find mr gladstones definition unflattering  but i am diverging from my proper business which is to say that i have given no ground for the ascription of these opinions and that as a matter of fact i do not hold them and never have held them it is mr gladstone and not i who will have it that the pentateuchal cosmogony is to be taken as science  my belief on the contrary is and long has been that the pentateuchal story of the creation is simply a myth i suppose it to be an hypothesis respecting the origin of the universe which some ancient thinker found himself able to reconcile with his knowledge or what he thought was knowledge of the nature of things and therefore assumed to be true as such i hold it to be not merely an interesting but a venerable monument of a stage in the mental progress of mankind and i find it difficult to suppose that any one who is acquainted with the cosmogonies of other 113 nationsand especially with those of the egyptians and the babylonians with whom the israelites were in such frequent and intimate communicationshould consider it to possess either more or less scientific importance than may be allotted to these  mr gladstones definition of a sermon permits me to suspect that he may not see much difference between that form of discourse and what i call a myth and i hope it may be something more than the slowness of apprehension to which i have confessed which leads me to imagine that a statement which is general but admits exceptions which is popular and aims mainly at producing moral impression summary and therefore open to criticism of detail amounts to a myth or perhaps less than a myth put algebraically it comes to this x  a  b  c always remembering that there is nothing to show the exact value of either a or b or c it is true that a is commonly supposed to equal 10 but there are exceptions and these may reduce it to 8 or 3 or 0 b also popularly means 10 but being chiefly used by the algebraist as a moral value you cannot do much with it in the addition or subtraction of mathematical values c also is quite summary and if you go into the details of which it is made up many of them may be wrong and their sum total equal to 0 or even to a minus quantity  mr gladstone appears to wish that i should 1 enter upon a sort of essay competition with the author of the pentateuchal cosmogony 2 that i should make a further statement about some 114 elementary facts in the history of indian and greek philosophy and 3 that i should show cause for my hesitation in accepting the assertion that genesis is supported at any rate to the extent of the first two verses by the nebular hypothesis  a certain sense of humour prevents me from accepting the first invitation i would as soon attempt to put hamlets soliloquy into a more scientific shape but if i supposed the mosaic writer to be inspired as mr gladstone does it would not be consistent with my notions of respect for the supreme being to imagine him unable to frame a form of words which should accurately or at least not inaccurately express his own meaning it is sometimes said that had the statements contained in the first chapter of genesis been scientifically true they would have been unintelligible to ignorant people but how is the matter mended if being scientifically untrue they must needs be rejected by instructed people  with respect to the second suggestion it would be presumptuous in me to pretend to instruct mr gladstone in matters which lie as much within the province of literature and history as in that of science but if any one desirous of further knowledge will be so good as to turn to that most excellent and by no means recondite source of information the encyclopædia britannica he will find under the letter e the word evolution and a long article on that subject now i do not recommend him to read the first half of the article but the second half by my 115 friend mr sully is really very good he will there find it said that in some of the philosophies of ancient india the idea of evolution is clearly expressed brahma is conceived as the eternal selfexistent being which on its material side unfolds itself to the world by gradually condensing itself to material objects through the gradations of ether fire water earth and other elements and again in the later system of emanation of sankhya there is a more marked approach to a materialistic doctrine of evolution what little knowledge i have of the matterchiefly derived from that very instructive book die religion des buddha by c f koeppen supplemented by hardys interesting worksleads me to think that mr sully might have spoken much more strongly as to the evolutionary character of indian philosophy and especially of that of the buddhists but the question is too large to be dealt with incidentally  and with respect to early greek philosophy16 the seeker after additional enlightenment need go no further than the same excellent storehouse of information      the early ionian physicists including thales anaximander and     anaximenes seek to explain the world as generated out of a primordial     matter which is at the same time the universal support of things this     substance is endowed with a generative or transmutative force by virtue     of which it passes into a 116 succession of forms they thus resemble     modern evolutionists since they regard the world with its infinite     variety of forms as issuing from a simple mode of matter  further on mr sully remarks that heraclitus deserves a prominent place in the history of the idea of evolution and he states with perfect justice that heraclitus has foreshadowed some of the special peculiarities of mr darwins views it is indeed a very strange circumstance that the philosophy of the great ephesian more than adumbrates the two doctrines which have played leading parts the one in the development of christian dogma the other in that of natural science the former is the conception of the word greek logos which took its jewish shape in alexandria and its christian form17 in that gospel which is usually referred to an ephesian source of some five centuries later date and the latter is that of the struggle for existence the saying that strife is father and king of all greek polemos pantôn men patêr esti panton de basileus ascribed to heraclitus would be a not inappropriate motto for the origin of species  i have referred only to mr sullys article because his authority is quite sufficient for my purpose but the consultation of any of the more elaborate histories of greek philosophy such as the great work of zeller for example will only bring out the same fact into still more striking prominence i have professed no minute acquaintance with either indian or greek philosophy but i have taken a great deal of pains to 117 secure that such knowledge as i do possess shall be accurate and trustworthy  in the third place mr gladstone appears to wish that i should discuss with him the question whether the nebular hypothesis is or is not confirmatory of the pentateuchal account of the origin of things mr gladstone appears to be prepared to enter upon this campaign with a light heart i confess i am not and my reason for this backwardness will doubtless surprise mr gladstone it is that rather more than a quarter of a century ago namely in february 1859 when it was my duty as president of the geological society to deliver the anniversary address18 i chose a topic which involved a very careful study of the remarkable cosmogonical speculation originally promulgated by immanuel kant and subsequently by laplace which is now known as the nebular hypothesis with the help of such little acquaintance with the principles of physics and astronomy as i had gained i endeavoured to obtain a clear understanding of this speculation in all its bearings i am not sure that i succeeded but of this i am certain that the problems involved are very difficult even for those who possess the intellectual discipline requisite for dealing with them and it was this conviction that led me to express my desire to leave the discussion of the question of the asserted harmony between genesis and the nebular hypothesis to experts in the appropriate branches of knowledge and i think my course was a 118 wise one but as mr gladstone evidently does not understand how there can be any hesitation on my part unless it arises from a conviction that he is in the right i may go so far as to set out my difficulties  they are of two kindsexegetical and scientific it appears to me that it is vain to discuss a supposed coincidence between genesis and science unless we have first settled on the one hand what genesis says and on the other hand what science says  in the first place i cannot find any consensus among biblical scholars as to the meaning of the words in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth some say that the hebrew word bara which is translated create means made out of nothing i venture to object to that rendering not on the ground of scholarship but of common sense omnipotence itself can surely no more make something out of nothing than it can make a triangular circle what is intended by made out of nothing appears to be caused to come into existence with the implication that nothing of the same kind previously existed it is further usually assumed that the heaven and the earth means the material substance of the universe hence the mosaic writer is taken to imply that where nothing of a material nature previously existed this substance appeared that is perfectly conceivable and therefore no one can deny that it may have happened but there are other very authoritative 119 critics who say that the ancient israelite19 who wrote the passage was not likely to have been capable of such abstract thinking and that as a matter of philology bara is commonly used to signify the fashioning or forming of that which already exists now it appears to me that the scientific investigator is wholly incompetent to say anything at all about the first origin of the material universe the whole power of his organon vanishes when he has to step beyond the chain of natural causes and effects no form of the nebular hypothesis that i know of is necessarily connected with any view of the origination of the nebular substance kants form of it expressly supposes that the nebular material from which one stellar system starts may be nothing but the disintegrated substance of a stellar and planetary system which has just come to an end therefore so far as i can see one who believes that matter has existed from all eternity has just as much right to hold the nebular hypothesis as one who believes that matter came into existence at a specified epoch in other words the nebular hypothesis and the creation hypothesis up to this point neither confirm nor oppose one another  next we read in the revisers version in which i suppose the ultimate results of critical scholarship to be embodied and the earth was waste without form in the authorised version and void most 120 people seem to think that this phraseology intends to imply that the matter out of which the world was to be formed was a veritable chaos devoid of law and order if this interpretation is correct the nebular hypothesis can have nothing to say to it the scientific thinker cannot admit the absence of law and order anywhere or anywhen in nature sometimes law and order are patent and visible to our limited vision sometimes they are hidden but every particle of the matter of the most fantasticlooking nebula in the heavens is a realm of law and order in itself and that it is so is the essential condition of the possibility of solar and planetary evolution from the apparent chaos20  waste is too vague a term to be worth consideration without form intelligible enough as a metaphor if taken literally is absurd for a material thing existing in space must have a superficies and if it has a superficies it has a form the wildest streaks of marestail clouds in the sky or the most irregular heavenly nebulæ have surely just as much form as a geometrical tetrahedron and as for void how can that be void which is full of matter as poetry these lines are vivid and admirable as a scientific statement which they must be taken to be if any one is justified in comparing them with another scientific statement they fail to convey any intelligible conception to my mind  121  the account proceeds and darkness was upon the face of the deep so be it but where then is the likeness to the celestial nebulæ of the existence of which we should know nothing unless they shone with a light of their own and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters i have met with no form of the nebular hypothesis which involves anything analogous to this process  i have said enough to explain some of the difficulties which arise in my mind when i try to ascertain whether there is any foundation for the contention that the statements contained in the first two verses of genesis are supported by the nebular hypothesis the result does not appear to me to be exactly favourable to that contention the nebular hypothesis assumes the existence of matter having definite properties as its foundation whether such matter was created a few thousand years ago or whether it has existed through an eternal series of metamorphoses of which our present universe is only the last stage are alternatives neither of which is scientifically untenable and neither scientifically demonstrable but science knows nothing of any stage in which the universe could be said in other than a metaphorical and popular sense to be formless or empty or in any respect less the seat of law and order than it is now one might as well talk of a freshlaid hens egg being without form and void because the chick therein is potential and not actual as apply such terms to the nebulous mass which contains a potential solar system 122  until some further enlightenment comes to me then i confess myself wholly unable to understand the way in which the nebular hypothesis is to be converted into an ally of the mosaic writer21  but mr gladstone informs us that professor dana and professor guyot are prepared to prove that the first or cosmogonical portion of the proem not only accords with but teaches the nebular hypothesis there is no one to whose authority on geological questions i am more readily disposed to bow than that of my eminent friend professor dana but i am familiar with what he has previously said on this topic in his wellknown and standard work into which strangely enough it does not seem to have occurred to mr gladstone to look before he set out upon his present undertaking and unless professor danas latest contribution which i have not yet met with takes up altogether new ground i am afraid i shall 123 not be able to extricate myself by its help from my present difficulties  it is a very long time since i began to think about the relations between modern scientifically ascertained truths and the cosmogonical speculations of the writer of genesis and as i think that mr gladstone might have been able to put his case with a good deal more force if he had thought it worth while to consult the last chapter of professor danas admirable manual of geology so i think he might have been made aware that he was undertaking an enterprise of which he had not counted the cost if he had chanced upon a discussion of the subject which i published in 187722  finally i should like to draw the attention of those who take interest in these topics to the weighty words of one of the most learned and moderate of biblical critics      a propos de cette première page de la bible on a coutume de nos jours     de disserter à perte de vue sur laccord du récit mosaïque avec les     sciences naturelles et comme cellesci tout éloignées quelles sont     encore de la perfection absolue ont rendu populaires et en quelque     sorte irréfragables un certain nombre de faits généraux ou de thèses     fondamentales de la cosmologie et de la géologie cest le texte sacré     quon sévertue à torturer pour le faire concorder avec ces     données23  in my paper on the interpreters of nature and the interpreters of genesis while freely availing myself of the rights of a scientific critic i endeavoured to keep the expression of my views well within those 124 bounds of courtesy which are set by selfrespect and consideration for others i am therefore glad to be favoured with mr gladstones acknowledgment of the success of my efforts i only wish that i could accept all the products of mr gladstones gracious appreciation but there is one about which as a matter of honesty i hesitate in fact if i had expressed my meaning better than i seem to have done i doubt if this particular proffer of mr gladstones thanks would have been made  to my mind whatever doctrine professes to be the result of the application of the accepted rules of inductive and deductive logic to its subjectmatter and accepts within the limits which it sets to itself the supremacy of reason is science whether the subjectmatter consists of realities or unrealities truths or falsehoods is quite another question i conceive that ordinary geometry is science by reason of its method and i also believe that its axioms definitions and conclusions are all true however there is a geometry of four dimensions which i also believe to be science because its method professes to be strictly scientific it is true that i cannot conceive four dimensions in space and therefore for me the whole affair is unreal but i have known men of great intellectual powers who seemed to have no difficulty either in conceiving them or at any rate in imagining how they could conceive them and therefore fourdimensioned geometry comes under my notion of science so i think astrology is a science in so far as it professes to reason logically from principles 125 established by just inductive methods to prevent misunderstanding perhaps i had better add that i do not believe one whit in astrology but no more do i believe in ptolemaic astronomy or in the catastrophic geology of my youth although these in their day claimedand to my mind rightly claimedthe name of science if nothing is to be called science but that which is exactly true from beginning to end i am afraid there is very little science in the world outside mathematics among the physical sciences i do not know that any could claim more than that it is true within certain limits so narrow that for the present at any rate they may be neglected if such is the case i do not see where the line is to be drawn between exactly true partially true and mainly untrue forms of science and what i have said about the current theology at the end of my paper p 95 leaves i think no doubt as to the category in which i rank it for all that i think it would be not only unjust but almost impertinent to refuse the name of science to the summa of st thomas or to the institutes of calvin    in conclusion i confess that my supposed unjaded appetite for the sort of controversy in which it needed not mr gladstones express declaration to tell us he is far better practised than i am though probably without another express declaration no one would have suspected that his controversial fires are burning low is already satiated  in elysium we conduct scientific discussions in 126 a different medium and we are liable to threatenings of asphyxia in that atmosphere of contention in which mr gladstone has been able to live alert and vigorous beyond the common race of men as if it were purest mountain air i trust that he may long continue to seek truth under the difficult conditions he has chosen for the search with unabated energyi had almost said fire    may age not wither him nor custom stale   his infinite variety  but elysium suits my less robust constitution better and i beg leave to retire thither not sorry for my experience of the other regionno one should regret experiencebut determined not to repeat it at any rate in reference to the plea for revelation                                           note on the proper sense of the mosaic narrative of the creation      it has been objected to my argument from leviticus p 103 that the     hebrew words translated by creeping things in genesis i 24 and     leviticus xi 29 are different namely rehmes in the former     shehretz in the latter the obvious reply to this objection is that     the question is not one of words but of the meaning of words to borrow     an illustration from our own language if crawling things had been     used by the translators in genesis and creeping things in leviticus     it would not have been necessarily implied that they intended to denote     different groups of animals shehretz is employed in a wider sense     than rehmes there are shehretz of the waters of the earth of     the air and of the land leviticus speaks of land reptiles among     other animals as shehretz genesis speaks of all creeping land     animals among which land reptiles are necessarily included as     rehmes our translators therefore 127 have given the true sense     when they render both shehretz and rehmes by creeping things      having taken a good deal of trouble to show what genesis iii 4 does     not mean in the preceding pages perhaps it may be well that i should     briefly give my opinion as to what it does mean i conceive that the     unknown author of this part of the hexateuchal compilation believed     and meant his readers to believe that his words as they understood     themthat is to say in their ordinary natural senseconveyed the     actual historical truth when he says that such and such things     happened i believe him to mean that they actually occurred and not     that he imagined or dreamed them when he says day i believe he uses     the word in the popular sense when he says made or created i     believe he means that they came into being by a process analogous to     that which the people whom he addressed called making or creating     and i think that unless we forget our present knowledge of nature     and putting ourselves back into the position of a phoenician or a     chaldæan philosopher start from his conception of the world we shall     fail to grasp the meaning of the hebrew writer we must conceive the     earth to be an immovable more or less flattened body with the vault     of heaven above the watery abyss below and around we must imagine     sun moon and stars to be set in a firmament with or in which     they move and above which is yet another watery mass we must consider     light and darkness to be things the alternation of which     constitutes day and night independently of the existence of sun moon     and stars we must further suppose that as in the case of the story of     the deluge the hebrew writer was acquainted with a gentile probably     chaldæan or accadian account of the origin of things in which he     substantially believed but which he stripped of all its idolatrous     associations by substituting elohim for ea anu bel and the like      from this point of view the first verse strikes the keynote of the     whole in the beginning elohim24 created the heaven and the earth     heaven and earth were not primitive existences from which the gods     proceeded as the gentiles taught on the contrary the powers     preceded and created heaven and earth 128 whether by creation is     meant causing to be where nothing was before or shaping of something     which preexisted seems to me to be an insoluble question      as i have pointed out the second verse has an interesting parallel in     jeremiah iv 23 i beheld the earth and lo it was waste and void     and the heavens and they had no light i conceive that there is no     more allusion to chaos in the one than in the other the earthdisk lay     in its watery envelope like the yolk of an egg in the glaire and     the spirit or breath of elohim stirred the mass light was created as     a thing by itself and its antithesis darkness as another thing it     was supposed to be the nature of these two to alternate and a pair of     alternations constituted a day in the sense of an unit of time      the next step was necessarily the formation of that firmament or     dome over the earthdisk which was supposed to support the celestial     waters and in which sun moon and stars were conceived to be set as     in a sort of orrery the earth was still surrounded and covered by the     lower waters but the upper were separated from it by the firmament     beneath which what we call the air lay a second alternation of     darkness and light marks the lapse of time      after this the waters which covered the earthdisk under the     firmament were drawn away into certain regions which became seas     while the part laid bare became dry land in accordance with the     notion universally accepted in antiquity that moist earth possesses     the potentiality of giving rise to living beings the land at the     command of elohim put forth all sorts of plants they are made to     appear thus early not i apprehend from any notion that plants are     lower in the scale of being than animals which would seem to be     inconsistent with the prevalence of tree worship among ancient people     but rather because animals obviously depend on plants and because     without crops and harvests there seemed to be no particular need of     heavenly signs for the seasons      these were provided by the fourth days work light existed already     but now vehicles for the distribution of light in a special manner and     with varying degrees of intensity were provided i conceive that the     previous alternations of light and darkness were supposed to go on but     that the light was 129 strengthened during the daytime by the sun     which as a source of heat as well as of light glided up the firmament     from the east and slid down in the west each day very probably each     days sun was supposed to be a new one and as the light of the day     was strengthened by the sun so the darkness of the night was weakened     by the moon which regularly waxed and waned every month the stars     are as it were thrown in and nothing can more sharply mark the     doctrinal purpose of the author than the manner in which he deals with     the heavenly bodies which the gentiles identified so closely with     their gods as if they were mere accessories to the almanac      animals come next in order of creation and the general notion of the     writer seems to be that they were produced by the medium in which they     live that is to say the aquatic animals by the waters and the     terrestrial animals by the land but there was a difficulty about     flying things such as bats birds and insects the cosmogonist seems     to have had no conception of air as an elemental body his elements     are earth and water and he ignores air as much as he does fire birds     fly above the earth in the open firmament or on the face of the     expanse of heaven they are not said to fly through the air the     choice of a generative medium for flying things therefore seemed to     lie between water and earth and if we take into account the     conspicuousness of the great flocks of waterbirds and the swarms of     winged insects which appear to arise from water i think the     preference of water becomes intelligible however i do not put this     forward as more than a probable hypothesis as to the creation of     aquatic animals on the fifth that of land animals on the sixth day     and that of man last of all i presume the order was determined by the     fact that man could hardly receive dominion over the living world     before it existed and that the cattle were not wanted until he was     about to make his appearance the other terrestrial animals would     naturally be associated with the cattle      the absurdity of imagining that any conception analogous to that of a     zoological classification was in the mind of the writer will be     apparent when we consider that the fifth days work must include the     zoologists cetacea sirenia and seals25 all of which are 130     mammalia all birds turtles seasnakes and presumably the fresh     water reptilia and amphibia with the great majority of     invertebrata      the creation of man is announced as a separate act resulting from a     particular resolution of elohim to make man in our image after our     likeness to learn what this remarkable phrase means we must turn to     the fifth chapter of genesis the work of the same writer in the day     that elohim created man in the likeness of elohim made he him male     and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam     in the day when they were created and adam lived an hundred and thirty     years and begat a son in his own likeness after his image and     called his name seth i find it impossible to read this passage     without being convinced that when the writer says adam was made in the     likeness of elohim he means the same sort of likeness as when he says     that seth was begotten in the likeness of adam whence it follows that     his conception of elohim was completely anthropomorphic        in all this narrative i can discover nothing which differentiates it     in principle from other ancient cosmogonies except the rejection of     all gods save the vague yet anthropomorphic elohim and the     assigning to them anteriority and superiority to the world it is as     utterly irreconcilable with the assured truths of modern science as it     is with the account of the origin of man plants and animals given by     the writer of the second chief constituent of the hexateuch in the     second chapter of genesis this extraordinary story starts with the     assumption of the existence of a rainless earth devoid of plants and     herbs of the field the creation of living beings begins with that of a     solitary man the next thing that happens is the laying out of the     garden of eden and the causing the growth from its soil of every tree     that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the third act is the     formation out of the ground of every beast of the field and every     fowl of the air the fourth and last the manufacture of the first     woman from a rib extracted from adam while in a state of anæsthesia      yet there are people who not only profess to take this monstrous legend     seriously but who declare it to be reconcilable with the elohistic     account of the creation                                        131  iv  the evolution of theology an anthropological study  i conceive that the origin the growth the decline and the fall of those speculations respecting the existence the powers and the dispositions of beings analogous to men but more or less devoid of corporeal qualities which may be broadly included under the head of theology are phenomena the study of which legitimately falls within the province of the anthropologist and it is purely as a question of anthropology a department of biology to which i have at various times given a good deal of attention that i propose to treat of the evolution of theology in the following pages  with theology as a code of dogmas which are to be believed or at any rate repeated under penalty of present or future punishment or as a storehouse of anæsthetics for those who find the pains of life too hard to bear i have nothing to do and so far as it may be possible i shall avoid the expression of any opinion as to the objective truth or falsehood of the systems of theological speculation of which i may 132 find occasion to speak from my present point of view theology is regarded as a natural product of the operations of the human mind under the conditions of its existence just as any other branch of science or the arts of architecture or music or painting are such products like them theology has a history like them also it is to be met with in certain simple and rudimentary forms and these can be connected by a multitude of gradations which exist or have existed among people of various ages and races with the most highly developed theologies of past and present times it is not my object to interfere even in the slightest degree with beliefs which anybody holds sacred or to alter the conviction of any one who is of opinion that in dealing with theology we ought to be guided by considerations different from those which would be thought appropriate if the problem lay in the province of chemistry or of mineralogy and if people of these ways of thinking choose to read beyond the present paragraph the responsibility for meeting with anything they may dislike rests with them and not with me    we are all likely to be more familiar with the theological history of the israelites than with that of any other nation we may therefore fitly make it the first object of our studies and it will be convenient to commence with that period which lies between the invasion of canaan and the early days of the monarchy and answers to the eleventh and twelfth 133 centuries bc or thereabouts the evidence on which any conclusion as to the nature of israelitic theology in those days must be based is wholly contained in the hebrew scripturesan agglomeration of documents which certainly belong to very different ages but of the exact dates and authorship of any one of which except perhaps one or two of the prophetical writings there is no evidence either internal or external so far as i can discover of such a nature as to justify more than a confession of ignorance or at most an approximate conclusion in this venerable record of ancient life miscalled a book when it is really a library comparable to a selection of works from english literature between the times of beda and those of milton we have the stratified deposits often confused and even with their natural order inverted left by the stream of the intellectual and moral life of israel during many centuries and embedded in these strata there are numerous remains of forms of thought which once lived and which though often unfortunately mere fragments are of priceless value to the anthropologist our task is to rescue these from their relatively unimportant surroundings and by careful comparison with existing forms of theology to make the dead world which they record live again in other words our problem is palæontological and the method pursued must be the same as that employed in dealing with other fossil remains  among the richest of the fossiliferous strata to which i have alluded are the books of judges and 134 samuel26 it has often been observed that these writings stand out in marked relief from those which precede and follow them in virtue of a certain archaic freshness and of a greater freedom from traces of late interpolation and editorial trimming jephthah gideon and samson are men of old heroic stamp who would look as much in place in a norse saga as where they are and if the varnishbrush of later respectability has passed over these memoirs of the mighty men of a wild age here and there it has not succeeded in effacing or even in seriously obscuring the essential characteristics of the theology traditionally ascribed to their epoch  there is nothing that i have met with in the results of biblical criticism inconsistent with the conviction that these books give us a fairly trustworthy account of israelitic life and thought in the times which they cover and as such apart from the great literary merit of many of their episodes they possess the interest of being perhaps the oldest genuine history as apart from mere chronicles on the one hand and mere legends on the other at present accessible to us  but it is often said with exultation by writers of 135 one party and often admitted more or less unwillingly by their opponents that these books are untrustworthy by reason of being full of obviously unhistoric tales and as a notable example the narrative of sauls visit to the socalled witch of endor is often cited as i have already intimated i have nothing to do with theological partisanship either heterodox or orthodox nor for my present purpose does it matter very much whether the story is historically true or whether it merely shows what the writer believed but looking at the matter solely from the point of view of an anthropologist i beg leave to express the opinion that the account of sauls necromantic expedition is quite consistent with probability that is to say i see no reason whatever to doubt firstly that saul made such a visit and secondly that he and all who were present including the wise woman of endor herself would have given with entire sincerity very much the same account of the business as that which we now read in the twentyeighth chapter of the first book of samuel and i am further of opinion that this story is one of the most important of those fossils to which i have referred in the material which it offers for the reconstruction of the theology of the time let us therefore study it attentivelynot merely as a narrative which in the dramatic force of its gruesome simplicity is not surpassed if it is equalled by the witch scenes in macbethbut as a piece of evidence bearing on an important anthropological problem  we are told 1 sam xxviii that saul encamped 136 at gilboa became alarmed by the strength of the philistine army gathered at shunem he therefore inquired of jahveh but jahveh answered him not neither by dreams nor by urim nor by prophets27 thus deserted by jahveh saul in his extremity bethought him of those that had familiar spirits and the wizards whom he is said at some previous time to have put out of the land but who seem nevertheless to have been very imperfectly banished since sauls servants in answer to his command to seek him a woman that hath a familiar spirit reply without a sign of hesitation or of fear behold there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at endor just as in some parts of england a countryman might tell any one who did not look like a magistrate or a policeman where a wise woman was to be met with saul goes to this woman who after being assured of immunity asks whom shall i bring up to thee whereupon saul says bring me up samuel the woman immediately sees an apparition but to saul nothing is visible for he asks what seest thou and the woman replies i see elohim coming up out of the earth still the spectre remains invisible to saul for he asks what form is he of and she replies an old man cometh up and he is covered with a robe so far therefore the wise woman unquestionably plays the part of a medium and saul is dependent upon her version of what happens  137  the account continues      and saul perceived that it was samuel and he bowed with his face to     the ground and did obeisance and samuel said to saul why hast thou     disquieted me to bring me up and saul answered i am sore distressed     for the philistines make war against me and elohim is departed from me     and answereth me no more neither by prophets nor by dreams therefore     i have called thee that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do     and samuel said wherefore then dost thou ask of me seeing that jahveh     is departed from thee and is become thine adversary and jahveh hath     wrought for himself as he spake by me and jahveh hath rent the     kingdom out of thine hand and given it to thy neighbour even to david     because thou obeyedst not the voice of jahveh and didst not execute his     fierce wrath upon amalek therefore hath jahveh done this thing unto     thee this day moreover jahveh will deliver israel also with thee into     the hand of the philistines and tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be     with me jahveh shall deliver the host of israel also into the hand of     the philistines then saul fell straightway his full length upon the     earth and was sore afraid because of the words of samuel  v     1420  the statement that saul perceived that it was samuel is not to be taken to imply that even now saul actually saw the shade of the prophet but only that the womans allusion to the prophetic mantle and to the aged appearance of the spectre convinced him that it was samuel reuss28 in fact translates the passage alors saul reconnut que cétait samuel 138 nor does the dialogue between saul and samuel necessarily or probably signify that samuel spoke otherwise than by the voice of the wise woman the septuagint does not hesitate to call her greek engastrimuthos that is to say a ventriloquist implying that it was she who spokeand this view of the matter is in harmony with the fact that the exact sense of the hebrew words which are translated as a woman that hath a familiar spirit is a woman mistress of ob ob means primitively a leather bottle such as a wine skin and is applied alike to the necromancer and to the spirit evoked its use in these senses appears to have been suggested by the likeness of the hollow sound emitted by a halfempty skin when struck to the sepulchral tones in which the oracles of the evoked spirits were uttered by the medium it is most probable that in accordance with the general theory of spiritual influences which obtained among the old israelites the spirit of samuel was conceived to pass into the body of the wise woman and to use her vocal organs to speak in his own namefor i cannot discover that they drew any clear distinction between possession and inspiration29  if the story of sauls consultation of the occult powers is to be regarded as an authentic narrative or at any rate as a statement which is perfectly veracious so far as the intention of the narrator goesand as i have said i see no reason for refusing it this characterit will be found on further consideration 139 to throw a flood of light both directly and indirectly on the theology of sauls countrymenthat is to say upon their beliefs respecting the nature and ways of spiritual beings  even without the confirmation of other abundant evidences to the same effect it leaves no doubt as to the existence among them of the fundamental doctrine that man consists of a body and of a spirit which last after the death of the body continues to exist as a ghost at the time of sauls visit to endor samuel was dead and buried but that his spirit would be believed to continue to exist in sheol may be concluded from the wellknown passage in the song attributed to hannah his mother    jahveh killeth and maketh alive   he bringeth down to sheol and bringeth up    1 sam ii 6  and it is obvious that this sheol was thought to be a place underground in which samuels spirit had been disturbed by the necromancers summons and in which after his return thither he would be joined by the spirits of saul and his sons when they had met with their bodily death on the hill of gilboa it is further to be observed that the spirit or ghost of the dead man presents itself as the image of the man himselfit is the man not merely in his ordinary corporeal presentment even down to the prophets mantle but in his moral and intellectual characteristics samuel who had begun as sauls friend and ended as his bitter enemy gives it to be understood that he is annoyed at sauls presumption in 140 disturbing him and that in sheol he is as much the devoted servant of jahveh and as much empowered to speak in jahvehs name as he was during his sojourn in the upper air  it appears now to be universally admitted that before the exile the israelites had no belief in rewards and punishments after death nor in anything similar to the christian heaven and hell but our story proves that it would be an error to suppose that they did not believe in the continuance of individual existence after death by a ghostly simulacrum of life nay i think it would be very hard to produce conclusive evidence that they disbelieved in immortality for i am not aware that there is anything to show that they thought the existence of the souls of the dead in sheol ever came to an end but they do not seem to have conceived that the condition of the souls in sheol was in any way affected by their conduct in life if there was immortality there was no state of retribution in their theology samuel expects saul and his sons to come to him in sheol  the next circumstance to be remarked is that the name of elohim is applied to the spirit which the woman sees coming up out of the earth that is to say from sheol the authorised version translates this in its literal sense gods the revised version gives god with gods in the margin reuss renders the word by spectre remarking in a note that it is not quite exact but that the word elohim expresses something divine that is to say superhuman commanding respect and terror histoire 141 des israelites p 321 tuch in his commentary on genesis and thenius in his commentary on samuel express substantially the same opinion dr alexander in kittos cyclopædia s v god has the following instructive remarks      elohim is sometimes used vaguely to describe unseen powers or     superhuman beings that are not properly thought of as divine thus the     witch of endor saw elohim ascending out of the earth 1 sam xxviii     13 meaning thereby some beings of an unearthly superhuman character     so also in zechariah xii 8 it is said the house of david shall be as     elohim as the angel of the lord where as the transition from elohim     to the angel of the lord is a minori ad majus we must regard the     former as a vague designation of supernatural powers  dr alexander speaks here of beings but there is no reason to suppose that the wise woman of endor referred to anything but a solitary spectre and it is quite clear that saul understood her in this sense for he asks what form is he of  this fact that the name of elohim is applied to a ghost or disembodied soul conceived as the image of the body in which it once dwelt is of no little importance for it is well known that the same term was employed to denote the gods of the heathen who were thought to have definite quasicorporeal forms and to be as much real entities as any other elohim30 the difference which was supposed to exist 142 between the different elohim was one of degree not one of kind elohim was in logical terminology the genus of which ghosts chemosh dagon baal and jahveh were species the israelite believed jahveh to be immeasurably superior to all other kinds of elohim the inscription on the moabite stone shows that king mesa held chemosh to be as unquestionably the superior of jahveh but if jahveh was thus supposed to differ only in degree from the undoubtedly zoomorphic or anthropomorphic gods of the nations why is it to be assumed that he also was not thought of as having a human shape it is possible for those who forget that the time of the great prophetic writers is at least as remote from that of saul as our day is from that of queen elizabeth to insist upon interpreting the gross notions current in the earlier age and among the mass of the people by the refined conceptions promulgated by a few select spirits centuries later but if we take the language constantly used concerning the deity in the books of genesis exodus joshua judges samuel or kings in its natural sense and i am aware of no valid reason which can be given for taking it in any other sense there cannot to my mind be a doubt that jahveh was conceived by those from whom the substance of these books is mainly derived to possess the appearance and the intellectual and moral attributes of a man and indeed of a man of just that type with which the israelites were familiar in their stronger and intellectually abler rulers and leaders in a wellknown passage of genesis i 27 elohim is said to 143 have created man in his own image in the image of elohim created he him it is man who is here said to be the image of elohimnot mans soul alone still less his reason but the whole man it is obvious that for those who called a manlike ghost elohim there could be no difficulty in conceiving any other elohim under the same aspect and if there could be any doubt on this subject surely it cannot stand in the face of what we find in the fifth chapter where immediately after a repetition of the statement that elohim created man in the likeness of elohim made he him it is said that adam begat seth in his own likeness after his image does this mean that seth resembled adam only in a spiritual and figurative sense and if that interpretation of the third verse of the fifth chapter of genesis is absurd why does it become reasonable in the first verse of the same chapter  but let us go further is not the jahveh who walks in the garden in the cool of the day from whom one may hope to hide oneself among the trees of whom it is expressly said that moses and aaron nadab and abihu and seventy of the elders of israel saw the elohim of israel exod xxiv 911 and that although the seeing jahveh was understood to be a high crime and misdemeanour worthy of death under ordinary circumstances yet for this once he laid not his hand on the nobles of israel that they beheld elohim and did eat and drink and that afterwards moses saw his back exod xxxiii 23is not this deity conceived as manlike in form 144 again is not the jahveh who eats with abraham under the oaks at mamre who is pleased with the sweet savour of noahs sacrifice to whom sacrifices are said to be food31is not this deity depicted as possessed of human appetites if this were not the current israelitish idea of jahveh even in the eighth century bc where is the point of isaiahs scathing admonitions to his countrymen to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me saith jahveh i am full of the burntofferings of rams and the fat of fed beasts and i delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of hegoats isa i 11 or of micahs inquiry will jahveh be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil vi 7 and in the innumerable passages in which jahveh is said to be jealous of other gods to be angry to be appeased and to repent in which he is represented as casting off saul because the king does not quite literally execute a command of the most ruthless severity or as smiting uzzah to death because the unfortunate man thoughtlessly but naturally enough put out his hand to stay the ark from fallingcan any one deny that the old israelites conceived jahveh not only in the image of a man but in that of a changeable irritable and occasionally violent man there appears to me then to be no reason to doubt that the notion of likeness to man which was indubitably held of the 145 ghost elohim was carried out consistently throughout the whole series of elohim and that jahvehelohim was thought of as a being of the same substantially human nature as the rest only immeasurably more powerful for good and for evil  the absence of any real distinction between the elohim of different ranks is further clearly illustrated by the corresponding absence of any sharp delimitation between the various kinds of people who serve as the media of communication between them and men the agents through whom the lower elohim are consulted are called necromancers wizards and diviners and are looked down upon by the prophets and priests of the higher elohim but the seer connects the two and they are all alike in their essential characters of media the wise woman of endor was believed by others and i have little doubt believed herself to be able to bring up whom she would from sheol and to be inspired whether in virtue of actual possession by the evoked elohim or otherwise with a knowledge of hidden things i am unable to see that sauls servant took any really different view of samuels powers though he may have believed that he obtained them by the grace of the higher elohim for when saul fails to find his fathers asses his servant says to him      behold there is in this city a man of elohim and he is a man that is     held in honour all that he saith cometh surely to pass now let us go     thither peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we     go then said saul to his servant but behold if we go what shall we     bring the man for the bread is spent in our vessels and there is not a     present to 146 bring to the man of elohim what have we and the     servant answered saul again and said behold i have in my hand the     fourth part of a shekel of silver that will i give to the man of     elohim to tell us our way beforetime in israel when a man went to     inquire of elohim then he said come and let us go to the seer for he     that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer32 1 sam     ix 610  in fact when shortly afterwards saul accidentally meets samuel he says tell me i pray thee where the seers house is samuel answers i am the seer immediately afterwards samuel informs saul that the asses are found though how he obtained his knowledge of the fact is not stated it will be observed that samuel is not spoken of here as in any special sense a seer or prophet of jahveh but as a man of elohimthat is to say a seer having access to the spiritual powers just as the wise woman of endor might have been said to be a woman of elohimand the narrators or editors explanatory note seems to indicate that prophet is merely a name introduced later than the time of samuel for a superior kind of seer or man of elohim33  another very instructive passage shows that samuel was not only considered to be diviner seer and prophet in one but that he was also to all intents and purposes priest of jahvehthough 147 according to his biographer he was not a member of the tribe of levi at the outset of their acquaintance samuel says to saul go up before me into the high place where as the young maidens of the city had just before told saul the seer was going for the people will not eat till he come because he doth bless the sacrifice 1 sam x 12 the use of the word bless hereas if samuel were not going to sacrifice but only to offer a blessing or thanksgivingis curious but that samuel really acted as priest seems plain from what follows for he not only asks saul to share in the customary sacrificial feast but he disposes in sauls favour of that portion of the victim which the levitical legislation doubtless embodying old customs recognises as the priests special property34  although particular persons adopted the profession of media between men and elohim there was no limitation of the power in the view of ancient israel to any special class of the population saul inquires of jahveh and builds him altars on his own account and in the very remarkable story told in the 148 fourteenth chapter of the first book of samuel v 3746 saul appears to conduct the whole process of divination although he has a priest at his elbow david seems to do the same  moreover elohim constantly appear in dreamswhich in old israel did not mean that as we should say the subject of the appearance dreamed he saw the spirit but that he veritably saw the elohim which as a soul visited his soul while his body was asleep and in the course of the history of israel jahveh himself thus appears to all sorts of persons nonisraelites as well as israelites again the elohim possess or inspire people against their will as in the case of saul and sauls messengers and then these people prophesythat is to say raveand exhibit the ungoverned gestures attributed by a later age to possession by malignant spirits apart from other evidence to be adduced by and by the history of ancient demonology and of modern revivalism does not permit me to doubt that the accounts of these phenomena given in the history of saul may be perfectly historical  in the ritual practices of which evidence is to be found in the books of judges and samuel the chief part is played by sacrifices usually burnt offerings whenever the aid of the elohim of israel is sought or thanks are considered due to him an altar is built and oxen sheep and goats are slaughtered and offered up sometimes the entire victim is burnt as a holocaust more frequently only certain parts notably the fat about the kidneys are burnt on the 149 altar the rest is properly cooked and after the reservation of a part for the priest is made the foundation of a joyous banquet in which the sacrificer his family and such guests as he thinks fit to invite participate35 elohim was supposed to share in the feast and it has been already shown that that which was set apart on the altar or consumed by fire was spoken of as the food of elohim who was thought to be influenced by the costliness or by the pleasant smell of the sacrifice in favour of the sacrificer  all this bears out the view that in the mind of the old israelite there was no difference save one of degree between one elohim and another it is true that there is but little direct evidence to show that the old israelites shared the widespread belief of their own and indeed of all times that the spirits of the dead not only continue to exist but are capable of a ghostly kind of feeding and are grateful for such aliment as can be assimilated by their attenuated substance and even for clothes ornaments and weapons36 that they were familiar with this doctrine in the time of the captivity is suggested by the wellknown reference of ezekiel xxxii 27 to the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised which 150 are gone down to sheol hell with their weapons of war and have laid their swords under their heads perhaps there is a still earlier allusion in the giving of food for the dead spoken of in deuteronomy xxvi 1437  it must be remembered that the literature of the old israelites as it lies before us has been subjected to the revisal of strictly monotheistic editors violently opposed to all kinds of idolatry who are not likely to have selected from the materials at their disposal any obvious evidence either of the practice under discussion or of that ancestorworship which is so closely related to it for preservation in the permanent records of their people  the mysterious objects known as teraphim which are occasionally mentioned in judges samuel and elsewhere however can hardly be interpreted otherwise than as indications of the existence both of ancestorworship and of imageworship in old israel 151 the teraphim were certainly images of family gods and as such in all probability represented deceased ancestors laban indignantly demands of his soninlaw wherefore hast thou stolen my elohim which rachel who must be assumed to have worshipped jacobs god jahveh had carried off obviously because she like her father believed in their divinity it is not suggested that jacob was in any way scandalised by the idolatrous practices of his favourite wife whatever he may have thought of her honesty when the truth came to light for the teraphim seem to have remained in his camp at least until he hid his strange gods under the oak that was by shechem gen xxxv 4 and indeed it is open to question if he got rid of them then for the subsequent history of israel renders it more than doubtful whether the teraphim were regarded as strange gods even as late as the eighth century bc  the writer of the books of samuel takes it quite as a matter of course that michal daughter of one royal jahveh worshipper and wife of the servant of jahveh par excellence the pious david should have her teraphim handy in her and davids chamber when she dresses them up in their bed into a simulation of her husband for the purpose of deceiving her fathers messengers even one of the early prophets hosea when he threatens that the children of israel shall abide many days without ephod or teraphim iii 4 appears to regard both as equally proper appurtenances of the suspended worship of jahveh and equally certain to be restored when that is resumed 152 when we further take into consideration that only in the reign of hezekiah was the brazen serpent preserved in the temple and believed to be the work of moses destroyed and the practice of offering incense to it that is worshipping it abolishedthat jeroboam could set up calves of gold for israel to worship with apparently none but a political object and certainly with no notion of creating a schism among the worshippers of jahveh or of repelling the men of judah from his standardit seems obvious either that the israelites of the tenth and eleventh centuries bc knew not the second commandment or that they construed it merely as part of the prohibition to worship any supreme god other than jahveh which precedes it  in seeking for information about the teraphim i lighted upon the following passage in the valuable article on that subject by archdeacon farrar in kittos cyclopædia of biblical literature which is so much to the purpose of my argument that i venture to quote it in full      the main and certain results of this review are that the teraphim were     rude human images that the use of them was an antique aramaic custom     that there is reason to suppose them to have been images of deceased     ancestors that they were consulted oracularly that they were not     confined to jews that their use continued down to the latest period of     jewish history and lastly that although the enlightened prophets and     strictest later kings regarded them as idolatrous the priests were     much less averse to such images and their cult was not considered in     any way repugnant to the pious worship of elohim nay even to the     worship of him under the awful title of jehovah in fact they     involved a monotheistic idolatry very different indeed from 153     polytheism and the tolerance of them by priests as compared with the     denunciation of them by the prophets offers a close analogy to the     views of the roman catholics respecting pictures and images as compared     with the views of protestants it was against this use of idolatrous     symbols and emblems in a monotheistic worship that the second     commandment was directed whereas the first is aimed against the graver     sin of direct polytheism but the whole history of israel shows how     utterly and how early the law must have fallen into desuetude the     worship of the golden calf and of the calves at dan and bethel against     which so far as we know neither elijah nor elisha said a single word     the tolerance of high places teraphim and betylia the offering of     incense for centuries to the brazen serpent destroyed by hezekiah the     occasional glimpses of the most startling irregularities sanctioned     apparently even in the temple worship itself prove most decisively     that a pure monotheism and an independence of symbols was the result of     a slow and painful course of gods disciplinal dealings among the     noblest thinkers of a single nation and not as is so constantly and     erroneously urged the instinct of the whole semitic race in other     words one single branch of the semites was under gods providence     educated into pure monotheism only by centuries of misfortune and     series of inspired men vol iii p 986  it appears to me that the researches of the anthropologist lead him to conclusions identical in substance if not in terms with those here enunciated as the result of a careful study of the same subject from a totally different point of view  there is abundant evidence in the books of samuel and elsewhere that an article of dress termed an ephod was supposed to have a peculiar efficacy in enabling the wearer to exercise divination by means of jahvehelohim great and long continued have been the disputes as to the exact nature of the ephodwhether it always means something to wear or 154 whether it sometimes means an image but the probabilities are that it usually signifies a kind of waistcoat or broad zone with shoulderstraps which the person who inquired of jahveh put on in 1 samuel xxiii 2 david appears to have inquired without an ephod for abiathar the priest is said to have come down with an ephod in his hand only subsequently and then david asks for it before inquiring of jahveh whether the men of keilah would betray him or not davids action is obviously divination pure and simple and it is curious that he seems to have worn the ephod himself and not to have employed abiathar as a medium how the answer was given is not clear though the probability is that it was obtained by casting lots the urim and thummim seem to have been two such lots of a peculiarly sacred character which were carried in the pocket of the high priests breastplate this last was worn along with the ephod  with the exception of one passage 1 sam xiv 18 the ark is ignored in the history of saul but in this place the septuagint reads ephod for ark while in 1 chronicles xiii 3 david says that we sought not unto it the ark in the days of saul nor does samuel seem to have paid any regard to the ark after its return from philistia though in his childhood he is said to have slept in the temple of jahveh where the ark of elohim was 1 sam iii 3 at shiloh and there to have been the seer of the earliest apparitions vouchsafed to him by jahveh the space between the cherubim or winged images on the 155 canopy or cover kapporeth of this holy chest was held to be the special seat of jahvehthe place selected for a temporary residence of the supreme elohim who had after aaron and phineas eli and his sons for priests and seers and when the ark was carried to the camp at ebenezer there can be no doubt that the israelites no less than the philistines held that elohim is come into the camp iv 7 and that the one as much as the other conceived that the israelites had summoned to their aid a powerful ally in these or this mighty elohimelsewhere called jahvesabaoth the jahveh of hosts if the temple at shiloh was the pentateuchal tabernacle as is suggested by the name of tent of meeting given to it in 1 samuel ii 22 it was essentially a large tent though constituted of very expensive and ornate materials if on the other hand it was a different edifice there can be little doubt that this house of jahveh was built on the model of an ordinary house of the time but there is not the slightest evidence that during the reign of saul any greater importance attached to this seat of the cult of jahveh than to others sanctuaries and high places for sacrifice were scattered all over the country from dan to beersheba and as samuel is said to have gone up to one of these high places to bless the sacrifice it may be taken for tolerably certain that he knew nothing of the levitical laws which severely condemn the high places and those who sacrifice away from the sanctuary hallowed by the presence of the ark  there is no evidence that during the time of the 156 judges and of samuel any one occupied the position of the high priest of later days and persons who were neither priests nor levites sacrificed and divined or inquired of jahveh when they pleased and where they pleased without the least indication that they or any one else in israel at that time knew they were doing wrong there is no allusion to any special observance of the sabbath and the references to circumcision are indirect    such are the chief articles of the theological creed of the old israelites which are made known to us by the direct evidence of the ancient record to which we have had recourse and they are as remarkable for that which they contain as for that which is absent from them they reveal a firm conviction that when death takes place a something termed a soul or spirit leaves the body and continues to exist in sheol for a period of indefinite duration even though there is no proof of any belief in absolute immortality that such spirits can return to earth to possess and inspire the living that they are in appearance and in disposition likenesses of the men to whom they belonged but that as spirits they have larger powers and are freer from physical limitations that they thus form a group among a number of kinds of spiritual existences known as elohim of whom jahveh the national god of israel is one that consistently with this view jahveh was conceived as a sort of spirit human in aspect and in senses and with many human passions but with immensely greater intelligence and power than any 157 other elohim whether human or divine further the evidence proves that this belief was the basis of the jahvehworship to which samuel and his followers were devoted that there is strong reason for believing and none for doubting that idolatry in the shape of the worship of the family gods or teraphim was practised by sincere and devout jahvehworshippers that the ark with its protective tent or tabernacle was regarded as a specially but by no means exclusively favoured sanctuary of jahveh that the ephod appears to have had a particular value for those who desired to divine by the help of jahveh and that divination by lots was practised before jahveh on the other hand there is not the slightest evidence of any belief in retribution after death but the contrary ritual obligations have at least as strong sanction as moral there are clear indications that some of the most stringent of the levitical laws were unknown even to samuel priests often appear to be superseded by laymen even in the performance of sacrifices and divination and no line of demarcation can be drawn between necromancer wizard seer prophet and priest each of whom is regarded like all the rest as a medium of communication between the world of elohim and that of living men    the theological system thus defined offers to the anthropologist no feature which is devoid of a parallel in the known theologies of other races of mankind even of those who inhabit parts of the world most remote from palestine and the foundation of the 158 whole the ghost theory is exactly that theological speculation which is the most widely spread of all and the most deeply rooted among uncivilised men i am able to base this statement to some extent on facts within my own knowledge in december 1848 hms rattlesnake the ship to which i then belonged was anchored off mount ernest an island in torres straits the people were few and well disposed and when a friend of mine whom i will call b and i went ashore we made acquaintance with an old native paouda by name in course of time we became quite intimate with the old gentleman partly by the rendering of mutual good offices but chiefly because paouda believed he had discovered that b was his fatherinlaw and his grounds for this singular conviction were very remarkable we had made a long stay at cape york hard by and in accordance with a theory which is widely spread among the australians that white men are the reincarnated spirits of black men b was held to be the ghost or narki of a certain mount ernest native one antarki who had lately died on the ground of some real or fancied resemblance to the latter now paouda had taken to wife a daughter of antarkis named domani and as soon as b informed him that he was the ghost of antarki paouda at once admitted the relationship and acted upon it for as all the women on the island had hidden away in fear of the ship and we were anxious to see what they were like b pleaded pathetically with paouda that it would be very unkind not to let him see his daughter and grandchildren 159 after a good deal of hesitation and the exaction of pledges of deep secrecy paouda consented to take b and myself as bs friend to see domani and the three daughters by whom b was received quite as one of the family while i was courteously welcomed on his account  this scene made an impression upon me which is not yet effaced it left no question on my mind of the sincerity of the strange ghost theory of these savages and of the influence which their belief has on their practical life i had it in my mind as well as many a like result of subsequent anthropological studies when in 186938 i wrote as follows      there are savages without god in any proper sense of the word but none     without ghosts and the fetishism ancestorworship heroworship and     demonology of primitive savages are all i believe different manners     of expression of their belief in ghosts and of the anthropomorphic     interpretation of outoftheway events which is its concomitant     witchcraft and sorcery are the practical expressions of these beliefs     and they stand in the same relation to religious worship as the simple     anthropomorphism of children or savages does to theology  i do not quote myself with any intention of making a claim to originality in putting forth this view for i have since discovered that the same conception is virtually contained in the great discours sur lhistoire universelle of bossuet now more than two centuries old      le culte des hommes morts faisoit presque tout le fond de lidolâtrie     presque tous les hommes sacrifioient aux mânes 160 cestàdire aux     âmes des morts de si anciennes erreurs nous font voir à la vérité     combien étoit ancienne la croyance de limmortalité de lâme et nous     montrent quelle doit être rangée parmi les premières traditions du     genre humain mais lhomme qui gâtoit tout en avoit étrangement     abusé puisquelle le portoit à sacrifier aux morts on alloit même     jusquà cet excès de leur sacrifier des hommes vivans on tuoit leurs     esclaves et même leurs femmes pour les aller servir dans lautre     monde39  among more modern writers j g müller in his excellent geschichte der amerikanischen urreligionen 1855 clearly recognises gespensterhafter geisterglaube as the foundation of all savage and semicivilised theology and i need do no more than mention the important developments of the same view which are to be found in mr tylors primitive culture and in the writings of mr herbert spencer especially his recentlypublished ecclesiastical institutions40  it is a matter of fact that whether we direct our attention to the older conditions of civilised societies in japan in china in hindostan in greece or in rome41 we find underlying all other theological notions the belief in ghosts with its inevitable concomitant sorcery and a primitive cult in the shape of a worship of ancestors which is essentially an attempt to please or appease their ghosts the 161 same thing is true of old mexico and peru and of every semicivilised or savage people who have developed a definite cult and in those who like the natives of australia have not even a cult the belief in and fear of ghosts is as strong as anywhere else the most clearly demonstrable article of the theology of the israelites in the eleventh and twelfth centuries bc is therefore simply the article which is to be found in all primitive theologies namely the belief that a man has a soul which continues to exist after death for a longer or shorter time and may return as a ghost with a divine or at least demonic character to influence for good or evil and usually for evil the affairs of the living but the correspondence between the old israelitic and other archaic forms of theology extends to details if in order to avoid all chance of direct communication we direct our attention to the theology of semicivilised people such as the polynesian islanders separated by the greatest possible distance and by every conceivable barrier from the inhabitants of palestine we shall find not merely that all the features of oldisraelitic theology which are revealed in the records cited are found among them but that extant information as to the inner mind of these people tends to remove many of the difficulties which those who have not studied anthropology find in the hebrew narrative  one of the best sources if not the best source of information on these topics is mariners tonga islands which tells us of the condition of cooks friendly islanders eighty years ago before 162 european influence was sensibly felt among them mariner a youth of fair education and of no inconsiderable natural ability as the work which was drawn up from the materials he furnished shows was about fifteen years of age when his ship was attacked and plundered by the tongans he remained four years in the islands familiarised himself with the language lived the life of the people became intimate with many of them and had every opportunity of acquainting himself with their opinions as well as with their habits and customs he seems to have been devoid of prejudices theological or other and the impression of strict accuracy which his statements convey has been justified by all the knowledge of polynesian life which has been subsequently acquired  it is desirable therefore to pay close attention to that which mariner tells us about the theological views of these people      the human soul42 after its separation from the body is termed a     hotooa a god or spirit and is believed to exist in the shape of     the body to have the same propensities as during life but to be     corrected by a more enlightened understanding by which it readily     distinguishes good from evil truth from falsehood right from wrong     having the same attributes as the original gods but in a minor degree     and having its dwelling for ever in the happy regions of bolotoo     holding the same rank in regard to other souls as during this life it     has however the power of returning to tonga to inspire priests     relations or others or to appear in dreams to those it wishes to     admonish 163 and sometimes to the external eye in the form of a     ghost or apparition but this power of reappearance at tonga     particularly belongs to the souls of chiefs rather than of matabooles     vol ii p 130  the word hotooa is the same as that which is usually spelt atua by polynesian philologues and it will be convenient to adopt this spelling now under this head of atuas or supernatural intelligent beings the tongans include      1 the original gods 2 the souls of nobles that have all attributes     in common with the first but inferior in degree 3 the souls of     matabooles43 that are still inferior and have not the power as the     two first have of coming back to tonga to inspire the priests though     they are supposed to have the power of appearing to their relatives 4     the original attendants or servants as it were of the gods who     although they had their origin and have ever since existed in bolotoo     are still inferior to the third class 5 the atua pow or mischievous     gods 6 mooi or the god that supports the earth and does not belong     to bolotoo vol ii pp 103 104  from this it appears that the atuas of the polynesian are exactly equivalent to the elohim of the old israelite44 they comprise everything spiritual from a ghost to a god and from the merely tutelar gods to particular private families vol ii p 104 to táliytooboó who was the national god of tonga the tongans had no doubt that these atuas daily and hourly influenced their destinies and could conversely be influenced by them 164 hence their piety the incessant acts of sacrificial worship which occupied their lives and their belief in omens and charms moreover the atuas were believed to visit particular personstheir own priests in the case of the higher gods but apparently anybody in that of the lowerand to inspire them by a process which was conceived to involve the actual residence of the god for the time being in the person inspired who was thus rendered capable of prophesying vol ii p 100 for the tongan therefore inspiration indubitably was possession  when one of the higher gods was invoked through his priest by a chief who wished to consult the oracle or in old israelitic phraseology to inquire of the god a hog was killed and cooked over night and together with plantains yams and the materials for making the peculiar drink kava of which the tongans were very fond was carried next day to the priest a circle as for an ordinary kavadrinking entertainment was then formed but the priest as the representative of the god took the highest place while the chiefs sat outside the circle as an expression of humility calculated to please the god      as soon as they are all seated the priest is considered as inspired     the god being supposed to exist within him from that moment he remains     for a considerable time in silence with his hands clasped before him     his eyes are cast down and he rests perfectly still during the time     the victuals are being shared out and the kava preparing the     matabooles sometimes begin to consult him sometimes he answers and at     other times not in either case he remains with his eyes cast down     frequently he will not utter a word till the repast is finished and the     kava too when he speaks he generally begins in a low 165 and very     altered tone of voice which gradually rises to nearly its natural     pitch though sometimes a little above it all that he says is supposed     to be the declaration of the god and he accordingly speaks in the     first person as if he were the god all this is done generally without     any apparent inward emotion or outward agitation but on some     occasions his countenance becomes fierce and as it were inflamed and     his whole frame agitated with inward feeling he is seized with an     universal trembling the perspiration breaks out on his forehead and     his lips turning black are convulsed at length tears start in floods     from his eyes his breast heaves with great emotion and his utterance     is choked these symptoms gradually subside before this paroxysm comes     on and after it is over he often eats as much as four hungry men     under other circumstances could devour the fit being now gone off he     remains for some time calm and then takes up a club that is placed by     him for the purpose turns it over and regards it attentively he then     looks up earnestly now to the right now to the left and now again at     the club afterwards he looks up again and about him in like manner     and then again fixes his eyes on the club and so on for several times     at length he suddenly raises the club and after a moments pause     strikes the ground or the adjacent part of the house with considerable     force immediately the god leaves him and he rises up and retires to     the back of the ring among the people vol i pp 100 101  the phenomena thus described in language which to any one who is familiar with the manifestations of abnormal mental states among ourselves bears the stamp of fidelity furnish a most instructive commentary upon the story of the wise woman of endor as in the latter we have the possession by the spirit or soul atua elohim the strange voice the speaking in the first person unfortunately nothing beyond the loud cry is mentioned as to the state of the wise woman of endor but what we learn from other sources eg 1 sam x 2024 respecting the physical 166 concomitants of inspiration among the old israelites has its exact equivalent in this and other accounts of polynesian prophetism an excellent authority moerenhout who lived among the people of the society islands many years and knew them well says that in tahiti the rôle of the prophet had very generally passed out of the hands of the priests into that of private persons who professed to represent the god often assumed his name and in this capacity prophesied i will not run the risk of weakening the force of moerenhouts description of the prophetic state by translating it      un individu dans cet état avait le bras gauche enveloppé dun morceau     détoffe signe de la présence de la divinité il ne parlait que dun     ton impérieux et véhément ses attaques quand il allait prophétiser     étaient aussi effroyables quimposantes il tremblait dabord de tous     ses membres la figure enflée les yeux hagards rouges et étincelants     dune expression sauvage il gesticulait articulait des mots vides de     sens poussait des cris horribles qui faisaient tressaillir tous les     assistans et sexaltait parfois au point quon nosait pas     lapprocher autour de lui le silence de la terreur et du respect     cest alors quil répondait aux questions annonçait lavenir le     destin des batailles la volonté des dieux et chose étonnante au     sein de ce délire de cet enthousiasme religieux son langage était     grave imposant son éloquence noble et persuasive45  just so saul strips off his clothes prophesies before samuel and lies down naked all that day and night  both mariner and moerenhout refuse to have recourse to the hypothesis of imposture in order to 167 account for the inspired state of the polynesian prophets on the contrary they fully believe in their sincerity mariner tells the story of a young chief an acquaintance of his who thought himself possessed by the atua of a dead woman who had fallen in love with him and who wished him to die that he might be near her in bolotoo and he died accordingly but the most valuable evidence on this head is contained in what the same authority says about king finows son the previous king toogoo ahoo had been assassinated by finow and his soul become an atua of divine rank in bolotoo had been pleased to visit and inspire finows sonwith what particular object does not appear      when this young chief returned to hapai mr mariner who was upon a     footing of great friendship with him one day asked him how he felt     himself when the spirit of toogoo ahoo visited him he replied that he     could not well describe his feelings but the best he could say of it     was that he felt himself all over in a glow of heat and quite restless     and uncomfortable and did not feel his own personal identity as it     were but seemed to have a mind different from his own natural mind     his thoughts wandering upon strange and unusual subjects although     perfectly sensible of surrounding objects he next asked him how he     knew it was the spirit of toogoo ahoo his answer was theres a fool     how can i tell you how i knew it i felt and knew it was so by a kind     of consciousness my mind told me that it was toogoo ahoo vol i     pp 104 105  finows son was evidently made for a theological disputant and fell back at once on the inexpugnable stronghold of faith when other evidence was lacking theres a fool i know it is true because i know it is the exemplar and epitome of the 168 scepticcrushing process in other places than the tonga islands  the island of bolotoo to which all the souls of the upper classes at any rate repair after the death of the body and from which they return at will to interfere for good or evil with the lives of those whom they have left behind obviously answers to sheol in tongan tradition this place of souls is a sort of elysium above ground and pleasant enough to live in but in other parts of polynesia the corresponding locality which is called po has to be reached by descending into the earth and is represented dark and gloomy like sheol but it was not looked upon as a place of rewards and punishments in any sense whether in bolotoo or in po the soul took the rank it had in the flesh and a shadow lived among the shadows of the friends and houses and food of its previous life  the tongan theologians recognised several hundred gods but there was one already mentioned as their national god whom they regarded as far greater than any of the others as a great chief from the top of the sky down to the bottom of the earth mariner vol ii p 106 he was also god of war and the tutelar deity of the royal family whoever happened to be the incumbent of the royal office for the time being he had no priest except the king himself and his visits even to royalty were few and far between the name of this supreme deity was táliytooboó the literal meaning of which is said to be wait there tooboó from which it would appear 169 that the peculiar characteristic of táliytooboó in the eyes of his worshippers was persistence of duration and it is curious to notice in relation to this circumstance that many hebrew philologers have thought the meaning of jahveh to be best expressed by the word eternal it would probably be difficult to express the notion of an eternal being in a dialect so little fitted to convey abstract conceptions as tongan better than by that of one who always waits there  the characteristics of the gods in tongan theology are exactly those of men whose shape they are supposed to possess only they have more intelligence and greater power the tongan belief that after death the human atua more readily distinguishes good from evil runs parallel with the old israelitic conception of elohim expressed in genesis ye shall be as elohim knowing good from evil they further agreed with the old israelites that all rewards for virtue and punishments for vice happen to men in this world only and come immediately from the gods vol ii p 100 moreover they were of opinion that though the gods approve of some kinds of virtue and are displeased with some kinds of vice and to a certain extent protect or forsake their worshippers according to their moral conduct yet neglect to pay due respect to the deities and forgetfulness to keep them in good humour might be visited with even worse consequences than moral delinquency and those who will carefully study the socalled mosaic code contained in the 170 books of exodus leviticus and numbers will see that though jahvehs prohibitions of certain forms of immorality are strict and sweeping his wrath is quite as strongly kindled against infractions of ritual ordinances accidental homicide may go unpunished and reparation may be made for wilful theft on the other hand nadab and abihu who offered strange fire before jahveh which he had not commanded them were swiftly devoured by jahvehs fire he who sacrificed anywhere except at the allotted place was to be cut off from his people so was he who eat blood and the details of the upholstery of the tabernacle of the millinery of the priests vestments and of the cabinet work of the ark can plead direct authority from jahveh no less than moral commands  amongst the tongans the sacrifices were regarded as gifts of food and drink offered to the divine atuas just as the articles deposited by the graves of the recently dead were meant as food for atuas of lower rank a kava root was a constant form of offering all over polynesia in the excellent work of the rev george turner entitled nineteen years in polynesia p 241 i find it said of the samoans near neighbours of the tongans      the offerings were principally cooked food as in ancient greece so     in samoa the first cup was in honour of the god it was either poured     out on the ground or waved towards the heavens reminding us again of     the mosaic ceremonies the chiefs all drank a portion out of the same     cup according to rank and after that the food brought as an offering     was divided and eaten there before the lord  in tonga when they consulted a god who had a 171 priest the latter as representative of the god had the first cup but if the god like táliytooboó had no priest then the chief place was left vacant and was supposed to be occupied by the god himself when the first cup of kava was filled the mataboole who acted as master of the ceremonies said give it to your god and it was offered though only as a matter of form in tonga and samoa there were many sacred places or morais with houses of the ordinary construction but which served as temples in consequence of being dedicated to various gods and there were altars on which the sacrifices were offered nevertheless there were few or no images mariner mentions none in tonga and the samoans seem to have been regarded as no better than atheists by other polynesians because they had none it does not appear that either of these peoples had images even of their family or ancestral gods  in tahiti and the adjacent islands moerenhout t i p 471 makes the very interesting observation not only that idols were often absent but that where they existed the images of the gods served merely as depositories for the proper representatives of the divinity each of these was called a maro aurou and was a kind of girdle artistically adorned with red yellow blue and black feathersthe red feathers being especially importantwhich were consecrated and kept as sacred objects within the idols they were worn by great personages on solemn occasions and conferred upon their wearers a sacred and almost divine character there is no distinct evidence that the 172 maro aurou was supposed to have any special efficacy in divination but one cannot fail to see a certain parallelism between this holy girdle which endowed its wearer with a particular sanctity and the ephod  according to the rev r taylor the new zealanders formerly used the word karakia now employed for prayer to signify a spell charm or incantation and the utterance of these karakias constituted the chief part of their cult in the south the officiating priest had a small image about eighteen inches long resembling a peg with a carved head which reminds one of the form commonly attributed to the teraphim      the priest first bandaged a fillet of red parrot feathers under the     gods chin which was called his pahau or beard this bandage was made     of a certain kind of sennet which was tied on in a peculiar way when     this was done it was taken possession of by the atua whose spirit     entered it the priest then either held it in the hand and vibrated it     in the air whilst the powerful karakia was repeated or he tied a     piece of string formed of the centre of a flax leaf round the neck of     the image and stuck it in the ground he sat at a little distance from     it leaning against a tuahu a short stone pillar stuck in the ground     in a slanting position and holding the string in his hand he gave the     god a jerk to arrest his attention lest he should be otherwise     engaged like baal of old either hunting fishing or sleeping and     therefore must be awaked the god is supposed to make use of the     priests tongue in giving a reply imageworship appears to have been     confined to one part of the island the atua was supposed only to enter     the image for the occasion the natives declare they did not worship     the image itself but only the atua it represented and that the image     was merely used as a way of approaching him46  173  this is the excuse for imageworship which the more intelligent idolaters make all the world over but it is more interesting to observe that in the present case we seem to have the equivalents of divination by teraphim with the aid of something like an ephod which however is used to sanctify the image and not the priest mixed up together many hebrew archæologists have supposed that the term ephod is sometimes used for an image particularly in the case of gideons ephod and the story of micah in the book of judges shows that images were at any rate employed in close association with the ephod if the pulling of the string to call the attention of the god seems as absurd to us as it appears to have done to the worthy missionary who tells us of the practice it should be recollected that the high priest of jahveh was ordered to wear a garment fringed with golden bells      and it shall be upon aaron to minister and the sound thereof shall be     heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before jahveh and when he     cometh out that he die not exod xxviii 35  an escape from the obvious conclusion suggested by this passage has been sought in the supposition that these bells rang for the sake of the worshippers as at the elevation of the host in the roman catholic ritual but then why should the priest be threatened with the wellknown penalty for inadvisedly beholding the divinity  in truth the intermediate step between the maori practice and that of the old israelites is furnished by 174 the kami temples in japan these are provided with bells which the worshippers who present themselves ring in order to call the attention of the ancestorgod to their presence grant the fundamental assumption of the essentially human character of the spirit whether atua kami or elohim and all these practices are equally rational  the sacrifices to the gods in tonga and elsewhere in polynesia were ordinarily social gatherings in which the god either in his own person or in that of his priestly representative was supposed to take part these sacrifices were offered on every occasion of importance and even the daily meals were prefaced by oblations and libations of food and drink exactly answering to those offered by the old romans to their manes penates and lares the sacrifices had no moral significance but were the necessary result of the theory that the god was either a deified ghost of an ancestor or chief or at any rate a being of like nature to these if one wanted to get anything out of him therefore the first step was to put him in good humour by gifts and if one desired to escape his wrath which might be excited by the most trifling neglect or unintentional disrespect the great thing was to pacify him by costly presents king finow appears to have been somewhat of a freethinker to the great horror of his subjects and it was only his untimely death which prevented him from dealing with the priest of a god who had not returned a favourable answer to his supplications as saul dealt with the priests of the sanctuary of jahveh at nob 175 nevertheless finow showed his practical belief in the gods during the sickness of a daughter to whom he was fondly attached in a fashion which has a close parallel in the history of israel      if the gods have any resentment against us let the whole weight of     vengeance fall on my head i fear not their vengeancebut spare my     child and i earnestly entreat you toobo totái the god whom he had     invoked to exert all your influence with the other gods that i alone     may suffer all the punishment they desire to inflict vol i p 354  so when the king of israel has sinned by numbering the people and they are punished for his fault by a pestilence which slays seventy thousand innocent men david cries to jahveh      lo i have sinned and i have done perversely but these sheep what     have they done let thine hand i pray thee be against me and against     my fathers house 2 sam xxiv 17  human sacrifices were extremely common in polynesia and in tonga the devotion of a child by strangling was a favourite method of averting the wrath of the gods the wellknown instances of jephthahs sacrifice of his daughter and of davids giving up the seven sons of saul to be sacrificed by the gibeonites before jahveh appear to me to leave no doubt that the old israelites even when devout worshippers of jahveh considered human sacrifices under certain circumstances to be not only permissible but laudable samuels hewing to pieces of the miserable captive sole survivor of his nation agag before jahveh can hardly be viewed in any other light the life of moses is redeemed from jahveh who sought 176 to slay him by zipporahs symbolical sacrifice of her child by the bloody operation of circumcision jahveh expressly affirms that the firstborn males of men and beasts are devoted to him in accordance with that claim the firstborn males of the beasts are duly sacrificed and it is only by special permission that the claim to the firstborn of men is waived and it is enacted that they may be redeemed exod xiii 1215 is it possible to avoid the conclusion that immolation of their firstborn sons would have been incumbent on the worshippers of jahveh had they not been thus specially excused can any other conclusion be drawn from the history of abraham and isaac does abraham exhibit any indication of surprise when he receives the astounding order to sacrifice his son is there the slightest evidence that there was anything in his intimate and personal acquaintance with the character of the deity who had eaten the meat and drunk the milk which abraham set before him under the oaks of mamre to lead him to hesitateeven to wait twelve or fourteen hours for a repetition of the command not a whit we are told that abraham rose early in the morning and led his only child to the slaughter as if it were the most ordinary business imaginable whether the story has any historical foundation or not it is valuable as showing that the writer of it conceived jahveh as a deity whose requirement of such a sacrifice need excite neither astonishment nor suspicion of mistake on the part of his devotee hence when the incessant human 177 sacrifices in israel during the age of the kings are put down to the influence of foreign idolatries we may fairly inquire whether editorial bowdlerising has not prevailed over historical truth  an attempt to compare the ethical standards of two nations one of which has a written code while the other has not is beset with difficulties with all that is strange and in many cases repulsive to us in the social arrangements and opinions respecting moral obligation among the tongans as they are placed before us with perfect candour in mariners account there is much that indicates a strong ethical sense they showed great kindliness to one another and faithfulness in standing by their comrades in war no people could have better observed either the third or the fifth commandment for they had a particular horror of blasphemy and their respectful tenderness towards their parents and indeed towards old people in general was remarkable  it cannot be said that the eighth commandment was generally observed especially where europeans were concerned but nevertheless a wellbred tongan looked upon theft as a meanness to which he would not condescend as to the seventh commandment any breach of it was considered scandalous in women and as something to be avoided in selfrespecting men but among unmarried and widowed people chastity was held very cheap nevertheless the women were extremely well treated and often showed themselves capable of great devotion and entire faithfulness in the matter of cruelty treachery and 178 bloodthirstiness these islanders were neither better nor worse than most peoples of antiquity it is to the credit of the tongans that they particularly objected to slander nor can covetousness be regarded as their characteristic for mariner says      when any one is about to eat he always shares out what he has to those     about him without any hesitation and a contrary conduct would be     considered exceedingly vile and selfish vol ii p 145  in fact they thought very badly of the english when mariner told them that his countrymen did not act exactly on that principle it further appears that they decidedly belonged to the school of intuitive moral philosophers and believed that virtue is its own reward for      many of the chiefs on being asked by mr mariner what motives they had     for conducting themselves with propriety besides the fear of     misfortunes in this life replied the agreeable and happy feeling     which a man experiences within himself when he does any good action or     conducts himself nobly and generously as a man ought to do and this     question they answered as if they wondered such a question should be     asked vol ii p 161  one may read from the beginning of the book of judges to the end of the books of samuel without discovering that the old israelites had a moral standard which differs in any essential respect except perhaps in regard to the chastity of unmarried women from that of the tongans gideon jephthah samson and david are stronghanded men some of whom are not outdone by any polynesian chieftain in the matter of murder and treachery 179 while deborahs jubilation over jaels violation of the primary duty of hospitality proffered and accepted under circumstances which give a peculiarly atrocious character to the murder of the guest and her witchlike gloating over the picture of the disappointment of the mother of the victim    the mother of sisera cried through the lattice   why is his chariot so long in coming jud v 28  would not have been out of place in the choral service of the most sanguinary god in the polynesian pantheon  with respect to the cannibalism which the tongans occasionally practised mariner says      although a few young ferocious warriors chose to imitate what they     considered a mark of courageous fierceness in a neighbouring nation it     was held in disgust by everybody else vol ii p 171  that the moral standard of tongan life was less elevated than that indicated in the book of the covenant exod xxixxiii may be freely admitted but then the evidence that this book of the covenant and even the ten commandments as given in exodus were known to the israelites of the time of samuel and saul is to say the least by no means conclusive the deuteronomic version of the fourth commandment is hopelessly discrepant from that which stands in exodus would any later writer have ventured to alter the commandments as given from sinai if he had had before him that which professed to be an accurate statement of the ten words in exodus and if the writer of 180 deuteronomy had not exodus before him what is the value of the claim of the version of the ten commandments therein contained to authenticity from one end to the other of the books of judges and samuel the only commandments of jahveh which are specially adduced refer to the prohibition of the worship of other gods or are orders given ad hoc and have nothing to do with questions of morality  in polynesia the belief in witchcraft in the appearance of spiritual beings in dreams in possession as the cause of diseases and in omens prevailed universally mariner tells a story of a woman of rank who was greatly attached to king finow and who for the space of six months after his death scarcely ever slept elsewhere than on his grave which she kept carefully decorated with flowers      one day she went with the deepest affliction to the house of mooonga     toobó the widow of the deceased chief to communicate what had     happened to her at the fytoca grave during several nights and     which caused her the greatest anxiety she related that she had dreamed     that the late how king appeared to her and with a countenance full     of disappointment asked why there yet remained at vavaoo so many     evildesigning persons for he declared that since he had been at     bolotoo his spirit had been disturbed47 by the evil machinations of     wicked men conspiring against his son but he declared that the youth     should not be molested nor his power shaken by the spirit of rebellion     that he therefore came to her with a warning voice to prevent such     disastrous consequences vol i p 424  on inquiry it turned out that the charm of tattao had been performed on finows grave with the view 181 of injuring his son the reigning king and it is to be presumed that it was this sorcerers work which had disturbed finows spirit the rev richard taylor says in the work already cited the account given of the witch of endor agrees most remarkably with the witches of new zealand p 45  the tongans also believed in a mode of divination essentially similar to the casting of lots by the twirling of a cocoanut      the object of inquiry  is chiefly whether a sick person will     recover for this purpose the nut being placed on the ground a     relation of the sick person determines that if the nut when again at     rest points to such a quarter the east for example that the sick man     will recover he then prays aloud to the patron god of the family that     he will be pleased to direct the nut so that it may indicate the truth     the nut being next spun the result is attended to with confidence at     least with a full conviction that it will truly declare the intentions     of the gods at the time vol ii p 227  does not the action of saul on a famous occasion involve exactly the same theological presuppositions      therefore saul said unto jahveh the elohim of israel shew the right     and jonathan and saul were taken by lot but the people escaped and     saul said cast lots between me and jonathan my son and jonathan was     taken and saul said to jonathan tell me what thou hast done and     the people rescued jonathan so that he died not 1 sam xiv 4145  as the israelites had great yearly feasts so had the polynesians as the israelites practised circumcision so did many polynesian people as the israelites had a complex and often arbitraryseeming multitude of distinctions between clean and unclean things and clean and unclean states of men to which 182 they attached great importance so had the polynesians their notions of ceremonial purity and their tabu an equally extensive and strange system of prohibitions violation of which was visited by death these doctrines of cleanness and uncleanness no doubt may have taken their rise in the real or fancied utility of the prescriptions but it is probable that the origin of many is indicated in the curious habit of the samoans to make fetishes of living animals it will be recollected that these people had no gods made with hands but they substituted animals for them  at his birth      every samoan was supposed to be taken under the care of some tutelary     god or aitu   atua as it was called the help of perhaps half a     dozen different gods was invoked in succession on the occasion but the     one who happened to be addressed just as the child was born was marked     and declared to be the childs god for life      these gods were supposed to appear in some visible incarnation and     the particular thing in which his god was in the habit of appearing     was to the samoan an object of veneration it was in fact his idol     and he was careful never to injure it or treat it with contempt one     for instance saw his god in the eel another in the shark another in     the turtle another in the dog another in the owl another in the     lizard and so on throughout all the fish of the sea and birds and     fourfooted beasts and creeping things in some of the shellfish even     gods were supposed to be present a man would eat freely of what was     regarded as the incarnation of the god of another man but the     incarnation of his own particular god he would consider it death to     injure or eat48  we have here that which appears to be the origin or one of the origins of food prohibitions on the one 183 hand and of totemism on the other when it is remembered that the old israelities sprang from ancestors who are said to have resided near or in one of the great seats of ancient babylonian civilisation the city of ur that they had been it is said for centuries in close contact with the egyptians and that in the theology of both the babylonians and the egyptians there is abundant evidence notwithstanding their advanced social organisation of the belief in spirits with sorcery ancestorworship the deification of animals and the converse animalisation of godsit obviously needs very strong evidence to justify the belief that the rude tribes of israel did not share the notions from which their far more civilised neighbours had not emancipated themselves  but it is surely needless to carry the comparison further out of the abundant evidence at command i think that sufficient has been produced to furnish ample grounds for the belief that the old israelites of the time of samuel entertained theological conceptions which were on a level with those current among the more civilised of the polynesian islanders though their ethical code may possibly in some respects have been more advanced49  a theological system of essentially similar character exhibiting the same fundamental conceptions respecting the continued existence and incessant interference in human affairs of disembodied spirits prevails or formerly prevailed among the whole of 184 the inhabitants of the polynesian and melanesian islands and among the people of australia notwithstanding the wide differences in physical character and in grade of civilisation which obtain among them and the same proposition is true of the people who inhabit the riverain shores of the pacific ocean whether dyaks malays indochinese chinese japanese the wild tribes of america or the highly civilised old mexicans and peruvians it is no less true of the mongolic nomads of northern asia of the asiatic aryans and of the ancient greeks and romans and it holds good among the dravidians of the dekhan and the negro tribes of africa no tribe of savages which has yet been discovered has been conclusively proved to have so poor a theological equipment as to be devoid of a belief in ghosts and in the utility of some form of witchcraft in influencing those ghosts and there is no nation modern or ancient which even at this moment has wholly given up the belief and in which it has not at one time or other played a great part in practical life  this sciotheism50 as it might be called is found in several degrees of complexity in rough correspondence with the stages of social organisation and like these separated by no sudden breaks  in its simplest condition such as may be met with among the australian savages theology is a mere 185 belief in the existence powers and disposition usually malignant of ghostlike entities who may be propitiated or scared away but no cult can properly be said to exist and in this stage theology is wholly independent of ethics the moral code such as is implied by public opinion derives no sanction from the theological dogmas and the influence of the spirits is supposed to be exerted out of mere caprice or malice  as a next stage the fundamental fear of ghosts and the consequent desire to propitiate them acquire an organised ritual in simple forms of ancestorworship such as the rev mr turner describes among the people of tanna lc p 88 and this line of development may be followed out until it attains its acme in the statetheology of china and the kamitheology51 of japan each of these is essentially ancestorworship the ancestors being reckoned back through family groups of higher and higher order sometimes with strict reference to the principle of agnation as in old rome and as in the latter it is intimately bound up with the whole organisation of the state there are no idols inscribed tablets in china and strips of paper lodged in a peculiar portable shrine in japan represent the souls of the deceased or the special seats which they occupy when sacrifices are offered by their descendants in japan it is interesting to observe that a national 186 kamitenziodaizinis worshipped as a sort of jahveh by the nation in general and as lippert has observed it is singular that his special seat is a portable litterlike shrine termed the mikosi in some sort analogous to the israelitic ark in china the emperor is the representative of the primitive ancestors and stands as it were between them and the supreme cosmic deitiesheaven and earthwho are superadded to them and who answer to the tangaloa and the maui of the polynesians  sciotheism under the form of the deification of ancestral ghosts in its most pronounced form is therefore the chief element in the theology of a great moiety possibly of more than half of the human race i think this must be taken to be a matter of factthough various opinions may be held as to how this ancestorworship came about but on the other hand it is no less a matter of fact that there are very few people without additional gods who cannot with certainty be accounted for as deified ancestors  with all respect for the distinguished authorities on the other side i cannot find good reasons for accepting the theory that the cosmic deitieswho are superadded to deified ancestors even in china who are found all over polynesia in tangaloa and maui and in old peru in the sunare the product either of the search after the infinite or of mistakes arising out of the confusion of a great chiefs name with the thing signified by the name but however this may be i think it is again merely matter of fact that among a large portion of 187 mankind ancestorworship is more or less thrown into the background either by such cosmic deities or by tribal gods of uncertain origin who have been raised to eminence by the superiority in warfare or otherwise of their worshippers  among certain nations the polytheistic theology thus constituted has become modified by the selection of some one cosmic or tribal god as the only god to whom worship is due on the part of that nation though it is by no means denied that other nations have a right to worship other gods and thus results a worship of one godmonolatry as wellhausen calls itwhich is very different from genuine monotheism52 in ancestral sciotheism and in this monolatry the ethical code often of a very high order comes into closer relation with the theological creed morality is taken under the patronage of the god or gods who reward all morally good conduct and punish all morally evil conduct in this world or the next at the same time however they are conceived to be thoroughly human and they visit any shadow of disrespect to themselves shown by disobedience to their commands or by delay or carelessness in carrying them out as severely as any breach of the moral laws piety means minute attention to the due performance of all sacred rites and covers any number of lapses in morality just as cruelty treachery murder and adultery did not bar davids claim to the title of the man after gods own heart among the israelites crimes against men may be expiated 188 but blasphemy against the gods is an unpardonable sin men forgive all injuries but those which touch their selfesteem and they make their gods after their own likeness in their own image make they them    it is in the category of monolatry that i conceive the theology of the old israelites must be ranged they were polytheists in so far as they admitted the existence of other elohim of divine rank beside jahveh they differed from ordinary polytheists in so far as they believed that jahveh was the supreme god and the one proper object of their own national worship but it will doubtless be objected that i have been building up a fictitious israelitic theology on the foundation of the recorded habits and customs of the people when they had lapsed from the ordinances of their great lawgiver and prophet moses and that my conclusions may be good for the perverts to canaanitish theology but not for the true observers of the sinaitic legislation the answer to the objection is thatso far as i can form a judgment of that which is well ascertained in the history of israelthere is very little ground for believing that we know much either about the theological and social value of the influence of moses or about what happened during the wanderings in the desert  the account of the exodus and of the occurrences in the sinaitic peninsula in fact all the history of israel before the invasion of canaan is full of wonderful stories which may be true in so far as they 189 are conceivable occurrences but which are certainly not probable and which i for one decline to accept until evidence which deserves that name is offered of their historical truth up to this time i know of none53 furthermore i see no answer to the argument that one has no right to pick out of an obviously unhistorical statement the assertions which happen to be probable and discard the rest but it is also certain that a primitively veracious tradition may be smothered under subsequent mythical additions and that one has no right to cast away the former along with the latter thus perhaps the fairest way of stating the case may be as follows  there can be no à priori objection to the supposition that the israelites were delivered from their egyptian bondage by a leader called moses and that he exerted a great influence over their subsequent organisation in the desert there is no reason to doubt that during their residence in the land of goshen the israelites knew nothing of jahveh but as their own prophets declare see ezek xx were polytheistic idolaters sharing in the worst practices of their neighbours as to their conduct in other respects nothing is known but it may fairly be suspected that their ethics were not of a higher order than those of jacob their progenitor in which case they might derive great profit from contact with egyptian society which held honesty and 190 truthfulness in the highest esteem thanks to the egyptologers we now know with all requisite certainty the moral standard of that society in the time and long before the time of moses it can be determined from the scrolls buried with the mummified dead and from the inscriptions on the tombs and memorial statues of that age for though the lying of epitaphs is proverbial so far as their subject is concerned they give an unmistakable insight into that which the writers and the readers of them think praiseworthy  in the famous tombs at beni hassan there is a record of the life of prince nakht who served osertasen ii a pharaoh of the twelfth dynasty as governor of a province the inscription speaks in his name i was a benevolent and kindly governor who loved his country never was a little child distressed nor a widow illtreated by me i have never repelled a workman or hindered a shepherd i gave alike to the widow and to the married woman and have not preferred the great to the small in my gifts and we have the high authority of the late dr samuel birch for the statement that the inscriptions of the twelfth dynasty abound in injunctions of a high ethical character to feed the hungry give drink to the thirsty clothe the naked bury the dead loyally serve the king formed the first duty of a pious man and faithful subject54 the people for whom these inscriptions embodied their ideal of praiseworthiness assuredly had no imperfect 191 conception of either justice or mercy but there is a document which gives still better evidence of the moral standard of the egyptians it is the book of the dead a sort of guide to spiritland the whole or a part of which was buried with the mummy of every welltodo egyptian while extracts from it are found in innumerable inscriptions portions of this work are of extreme antiquity evidence of their existence occurring as far back as the fifth and sixth dynasties while the 125th chapter which constitutes a sort of book by itself and is known as the book of redemption in the hall of the two truths is frequently inscribed upon coffins and other monuments of the nineteenth dynasty that under which there is reason to believe the israelites were oppressed and the exodus took place and it occurs more than once in the famous tombs of the kings of this and the preceding dynasty at thebes55 this book of redemption is chiefly occupied by the socalled negative confession made to the fortytwo divine judges in which the soul of the dead denies that he has committed faults of various kinds it is therefore obvious that the egyptians conceived that their gods commanded them not to do the deeds which are here denied the book of redemption in fact implies the existence in the mind of the egyptians if not in a formal writing of a series of ordinances couched like the majority of the ten 192 commandments in negative terms and it is easy to prove the implied existence of a series which nearly answers to the ten words of course a polytheistic and imageworshipping people who observed a great many holy days but no sabbaths could have nothing analogous to the first or the second and the fourth commandments of the decalogue but answering to the third is i have not blasphemed to the fifth i have not reviled the face of the king or my father to the sixth i have not murdered to the seventh i have not committed adultery to the eighth i have not stolen i have not done fraud to man to the ninth i have not told falsehoods in the tribunal of truth and further i have not calumniated the slave to his master i find nothing exactly similar to the tenth commandment but that the inward disposition of mind was held to be of no less importance than the outward act is to be gathered from the praises of kindliness already cited and the cry of i am pure which is repeated by the soul on trial moreover there is a minuteness of detail in the confession which shows no little delicacy of moral appreciationi have not privily done evil against mankind i have not afflicted men i have not withheld milk from the mouths of sucklings i have not been idle i have not played the hypocrite i have not told falsehoods i have not corrupted woman or man i have not caused fear i have not multiplied words in speaking  would that the moral sense of the nineteenth 193 century ad were as far advanced as that of the egyptians in the nineteenth century bc in this last particular what incalculable benefit to mankind would flow from strict observance of the commandment thou shalt not multiply words in speaking nothing is more remarkable than the stress which the old egyptians here and elsewhere lay upon this and other kinds of truthfulness as compared with the absence of any such requirement in the israelitic decalogue in which only a specific kind of untruthfulness is forbidden  if as the story runs moses was adopted by a princess of the royal house and was instructed in all the wisdom of the egyptians it is surely incredible that he should not have been familiar from his youth up with the high moral code implied in the book of redemption it is surely impossible that he should have been less familiar with the complete legal system and with the method of administration of justice which even in his time had enabled the egyptian people to hold together as a complex social organisation for a period far longer than the duration of old roman society from the building of the city to the death of the last cæsar nor need we look to moses alone for the influence of egypt upon israel it is true that the hebrew nomads who came into contact with the egyptians of osertasen or of ramses stood in much the same relation to them in point of culture as a germanic tribe did to the romans of tiberius or of marcus antoninus or as captain cooks omai did to the english of george the third but 194 at the same time any difficulty of communication which might have arisen out of this circumstance was removed by the long preexisting intercourse of other semites of every grade of civilisation with the egyptians in mesopotamia and elsewhere as in phenicia semitic people had attained to a social organisation as advanced as that of the egyptians semites had conquered and occupied lower egypt for centuries so extensively had semitic influences penetrated egypt that the egyptian language during the period of the nineteenth dynasty is said by brugsch to be as full of semitisms as german is of gallicisms while semitic deities had supplanted the egyptian gods at heliopolis and elsewhere on the other hand the semites as far as phenicia were extensively influenced by egypt  it is generally admitted56 that moses phinehas and perhaps aaron are names of egyptian origin and there is excellent authority for the statement that the name abir which the israelites gave to their golden calf and which is also used to signify the strong the heavenly and even god57 is simply the egyptian apis brugsch points out that the god tum or tom who was the special object of worship in the city of pitom with which the israelites were only too familiar was called ankh and the great god and had no image ankh means he who lives the living one a name the resemblance of which to the 195 i am that i am of exodus is unmistakable whatever may be the value of the fact every discussion of israelitic ritual seeks and finds the explanation of its details in the portable sacred chests the altars the priestly dress the breastplate the incense and the sacrifices depicted on the monuments of egypt but it must be remembered that these signs of the influence of egypt upon israel are not necessarily evidence that such influence was exerted before the exodus it may have come much later through the close connection of the israel of david and solomon first with phenicia and then with egypt  if we suppose moses to have been a man of the stamp of calvin there is no difficulty in conceiving that he may have constructed the substance of the ten words and even of the book of the covenant which curiously resembles parts of the book of the dead from the foundation of egyptian ethics and theology which had filtered through to the israelites in general or had been furnished specially to himself by his early education just as the great genevese reformer built up a puritanic social organisation on so much as remained of the ethics and theology of the roman church after he had trimmed them to his liking  thus i repeat i see no à priori objection to the assumption that moses may have endeavoured to give his people a theologicopolitical organisation based on the ten commandments though certainly not quite in their present form and the book of the covenant contained in our present book of exodus but 196 whether there is such evidence as amounts to proof or i had better say to probability that even this much of the pentateuch owes its origin to moses is another matter the mythical character of the accessories of the sinaitic history is patent and it would take a good deal more evidence than is afforded by the bare assertion of an unknown writer to justify the belief that the people who saw the thunderings and the lightnings and the voice of the trumpet and the mountain smoking exod xx 18 to whom jahveh orders moses to say ye yourselves have seen that i have talked with you from heaven ye shall not make other gods with me gods of silver and gods of gold ye shall not make unto you ibid 22 23 should less than six weeks afterwards have done the exact thing they were thus awfully forbidden to do nor is the credibility of the story increased by the statement that aaron the brother of moses the witness and fellowworker of the miracles before pharaoh was their leader and the artificer of the idol and yet at the same time aaron was apparently so ignorant of wrongdoing that he made proclamation tomorrow shall be a feast to jahveh and the people proceeded to offer their burntofferings and peaceofferings as if everything in their proceedings must be satisfactory to the deity with whom they had just made a solemn covenant to abolish imageworship it seems to me that on a survey of all the facts of the case only a very cautious and hypothetical judgment is justifiable it may be that moses profited by the opportunities afforded him of 197 access to what was best in egyptian society to become acquainted not only with its advanced ethical and legal code but with the more or less pantheistic unification of the divine to which the speculations of the egyptian thinkers like those of all polytheistic philosophers from polynesia to greece tend if indeed the theology of the period of the nineteenth dynasty was not as some egyptologists think a modification of an earlier more distinctly monotheistic doctrine of a long antecedent age it took only half a dozen centuries for the theology of paul to become the theology of gregory the great and it is possible that twenty centuries lay between the theology of the first worshippers in the sanctuary of the sphinx and that of the priests of ramses maimun  it may be that the ten commandments and the book of the covenant are based upon faithful traditions of the efforts of a great leader to raise his followers to his own level for myself as a matter of pious opinion i like to think so as i like to imagine that between moses and samuel there may have been many a seer many a herdsman such as him of tekoah lonely amidst the hills of ephraim and judah who cherished and kept alive these traditions in the present results of biblical criticism however i can discover no justification for the common assumption that between the time of joshua and that of rehoboam the israelites were familiar with either the deuteronomic or the levitical legislation or that the theology of the israelites from the king who sat on the throne to the lowest of his subjects was in 198 any important respect different from that which might naturally be expected from their previous history and the conditions of their existence but there is excellent evidence to the contrary effect and for my part i see no reason to doubt that like the rest of the world the israelites had passed through a period of mere ghostworship and had advanced through ancestorworship and fetishism and totemism to the theological level at which we find them in the books of judges and samuel    all the more remarkable therefore is the extraordinary change which is to be noted in the eighth century bc the student who is familiar with the theology implied or expressed in the books of judges samuel and the first book of kings finds himself in a new world of thought in the full tide of a great reformation when he reads joel amos hosea isaiah micah and jeremiah  the essence of this change is the reversal of the position which in primitive society ethics holds in relation to theology originally that which men worship is a theological hypothesis not a moral ideal the prophets in substance if not always in form preach the opposite doctrine they are constantly striving to free the moral ideal from the stifling embrace of the current theology and its concomitant ritual theirs was not an intellectual criticism argued on strictly scientific grounds the imageworshippers and the believers in the efficacy of sacrifices and ceremonies might logically have held their 199 own against anything the prophets have to say it was an ethical criticism from the height of his moral intuitionthat the whole duty of man is to do justice and love mercy and to bear himself as humbly as befits his insignificance in face of the infinitethe prophet simply laughs at the idolaters of stocks and stones and the idolaters of ritual idols of the first kind in his experience were inseparably united with the practice of immorality and they were to be ruthlessly destroyed as for sacrifices and ceremonies whatever their intrinsic value might be they might be tolerated on condition of ceasing to be idols they might even be praiseworthy on condition of being made to subserve the worship of the true jahvehthe moral ideal  if the realm of david had remained undivided if the assyrian and the chaldean and the egyptian had left israel to the ordinary course of development of an oriental kingdom it is possible that the effects of the reforming zeal of the prophets of the eighth and seventh centuries might have been effaced by the growth according to its inevitable tendencies of the theology which they combated but the captivity made the fortune of the ideas which it was the privilege of these men to launch upon an endless career with the abolition of the templeservices for more than half a century the priest must have lost and the scribe gained influence the puritanism of a vigorous minority among the babylonian jews rooted out polytheism from all its hidingplaces in the theology which they had inherited they created the first 200 consistent remorseless naked monotheism which so far as history records appeared in the world for zoroastrism is practically ditheism and buddhism anytheism or notheism and they inseparably united therewith an ethical code which for its purity and for its efficiency as a bond of social life was and is unsurpassed so i think we must not judge ezra and nehemiah and their followers too hardly if they exemplified the usual doom of poor humanity to escape from one error only to fall into another if they failed to free themselves as completely from the idolatry of ritual as they had from that of images and dogmas if they cherished the new fetters of the levitical legislation which they had fitted upon themselves and their nation as though such bonds had the sanctity of the obligations of morality and if they led succeeding generations to spend their best energies in building that hedge round the torah which was meant to preserve both ethics and theology but which too often had the effect of pampering the latter and starving the former the world being what it was it is to be doubted whether israel would have preserved intact the pure ore of religion which the prophets had extracted for the use of mankind as well as for their nation had not the leaders of the nation been zealous even to death for the dross of the law in which it was embedded the struggle of the jews under the maccabean house against the seleucidæ was as important for mankind as that of the greeks against the persians and of all the strange ironies of history perhaps the strangest 201 is that pharisee is current as a term of reproach among the theological descendants of that sect of nazarenes who without the martyr spirit of those primitive puritans would never have come into existence they like their historical successors our own puritans have shared the general fate of the poor wise men who save cities  a criticism of theology from the side of science is not thought of by the prophets and is at most indicated in the books of job and ecclesiastes in both of which the problem of vindicating the ways of god to man is given up though on different grounds as a hopeless one but with the extensive introduction of greek thought among the jews which took place not only during the domination of the seleucidæ in palestine but in the great judaic colony which flourished in egypt under the ptolemies criticism on both ethical and scientific grounds took a new departure  in the hands of the alexandrian jews as represented by philo the fundamental axiom of later jewish as of christian monotheism that the deity is infinitely perfect and infinitely good worked itself out into its logical consequenceagnostic theism philo will allow of no point of contact between god and a world in which evil exists for him god has no relation to space or to time and as infinite suffers no predicate beyond that of existence it is therefore absurd to ascribe to him mental faculties and affections comparable in the remotest degree to those of men he is in no way an object of cognition he 202 is greek apoios and greek akatalêktos58without quality and incomprehensible that is to say the alexandrian jew of the first century had anticipated the reasonings of hamilton and mansell in the nineteenth and for him god is the unknowable in the sense in which that term is used by mr herbert spencer moreover philos definition of the supreme being would not be inconsistent with that substantia constans infinitis attributis quorum unumquodque æternam et infinitam essentiam exprimit given by another great israelite were it not that spinozas doctrine of the immanence of the deity in the world puts him at any rate formally at the antipodes of theological speculation but the conception of the essential incognoscibility of the deity is the same in each case however philo was too thorough an israelite and too much the child of his time to be content with this agnostic position with the help of the platonic and stoic philosophy he constructed an apprehensible if not comprehensible quasideity out of the logos while other more or less personified divine powers or attributes bridged over the interval between god and man between the sacred existence too pure to be called by any name which implied a conceivable quality and the gross and evil world of matter in order to get over the ethical difficulties presented by the naïve naturalism of many parts of 203 those scriptures in the divine authority of which he firmly believed philo borrowed from the stoics who had been in like straits in respect of greek mythology that great excalibur which they had forged with infinite pains and skillthe method of allegorical interpretation this mighty twohanded engine at the door of the theologian is warranted to make a speedy end of any and every moral or intellectual difficulty by showing that taken allegorically or as it is otherwise said poetically or in a spiritual sense the plainest words mean whatever a pious interpreter desires they should mean in biblical phrase zeno who probably had a strain of semitic blood in him was the father of all such as reconcile no doubt philo and his followers were eminently religious men but they did endless injury to the cause of religion by laying the foundations of a new theology while equipping the defenders of it with the subtlest of all weapons of offence and defence and with an inexhaustible store of sophistical arguments of the most plausible aspect  the question of the real bearing upon theology of the influence exerted by the teaching of philos contemporary jesus of nazareth is one upon which it is not germane to my present purpose to enter i take it simply as an unquestionable fact that his immediate disciples known to their countrymen as nazarenes were regarded as and considered themselves to be perfectly orthodox jews belonging to the puritanic or pharisaic section of their people and differing from the rest only in their belief that 204 the messiah had already come christianity it is said first became clearly differentiated at antioch and it separated itself from orthodox judaism by denying the obligation of the rite of circumcision and of the food prohibitions prescribed by the law henceforward theology became relatively stationary among the jews59 and the history of its rapid progress in a new course of evolution is the history of the christian churches orthodox and heterodox the steps in this evolution are obvious the first is the birth of a new theological scheme arising out of the union of elements derived from greek philosophy with elements derived from israelitic theology in the fourth gospel the logos raised to a somewhat higher degree of personification than in the alexandrian theosophy is identified with jesus of nazareth in the epistles especially the later of those attributed to paul the israelitic ideas of the messiah and of sacrificial atonement coalesce with one another and with the embodiment of the logos in jesus until the apotheosis of the son of man is almost or quite effected the history of christian dogma from justin to athanasius is a record of continual progress in the same direction until the fair body of religion revealed in almost naked purity by the prophets is 205 once more hidden under a new accumulation of dogmas and of ritual practices of which the primitive nazarene knew nothing and which he would probably have regarded as blasphemous if he could have been made to understand them  as century after century the ages roll on polytheism comes back under the disguise of mariolatry and the adoration of saints imageworship becomes as rampant as in old egypt adoration of relics takes the place of the old fetishworship the virtues of the ephod pale before those of holy coats and handkerchiefs shrines and calvaries make up for the loss of the ark and of the high places and even the lustral fluid of paganism is replaced by holy water at the porches of the temples a touching ceremonythe common meal originally eaten in pious memory of a loved teacherwas metamorphosed into a fleshandblood sacrifice supposed to possess exactly that redeeming virtue which the prophets denied to the fleshandblood sacrifices of their day while the minute observance of ritual was raised to a degree of punctilious refinement which levitical legislators might envy and with the growth of this theology grew its inevitable concomitant the belief in evil spirits in possession in sorcery in charms and omens until the christians of the twelfth century after our era were sunk in more debased and brutal superstitions than are recorded of the israelites in the twelfth century before it  the greatest men of the middle ages are unable to escape the infection dantes inferno would be 206 revolting if it were not so often sublime so often exquisitely tender the hideous pictures which cover a vast space on the south wall of the campo santo of pisa convey information as terrible as it is indisputable of the theological conceptions of dantes countrymen in the fourteenth century whose eyes were addressed by the painters of those disgusting scenes and whose approbation they knew how to win a candid mexican of the time of cortez could he have seen this christian burialplace would have taken it for an appropriately adorned teocalli the professed disciple of the god of justice and of mercy might there gloat over the sufferings of his fellowmen depicted as undergoing every extremity of atrocious and sanguinary torture to all eternity for theological errors no less than for moral delinquencies while in the central figure of satan60 occupied in champing up souls in his capricious and welltoothed jaws to void them again for the purpose of undergoing fresh suffering we have the counterpart of the strange polynesian and egyptian dogma that there were certain gods who employed themselves in devouring the ghostly flesh of the spirits of the dead 207 but in justice to the polynesians it must be recollected that after three such operations they thought the soul was purified and happy in the view of the christian theologian the operation was only a preparation for new tortures continued for ever and aye  with the growth of civilisation in europe and with the revival of letters and of science in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the ethical and intellectual criticism of theology once more recommenced and arrived at a temporary restingplace in the confessions of the various reformed protestant sects in the sixteenth century almost all of which as soon as they were strong enough began to persecute those who carried criticism beyond their own limit but the movement was not arrested by these ecclesiastical barriers as their constructors fondly imagined it would be it was continued tacitly or openly by galileo by hobbes by descartes and especially by spinoza in the seventeenth century by the english freethinkers by rousseau by the french encyclopædists and by the german rationalists among whom lessing stands out a head and shoulders taller than the rest throughout the eighteenth century by the historians the philologers the biblical critics the geologists and the biologists in the nineteenth century until it is obvious to all who can see that the moral sense and the really scientific method of seeking for truth are once more predominating over false science once more ethics and theology are parting company  it is my conviction that with the spread of true scientific culture whatever may be the medium 208 historical philological philosophical or physical through which that culture is conveyed and with its necessary concomitant a constant elevation of the standard of veracity the end of the evolution of theology will be like its beginningit will cease to have any relation to ethics i suppose that so long as the human mind exists it will not escape its deepseated instinct to personify its intellectual conceptions the science of the present day is as full of this particular form of intellectual shadowworship as is the nescience of ignorant ages the difference is that the philosopher who is worthy of the name knows that his personified hypotheses such as law and force and ether and the like are merely useful symbols while the ignorant and the careless take them for adequate expressions of reality so it may be that the majority of mankind may find the practice of morality made easier by the use of theological symbols and unless these are converted from symbols into idols i do not see that science has anything to say to the practice except to give an occasional warning of its dangers but when such symbols are dealt with as real existences i think the highest duty which is laid upon men of science is to show that these dogmatic idols have no greater value than the fabrications of mens hands the stocks and the stones which they have replaced                                        209  v  science and morals  in spite of long and perhaps not unjustifiable hesitation i begin to think that there must be something in telepathy for evidence which i may not disregard is furnished by the last number of the fortnightly review that among the hitherto undiscovered endowments of the human species there may be a power even more wonderful than the mystic faculty by which the esoterically buddhistic sage upon the farthest mountain in cathay reads the inmost thoughts of a dweller within the homely circuit of the london postal district great indeed is the insight of such a seer but how much greater is his who combines the feat of reading not merely the thoughts of which the thinker is aware but those of which he knows nothing who sees him unconsciously drawing the conclusions which he repudiates and supporting the doctrines which he detests to reflect upon the confusion which the working of such a power as this may introduce into ones ideas of personality and responsibility is perilousmadness lies that way but truth is truth and i am almost fain to believe in 210 this magical visibility of the nonexistent when the only alternative is the supposition that the writer of the article on materialism and morality in vol xl 1886 of the fortnightly review in spite of his manifest ability and honesty has pledged himself so far as i am concerned to what if i may trust my own knowledge of my own thoughts must be called a multitude of errors of the first magnitude  i so much admire mr lillys outspokenness i am so completely satisfied of the uprightness of his intentions that it is repugnant to me to quarrel with anything he may say and i sympathise so warmly with his manly scorn of the vileness of much that passes under the name of literature in these times that i would willingly be silent under his by no means unkindly exposition of his theory of my own tenets if i thought that such personal abnegation would serve the interest of the cause we both have at heart but i cannot think so my creed may be an illfavoured thing but it is mine own as touchstone says of his ladylove and i have so high an opinion of the solid virtues of the object of my affections that i cannot calmly see her personated by a wench who is much uglier and has no virtue worth speaking of i hope i should be ready to stand by a falling cause if i had ever adopted it but suffering for a falling cause which one has done ones best to bring to the ground is a kind of martyrdom for which i have no taste in my opinion the philosophical theory which mr lilly attributes to mebut which i have over and over again 211 disclaimedis untenable and destined to extinction and i not unreasonably demur to being counted among its defenders  after the manner of a mediæval disputant mr lilly posts up three theses which as he conceives embody the chief heresies propagated by the late professor clifford mr herbert spencer and myself he says that we agree 1 in putting aside as unverifiable everything which the senses cannot verify 2 everything beyond the bounds of physical science 3 everything which cannot be brought into a laboratory and dealt with chemically p 578  my lamented young friend clifford sweetest of natures though keenest of disputants is out of reach of our little controversies but his works speak for him and those who run may read a refutation of mr lillys assertions in them mr herbert spencer hitherto has shown no lack either of ability or of inclination to speak for himself and it would be a superfluity not to say an impertinence on my part to take up the cudgels for him but for myself if my knowledge of my own consciousness may be assumed to be adequate and i make not the least pretension to acquaintance with what goes on in my unbewusstsein i may be permitted to observe that the first proposition appears to me to be not true that the second is in the same case and that if there be gradations in untrueness the third is so monstrously untrue that it hovers on the verge of absurdity even if it does not actually flounder in that logical limbo thus to all three theses i reply in 212 appropriate fashion negoi say no and i proceed to state the grounds of that negation which the proprieties do not permit me to make quite so emphatic as i could desire  let me begin with the first assertion that i put aside as unverifiable everything which the senses cannot verify can such a statement as this be seriously made in respect of any human being but i am not appointed apologist for mankind in general and confining my observations to myself i beg leave to point out that at this present moment i entertain an unshakable conviction that mr lilly is the victim of a patent and enormous misunderstanding and that i have not the slightest intention of putting that conviction aside because i cannot verify it either by touch or taste or smell or hearing or sight which in the absence of any trace of telepathic faculty make up the totality of my senses  again i may venture to admire the clear and vigorous english in which mr lilly embodies his views but the source of that admiration does not lie in anything which my five senses enable me to discover in the pages of his article and of which an orangoutang might be just as acutely sensible no it lies in an appreciation of literary form and logical structure by æsthetic and intellectual faculties which are not senses and which are not unfrequently sadly wanting where the senses are in full vigour my poor relation may beat me in the matter of sensation but i am quite confident that when style and syllogisms are to be dealt with he is nowhere 213  if there is anything in the world which i do firmly believe in it is the universal validity of the law of causation but that universality cannot be proved by any amount of experience let alone that which comes to us through the senses and when an effort of volition changes the current of my thoughts or when an idea calls up another associated idea i have not the slightest doubt that the process to which the first of the phenomena in each case is due stands in the relation of cause to the second yet the attempt to verify this belief by sensation would be sheer lunacy now i am quite sure that mr lilly does not doubt my sanity and the only alternative seems to be the admission that his first proposition is erroneous  the second thesis charges me with putting aside as unverifiable everything beyond the bounds of physical science again i say no nobody i imagine will credit me with a desire to limit the empire of physical science but i really feel bound to confess that a great many very familiar and at the same time extremely important phenomena lie quite beyond its legitimate limits i cannot conceive for example how the phenomena of consciousness as such and apart from the physical process by which they are called into existence are to be brought within the bounds of physical science take the simplest possible example the feeling of redness physical science tells us that it commonly arises as a consequence of molecular changes propagated from the eye to a certain part of the substance of the brain when vibrations of the luminiferous ether of a certain character fall upon 214 the retina let us suppose the process of physical analysis pushed so far that one could view the last link of this chain of molecules watch their movements as if they were billiard balls weigh them measure them and know all that is physically knowable about them well even in that case we should be just as far from being able to include the resulting phenomenon of consciousness the feeling of redness within the bounds of physical science as we are at present it would remain as unlike the phenomena we know under the names of matter and motion as it is now if there is any plain truth upon which i have made it my business to insist over and over again it is thisand whether it is a truth or not my insistence upon it leaves not a shadow of justification for mr lillys assertion  but i ask in this case also how is it conceivable that any man in possession of all his natural faculties should hold such an opinion i do not suppose that i am exceptionally endowed because i have all my life enjoyed a keen perception of the beauty offered us by nature and by art now physical science may and probably will some day enable our posterity to set forth the exact physical concomitants and conditions of the strange rapture of beauty but if ever that day arrives the rapture will remain just as it is now outside and beyond the physical world and even in the mental world something superadded to mere sensation i do not wish to crow unduly over my humble cousin the orang but in the æsthetic province as in that of the intellect i am afraid he is 215 nowhere i doubt not he would detect a fruit amidst a wilderness of leaves where i could see nothing but i am tolerably confident that he has never been awestruck as i have been by the dim religious gloom as of a temple devoted to the earthgods of the tropical forest which he inhabits yet i doubt not that our poor longarmed and shortlegged friend as he sits meditatively munching his durian fruit has something behind that sad socratic face of his which is utterly beyond the bounds of physical science physical science may know all about his clutching the fruit and munching it and digesting it and how the physical titillation of his palate is transmitted to some microscopic cells of the gray matter of his brain but the feelings of sweetness and of satisfaction which for a moment hang out their signal lights in his melancholy eyes are as utterly outside the bounds of physics as is the fine frenzy of a human rhapsodist  does mr lilly really believe that putting me aside there is any man with the feeling of music in him who disbelieves in the reality of the delight which he derives from it because that delight lies outside the bounds of physical science not less than outside the region of the mere sense of hearing but it may be that he includes music painting and sculpture under the head of physical science and in that case i can only regret i am unable to follow him in his ennoblement of my favourite pursuits  the third thesis runs that i put aside as unverifiable everything which cannot be brought into a 216 laboratory and dealt with chemically and once more i say no this wondrous allegation is no novelty it has not unfrequently reached me from that region where gentle or ungentle dulness so often holds unchecked swaythe pulpit but i marvel to find that a writer of mr lillys intelligence and good faith is willing to father such a wastrel if i am to deal with the thing seriously i find myself met by one of the two horns of a dilemma either some meaning as unknown to usage as to the dictionaries attaches to laboratory and chemical or the proposition is what am i to say in my sore need for a gentle and yet appropriate wordwellunhistorical  does mr lilly suppose that i put aside as unverifiable all the truths of mathematics of philology of history and if i do not will he have the great goodness to say how the binomial theorem is to be dealt with chemically even in the best appointed laboratory or where the balances and crucibles are kept by which the various theories of the nature of the basque language may be tested or what reagents will extract the truth from any given history of rome and leave the errors behind as a residual calx  i really cannot answer these questions and unless mr lilly can i think he would do well hereafter to think more than twice before attributing such preposterous notions to his fellowmen who after all as a learned counsel said are vertebrated animals  the whole thing perplexes me much and i am 217 sure there must be an explanation which will leave mr lillys reputation for common sense and fair dealing untouched can it bei put this forward quite tentativelythat mr lilly is the victim of a confusion common enough among thoughtless people and into which he has fallen unawares obviously it is one thing to say that the logical methods of physical science are of universal applicability and quite another to affirm that all subjects of thought lie within the province of physical science i have often declared my conviction that there is only one method by which intellectual truth can be reached whether the subjectmatter of investigation belongs to the world of physics or to the world of consciousness and one of the arguments in favour of the use of physical science as an instrument of education which i have oftenest used is that in my opinion it exercises young minds in the appreciation of inductive evidence better than any other study but while i repeat my conviction that the physical sciences probably furnish the best and most easily appreciable illustrations of the one and indivisible mode of ascertaining truth by the use of reason i beg leave to add that i have never thought of suggesting that other branches of knowledge may not afford the same discipline and assuredly i have never given the slightest ground for the attribution to me of the ridiculous contention that there is nothing true outside the bounds of physical science doubtless people who wanted to say something damaging without too nice a regard to its truth or falsehood have often enough misrepresented 218 my plain meaning but mr lilly is not one of these folks at whom one looks and passes by and i can but sorrowfully wonder at finding him in such company  so much for the three theses which mr lilly has nailed on to a page of this review i think i have shown that the first is inaccurate that the second is inaccurate and that the third is inaccurate and that these three inaccurates constitute one prodigious though i doubt not unintentional misrepresentation if mr lilly and i were dialectic gladiators fighting in the arena of the fortnightly under the eye of an editorial lanista for the delectation of the public my best tactics would now be to leave the field of battle for the question whether i do or do not hold certain opinions is a matter of fact with regard to which my evidence is likely to be regarded as conclusiveat least until such time as the telepathy of the unconscious is more generally recognised  however some other assertions are made by mr lilly which more or less involve matters of opinion whereof the rights and wrongs are less easily settled but in respect of which he seems to me to err quite as seriously as about the topics we have been hitherto discussing and the importance of these subjects leads me to venture upon saying something about them even though i am thereby compelled to leave the safe ground of personal knowledge  before launching the three torpedoes which have so sadly exploded on board his own ship mr lilly says that with whatever rhetorical ornaments i may 219 gild my teaching it is materialism let me observe in passing that rhetorical ornament is not in my way and that gilding refined gold would to my mind be less objectionable than varnishing the fair face of truth with that pestilent cosmetic rhetoric if i believed that i had any claim to the title of materialist as that term is understood in the language of philosophy and not in that of abuse i should not attempt to hide it by any sort of gilding i have not found reason to care much for hard names in the course of the last thirty years and i am too old to develop a new sensitiveness but to repeat what i have more than once taken pains to say in the most unadorned of plain language i repudiate as philosophical error the doctrine of materialism as i understand it just as i repudiate the doctrine of spiritualism as mr lilly presents it and my reason for thus doing is in both cases the same namely that whatever their differences materialists and spiritualists agree in making very positive assertions about matters of which i am certain i know nothing and about which i believe they are in truth just as ignorant and further that even when their assertions are confined to topics which lie within the range of my faculties they often appear to me to be in the wrong and there is yet another reason for objecting to be identified with either of these sects and that is that each is extremely fond of attributing to the other by way of reproach conclusions which are the property of neither though they infallibly flow from the logical 220 development of the first principles of both surely a prudent man is not to be reproached because he keeps clear of the squabbles of these philosophical bianchi and neri by refusing to have anything to do with either  i understand the main tenet of materialism to be that there is nothing in the universe but matter and force and that all the phenomena of nature are explicable by deduction from the properties assignable to these two primitive factors that great champion of materialism whom mr lilly appears to consider to be an authority in physical science dr büchner embodies this article of faith on his titlepage kraft und stoffforce and matterare paraded as the alpha and omega of existence this i apprehend is the fundamental article of the faith materialistic and whosoever does not hold it is condemned by the more zealous of the persuasion as i have some reason to know to the inferno appointed for fools or hypocrites but all this i heartily disbelieve and at the risk of being charged with wearisome repetition of an old story i will briefly give my reasons for persisting in my infidelity in the first place as i have already hinted it seems to me pretty plain that there is a third thing in the universe to wit consciousness which in the hardness of my heart or head i cannot see to be matter or force or any conceivable modification of either however intimately the manifestations of the phenomena of consciousness may be connected with the phenomena known as matter and force in the second place 221 the arguments used by descartes and berkeley to show that our certain knowledge does not extend beyond our states of consciousness appear to me to be as irrefragable now as they did when i first became acquainted with them some half century ago all the materialistic writers i know of who have tried to bite that file have simply broken their teeth but if this is true our one certainty is the existence of the mental world and that of kraft und stoff falls into the rank of at best a highly probable hypothesis  thirdly when i was a mere boy with a perverse tendency to think when i ought to have been playing my mind was greatly exercised by this formidable problem what would become of things if they lost their qualities as the qualities had no objective existence and the thing without qualities was nothing the solid world seemed whittled awayto my great horror as i grew older and learned to use the terms matter and force the boyish problem was revived mutato nomine on the one hand the notion of matter without force seemed to resolve the world into a set of geometrical ghosts too dead even to jabber on the other hand boscovichs hypothesis by which matter was resolved into centres of force was very attractive but when one tried to think it out what in the world became of force considered as an objective entity force even the most materialistic of philosophers will agree with the most idealistic is nothing but a name for the cause of motion and if with boscovich i resolved 222 things into centres of force then matter vanished altogether and left immaterial entities in its place one might as well frankly accept idealism and have done with it  i must make a confession even if it be humiliating i have never been able to form the slightest conception of those forces which the materialists talk about as if they had samples of them many years in bottle they tell me that matter consists of atoms which are separated by mere space devoid of contents and that through this void radiate the attractive and repulsive forces whereby the atoms affect one another if anybody can clearly conceive the nature of these things which not only exist in nothingness but pull and push there with great vigour i envy him for the possession of an intellect of larger grasp not only than mine but than that of leibnitz or of newton61 to me the chimæra bombinans in vacuo quia comedit secundas intentiones of the schoolmen is a familiar and domestic creature compared with such forces besides by the hypothesis the forces are not matter and thus all that is of any particular consequence in the world turns out to be not matter on the materialists own showing let it not be supposed that i am casting 223 a doubt upon the propriety of the employment of the terms atom and force as they stand among the working hypotheses of physical science as formulæ which can be applied with perfect precision and great convenience in the interpretation of nature their value is incalculable but as real entities having an objective existence an indivisible particle which nevertheless occupies space is surely inconceivable and with respect to the operation of that atom where it is not by the aid of a force resident in nothingness i am as little able to imagine it as i fancy any one else is  unless and until anybody will resolve all these doubts and difficulties for me i think i have a right to hold aloof from materialism as to spiritualism it lands me in even greater difficulties when i want to get change for its notesofhand in the solid coin of reality for the assumed substantial entity spirit which is supposed to underlie the phenomena of consciousness as matter underlies those of physical nature leaves not even a geometrical ghost when these phenomena are abstracted and even if we suppose the existence of such an entity apart from qualitiesthat is to say a bare existencefor mind how does anybody know that it differs from that other entity apart from qualities which is the supposed substratum of matter spiritualism is after all little better than materialism turned upside down and if i try to think of the spirit which a man by this hypothesis carries about under his hat as something devoid of relation to space and as something indivisible even 224 in thought while it is at the same time supposed to be in that place and to be possessed of half a dozen different faculties i confess i get quite lost  as i have said elsewhere if i were forced to choose between materialism and idealism i should elect for the latter and i certainly would have nothing to do with the effete mythology of spiritualism but i am not aware that i am under any compulsion to choose either the one or the other i have always entertained a strong suspicion that the sage who maintained that man is the measure of the universe was sadly in the wrong and age and experience have not weakened that conviction in following these lines of speculation i am reminded of the quarterdeck walks of my youth in taking that form of exercise you may perambulate through all points of the compass with perfect safety so long as you keep within certain limits forget those limits in your ardour and mere smothering and spluttering if not worse await you i stick by the deck and throw a lifebuoy now and then to the struggling folk who have gone overboard and all i get for my humanity is the abuse of all whenever they leave off abusing one another  tolerably early in life i discovered that one of the unpardonable sins in the eyes of most people is for a man to presume to go about unlabelled the world regards such a person as the police do an unmuzzled dog not under proper control i could find no label that would suit me so in my desire to range myself and be respectable i invented one and as the chief thing i was sure of was that i did not know a great 225 many things that the ists and the ites about me professed to be familiar with i called myself an agnostic surely no denomination could be more modest or more appropriate and i cannot imagine why i should be every now and then haled out of my refuge and declared sometimes to be a materialist sometimes an atheist sometimes a positivist and sometimes alas and alack a cowardly or reactionary obscurantist  i trust that i have at last made my case clear and that henceforth i shall be allowed to rest in peaceat least after a further explanation or two which mr lilly proves to me may be necessary it has been seen that my excellent critic has original ideas respecting the meaning of the words laboratory and chemical and as it appears to me his definition of materialist is quite as much peculiar to himself for unless i misunderstand him and i have taken pains not to do so he puts me down as a materialist over and above the grounds which i have shown to have no foundation firstly because i have said that consciousness is a function of the brain and secondly because i hold by determinism with respect to the first point i am not aware that there is any one who doubts that in the proper physiological sense of the word function consciousness in certain forms at any rate is a cerebral function in physiology we call function that effect or series of effects which results from the activity of an organ thus it is the function of muscle to give rise to motion and the muscle gives rise to motion when the nerve which 226 supplies it is stimulated if one of the nervebundles in a mans arm is laid bare and a stimulus is applied to certain of the nervous filaments the result will be production of motion in that arm if others are stimulated the result will be the production of the state of consciousness called pain now if i trace these last nervefilaments i find them to be ultimately connected with part of the substance of the brain just as the others turn out to be connected with muscular substance if the production of motion in the one case is properly said to be the function of the muscular substance why is the production of a state of consciousness in the other case not to be called a function of the cerebral substance once upon a time it is true it was supposed that a certain animal spirit resided in muscle and was the real active agent but we have done with that wholly superfluous fiction so far as the muscular organs are concerned why are we to retain a corresponding fiction for the nervous organs  if it is replied that no physiologist however spiritual his leanings dreams of supposing that simple sensations require a spirit for their production then i must point out that we are all agreed that consciousness is a function of matter and that particular tenet must be given up as a mark of materialism any further argument will turn upon the question not whether consciousness is a function of the brain but whether all forms of consciousness are so again i hold it would be quite correct to say that material changes are the causes of psychical 227 phenomena and as a consequence that the organs in which these changes take place have the production of such phenomena for their function even if the spiritualistic hypothesis had any foundation for nobody hesitates to say that an event a is the cause of an event z even if there are as many intermediate terms known and unknown in the chain of causation as there are letters between a and z the man who pulls the trigger of a loaded pistol placed close to anothers head certainly is the cause of that others death though in strictness he causes nothing but the movement of the finger upon the trigger and in like manner the molecular change which is brought about in a certain portion of the cerebral substance by the stimulation of a remote part of the body would be properly said to be the cause of the consequent feeling whatever unknown terms were interposed between the physical agent and the actual psychical product therefore unless materialism has the monopoly of the right use of language i see nothing materialistic in the phraseology which i have employed  the only remaining justification which mr lilly offers for dubbing me a materialist malgré moi arises out of a passage which he quotes in which i say that the progress of science means the extension of the province of what we call matter and force and the concomitant gradual banishment from all regions of human thought of what we call spirit and spontaneity i hold that opinion now if anything more firmly than i did when i gave utterance to it a score of 228 years ago for it has been justified by subsequent events but what that opinion has to do with materialism i fail to discover in my judgment it is consistent with the most thoroughgoing idealism and the grounds of that judgment are really very plain and simple  the growth of science not merely of physical science but of all science means the demonstration of order and natural causation among phenomena which had not previously been brought under those conceptions nobody who is acquainted with the progress of scientific thinking in every department of human knowledge in the course of the last two centuries will be disposed to deny that immense provinces have been added to the realm of science or to doubt that the next two centuries will be witnesses of a vastly greater annexation more particularly in the region of the physiology of the nervous system is it justifiable to conclude from the progress that has been made in analysing the relations between material and psychical phenomena that vast further advances will be made and that sooner or later all the socalled spontaneous operations of the mind will have not only their relations to one another but their relations to physical phenomena connected in natural series of causes and effects strictly defined in other words while at present we know only the nearer moiety of the chain of causes and effects by which the phenomena we call material give rise to those which we call mental hereafter we shall get to the further end of the series 229  in my innocence i have been in the habit of supposing that this is merely a statement of facts and that the good bishop berkeley if he were alive would find such facts fit into his system without the least difficulty that mr lilly should play into the hands of his foes by declaring that unmistakable facts make for them is an exemplification of ways that are dark quite unintelligible to me surely mr lilly does not hold that the disbelief in spontaneitywhich term if it has any meaning at all means uncaused actionis a mark of the beast materialism if so he must be prepared to tackle many of the cartesians if not descartes himself spinoza and leibnitz among the philosophers augustine thomas aquinas calvin and his followers among theologians as materialistsand that surely is a sufficient reductio ad absurdum of such a classification  the truth is that in his zeal to paint materialism in large letters on everything he dislikes mr lilly forgets a very important fact which however must be patent to every one who has paid attention to the history of human thought and that fact is that every one of the speculative difficulties which beset kants three problems the existence of a deity the freedom of the will and immortality existed ages before anything that can be called physical science and would continue to exist if modern physical science were swept away all that physical science has done has been to make as it were visible and tangible some difficulties that formerly were more hard of apprehension moreover these difficulties 230 exist just as much on the hypothesis of idealism as on that of materialism  the student of nature who starts from the axiom of the universality of the law of causation cannot refuse to admit an eternal existence if he admits the conservation of energy he cannot deny the possibility of an eternal energy if he admits the existence of immaterial phenomena in the form of consciousness he must admit the possibility at any rate of an eternal series of such phenomena and if his studies have not been barren of the best fruit of the investigation of nature he will have enough sense to see that when spinoza says per deum intelligo ens absolute infinitum hoc est substantiam constantem infinitis attributis the god so conceived is one that only a very great fool would deny even in his heart physical science is as little atheistic as it is materialistic  so with respect to immortality as physical science states this problem it seems to stand thus is there any means of knowing whether the series of states of consciousness which has been causally associated for threescore years and ten with the arrangement and movements of innumerable millions of successively different material molecules can be continued in like association with some substance which has not the properties of matter and force as kant said on a like occasion if anybody can answer that question he is just the man i want to see if he says that consciousness cannot exist except in relation of cause and effect with certain organic 231 molecules i must ask how he knows that and if he says it can i must put the same question and i am afraid that like jesting pilate i shall not think it worth while having but little time before me to wait for an answer  lastly with respect to the old riddle of the freedom of the will in the only sense in which the word freedom is intelligible to methat is to say the absence of any restraint upon doing what one likes within certain limitsphysical science certainly gives no more ground for doubting it than the common sense of mankind does and if physical science in strengthening our belief in the universality of causation and abolishing chance as an absurdity leads to the conclusions of determinism it does no more than follow the track of consistent and logical thinkers in philosophy and in theology before it existed or was thought of whoever accepts the universality of the law of causation as a dogma of philosophy denies the existence of uncaused phenomena and the essence of that which is improperly called the freewill doctrine is that occasionally at any rate human volition is selfcaused that is to say not caused at all for to cause oneself one must have anteceded oneselfwhich is to say the least of it difficult to imagine  whoever accepts the existence of an omniscient deity as a dogma of theology affirms that the order of things is fixed from eternity to eternity for the foreknowledge of an occurrence means that the occurrence will certainly happen and the certainty 232 of an event happening is what is meant by its being fixed or fated62  whoever asserts the existence of an omnipotent deity that he made and sustains all things and is the causa causarum cannot without a contradiction in terms assert that there is any cause independent of him and it is a mere subterfuge to assert that the cause of all things can permit one of these things to be an independent cause  233  whoever asserts the combination of omniscience and omnipotence as attributes of the deity does implicitly assert predestination for he who knowingly makes a thing and places it in circumstances the operation of which on that thing he is perfectly acquainted with does predestine that thing to whatever fate may befall it  thus to come at last to the really important part of all this discussion if the belief in a god is essential to morality physical science offers no obstacle thereto if the belief in immortality is essential to morality physical science has no more to say against the probability of that doctrine than the most ordinary experience has and it effectually closes the mouths of those who pretend to refute it by objections deduced from merely physical data finally if the belief in the uncausedness of volition is essential to morality the student of physical science has no more to say against that absurdity than the logical philosopher or theologian physical science i repeat did not invent determinism and the deterministic doctrine would stand on just as firm a foundation as it does if there were no physical science let any one who doubts this read jonathan edwards whose demonstrations are derived wholly from philosophy and theology  thus when mr lilly like another solomon eagle goes about proclaiming woe to this wicked city and denouncing physical science as the evil genius of modern daysmother of materialism and fatalism and all sorts of other condemnable ismsi 234 venture to beg him to lay the blame on the right shoulders or at least to put in the dock along with science those sinful sisters of hers philosophy and theology who being so much older should have known better than the poor cinderella of the schools and universities over which they have so long dominated no doubt modern society is diseased enough but then it does not differ from older civilisations in that respect societies of men are fermenting masses and as beer has what the germans call oberhefe and unterhefe so every society that has existed has had its scum at the top and its dregs at the bottom but i doubt if any of the ages of faith had less scum or less dregs or even showed a proportionally greater quantity of sound wholesome stuff in the vat i think it would puzzle mr lilly or any one else to adduce convincing evidence that at any period of the worlds history there was a more widespread sense of social duty or a greater sense of justice or of the obligation of mutual help than in this england of ours ah but says mr lilly these are all products of our christian inheritance when christian dogmas vanish virtue will disappear too and the ancestral ape and tiger will have full play but there are a good many people who think it obvious that christianity also inherited a good deal from paganism and from judaism and that if the stoics and the jews revoked their bequest the moral property of christianity would realise very little and if morality has survived the stripping off of several sets of clothes which have been found to fit badly why 235 should it not be able to get on very well in the light and handy garments which science is ready to provide  but this by the way if the diseases of society consist in the weakness of its faith in the existence of the god of the theologians in a future state and in uncaused volitions the indication as the doctors say is to suppress theology and philosophy whose bickerings about things of which they know nothing have been the prime cause and continual sustenance of that evil scepticism which is the nemesis of meddling with the unknowable  cinderella is modestly conscious of her ignorance of these high matters she lights the fire sweeps the house and provides the dinner and is rewarded by being told that she is a base creature devoted to low and material interests but in her garret she has fairy visions out of the ken of the pair of shrews who are quarrelling downstairs she sees the order which pervades the seeming disorder of the world the great drama of evolution with its full share of pity and terror but also with abundant goodness and beauty unrolls itself before her eyes and she learns in her heart of hearts the lesson that the foundation of morality is to have done once and for all with lying to give up pretending to believe that for which there is no evidence and repeating unintelligible propositions about things beyond the possibilities of knowledge  she knows that the safety of morality lies neither in the adoption of this or that philosophical 236 speculation or this or that theological creed but in a real and living belief in that fixed order of nature which sends social disorganisation upon the track of immorality as surely as it sends physical disease after physical trespasses and of that firm and lively faith it is her high mission to be the priestess                                        237  vi  scientific and pseudoscientific realism  next to undue precipitation in anticipating the results of pending investigations the intellectual sin which is commonest and most hurtful to those who devote themselves to the increase of knowledge is the omission to profit by the experience of their predecessors recorded in the history of science and philosophy it is true that at the present day there is more excuse than at any former time for such neglect no small labour is needed to raise oneself to the level of the acquisitions already made and able men who have achieved thus much know that if they devote themselves body and soul to the increase of their store and avoid looking back with as much care as if the injunction laid on lot and his family were binding upon them such devotion is sure to be richly repaid by the joys of the discoverer and the solace of fame if not by rewards of a less elevated character  so following the advice of francis bacon we refuse inter mortuos quærere vivum we leave the past to bury its dead and ignore our intellectual ancestry nor are we content with that we follow the evil example set us not only by bacon but by 238 almost all the men of the renaissance in pouring scorn upon the work of our immediate spiritual forefathers the schoolmen of the middle ages it is accepted as a truth which is indisputable that for seven or eight centuries a long succession of able mensome of them of transcendent acuteness and encyclopædic knowledgedevoted laborious lives to the grave discussion of mere frivolities and the arduous pursuit of intellectual willothewisps to say nothing of a little modesty a little impartial pondering over personal experience might suggest a doubt as to the adequacy of this short and easy method of dealing with a large chapter of the history of the human mind even an acquaintance with popular literature which had extended so far as to include that part of the contributions of sam slick which contains his weighty aphorism that there is a great deal of human nature in all mankind might raise a doubt whether after all the men of that epoch who take them all round were endowed with wisdom and folly in much the same proportion as ourselves were likely to display nothing better than the qualities of energetic idiots when they devoted their faculties to the elucidation of problems which were to them and indeed are to us the most serious which life has to offer speaking for myself the longer i live the more i am disposed to think that there is much less either of pure folly or of pure wickedness in the world than is commonly supposed it may be doubted if any sane man ever said to himself evil be thou my good and i have never yet had the good fortune to meet with a perfect 239 fool when i have brought to the inquiry the patience and longsuffering which become a scientific investigator the most promising specimens have turned out to have a good deal to say for themselves from their own point of view and sometimes calm reflection has taught the humiliating lesson that their point of view was not so different from my own as i had fondly imagined comprehension is more than halfway to sympathy here as elsewhere  if we turn our attention to scholastic philosophy in the frame of mind suggested by these prefatory remarks it assumes a very different character from that which it bears in general estimation no doubt it is surrounded by a dense thicket of thorny logomachies and obscured by the dustclouds of a barbarous and perplexing terminology but suppose that undeterred by much grime and by many scratches the explorer has toiled through this jungle he comes to an open country which is amazingly like his dear native land the hills which he has to climb the ravines he has to avoid look very much the same there is the same infinite space above and the same abyss of the unknown below the means of travelling are the same and the goal is the same  that goal for the schoolmen as for us is the settlement of the question how far the universe is the manifestation of a rational order in other words how far logical deduction from indisputable premisses will account for that which has happened and does happen that was the object of scholasticism and so far as i am aware the object of modern science may be 240 expressed in the same terms in pursuit of this end modern science takes into account all the phenomena of the universe which are brought to our knowledge by observation or by experiment it admits that there are two worlds to be considered the one physical and the other psychical and that though there is a most intimate relation and interconnection between the two the bridge from one to the other has yet to be found that their phenomena run not in one series but along two parallel lines  to the schoolmen the duality of the universe appeared under a different aspect how this came about will not be intelligible unless we clearly apprehend the fact that they did really believe in dogmatic christianity as it was formulated by the roman church they did not give a mere dull assent to anything the church told them on sundays and ignore her teachings for the rest of the week but they lived and moved and had their being in that supersensible theological world which was created or rather grew up during the first four centuries of our reckoning and which occupied their thoughts far more than the sensible world in which their earthly lot was cast  for the most part we learn history from the colourless compendiums or partisan briefs of mere scholars who have too little acquaintance with practical life and too little insight into speculative problems to understand that about which they write in historical science as in all sciences which have to do with concrete phenomena laboratory practice is indispensable and the laboratory practice of historical science is 241 afforded on the one hand by active social and political life and on the other by the study of those tendencies and operations of the mind which embody themselves in philosophical and theological systems thucydides and tacitus and to come nearer our own time hume and grote were men of affairs and had acquired by direct contact with social and political history in the making the secret of understanding how such history is made our notions of the intellectual history of the middle ages are unfortunately too often derived from writers who have never seriously grappled with philosophical and theological problems and hence that strange myth of a millennium of moonshine to which i have adverted  however no very profound study of the works of contemporary writers who without devoting themselves specially to theology or philosophy were learned and enlightenedsuch men for example as eginhard or danteis necessary to convince oneself that for them the world of the theologian was an everpresent and awful reality from the centre of that world the divine trinity surrounded by a hierarchy of angels and saints contemplated and governed the insignificant sensible world in which the inferior spirits of men burdened with the debasement of their material embodiment and continually solicited to their perdition by a no less numerous and almost as powerful hierarchy of devils were constantly struggling on the edge of the pit of everlasting damnation63  242  the men of the middle ages believed that through the scriptures the traditions of the fathers and the authority of the church they were in possession of far more and more trustworthy information with respect to the nature and order of things in the theological world than they had in regard to the nature and order of things in the sensible world and if the two sources of information came into conflict so much the worse for the sensible world which after all was more or less under the dominion of satan let us suppose that a telescope powerful enough to show us what is going on in the nebula of the sword of orion should reveal a world in which stones fell upwards parallel lines met and the fourth dimension of space was quite obvious men of science would have only two 243 alternatives before them either the terrestrial and the nebular facts must be brought into harmony by such feats of subtle sophistry as the human mind is always capable of performing when driven into a corner or science must throw down its arms in despair and commit suicide either by the admission that the universe is after all irrational inasmuch as that which is truth in one corner of it is absurdity in another or by a declaration of incompetency  in the middle ages the labours of those great men who endeavoured to reconcile the system of thought which started from the data of pure reason with that which started from the data of roman theology produced the system of thought which is known as scholastic philosophy the alternative of surrender and suicide is exemplified by avicenna and his followers when they declared that that which is true in theology may be false in philosophy and vice versâ and by sanchez in his famous defence of the thesis quod nil scitur  to those who deny the validity of one of the primary assumptions of the disputantswho decline on the ground of the utter insufficiency of the evidence to put faith in the reality of that other world the geography and the inhabitants of which are so confidently described in the socalled64 christianity of catholicismthe long and bitter contest which 244 engaged the best intellects for so many centuries may seem a terrible illustration of the wasteful way in which the struggle for existence is carried on in the world of thought no less than in that of matter but there is a more cheerful mode of looking at the history of scholasticism it ground and sharpened the dialectic implements of our race as perhaps nothing but discussions in the result of which men thought their eternal no less than their temporal interests were at stake could have done when a logical blunder may ensure combustion not only in the next world but in this the construction of syllogisms acquires a peculiar interest moreover the schools kept the thinking faculty alive and active when the disturbed state of civil life the mephitic atmosphere engendered by the dominant ecclesiasticism and the almost total neglect of natural knowledge might well have stifled it and finally it should be remembered that scholasticism really did thresh out pretty effectually certain problems which have presented themselves to mankind ever since they began to think and which i suppose will present themselves so long as they continue to think consider for example the controversy of the realists and the nominalists which was carried on with varying fortunes and under various names from the time of scotus erigena to the end of the scholastic period has it now a merely antiquarian interest has nominalism in any of its modifications so completely won the day that realism may be regarded as dead and buried without hope of resurrection 245 many people seem to think so but it appears to me that without taking catholic philosophy into consideration one has not to look about far to find evidence that realism is still to the fore and indeed extremely lively65    the other day i happened to meet with a report of a sermon recently preached in st pauls cathedral from internal evidence i am inclined to think that the report is substantially correct but as i have not the slightest intention of finding fault with the eminent theologian and eloquent preacher to whom the discourse is attributed for employment of scientific language in a manner for which he could find only too many scientific precedents the accuracy of the report in detail is not to the purpose i may safely take it as the embodiment of views which are thought to be quite in accordance with science by many excellent instructed and intelligent people      the preacher further contended that it was yet more difficult to     realise that our earthly home would become the scene of a vast physical     catastrophe imagination recoils from the idea that the 246 course of     naturethe phrase helps to disguise the truthso unvarying and     regular the ordered sequence of movement and life should suddenly     cease imagination looks more reasonable when it assumes the air of     scientific reason physical law it says will prevent the occurrence     of catastrophes only anticipated by an apostle in an unscientific age     might not there however be a suspension of a lower law by the     intervention of a higher thus every time we lifted our arms we defied     the laws of gravitation and in railways and steamboats powerful laws     were held in check by others the flood and the destruction of sodom     and gomorrah were brought about by the operations of existing laws and     may it not be that in his illimitable universe there are more important     laws than those which surround our puny lifemoral and not merely     physical forces is it inconceivable that the day will come when these     royal and ultimate laws shall wreck the natural order of things which     seems so stable and so fair earthquakes were not things of remote     antiquity as an island off italy the eastern archipelago greece and     chicago bore witness in presence of a great earthquake men feel how     powerless they are and their very knowledge adds to their weakness     the end of human probation the final dissolution of organised society     and the destruction of mans home on the surface of the globe were     none of them violently contrary to our present experience but only the     extension of present facts the presentiment of death was common there     were felt to be many things which threatened the existence of society     and as our globe was a ball of fire at any moment the pentup forces     which surge and boil beneath our feet might be poured out pall mall     gazette december 6 1886  the preacher appears to entertain the notion that the occurrence of a catastrophe66 involves a breach of the present order of naturethat it is an event incompatible with the physical laws which at present 247 obtain he seems to be of opinion that scientific reason lends its authority to the imaginative supposition that physical law will prevent the occurrence of the catastrophes anticipated by an unscientific apostle  scientific reason like homer sometimes nods but i am not aware that it has ever dreamed dreams of this sort the fundamental axiom of scientific thought is that there is not never has been and never will be any disorder in nature the admission of the occurrence of any event which was not the logical consequence of the immediately antecedent events according to these definite ascertained or unascertained rules which we call the laws of nature would be an act of selfdestruction on the part of science  catastrophe is a relative conception for ourselves it means an event which brings about very terrible consequences to man or impresses his mind by its magnitude relatively to him but events which are quite in the natural order of things to us may be frightful catastrophes to other sentient beings surely no interruption of the order of nature is involved if in the course of descending through an alpine pinewood i jump upon an anthill and in a moment wreck a whole city and destroy a hundred thousand of its inhabitants to the ants the catastrophe is worse than the earthquake of lisbon to me it is the natural and necessary consequence of the laws of matter in motion a redistribution of energy has taken place which is perfectly in accordance with natural order however unpleasant its effects may be to the ants 248  imagination inspired by scientific reason and not merely assuming the airs thereof as it unfortunately too often does in the pulpit so far from having any right to repudiate catastrophes and deny the possibility of the cessation of motion and life easily finds justification for the exactly contrary course kant in his famous theory of the heavens declares the end of the world and its reduction to a formless condition to be a necessary consequence of the causes to which it owes its origin and continuance and as to catastrophes of prodigious magnitude and frequent occurrence they were the favourite asylum ignorantiæ of geologists not a quarter of a century ago if modern geology is becoming more and more disinclined to call in catastrophes to its aid it is not because of any à priori difficulty in reconciling the occurrence of such events with the universality of order but because the à posteriori evidence of the occurrence of events of this character in past times has more or less completely broken down  it is to say the least highly probable that this earth is a mass of extremely hot matter invested by a cooled crust through which the hot interior still continues to cool though with extreme slowness it is no less probable that the faults and dislocations the foldings and fractures everywhere visible in the stratified crust its large and slow movements through miles of elevation and depression and its small and rapid movements which give rise to the innumerable perceived and unperceived earthquakes which are constantly occurring are due to the 249 shrinkage of the crust on its cooling and contracting nucleus  without going beyond the range of fair scientific analogy conditions are easily conceivable which should render the loss of heat far more rapid than it is at present and such an occurrence would be just as much in accordance with ascertained laws of nature as the more rapid cooling of a redhot bar when it is thrust into cold water than when it remains in the air but much more rapid cooling might entail a shifting and rearrangement of the parts of the crust of the earth on a scale of unprecedented magnitude and bring about catastrophes to which the earthquake of lisbon is but a trifle it is conceivable that man and his works and all the higher forms of animal life should be utterly destroyed that mountain regions should be converted into ocean depths and the floor of oceans raised into mountains and the earth become a scene of horror which even the lurid fancy of the writer of the apocalypse would fail to portray and yet to the eye of science there would be no more disorder here than in the sabbatical peace of a summer sea not a link in the chain of natural causes and effects would be broken nowhere would there be the slightest indication of the suspension of a lower law by a higher if a sober scientific thinker is inclined to put little faith in the wild vaticinations of universal ruin which in a less saintly person than the seer of patmos might seem to be dictated by the fury of a revengeful fanatic rather than by the spirit of the teacher who bid men love 250 their enemies it is not on the ground that they contradict scientific principles but because the evidence of their scientific value does not fulfil the conditions on which weight is attached to evidence the imagination which supposes that it does simply does not assume the air of scientific reason  i repeat that if imagination is used within the limits laid down by science disorder is unimaginable if a being endowed with perfect intellectual and æsthetic faculties but devoid of the capacity for suffering pain either physical or moral were to devote his utmost powers to the investigation of nature the universe would seem to him to be a sort of kaleidoscope in which at every successive moment of time a new arrangement of parts of exquisite beauty and symmetry would present itself and each of them would show itself to be the logical consequence of the preceding arrangement under the conditions which we call the laws of nature such a spectator might well be filled with that amor intellectualis dei the beatific vision of the vita contemplativa which some of the greatest thinkers of all ages aristotle aquinas spinoza have regarded as the only conceivable eternal felicity and the vision of illimitable suffering as if sensitive beings were unregarded animalcules which had got between the bits of glass of the kaleidoscope which mars the prospect to us poor mortals in no wise alters the fact that order is lord of all and disorder only a name for that part of the order which gives us pain  the other fallacious employment of the names of 251 scientific conceptions which pervades the preachers utterance brings me back to the proper topic of the present paper it is the use of the word law as if it denoted a thingas if a law of nature as science understands it were a being endowed with certain powers in virtue of which the phenomena expressed by that law are brought about the preacher asks might not there be a suspension of a lower law by the intervention of a higher he tells us that every time we lift our arms we defy the law of gravitation he asks whether some day certain royal and ultimate laws may not come and wreck those laws which are at present it would appear acting as natures police it is evident from these expressions that laws in the mind of the preacher are entities having an objective existence in a graduated hierarchy and it would appear that the royal laws are by no means to be regarded as constitutional royalties at any moment they may like eastern despots descend in wrath among the middleclass and plebeian laws which have hitherto done the drudgery of the worlds work and to use phraseology not unknown in our seats of learningmake hay of their belongings or perhaps a still more familiar analogy has suggested this singular theory and it is thought that high laws may suspend low laws as a bishop may suspend a curate  far be it from me to controvert these views if any one likes to hold them all i wish to remark is that such a conception of the nature of laws has nothing to do with modern science it is scholastic 252 realismrealism as intense and unmitigated as that of scotus erigena a thousand years ago the essence of such realism is that it maintains the objective existence of universals or as we call them nowadays general propositions it affirms for example that man is a real thing apart from individual men having its existence not in the sensible but in the intelligible world and clothing itself with the accidents of sense to make the jack and tom and harry whom we know strange as such a notion may appear to modern scientific thought it really pervades ordinary language there are few people who would at once hesitate to admit that colour for example exists apart from the mind which conceives the idea of colour they hold it to be something which resides in the coloured object and so far they are as much realists as if they had sat at platos feet reflection on the facts of the case must i imagine convince every one that colour isnot a mere name which was the extreme nominalist positionbut a name for that group of states of feeling which we call blue red yellow and so on and which we believe to be caused by luminiferous vibrations which have not the slightest resemblance to colour while these again are set afoot by states of the body to which we ascribe colour but which are equally devoid of likeness to colour  in the same way a law of nature in the scientific sense is the product of a mental operation upon the facts of nature which come under our observation and has no more existence outside the mind than 253 colour has the law of gravitation is a statement of the manner in which experience shows that bodies which are free to move do in fact move towards one another but the other facts of observation that bodies are not always moving in this fashion and sometimes move in a contrary direction are implied in the words free to move if it is a law of nature that bodies tend to move towards one another in a certain way it is another and no less true law of nature that if bodies are not free to move as they tend to do either in consequence of an obstacle or of a contrary impulse from some other source of energy than that to which we give the name of gravitation they either stop still or go another way  scientifically speaking it is the acme of absurdity to talk of a man defying the law of gravitation when he lifts his arm the general store of energy in the universe working through terrestrial matter is doubtless tending to bring the mans arm down but the particular fraction of that energy which is working through certain of his nervous and muscular organs is tending to drive it up and more energy being expended on the arm in the upward than in the downward direction the arm goes up accordingly but the law of gravitation is no more defied in this case than when a grocer throws so much sugar into the empty pan of his scales that the one which contains the weight kicks the beam  the tenacity of the wonderful fallacy that the laws of nature are agents instead of being as they really are a mere record of experience upon which we 254 base our interpretations of that which does happen and our anticipation of that which will happen is an interesting psychological fact and would be unintelligible if the tendency of the human mind towards realism were less strong  even at the present day and in the writings of men who would at once repudiate scholastic realism in any form law is often inadvertently employed in the sense of cause just as in common life a man will say that he is compelled by the law to do so and so when in point of fact all he means is that the law orders him to do it and tells him what will happen if he does not do it we commonly hear of bodies falling to the ground by reason of the law of gravitation whereas that law is simply the record of the fact that according to all experience they have so fallen when free to move and of the grounds of a reasonable expectation that they will so fall if it should be worth anybodys while to seek for examples of such misuse of language on my own part i am not at all sure he might not succeed though i have usually been on my guard against such looseness of expression if i am guilty i do penance beforehand and only hope that i may thereby deter others from committing the like fault and i venture on this personal observation by way of showing that i have no wish to bear hardly on the preacher for falling into an error for which he might find good precedents but it is one of those errors which in the case of a person engaged in scientific pursuits do little harm because it is corrected as soon as its consequences 255 become obvious while those who know physical science only by name are as has been seen easily led to build a mighty fabric of unrealities on this fundamental fallacy in fact the habitual use of the word law in the sense of an active thing is almost a mark of pseudoscience it characterises the writings of those who have appropriated the forms of science without knowing anything of its substance  there are two classes of these people those who are ready to believe in any miracle so long as it is guaranteed by ecclesiastical authority and those who are ready to believe in any miracle so long as it has some different guarantee the believers in what are ordinarily called miraclesthose who accept the miraculous narratives which they are taught to think are essential elements of religious doctrineare in the one category the spiritrappers tableturners and all the other devotees of the occult sciences of our day are in the other and if they disagree in most things they agree in this namely that they ascribe to science a dictum that is not scientific and that they endeavour to upset the dictum thus foisted on science by a realistic argument which is equally unscientific  it is asserted for example that on a particular occasion water was turned into wine and on the other hand it is asserted that a man or a woman levitated to the ceiling floated about there and finally sailed out by the window and it is assumed that the pardonable scepticism with which most scientific men receive these statements is due to the 256 fact that they feel themselves justified in denying the possibility of any such metamorphosis of water or of any such levitation because such events are contrary to the laws of nature so the question of the preacher is triumphantly put how do you know that there are not higher laws of nature than your chemical and physical laws and that these higher laws may not intervene and wreck the latter  the plain answer to this question is why should anybody be called upon to say how he knows that which he does not know you are assuming that laws are agentsefficient causes of that which happensand that one law can interfere with another to us that assumption is as nonsensical as if you were to talk of a proposition of euclid being the cause of the diagram which illustrates it or of the integral calculus interfering with the rule of three your question really implies that we pretend to complete knowledge not only of all past and present phenomena but of all that are possible in the future and we leave all that sort of thing to the adepts of esoteric buddhism our pretensions are infinitely more modest we have succeeded in finding out the rules of action of a little bit of the universe we call these rules laws of nature not because anybody knows whether they bind nature or not but because we find it is obligatory on us to take them into account both as actors under nature and as interpreters of nature we have any quantity of genuine miracles of our own and if you will furnish us with as good evidence of your miracles as we have 257 of ours we shall be quite happy to accept them and to amend our expression of the laws of nature in accordance with the new facts  as to the particular cases adduced we are so perfectly fairminded as to be willing to help your case as far as we can you are quite mistaken in supposing that anybody who is acquainted with the possibilities of physical science will undertake categorically to deny that water may be turned into wine many very competent judges are already inclined to think that the bodies which we have hitherto called elementary are really composite arrangements of the particles of a uniform primitive matter supposing that view to be correct there would be no more theoretical difficulty about turning water into alcohol ethereal and colouring matters than there is at this present moment any practical difficulty in working other such miracles as when we turn sugar into alcohol carbonic acid glycerine and succinic acid or transmute gasrefuse into perfumes rarer than musk and dyes richer than tyrian purple if the socalled elements oxygen and hydrogen which compose water are aggregates of the same ultimate particles or physical units as those which enter into the structure of the socalled element carbon it is obvious that alcohol and other substances composed of carbon hydrogen and oxygen may be produced by a rearrangement of some of the units of oxygen and hydrogen into the element carbon and their synthesis with the rest of the oxygen and hydrogen 258  theoretically therefore

train or telegram to stillvexed bermoothes and twit ariel if he happens to be there for a sluggard we have not the presumption to deny the possibility of anything you affirm only as our brethren are particular about evidence do give us as much to go upon as may save us from being roared down by their inextinguishable laughter  enough of the realism which clings about laws there are plenty of other exemplifications of its vitality in modern science but i will cite only one of them  this is the conception of vital force which comes straight from the philosophy of aristotle it is a fundamental proposition of that philosophy that 259 a natural object is composed of two constituentsthe one its matter conceived as inert or even to a certain extent opposed to orderly and purposive motion the other its form conceived as a quasispiritual something containing or conditioning the actual activities of the body and the potentiality of its possible activities  i am disposed to think that the prominence of this conception in aristotles theory of things arose from the circumstance that he was to begin with and throughout his life devoted to biological studies in fact it is a notion which must force itself upon the mind of any one who studies biological phenomena without reference to general physics as they now stand everybody who observes the obvious phenomena of the development of a seed into a tree or of an egg into an animal will note that a relatively formless mass of matter gradually grows takes a definite shape and structure and finally begins to perform actions which contribute towards a certain end namely the maintenance of the individual in the first place and of the species in the second starting from the axiom that every event has a cause we have here the causa finalis manifested in the last set of phenomena the causa materialis and formalis in the first while the existence of a causa efficiens within the seed or egg and its product is a corollary from the phenomena of growth and metamorphosis which proceed in unbroken succession and make up the life of the animal or plant  thus at starting the egg or seed is matter having 260 a form like all other material bodies but this form has the peculiarity in contradistinction to lower substantial forms that it is a power which constantly works towards an end by means of living organisation  so far as i know leibnitz is the only philosopher at the same time a man of science in the modern sense of the first rank who has noted that the modern conception of force as a sort of atmosphere enveloping the particles of bodies and having potential or actual activity is simply a new name for the aristotelian form67 in modern biology up till within quite recent times the aristotelian conception held undisputed sway living matter was endowed with vital force and that accounted for everything whosoever was not satisfied with that explanation was treated to that very plain argumentconfound you eternallywherewith lord peter overcomes the doubts of his brothers in the tale of a tub materialist was the mildest term applied to himfortunate if he escaped pelting with infidel and atheist there may be scientific rip van winkles about who still hold by vital force but among those biologists who have not been asleep for the last quarter of a century vital force no longer figures in the vocabulary of science it is a patent survival of realism the generalisation from experience that all living bodies exhibit certain activities of a definite character is made the basis of the notion 261 that every living body contains an entity vital force which is assumed to be the cause of those activities  it is remarkable in looking back to notice to what an extent this and other survivals of scholastic realism arrested or at any rate impeded the application of sound scientific principles to the investigation of biological phenomena when i was beginning to think about these matters the scientific world was occasionally agitated by discussions respecting the nature of the species and genera of naturalists of a different order from the disputes of a later time i think most were agreed that a species was something which existed objectively somehow or other and had been created by a divine fiat as to the objective reality of genera there was a good deal of difference of opinion on the other hand there were a few who could see no objective reality in anything but individuals and looked upon both species and genera as hypostatised universals as for myself i seem to have unconsciously emulated william of occam inasmuch as almost the first public discourse i ever ventured upon dealt with animal individuality and its tendency was to fight the nominalist battle even in that quarter  realism appeared in still stranger forms at the time to which i refer the community of plan which is observable in each great group of animals was hypostatised into a platonic idea with the appropriate name of archetype and we were told as a disciple of philojudæus might have told us that this realistic figment was the archetypal light by which nature 262 has been guided amidst the wreck of worlds so again another naturalist who had no less earned a welldeserved reputation by his contributions to positive knowledge put forward a theory of the production of living things which as nearly as the increase of knowledge allowed was a reproduction of the doctrine inculcated by the jewish cabbala  annexing the archetype notion and carrying it to its full logical consequence the author of this theory conceived that the species of animals and plants were so many incarnations of the thoughts of godmaterial representations of divine ideasduring the particular period of the worlds history at which they existed but under the influence of the embryological and palæontological discoveries of modern times which had already lent some scientific support to the revived ancient theories of cosmical evolution or emanation the ingenious author of this speculation while denying and repudiating the ordinary theory of evolution by successive modification of individuals maintained and endeavoured to prove the occurrence of a progressive modification in the divine ideas of successive epochs  on the foundation of a supposed elevation of organisation in the whole living population of any epoch as compared with that of its predecessor and a supposed complete difference in species between the populations of any two epochs neither of which suppositions has stood the test of further inquiry the author of this speculation based his conclusion that the creator had so to speak improved upon his thoughts as time went on and that as each such 263 amended scheme of creation came up the embodiment of the earlier divine thoughts was swept away by a universal catastrophe and an incarnation of the improved ideas took its place only after the last such wreck thus brought about did the embodiment of a divine thought in the shape of the first man make its appearance as the ne plus ultra of the cosmogonical process  i imagine that louis agassiz the genial backwoodsman of the science of my young days who did more to open out new tracks in the scientific forest than most men would have been much surprised to learn that he was preaching the doctrine of the cabbala pure and simple according to this modification of neoplatonism by contact with hebrew speculation the divine essence is unknowablewithout form or attribute but the interval between it and the world of sense is filled by intelligible entities which are nothing but the familiar hypostatised abstractions of the realists these have emanated like immense waves of light from the divine centre and as ten consecutive zones of sephiroth form the universe the farther away from the centre the more the primitive light wanes until the periphery ends in those mere negations darkness and evil which are the essence of matter on this the divine agency transmitted through the sephiroth operates after the fashion of the aristotelian forms and at first produces the lowest of a series of worlds after a certain duration the primitive world is demolished and its fragments used up in making a better and 264 this process is repeated until at length a final world with man for its crown and finish makes its appearance it is needless to trace the process of retrogressive metamorphosis by which through the agency of the messiah the steps of the process of evolution here sketched are retraced sufficient has been said to prove that the extremest realism current in the philosophy of the thirteenth century can be fully matched by the speculations of our own time                                        265  vii  science and pseudoscience  in the opening sentences of a contribution to the last number of this review68 the duke of argyll has favoured me with a lecture on the proprieties of controversy to which i should be disposed to listen with more docility if his graces precepts appeared to me to be based upon rational principles or if his example were more exemplary  with respect to the latter point the duke has thought fit to entitle his article professor huxley on canon liddon and thus forces into prominence an element of personality which those who read the paper which is the object of the dukes animadversions will observe i have endeavoured most carefully to avoid my criticisms dealt with a report of a sermon published in a newspaper and thereby addressed to all the world whether that sermon was preached by a or b was not a matter of the smallest consequence and i went out of my way to absolve the learned divine to whom the discourse was attributed from the responsibility for statements which for anything i knew to the contrary might contain 266 imperfect or inaccurate representations of his views the assertion that i had the wish or was beset by any temptation to attack canon liddon is simply contrary to fact  but suppose that if instead of sedulously avoiding even the appearance of such attack i had thought fit to take a different course suppose that after satisfying myself that the eminent clergyman whose name is paraded by the duke of argyll had really uttered the words attributed to him from the pulpit of st pauls what right would any one have to find fault with my action on grounds either of justice expediency or good taste  establishment has its duties as well as its rights the clergy of a state church enjoy many advantages over those of unprivileged and unendowed religious persuasions but they lie under a correlative responsibility to the state and to every member of the body politic i am not aware that any sacredness attaches to sermons if preachers stray beyond the doctrinal limits set by lay lawyers the privy council will see to it and if they think fit to use their pulpits for the promulgation of literary or historical or scientific errors it is not only the right but the duty of the humblest layman who may happen to be better informed to correct the evil effects of such perversion of the opportunities which the state affords them and such misuse of the authority which its support lends them whatever else it may claim to be in its relations with the state the established church is a branch of the civil service and for those who 267 repudiate the ecclesiastical authority of the clergy they are merely civil servants as much responsible to the english people for the proper performance of their duties as any others  the duke of argyll tells us that the work and calling of the clergy prevent them from pursuing disputation as others can i wonder if his grace ever reads the socalled religious newspapers it is not an occupation which i should commend to any one who wishes to employ his time profitably but a very short devotion to this exercise will suffice to convince him that the pursuit of disputation carried to a degree of acrimony and vehemence unsurpassed in lay controversies seems to be found quite compatible with the work and calling of a remarkably large number of the clergy  finally it appears to me that nothing can be in worse taste than the assumption that a body of english gentlemen can by any possibility desire that immunity from criticism which the duke of argyll claims for them nothing would be more personally offensive to me than the supposition that i shirked criticism just or unjust of any lecture i ever gave i should be utterly ashamed of myself if when i stood up as an instructor of others i had not taken every pains to assure myself of the truth of that which i was about to say and i should feel myself bound to be even more careful with a popular assembly who would take me more or less on trust than with an audience of competent and critical experts  i decline to assume that the standard of morality 268 in these matters is lower among the clergy than it is among scientific men i refuse to think that the priest who stands up before a congregation as the minister and interpreter of the divinity is less careful in his utterances less ready to meet adverse comment than the layman who comes before his audience as the minister and interpreter of nature yet what should we think of the man of science who when his ignorance or his carelessness was exposed whined about the want of delicacy of his critics or pleaded his work and calling as a reason for being let alone  no man nor any body of men is good enough or wise enough to dispense with the tonic of criticism nothing has done more harm to the clergy than the practice too common among laymen of regarding them when in the pulpit as a sort of chartered libertines whose divagations are not to be taken seriously and i am well assured that the distinguished divine to whom the sermon is attributed is the last person who would desire to avail himself of the dishonouring protection which has been superfluously thrown over him  so much for the lecture on propriety but the duke of argyll to whom the hortatory style seems to come naturally does me the honour to make my sayings the subjects of a series of other admonitions some on philosophical some on geological some on biological topics i can but rejoice that the dukes authority in these matters is not always employed to show that i am ignorant of them on the contrary i meet with an amount of agreement even of 269 approbation for which i proffer such gratitude as may be due even if that gratitude is sometimes almost overshadowed by surprise  i am unfeignedly astonished to find that the duke of argyll who professes to intervene on behalf of the preacher does really like another balaam bless me altogether in respect of the main issue  i denied the justice of the preachers ascription to men of science of the doctrine that miracles are incredible because they are violations of natural law and the duke of argyll says that he believes my denial to be well founded the preacher was answering an objection which has now been generally abandoned either the preacher knew this or he did not know it it seems to me as a mere lay teacher to be a pity that the great dome of st pauls should have been made to echo if so be that such stentorian effects were really produced a statement which admitting the first alternative was unfair and admitting the second was ignorant69  270  having thus sacrificed one half of the preachers arguments the duke of argyll proceeds to make equally short work with the other half it appears that he fully accepts my position that the occurrence of those events which the preacher speaks of as catastrophes is no evidence of disorder inasmuch as such catastrophes may be necessary occasional consequences of uniform changes whence i conclude his grace agrees with me that the talk about royal laws wrecking ordinary laws may be eloquent metaphor but is also nonsense  and now comes a further surprise after having given these superfluous stabs to the slain body of the preachers argument my good ally remarks with magnificent calmness so far then the preacher and the professor are at one let them smoke the calumet by all means smoke would be the most appropriate symbol of this wonderful attempt to cover a retreat after all the duke has come to bury the preacher not to praise him only he makes the funeral obsequies look as much like a triumphal procession as possible  so far as the questions between the preacher and myself are concerned then i may feel happy the authority of the duke of argyll is ranged on my side but the duke has raised a number of other questions with respect to which i fear i shall have to dispense with his supportnay even be compelled to differ from him as much or more than i have done about his graces new rendering of the benefit of clergy 271  in discussing catastrophes the duke indulges in statements partly scientific partly anecdotic which appear to me to be somewhat misleading we are told to begin with that sir charles lyells doctrine respecting the proper mode of interpreting the facts of geology which is commonly called uniformitarianism does not hold its head quite so high as it once did that is great news indeed but is it true all i can say is that i am aware of nothing that has happened of late that can in any way justify it and my opinion is that the body of lyells doctrine as laid down in that great work the principles of geology whatever may have happened to its head is a chief and permanent constituent of the foundations of geological science  but this question cannot be advantageously discussed unless we take some pains to discriminate between the essential part of the uniformitarian doctrine and its accessories and it does not appear that the duke of argyll has carried his studies of geological philosophy so far as this point for he defines uniformitarianism to be the assumption of the extreme slowness and perfect continuity of all geological changes  what perfect continuity may mean in this definition i am by no means sure but i can only imagine that it signifies the absence of any break in the course of natural order during the millions of years the lapse of which is recorded by geological phenomena  is the duke of argyll prepared to say that any 272 geologist of authority at the present day believes that there is the slightest evidence of the occurrence of supernatural intervention during the long ages of which the monuments are preserved to us in the crust of the earth and if he is not in what sense has this part of the uniformitarian doctrine as he defines it lowered its pretensions to represent scientific truth  as to the extreme slowness of all geological changes it is simply a popular error to regard that as in any wise a fundamental and necessary dogma of uniformitarianism it is extremely astonishing to me that any one who has carefully studied lyells great work can have so completely failed to appreciate its purport which yet is writ large on the very titlepage the principles of geology being an attempt to explain the former changes of the earths surface by reference to causes now in operation the essence of lyells doctrine is here written so that those who run may read and it has nothing to do with the quickness or slowness of the past changes of the earths surface except in so far as existing analogous changes may go on slowly and therefore create a presumption in favour of the slowness of past changes  with that epigrammatic force which characterises his style buffon wrote nearly a hundred and fifty years ago in his famous théorie de la terre pour juger de ce qui est arrivé et même de ce qui arrivera nous navons quà examiner ce qui arrive the key of the past as of the future is to be sought in the present and only when known causes of change have 273 been shown to be insufficient have we any right to have recourse to unknown causes geology is as much a historical science as archæology and i apprehend that all sound historical investigation rests upon this axiom it underlay all huttons work and animated lyell and scrope in their successful efforts to revolutionise the geology of half a century ago  there is no antagonism whatever and there never was between the belief in the views which had their chief and unwearied advocate in lyell and the belief in the occurrence of catastrophes the first edition of lyells principles published in 1830 lies before me and a large part of the first volume is occupied by an account of volcanic seismic and diluvial catastrophes which have occurred within the historical period moreover the author over and over again expressly draws the attention of his readers to the consistency of catastrophes with his doctrine      notwithstanding therefore that we have not witnessed within the last     three thousand years the devastation by deluge of a large continent     yet as we may predict the future occurrence of such catastrophes we     are authorised to regard them as part of the present order of nature     and they may be introduced into geological speculations respecting the     past provided that we do not imagine them to have been more frequent     or general than we expect them to be in time to come vol i p 89  again      if we regard each of the causes separately which we know to be at     present the most instrumental in remodelling the state of the surface     we shall find that we must expect each to be in action for thousands of     years without producing any extensive 274 alterations in the     habitable surface and then to give rise during a very brief period     to important revolutions vol ii p 16170  lyell quarrelled with the catastrophists then by no means because they assumed that catastrophes occur and have occurred but because they had got into the habit of calling on their god catastrophe to help them when they ought to have been putting their shoulders to the wheel of observation of the present course of nature in order to help themselves out of their difficulties and geological science has become what it is chiefly because geologists have gradually accepted lyells doctrine and followed his precepts  so far as i know anything about the matter there is nothing that can be called proof that the causes of geological phenomena operated more intensely or more rapidly at any time between the older tertiary and the oldest palæozoic epochs than they have done between the older tertiary epoch and the present day and if that is so uniformitarianism even as limited by lyell71 has no call to lower its crest but if the facts were otherwise the position lyell took up remains 275 impregnable he did not say that the geological operations of nature were never more rapid or more vast than they are now what he did maintain is the very different proposition that there is no good evidence of anything of the kind and that proposition has not yet been shown to be incorrect  i owe more than i can tell to the careful study of the principles of geology in my young days and long before the year 1856 my mind was familiar with the truth that the doctrine of uniformity is not incompatible with great and sudden changes which as i have shown is taught totidem verbis in that work even had it been possible for me to shut my eyes to the sense of what i had read in the principles whewells philosophy of the inductive sciences published in 1840 a work with which i was also tolerably familiar must have opened them for the always acute if not always profound author in arguing against lyells uniformitarianism expressly points out that it does not in any way contravene the occurrence of catastrophes      with regard to such occurrences earthquakes deluges etc terrible     as they appear at the time they may not much affect the 276 average     rate of change there may be a cycle though an irregular one of     rapid and slow change and if such cycles go on succeeding each other     we may still call the order of nature uniform notwithstanding the     periods of violence which it involves72  the reader who has followed me through this brief chapter of the history of geological philosophy will probably find the following passage in the paper of the duke of argyll to be not a little remarkable      many years ago when i had the honour of being president of the british     association73 i ventured to point out in the presence and in the     hearing of that most distinguished man sir c lyell that the doctrine     of uniformity was not incompatible with great and sudden changes since     cycles of these and other cycles of comparative rest might well be     constituent parts of that uniformity which he asserted lyell did not     object to this extended interpretation of his own doctrine and indeed     expressed to me his entire concurrence  i should think he did for as i have shown there was nothing in it that lyell himself had not said sixandtwenty years before and enforced three years before and it is almost verbally identical with the view of uniformitarianism taken by whewell sixteen years before in a work with which one would think that any one who undertakes to discuss the philosophy of science should be familiar  thirty years have elapsed since the beginner of 1856 persuaded himself that he enlightened the foremost geologist of his time and one of the most acute and farseeing men of science of any time as to the scope of the doctrines which the veteran philosopher 277 had grown gray in promulgating and the duke of argylls acquaintance with the literature of geology has not even now become sufficiently profound to dissipate that pleasant delusion  if the duke of argylls guidance in that branch of physical science with which alone he has given evidence of any practical acquaintance is thus unsafe i may breathe more freely in setting my opinion against the authoritative deliverances of his grace about matters which lie outside the province of geology  and here the dukes paper offers me such a wealth of opportunities that choice becomes embarrassing i must bear in mind the good old adage non multa sed multum tempting as it would be to follow the duke through his labyrinthine misunderstandings of the ordinary terminology of philosophy and to comment on the curious unintelligibility which hangs about his frequent outpourings of fervid language limits of space oblige me to restrict myself to those points the discussion of which may help to enlighten the public in respect of matters of more importance than the competence of my mentor for the task which he has undertaken  i am not sure when the employment of the word law in the sense in which we speak of laws of nature commenced but examples of it may be found in the works of bacon descartes and spinoza bacon employs law as the equivalent of form and i am inclined to think that he may be responsible for a good deal of the confusion that has subsequently 278 arisen but i am not aware that the term is used by other authorities in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in any other sense than that of rule or definite order of the coexistence of things or succession of events in nature descartes speaks of règles que je nomme les lois de la nature leibnitz says loi ou règle générale as if he considered the terms interchangeable  the duke of argyll however affirms that the law of gravitation as put forth by newton was something more than the statement of an observed order he admits that keplers three laws were an observed order of facts and nothing more as to the law of gravitation it contains an element which keplers laws did not contain even an element of causation the recognition of which belongs to a higher category of intellectual conceptions than that which is concerned in the mere observation and record of separate and apparently unconnected facts there is hardly a line in these paragraphs which appears to me to be indisputable but to confine myself to the matter in hand i cannot conceive that any one who had taken ordinary pains to acquaint himself with the real nature of either keplers or newtons work could have written them that the labours of kepler of all men in the world should be called mere observation and record is truly wonderful and any one who will look into the principia or the optics or the letters to bentley will see even if he has no more special knowledge of the topics discussed than i have that newton over and over again insisted that he had 279 nothing to do with gravitation as a physical cause and that when he used the terms attraction force and the like he employed them as he says mathematicè and not physicè      how these attractions of gravity magnetism and electricity may be     performed i do not here consider what i call attraction may be     performed by impulse or by some other means unknown to me i use that     word here to signify only in a general way any force by which bodies     tend towards one another whatever be the cause74  according to my reading of the best authorities upon the history of science newton discovered neither gravitation nor the law of gravitation nor did he pretend to offer more than a conjecture as to the causation of gravitation moreover his assertion that the notion of a body acting where it is not is one that no competent thinker could entertain is antagonistic to the whole current conception of attractive and repulsive forces and therefore of the attractive force of gravitation what then was that labour of unsurpassed magnitude and excellence and immortal influence which newton did perform in the first place newton defined the laws rules or observed order of the phenomena of motion which come under our daily observation with greater precision than had been before attained and by following out with marvellous power and subtlety the mathematical consequences of these rules he almost created the modern science of pure mechanics in the second place applying exactly the same method 280 to the explication of the facts of astronomy as that which was applied a century and a half later to the facts of geology by lyell he set himself to solve the following problem assuming that all bodies free to move tend to approach one another as the earth and the bodies on it do assuming that the strength of that tendency is directly as the mass and inversely as the squares of the distances assuming that the laws of motion determined for terrestrial bodies hold good throughout the universe assuming that the planets and their satellites were created and placed at their observed mean distances and that each received a certain impulse from the creator will the form of the orbits the varying rates of motion of the planets and the ratio between those rates and their distances from the sun which must follow by mathematical reasoning from these premisses agree with the order of facts determined by kepler and others or not  newton employing mathematical methods which are the admiration of adepts but which no one but himself appears to have been able to use with ease not only answered this question in the affirmative but stayed not his constructive genius before it had founded modern physical astronomy  the historians of mechanical and of astronomical science appear to be agreed that he was the first person who clearly and distinctly put forth the hypothesis that the phenomena comprehended under the general name of gravity follow the same order throughout the universe and that all material bodies exhibit these phenomena so that in this sense the 281 idea of universal gravitation may doubtless be properly ascribed to him  newton proved that the laws of kepler were particular consequences of the laws of motion and the law of gravitationin other words the reason of the first lay in the two latter but to talk of the law of gravitation alone as the reason of keplers laws and still more as standing in any causal relation to keplers laws is simply a misuse of language it would really be interesting if the duke of argyll would explain how he proposes to set about showing that the elliptical form of the orbits of the planets the constant area described by the radius vector and the proportionality of the squares of the periodic times to the cubes of the distances from the sun are either caused by the force of gravitation or deducible from the law of gravitation i conceive that it would be about as apposite to say that the various compounds of nitrogen with oxygen are caused by chemical attraction and deducible from the atomic theory    newton assuredly lent no shadow of support to the modern pseudoscientific philosophy which confounds laws with causes i have not taken the trouble to trace out this commonest of fallacies to its first beginning but i was familiar with it in full bloom more than thirty years ago in a work which had a great vogue in its daythe vestiges of the natural history of creationof which the first edition was published in 1844  it is full of apt and forcible illustrations of 282 pseudoscientific realism consider for example this gem serene when a boy who has climbed a tree loses his hold of the branch the law of gravitation unrelentingly pulls him to the ground and then he is hurt whereby the almighty is quite relieved from any responsibility for the accident here is the law of gravitation acting as a cause in a way quite in accordance with the duke of argylls conception of it in fact in the mind of the author of the vestiges laws are existences intermediate between the creator and his works like the ideas of the platonisers or the logos of the alexandrians75 i may cite a passage which is quite in the vein of philo      we have seen powerful evidences that the construction of this globe and     its associates and inferentially that of all the other globes in     space was the result not of any immediate or personal exertion on the     part of the deity but of natural laws which are the expression of his     will what is to hinder our supposing that the organic creation is also     a result of natural laws which are in like manner an expression of his     will p 154 1st edition  and creation operating by law is constantly cited as relieving the creator from trouble about insignificant details  i am perplexed to picture to myself the state of mind which accepts these verbal juggleries it is intelligible that the creator should operate according to such rules as he might think fit to lay down for himself and therefore according to law but that would leave the operation of his will just as much a direct personal act as it would be under any other 283 circumstances i can also understand that as in leibnitzs caricature of newtons views the creator might have made the cosmical machine and after setting it going have left it to itself till it needed repair but then by the supposition his personal responsibility would have been involved in all that it did just as much as a dynamiter is responsible for what happens when he has set his machine going and left it to explode  the only hypothesis which gives a sort of mad consistency to the vestigiarians views is the supposition that laws are a kind of angels or demiurgoi who being supplied with the great architects plan were permitted to settle the details among themselves accepting this doctrine the conception of royal laws and plebeian laws and of those more than homeric contests in which the big laws wreck the little ones becomes quite intelligible and in fact the honour of the paternity of those remarkable ideas which come into full flower in the preachers discourse must so far as my imperfect knowledge goes be attributed to the author of the vestiges  but the author of the vestiges is not the only writer who is responsible for the current pseudoscientific mystifications which hang about the term law when i wrote my paper about scientific and pseudoscientific realism i had not read a work by the duke of argyll the reign of law which i believe has enjoyed possibly still enjoys a widespread popularity but the vivacity of the dukes attack led me to think it possible that criticisms directed elsewhere might have come home to 284 him and in fact i find that the second chapter of the work in question which is entitled law its definitions is from my point of view a sort of summa of pseudoscientific philosophy it will be worth while to examine it in some detail  in the first place it is to be noted that the author of the reign of law admits that law in many cases means nothing more than the statement of the order in which facts occur or as he says an observed order of facts p 66 but his appreciation of the value of accuracy of expression does not hinder him from adding almost in the same breath in this sense the laws of nature are simply those facts of nature which recur according to rule p 66 thus laws which were rightly said to be the statement of an order of facts in one paragraph are declared to be the facts themselves in the next  we are next told that though it may be customary and permissible to use law in the sense of a statement of the order of facts this is a low use of the word and indeed two pages farther on the writer flatly contradicting himself altogether denies its admissibility      an observed order of facts to be entitled to the rank of a law must     be an order so constant and uniform as to indicate necessity and     necessity can only arise out of the action of some compelling force p     68  this is undoubtedly one of the most singular propositions that i have ever met with in a professedly scientific work and its rarity is embellished by another direct selfcontradiction which it implies for 285 on the preceding page 67 when the duke of argyll is speaking of the laws of kepler which he admits to be laws and which are types of that which men of science understand by laws he says that they are simply and purely an order of facts moreover he adds a very large proportion of the laws of every science are laws of this kind and in this sense  if according to the duke of argylls admission law is understood in this sense thus widely and constantly by scientific authorities where is the justification for his unqualified assertion that such statements of the observed order of facts are not entitled to the rank of laws  but let us examine the consequences of the really interesting proposition i have just quoted i presume that it is a law of nature that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points this law affirms the constant association of a certain fact of form with a certain fact of dimension whether the notion of necessity which attaches to it has an à priori or an à posteriori origin is a question not relevant to the present discussion but i would beg to be informed if it is necessary where is the compelling force out of which the necessity arises and further if it is not necessary whether it loses the character of a law of nature  i take it to be a law of nature based on unexceptionable evidence that the mass of matter remains unchanged whatever chemical or other modifications it may undergo this law is one of the foundations of chemistry but it is by no means necessary it 286 is quite possible to imagine that the mass of matter should vary according to circumstances as we know its weight does moreover the determination of the force which makes mass constant if there is any intelligibility in that form of words would not so far as i can see confer any more validity on the law than it has now  there is a law of nature so well vouched by experience that all mankind from pure logicians in search of examples to parish sextons in search of fees confide in it this is the law that all men are mortal it is simply a statement of the observed order of facts that all men sooner or later die i am not acquainted with any law of nature which is more constant and uniform than this but will any one tell me that death is necessary certainly there is no à priori necessity in the case for various men have been imagined to be immortal and i should be glad to be informed of any necessity that can be deduced from biological considerations it is quite conceivable as has recently been pointed out that some of the lowest forms of life may be immortal after a fashion however this may be i would further ask supposing all men are mortal to be a real law of nature where and what is that to which with any propriety the title of compelling force of the law can be given  on page 69 the duke of argyll asserts that the law of gravitation is a law in the sense not merely of a rule but of a cause but this revival of the teaching of the vestiges has already been examined 287 and disposed of and when the duke of argyll states that the observed order which kepler had discovered was simply a necessary consequence of the force of gravitation i need not recapitulate the evidence which proves such a statement to be wholly fallacious but it may be useful to say once more that at this present moment nobody knows anything about the existence of a force of gravitation apart from the fact that newton declared the ordinary notion of such force to be inconceivable that various attempts have been made to account for the order of facts we call gravitation without recourse to the notion of attractive force that if such a force exists it is utterly incompetent to account for keplers laws without taking into the reckoning a great number of other considerations and finally that all we know about the force of gravitation or any other socalled force is that it is a name for the hypothetical cause of an observed order of facts  thus when the duke of argyll says force ascertained according to some measure of its operationthis is indeed one of the definitions but only one of a scientific law p 71 i reply that it is a definition which must be repudiated by every one who possesses an adequate acquaintance with either the facts or the philosophy of science and relegated to the limbo of pseudoscientific fallacies if the human mind had never entertained this notion of force nay if it substituted bare invariable succession for the ordinary notion of causation the idea of law as the expression of a constantlyobserved order which 288 generates a corresponding intensity of expectation in our minds would have exactly the same value and play its part in real science exactly as it does now  it is needless to extend further the present excursus on the origin and history of modern pseudoscience under such high patronage as it has enjoyed it has grown and flourished until nowadays it is becoming somewhat rampant it has its weekly ephemerides in which every new pseudoscientific maresnest is hailed and belauded with the unconscious unfairness of ignorance and an army of reconcilers enlisted in its service whose business seems to be to mix the black of dogma and the white of science into the neutral tint of what they call liberal theology  i remember that not long after the publication of the vestiges a shrewd and sarcastic countryman of the author defined it as cauld kail made het again a cynic might find amusement in the reflection that at the present time the principles and the methods of the muchvilified vestigiarian are being made het again and are not only echoed by the dome of st pauls but thundered from the castle of inveraray but my turn of mind is not cynical and i can but regret the waste of time and energy bestowed on the endeavour to deal with the most difficult problems of science by those who have neither undergone the discipline nor possess the information which are indispensable to the successful issue of such an enterprise  i have already had occasion to remark that the 289 duke of argylls views of the conduct of controversy are different from mine and this muchtobelamented discrepancy becomes yet more accentuated when the duke reaches biological topics anything that was good enough for sir charles lyell in his department of study is certainly good enough for me in mine and i by no means demur to being pedagogically instructed about a variety of matters with which it has been the business of my life to try to acquaint myself but the duke of argyll is not content with favouring me with his opinions about my own business he also answers for mine and at that point really the worm must turn i am told that no one knows better than professor huxley a variety of things which i really do not know and i am said to be a disciple of that positive philosophy which i have over and over again publicly repudiated in language which is certainly not lacking in intelligibility whatever may be its other defects  i am told that i have been amusing myself with a metaphysical exercitation or logomachy may i remark incidentally that these are not quite convertible terms when to the best of my belief i have been trying to expose a process of mystification based upon the use of scientific language by writers who exhibit no sign of scientific training of accurate scientific knowledge or of clear ideas respecting the philosophy of science which is doing very serious harm to the public naturally enough they take the lions skin of scientific phraseology for evidence that the voice which issues from beneath it is the voice of 290 science and i desire to relieve them from the consequences of their error  the duke of argyll asks apparently with sorrow that it should be his duty to subject me to reproof      what shall we say of a philosophy which confounds the organic with the     inorganic and refusing to take note of a difference so profound     assumes to explain under one common abstraction the movements due to     gravitation and the movements due to the mind of man  to which i may fitly reply by another question what shall we say to a controversialist who attributes to the subject of his attack opinions which are notoriously not his and expresses himself in such a manner that it is obvious he is unacquainted with even the rudiments of that knowledge which is necessary to the discussion into which he has rushed  what line of my writing can the duke of argyll produce which confounds the organic with the inorganic  as to the latter half of the paragraph i have to confess a doubt whether it has any definite meaning but i imagine that the duke is alluding to my assertion that the law of gravitation is nowise suspended or defied when a man lifts his arm but that under such circumstances part of the store of energy in the universe operates on the arm at a mechanical advantage as against the operation of another part i was simple enough to think that no one who had as much knowledge of physiology as is to be found in an elementary primer or who had ever heard of the greatest physical generalisation of modern 291 timesthe doctrine of the conservation of energywould dream of doubting my statement and i was further simple enough to think that no one who lacked these qualifications would feel tempted to charge me with error it appears that my simplicity is greater than my powers of imagination  the duke of argyll may not be aware of the fact but it is nevertheless true that when a mans arm is raised in sequence to that state of consciousness we call a volition the volition is not the immediate cause of the elevation of the arm on the contrary that operation is effected by a certain change of form technically known as contraction in sundry masses of flesh technically known as muscles which are fixed to the bones of the shoulder in such a manner that if these muscles contract they must raise the arm now each of these muscles is a machine comparable in a certain sense to one of the donkeyengines of a steamship but more complete inasmuch as the source of its ability to change its form or contract lies within itself every time that by contracting the muscle does work such as that involved in raising the arm more or less of the material which it contains is used up just as more or less of the fuel of a steamengine is used up when it does work and i do not think there is a doubt in the mind of any competent physicist or physiologist that the work done in lifting the weight of the arm is the mechanical equivalent of a certain proportion of the energy set free by the molecular changes which take place in the muscle it is further a tolerably 292 wellbased belief that this and all other forms of energy are mutually convertible and therefore that they all come under that general law or statement of the order of facts called the conservation of energy and as that certainly is an abstraction so the view which the duke of argyll thinks so extremely absurd is really one of the commonplaces of physiology but this review is hardly an appropriate place for giving instruction in the elements of that science and i content myself with recommending the duke of argyll to devote some study to book ii chap v section 4 of my friend dr fosters excellent textbook of physiology 1st edition 1877 p 321 which begins thus      broadly speaking the animal body is a machine for converting potential     into actual energy the potential energy is supplied by the food this     the metabolism of the body converts into the actual energy of heat and     mechanical labour  there is no more difficult problem in the world than that of the relation of the state of consciousness termed volition to the mechanical work which frequently follows upon it but no one can even comprehend the nature of the problem who has not carefully studied the long series of modes of motion which without a break connect the energy which does that work with the general store of energy the ultimate form of the problem is this have we any reason to believe that a feeling or state of consciousness is capable of directly affecting the motion of even the smallest conceivable molecule of matter is such a thing even conceivable if we answer these 293 questions in the negative it follows that volition may be a sign but cannot be a cause of bodily motion if we answer them in the affirmative then states of consciousness become undistinguishable from material things for it is the essential nature of matter to be the vehicle or substratum of mechanical energy  there is nothing new in all this i have merely put into modern language the issue raised by descartes more than two centuries ago the philosophies of the occasionalists of spinoza of malebranche of modern idealism and modern materialism have all grown out of the controversies which cartesianism evoked of all this the pseudoscience of the present time appears to be unconscious otherwise it would hardly content itself with making het again the pseudoscience of the past  in the course of these observations i have already had occasion to express my appreciation of the copious and perfervid eloquence which enriches the duke of argylls pages i am almost ashamed that a constitutional insensibility to the sirenian charms of rhetoric has permitted me in wandering through these flowery meads to be attracted almost exclusively to the bare places of fallacy and the stony grounds of deficient information which are disguised though not concealed by these floral decorations but in his concluding sentences the duke soars into a tyrtæan strain which roused even my dull soul      it was high time indeed that some revolt should be raised against     that reign of terror which had come to be established in the scientific     world under the abuse of a great name 294 professor huxley has not     joined this revolt openly for as yet indeed it is only beginning to     raise its head but more than onceand very latelyhe has uttered a     warning voice against the shallow dogmatism that has provoked it the     time is coming when that revolt will be carried further higher     interpretations will be established unless i am much mistaken they     are already coming in sight p 339  i have been living very much out of the world for the last two or three years and when i read this denunciatory outburst as of one filled with the spirit of prophecy i said to myself mercy upon us what has happened can it be that x and y it would be wrong to mention the names of the vigorous young friends which occurred to me are playing danton and robespierre and that a guillotine is erected in the courtyard of burlington house for the benefit of all antidarwinian fellows of the royal society where are the secret conspirators against this tyranny whom i am supposed to favour and yet not have the courage to join openly and to think of my poor oppressed friend mr herbert spencer compelled to speak with bated breath p 338 certainly for the first time in my thirtyodd years acquaintance with him my alarm and horror at the supposition that while i had been fiddling or at any rate physicking my beloved rome had been burning in this fashion may be imagined  i am sure the duke of argyll will be glad to hear that the anxiety he created was of extremely short duration it is my privilege to have access to the best sources of information and nobody in the scientific world can tell me anything about either the reign of 295 terror or the revolt in fact the scientific world laughs most indecorously at the notion of the existence of either and some are so lost to the sense of the scientific dignity that they descend to the use of transatlantic slang and call it a bogus scare as to my friend mr herbert spencer i have every reason to know that in the factors of organic evolution he has said exactly what was in his mind without any particular deference to the opinions of the person whom he is pleased to regard as his most dangerous critic and devils advocategeneral and still less of any one else  i do not know whether the duke of argyll pictures himself as the tallien of this imaginary revolt against a no less imaginary reign of terror but if so i most respectfully but firmly decline to join his forces it is only a few weeks since i happened to read over again the first article which i ever wrote now twentyseven years ago on the origin of species and i found nothing that i wished to modify in the opinions that are there expressed though the subsequent vast accumulation of evidence in favour of mr darwins views would give me much to add as is the case with all new doctrines so with that of evolution the enthusiasm of advocates has sometimes tended to degenerate into fanaticism and mere speculation has at times threatened to shoot beyond its legitimate bounds i have occasionally thought it wise to warn the more adventurous spirits among us against these dangers in sufficiently plain language and i have sometimes jestingly said that i expected 296 if i lived long enough to be looked on as a reactionary by some of my more ardent friends but nothing short of midsummer madness can account for the fiction that i am waiting till it is safe to join openly a revolt hatched by some person or persons unknown against an intellectual movement with which i am in the most entire and hearty sympathy it is a great many years since at the outset of my career i had to think seriously what life had to offer that was worth having i came to the conclusion that the chief good for me was freedom to learn think and say what i pleased when i pleased i have acted on that conviction and have availed myself of the rara temporum felicitas ubi sentire quæ velis et quæ sentias dicere licet which is now enjoyable to the best of my ability and though strongly and perhaps wisely warned that i should probably come to grief i am entirely satisfied with the results of the line of action i have adopted  my career is at an end i have      warmed both hands before the fire of life  and nothing is left me before i depart but to help or at any rate to abstain from hindering the younger generation of men of science in doing better service to the cause we have at heart than i have been able to render  and yet forsooth i am supposed to be waiting for the signal of revolt which some fiery spirits among these young men are to raise before i dare express my real opinions concerning questions about which we 297 older men had to fight in the teeth of fierce public opposition and obloquyof something which might almost justify even the grandiloquent epithet of a reign of terrorbefore our excellent successors had left school  it would appear that the spirit of pseudoscience has impregnated even the imagination of the duke of argyll the scientific imagination always restrains itself within the limits of probability                                        298  viii  an episcopal trilogy  if there is any truth in the old adage that a burnt child dreads the fire i ought to be very loath to touch a sermon while the memory of what befell me on a recent occasion possibly not yet forgotten by the readers of this review is uneffaced but i suppose that even the distinguished censor of that unheardof audacity to which not even the newspaper report of a sermon is sacred can hardly regard a man of science as either indelicate or presumptuous if he ventures to offer some comments upon three discourses specially addressed to the great assemblage of men of science which recently gathered at manchester by three bishops of the state church on my return to england not long ago i found a pamphlet76 containing a version which i presume to be authorised of these sermons among the huge mass of letters and papers which had accumulated during two months absence and i have read them not only 299 with attentive interest but with a feeling of satisfaction which is quite new to me as a result of hearing or reading sermons these excellent discourses in fact appear to me to signalise a new departure in the course adopted by theology towards science and to indicate the possibility of bringing about an honourable modus vivendi between the two how far the three bishops speak as accredited representatives of the church is a question to be considered by and by most assuredly i am not authorised to represent any one but myself but i suppose that there must be a good many people in the church of the bishops way of thinking and i have reason to believe that in the ranks of science there are a good many persons who more or less share my views and it is to these sensible people on both sides as the bishops and i must needs think those who agree with us that my present observations are addressed they will probably be astonished to learn how insignificant in principle their differences are  it is impossible to read the discourses of the three prelates without being impressed by the knowledge which they display and by the spirit of equity i might say of generosity towards science which pervades them there is no trace of that tacit or open assumption that the rejection of theological dogmas on scientific grounds is due to moral perversity which is the ordinary note of ecclesiastical homilies on this subject and which makes them look so supremely silly to men whose lives have been spent in wrestling with these questions there is no attempt to hide 300 away real stumblingblocks under rhetorical stucco no resort to the tu quoque device of setting scientific blunders against theological errors no suggestion that an honest man may keep contradictory beliefs in separate pockets of his brain no question that the method of scientific investigation is valid whatever the results to which it may lead and that the search after truth and truth only ennobles the searcher and leaves no doubt that his life at any rate is worth living the bishop of carlisle declares himself pledged to the belief that the advancement of science the progress of human knowledge is in itself a worthy aim of the greatest effort of the greatest minds  how often was it my fate a quarter of a century ago to see the whole artillery of the pulpit brought to bear upon the doctrine of evolution and its supporters any one unaccustomed to the amenities of ecclesiastical controversy would have thought we were too wicked to be permitted to live but let us hear the bishop of bedford after a perfectly frank statement of the doctrine of evolution and some of its obvious consequences that learned prelate pleads with all earnestness against      a hasty denunciation of what may be proved to have at least some     elements of truth in it a contemptuous rejection of theories which we     may some day learn to accept as freely and with as little sense of     inconsistency with gods word as we now accept the theory of the     earths motion round the sun or the long duration of the geological     epochs p 28  i do not see that the most convinced evolutionist could ask any one whether cleric or layman to say 301 more than this in fact i do not think that any one has a right to say more with respect to any question about which two opinions can be held than that his mind is perfectly open to the force of evidence  there is another portion of the bishop of bedfords sermon which i think will be warmly appreciated by all honest and clearheaded men he repudiates the views of those who say that theology and science      occupy wholly different spheres and need in no way intermeddle with     each other they revolve as it were in different planes and so never     meet thus we may pursue scientific studies with the utmost freedom     and at the same time may pay the most reverent regard to theology     having no fears of collision because allowing no points of contact p     29  surely every unsophisticated mind will heartily concur with the bishops remark upon this convenient refuge for the descendants of mr facingbothways i have never been able to understand this position though i have often seen it assumed nor can any demurrer be sustained when the bishop proceeds to point out that there are and must be various points of contact between theological and natural science and therefore that it is foolish to ignore or deny the existence of as many dangers of collision  finally the bishop of manchester freely admits the force of the objections which have been raised on scientific grounds to prayer and attempts to turn them by arguing that the proper objects of prayer are not physical but spiritual he tells us that natural accidents and moral misfortunes are not to be taken 302 for moral judgments of god he admits the propriety of the application of scientific methods to the investigation of the origin and growth of religions and he is as ready to recognise the process of evolution there as in the physical world mark the following striking passage      and how utterly all the common objections to divine revelation vanish     away when they are set in the light of this theory of a spiritual     progression are we reminded that there prevailed in those earlier     days views of the nature of god and man of human life and divine     providence which we now find to be untenable that we answer is     precisely what the theory of development presupposes if early views of     religion and morality had not been imperfect where had been the     development if symbolical visions and mythical creations had found no     place in the early oriental expression of divine truth where had been     the development the sufficient answer to ninetynine out of a hundred     of the ordinary objections to the bible as the record of a divine     education of our race is asked in that one worddevelopment and to     what are we indebted for that potent word which as with the wand of a     magician has at the same moment so completely transformed our     knowledge and dispelled our difficulties to modern science resolutely     pursuing its search for truth in spite of popular obloquy andalas     that one should have to say itin spite too often of theological     denunciation p 53  apart from its general importance i read this remarkable statement with the more pleasure since however imperfectly i may have endeavoured to illustrate the evolution of theology in a paper published in this review last year it seems to me that in principle at any rate i may hereafter claim high theological sanction for the views there set forth 303  if theologians are henceforward prepared to recognise the authority of secular science in the manner and to the extent indicated in the manchester trilogy if the distinguished prelates who offer these terms are really plenipotentiaries then so far as i may presume to speak on such a matter there will be no difficulty about concluding a perpetual treaty of peace and indeed of alliance between the high contracting powers whose history has hitherto been little more than a record of continual warfare but if the great chancellors maxim do ut des is to form the basis of negotiation i am afraid that secular science will be ruined for it seems to me that theology under the generous impulse of a sudden conversion has given all that she hath and indeed on one point has surrendered more than can reasonably be asked  i suppose i must be prepared to face the reproach which attaches to those who criticise a gift if i venture to observe that i do not think that the bishop of manchester need have been so much alarmed as he evidently has been by the objections which have often been raised to prayer on the ground that a belief in the efficacy of prayer is inconsistent with a belief in the constancy of the order of nature  the bishop appears to admit that there is an antagonism between the regular economy of nature and the regular economy of prayer p 39 and that prayers for the interruption of gods natural order are of doubtful validity p 42 it appears to me that the bishops difficulty simply adds another example to those which i have several times insisted 304 upon in the pages of this review and elsewhere of the mischief which has been done and is being done by a mistaken apprehension of the real meaning of natural order and law of nature  may i therefore be permitted to repeat once more that the statements denoted by these terms have no greater value or cogency than such as may attach to generalisations from experience of the past and to expectations for the future based upon that experience nobody can presume to say what the order of nature must be all that the widest experience even if it extended over all past time and through all space that events had happened in a certain way could justify would be a proportionally strong expectation that events will go on so happening and the demand for a proportional strength of evidence in favour of any assertion that they had happened otherwise  it is this weighty consideration the truth of which every one who is capable of logical thought must surely admit which knocks the bottom out of all a priori objections either to ordinary miracles or to the efficacy of prayer in so far as the latter implies the miraculous intervention of a higher power no one is entitled to say a priori that any given socalled miraculous event is impossible and no one is entitled to say a priori that prayer for some change in the ordinary course of nature cannot possibly avail  the supposition that there is any inconsistency between the acceptance of the constancy of natural 305 order and a belief in the efficacy of prayer is the more unaccountable as it is obviously contradicted by analogies furnished by everyday experience the belief in the efficacy of prayer depends upon the assumption that there is somebody somewhere who is strong enough to deal with the earth and its contents as men deal with the things and events which they are strong enough to modify or control and who is capable of being moved by appeals such as men make to one another this belief does not even involve theism for our earth is an insignificant particle of the solar system while the solar system is hardly worth speaking of in relation to the all and for anything that can be proved to the contrary there may be beings endowed with full powers over our system yet practically as insignificant as ourselves in relation to the universe if any one pleases therefore to give unrestrained liberty to his fancy he may plead analogy in favour of the dream that there may be somewhere a finite being or beings who can play with the solar system as a child plays with a toy and that such being may be willing to do anything which he is properly supplicated to do for we are not justified in saying that it is impossible for beings having the nature of men only vastly more powerful to exist and if they do exist they may act as and when we ask them to do so just as our brother men act as a matter of fact the great mass of the human race has believed and still believes in such beings under the various names of fairies gnomes angels and demons certainly i do 306 not lack faith in the constancy of natural order but i am not less convinced that if i were to ask the bishop of manchester to do me a kindness which lay within his power he would do it and i am unable to see that his action on my request involves any violation of the order of nature on the contrary as i have not the honour to know the bishop personally my action would be based upon my faith in that law of nature or generalisation from experience which tells me that as a rule men who occupy the bishops position are kindly and courteous how is the case altered if my request is preferred to some imaginary superior being or to the most high being who by the supposition is able to arrest disease or make the sun stand still in the heavens just as easily as i can stop my watch or make it indicate any hour that pleases me  i repeat that it is not upon any a priori considerations that objections either to the supposed efficacy of prayer in modifying the course of events or to the supposed occurrence of miracles can be scientifically based the real objection and to my mind the fatal objection to both these suppositions is the inadequacy of the evidence to prove any given case of such occurrences which has been adduced it is a canon of common sense to say nothing of science that the more improbable a supposed occurrence the more cogent ought to be the evidence in its favour i have looked somewhat carefully into the subject and i am unable to find in the records of any miraculous event evidence 307 which even approximates to the fulfilment of this requirement  but in the case of prayer the bishop points out a most just and necessary distinction between its effect on the course of nature outside ourselves and its effect within the region of the supplicators mind  it is a law of nature verifiable by everyday experience that our already formed convictions our strong desires our intent occupation with particular ideas modify our mental operations to a most marvellous extent and produce enduring changes in the direction and in the intensity of our intellectual and moral activities men can intoxicate themselves with ideas as effectually as with alcohol or with bang and produce by dint of intense thinking mental conditions hardly distinguishable from monomania demoniac possession is mythical but the faculty of being possessed more or less completely by an idea is probably the fundamental condition of what is called genius whether it show itself in the saint the artist or the man of science one calls it faith another calls it inspiration a third calls it insight but the intending of the mind to borrow newtons wellknown phrase the concentration of all the rays of intellectual energy on some one point until it glows and colours the whole cast of thought with its peculiar light is common to all  i take it that the bishop of manchester has psychological science with him when he insists upon the subjective efficacy of prayer in faith and on the 308 seemingly miraculous effects which such intending of the mind upon religious and moral ideals may have upon character and happiness scientific faith at present takes it no further than the prayer which ajax offered but that petition is continually granted  whatever points of detail may yet remain open for discussion however i repeat the opinion i have already expressed that the manchester sermons concede all that science has an indisputable right or any pressing need to ask and that not grudgingly but generously and if the three bishops of 1887 carry the church with them i think they will have as good title to the permanent gratitude of posterity as the famous seven who went to the tower in defence of the church two hundred years ago  will their brethren follow their just and prudent guidance i have no such acquaintance with the currents of ecclesiastical opinion as would justify me in even hazarding a guess on such a difficult topic but some recent omens are hardly favourable there seems to be an impression abroadi do not desire to give any countenance to itthat i am fond of reading sermons from time to time unknown correspondentssome apparently animated by the charitable desire to promote my conversion and others unmistakably anxious to spur me to the expression of wrathful antagonismfavour me with reports or copies of such productions  i found one of the latter category among the accumulated arrears to which i have already referred  it is a full and apparently accurate report of a 309 discourse by a person of no less ecclesiastical rank than the three authors of the sermons i have hitherto been considering but who he is and where or when the sermon was preached are secrets which wild horses shall not tear from me lest i fall again under high censure for attacking a clergyman only if the editor of this review thinks it his duty to have independent evidence that the sermon has a real existence will i in the strictest confidence communicate it to him  the preacher in this case is of a very different mind from the three bishopsand this mind is different in quality different in spirit and different in contents he discourses on the a priori objections to miracles apparently without being aware in spite of all the discussions of the last seven or eight years that he is doing battle with a shadow  i trust i do not misrepresent the bishop of manchester in saying that the essence of his remarkable discourse is the insistence upon the supreme importance of the purely spiritual in our faith and of the relative if not absolute insignificance of aught else he obviously perceives the bearing of his arguments against the alterability of the course of outward nature by prayer on the question of miracles in general for he is careful to say that the possibility of miracles of a rare and unusual transcendence of the world order is not here in question p 38 it may be permitted me to suppose however that if miracles were in question the speaker who warns us that we must look for the heart of the absolute 310 religion in that part of it which prescribes our moral and religious relations p 46 would not be disposed to advise those who had found the heart of christianity to take much thought about its miraculous integument  my anonymous sermon will have nothing to do with such notions as these and its preacher is not too polite to say nothing of charitable towards those who entertain them      scientific men therefore are perfectly right in asserting that     christianity rests on miracles if miracles never happened     christianity in any sense which is not a mockery which does not make     the term of none effect has no reality i dwell on this because there     is now an effort making to get up a nonmiraculous invertebrate     christianity which may escape the ban of science and i would warn you     very distinctly against this new contrivance christianity is     essentially miraculous and falls to the ground if miracles be     impossible  well warning for warning i venture to warn this preacher and those who with him persist in identifying christianity with the miraculous that such forms of christianity are not only doomed to fall to the ground but that within the last half century they have been driving that way with continually accelerated velocity  the socalled religious world is given to a strange delusion it fondly imagines that it possesses the monopoly of serious and constant reflection upon the terrible problems of existence and that those who cannot accept its shibboleths are either mere gallios caring for none of these things or libertines desiring to escape from the restraints of morality it does not 311 appear to have entered the imaginations of these people that outside their pale and firmly resolved never to enter it there are thousands of men certainly not their inferiors in character capacity or knowledge of the questions at issue who estimate those purely spiritual elements of the christian faith of which the bishop of manchester speaks as highly as the bishop does but who will have nothing to do with the christian churches because in their apprehension and for them the profession of belief in the miraculous on the evidence offered would be simply immoral  so far as my experience goes men of science are neither better nor worse than the rest of the world occupation with the endlessly great parts of the universe does not necessarily involve greatness of character nor does microscopic study of the infinitely little always produce humility we have our full share of original sin need greed and vainglory beset us as they do other mortals and our progress is for the most part like that of a tacking ship the resultant of opposite divergencies from the straight path but for all that there is one moral benefit which the pursuit of science unquestionably bestows it keeps the estimate of the value of evidence up to the proper mark and we are constantly receiving lessons and sometimes very sharp ones on the nature of proof men of science will always act up to their standard of veracity when mankind in general leave off sinning but that standard appears to me to be higher among them than in any other class of the community 312  i do not know any body of scientific men who could be got to listen without the strongest expressions of disgusted repudiation to the exposition of a pretended scientific discovery which had no better evidence to show for itself than the story of the devils entering a herd of swine or of the figtree that was blasted for bearing no figs when it was not the season of figs whether such events are possible or impossible no man can say but scientific ethics can and does declare that the profession of belief in them on the evidence of documents of unknown date and of unknown authorship is immoral theological apologists who insist that morality will vanish if their dogmas are exploded would do well to consider the fact that in the matter of intellectual veracity science is already a long way ahead of the churches and that in this particular it is exerting an educational influence on mankind of which the churches have shown themselves utterly incapable  undoubtedly that varying compound of some of the best and some of the worst elements of paganism and judaism moulded in practice by the innate character of certain people of the western world which since the second century has assumed to itself the title of orthodox christianity rests on miracles and falls to the ground not if miracles be impossible but if those to whom it is committed prove themselves unable to fulfil the conditions of honest belief that this christianity is doomed to fall is to my mind beyond a doubt but its fall will be neither sudden nor speedy the church with all the aid 313 lent it by the secular arm took many centuries to extirpate the open practice of pagan idolatry within its own fold and those who have travelled in southern europe will be aware that it has not extirpated the essence of such idolatry even yet mutato nomine it is probable that there is as much sheer fetichism among the roman populace now as there was eighteen hundred years ago and if marcus antoninus could descend from his horse and ascend the steps of the ara coeli church about twelfth day the only thing that need strike him would be the extremely contemptible character of the modern idols as works of art  science will certainly neither ask for nor receive the aid of the secular arm it will trust to the much better and more powerful help of that education in scientific truth and in the morals of assent which is rendered as indispensable as it is inevitable by the permeation of practical life with the products and ideas of science but no one who considers the present state of even the most developed countries can doubt that the scientific light that has come into the world will for a long time have to shine in the midst of darkness the urban populations driven into contact with science by trade and manufacture will more and more receive it while the pagani will lag behind let us hope that no julian may arise among them to head a forlorn hope against the inevitable whatever happens science may bide her time in patience and in confidence  but to return to my anonymous i am afraid 314 that if he represents any great party in the church the spirit of justice and reasonableness which animates the three bishops has as slender a chance of being imitated on a large scale as their common sense and their courtesy for not contented with misrepresenting science on its speculative side anonymous attacks its morality      for two whole years investigations and conclusions which would upset     the theories of darwin on the formation of coral islands were actually     suppressed and that by the advice even of those who accepted them     for fear of upsetting the faith and disturbing the judgment formed by     the multitude on the scientific characterthe infallibilityof the     great master  so far as i know anything about the matters which are here referred to the part of this passage which i have italicised is absolutely untrue i believe that i am intimately acquainted with all mr darwins immediate scientific friends and i say that no one of them nor any other man of science known to me ever could or would have given such advice to any oneif for no other reason than that with the example of the most candid and patient listener to objections that ever lived fresh in their memories they could not so grossly have at once violated their highest duty and dishonoured their friend  the charge thus brought by anonymous affects the honour and the probity of men of science if it is true we have forfeited all claim to the confidence of the general public in my belief it is utterly false and its real effect will be to discredit those who are responsible for it as is the way with slanders it 315 has grown by repetition anonymous is responsible for the peculiarly offensive form which it has taken in his hands but he is not responsible for originating it he has evidently been inspired by an article entitled a great lesson published in the september number of this review truly it is a great lesson but not quite in the sense intended by the giver thereof  in the course of his doubtless wellmeant admonitions the duke of argyll commits himself to a greater number of statements which are demonstrably incorrect and which any one who ventured to write upon the subject ought to have known to be incorrect than i have ever seen gathered together in so small a space  i submit a gathering from the rich store for the appreciation of the public  first      mr murrays new explanation of the structure of coralreefs and     islands was communicated to the royal society of edinburgh in 1880 and     supported with such a weight of facts and such a close texture of     reasoning that no serious reply has ever been attempted p 305  no serious reply has ever been attempted i suppose that the duke of argyll may have heard of professor dana whose years of labour devoted to corals and coralreefs when he was naturalist of the american expedition under commodore wilkes more than forty years ago have ever since caused him to be recognised as an authority of the first rank on such subjects now does his grace know or does he not 316 know that in the year 1885 professor dana published an elaborate paper on the origin of coralreefs and islands in which after referring to a presidential address by the director of the geological survey of great britain and ireland delivered in 1883 in which special attention is directed to mr murrays views professor dana says      the existing state of doubt on the question has led the writer to     reconsider the earlier and later facts and in the following pages he     gives his results  professor dana then devotes many pages of his very serious reply to a most admirable and weighty criticism of the objections which have at various times been raised to mr darwins doctrine by professor semper by dr rein and finally by mr murray and he states his final judgment as follows      with the theory of abrasion and solution incompetent all the     hypotheses of objectors to darwins theory are alike weak for all have     made these processes their chief reliance whether appealing to a     calcareous or a volcanic or a mountainpeak basement for the     structure the subsidence which the darwinian theory requires has not     been opposed by the mention of any fact at variance with it nor by     setting aside darwins arguments in its favour and it has found new     support in the facts from the challengers soundings off tahiti that     had been put in array against it and strong corroboration in the facts     from the west indies      darwins theory therefore remains as the theory that accounts for the     origin of reefs and islands77  be it understood that i express no opinion on the controverted points i doubt if there are ten living men who having a practical knowledge of what a 317 coralreef is have endeavoured to master the very difficult biological and geological problems involved in their study i happen to have spent the best part of three years among coralreefs and to have made that attempt and when mr murrays work appeared i said to myself that until i had two or three months to give to the renewed study of the subject in all its bearings i must be content to remain in a condition of suspended judgment in the meanwhile the man who would be voted by common acclamation as the most competent person now living to act as umpire has delivered the verdict i have quoted and to go no further has fully justified the hesitation i and others may have felt about expressing an opinion under these circumstances it seems to me to require a good deal of courage to say no serious reply has ever been attempted and to chide the men of science in lofty tones for their reluctance to admit an error which is not admitted and for their slow and sulky acquiescence in a conclusion which they have the gravest warranty for suspecting  second      darwin himself had lived to hear of the new solution and with that     splendid candour which was eminent in him his mind though now grown     old in his own early convictions was at least ready to entertain it     and to confess that serious doubts had been awakened as to the truth of     his famous theory p 305  i wish that darwins splendid candour could be conveyed by some description of spiritual microbe to those who write about him i am not aware that mr darwin ever entertained serious doubts as to 318 the truth of his famous theory and there is tolerably good evidence to the contrary the second edition of his work published in 1876 proves that he entertained no such doubts then a letter to professor semper whose objections in some respects forestalled those of mr murray dated october 2 1879 expresses his continued adherence to the opinion that the atolls and barrier reefs in the middle of the pacific and indian oceans indicate subsidence and the letter of my friend professor judd printed at the end of this article which i had perhaps better say professor judd had not seen will prove that this opinion remained unaltered to the end of his life  third       darwins theory is a dream it is not only unsound but it is in     many respects the reverse of truth with all his conscientiousness     with all his caution with all his powers of observation darwin in     this matter fell into errors as profound as the abysses of the pacific     p 301  really it seems to me that under the circumstances it is pretty clear that these lines exhibit a lack of the qualities justly ascribed to mr darwin which plunges their author into a much deeper abyss and one from which there is no hope of emergence  fourth      all the acclamations with which it was received were as the shouts of     an ignorant mob p 301  but surely it should be added that the coryphæus of this ignorant mob the fugleman of the shouts was one of the most accomplished naturalists and geologists now livingthe american danawho after years of 319 independent study extending over numerous reefs in the pacific gave his hearty assent to darwins views and after all that had been said deliberately reaffirmed that assent in the year 1885  fifth      the overthrow of darwins speculation is only beginning to be known it     has been whispered for some time the cherished dogma has been dropping     very slowly out of sight p 301  darwins speculation may be right or wrong but i submit that that which has not happened cannot even begin to be known except by those who have miraculous gifts to which we poor scientific people do not aspire the overthrow of darwins views may have been whispered by those who hoped for it and they were perhaps wise in not raising their voices above a whisper incorrect statements if made too loudly are apt to bring about unpleasant consequences  sixth mr murrays views published in 1880 are said to have met with slow and sulky acquiescence p 305 i have proved that they cannot be said to have met with general acquiescence of any sort whether quick and cheerful or slow and sulky and if this assertion is meant to convey the impression that mr murrays views have been ignored that there has been a conspiracy of silence against them it is utterly contrary to notorious fact  professor geikies wellknown textbook of geology was published in 1882 and at pages 457459 of that work there is a careful exposition of mr murrays views moreover professor geikie has specially 320 advocated them on other occasions78 notably in a long article on the origin of coralreefs published in two numbers of nature for 1883 and in a presidential address delivered in the same year if in so short a time after the publication of his views mr murray could boast of a convert so distinguished and influential as the director of the geological survey it seems to me that this wonderful conspiration de silence which has about as much real existence as the duke of argylls other bogie the reign of terror must have ipso facto collapsed i wish that when i was a young man my endeavours to upset some prevalent errors had met with as speedy and effectual backing  seventh       mr john murray was strongly advised against the publication of his     views in derogation of darwins longaccepted theory of the coral     islands and was actually induced to delay it for two years yet the     late sir wyville thomson who was at the head of the naturalists of the     challenger expedition was himself convinced by mr murrays     reasoning p 307  clearly then it could not be mr murrays official chief who gave him this advice who was it and what was the exact nature of the advice given until we have some precise information on this head i shall take leave to doubt whether this statement is more accurate than those which i have previously cited  whether such advice was wise or foolish just or 321 immoral depends entirely on the motive of the person who gave it if he meant to suggest to mr murray that it might be wise for a young and comparatively unknown man to walk warily when he proposed to attack a generalisation based on many years labour of one undoubtedly competent person and fortified by the independent results of the many years labour of another undoubtedly competent person and even if necessary to take two whole years in fortifying his position i think that such advice would have been sagacious and kind i suppose that there are few working men of science who have not kept their ideas to themselves while gathering and sifting evidence for a much longer period than two years  if on the other hand mr murray was advised to delay the publication of his criticisms simply to save mr darwins credit and to preserve some reputation for infallibility which no one ever heard of then i have no hesitation in declaring that his adviser was profoundly dishonest as well as extremely foolish and that if he is a man of science he has disgraced his calling  but after all this supposed scientific achitophel has not yet made good the primary fact of his existence until the needful proof is forthcoming i think i am justified in suspending my judgment as to whether he is much more than an antiscientific myth i leave it to the duke of argyll to judge of the extent of the obligation under which for his own sake he may lie to produce the evidence on which 322 his aspersions of the honour of scientific men are based i cannot pretend that we are seriously disturbed by charges which every one who is acquainted with the truth of the matter knows to be ridiculous but mud has a habit of staining if it lies too long and it is as well to have it brushed off as soon as may be  so much for the great lesson it is followed by a little lesson apparently directed against my infallibilitya doctrine about which i should be inclined to paraphrase wilkess remark to george the third when he declared that he at any rate was not a wilkite but i really should be glad to think that there are people who need the warning because then it will be obvious that this raking up of an old story cannot have been suggested by a mere fanatical desire to damage men of science i can but rejoice then that these misguided enthusiasts whose faith in me has so far exceeded the bounds of reason should be set right but that want of finish in the matter of accuracy which so terribly mars the effect of the great lesson is no less conspicuous in the case of the little lesson and instead of setting my too fervent disciples right it will set them wrong  the duke of argyll in telling the story of bathybius says that my mind was caught by this new and grand generalisation of the physical basis of life i never have been guilty of a reclamation about anything to my credit and i do not mean to be but if there is any blame going i do not choose to be relegated to a subordinate place when i have a claim to 323 the first the responsibility for the first description and the naming of bathybius is mine and mine only the paper on some organisms living at great depths in the atlantic ocean in which i drew attention to this substance is to be found by the curious in the 8th volume of the quarterly journal of microscopical science and was published in the year 1868 whatever errors are contained in that paper are my own peculiar property but neither at the meeting of the british association in 1868 nor anywhere else have i gone beyond what is there stated except in so far that at a longsubsequent meeting of the association being importuned about the subject i ventured to express somewhat emphatically the wish that the thing was at the bottom of the sea  what is meant by my being caught by a generalisation about the physical basis of life i do not know still less can i understand the assertion that bathybius was accepted because of its supposed harmony with darwins speculations that which interested me in the matter was the apparent analogy of bathybius with other wellknown forms of lower life such as the plasmodia of the myxomycetes and the rhizopods speculative hopes or fears had nothing to do with the matter and if bathybius were brought up alive from the bottom of the atlantic tomorrow the fact would not have the slightest bearing that i can discern upon mr darwins speculations or upon any of the disputed problems of biology it would merely be one elementary organism the more added to the thousands already known 324  up to this moment i was not aware of the universal favour with which bathybius was received79 those simulators of an ignorant mob who according to the duke of argyll welcomed darwins theory of coralreefs made no demonstration in my favour unless his grace includes sir wyville thomson dr carpenter dr bessels and professor haeckel under that head on the contrary a sagacious friend of mine than whom there was no more competent judge the late mr george busk was not to be converted while long before the challenger work ehrenberg wrote to me very sceptically and i fully expected that that eminent man would favour me with pretty sharp criticism unfortunately he died shortly afterwards and nothing from him that i know of appeared when sir wyville thomson wrote to me a brief account of the results obtained on board the challenger i sent his statement to nature in which journal it appeared the following week without any further note or comment than was needful to explain the circumstances in thus allowing judgment to go by default i am afraid i showed a reckless and ungracious disregard for the feelings of the believers in my infallibility no doubt i ought to have hedged and fenced and attenuated the effect of sir wyville thomsons brief note in every possible way or 325 perhaps i ought to have suppressed the note altogether on the ground that it was a mere ex parte statement my excuse is that notwithstanding a large and abiding faith in human folly i did not know then any more than i know now that there was anybody foolish enough to be unaware that the only people scientific or other who never make mistakes are those who do nothing or that anybody for whose opinion i cared would not rather see me commit ten blunders than try to hide one  pending the production of further evidence i hold that the existence of people who believe in the infallibility of men of science is as purely mythical as that of the evil counsellor who advised the withholding of the truth lest it should conflict with that belief  i venture to think then that the duke of argyll might have spared his little lesson as well as his great lesson with advantage the paternal authority who whips the child for sins he has not committed does not strengthen his moral influencerather excites contempt and repugnance and if as would seem from this and former monitory allocutions which have been addressed to us the duke aspires to the position of censor or spiritual director in relation to the men who are doing the work of physical science he really must get up his facts better there will be an end to all chance of our kissing the rod if his grace goes wrong a third time he must not say again that no serious reply has been attempted to a view which was discussed and 326 repudiated two years before by one of the highest extant authorities on the subject he must not say that darwin accepted that which it can be proved he did not accept he must not say that a doctrine has dropped into the abyss when it is quite obviously alive and kicking at the surface he must not assimilate a man like professor dana to the components of an ignorant mob he must not say that things are beginning to be known which are not known at all he must not say that slow and sulky acquiescence has been given to that which cannot yet boast of general acquiescence of any kind he must not suggest that a view which has been publicly advocated by the director of the geological survey and no less publicly discussed by many other authoritative writers has been intentionally and systematically ignored he must not ascribe ill motives for a course of action which is the only proper one and finally if any one but myself were interested i should say that he had better not waste his time in raking up the errors of those whose lives have been occupied not in talking about science but in toiling sometimes with success and sometimes with failure to get some real work done  the most considerable difference i note among men is not in their readiness to fall into error but in their readiness to acknowledge these inevitable lapses the duke of argyll has now a splendid opportunity for proving to the world in which of these categories it is hereafter to rank him                                       327  dear professor huxleya short time before mr darwins death i had a conversation with him concerning the observations which had been made by mr murray upon coralreefs and the speculations which had been founded upon those observations i found that mr darwin had very carefully considered the whole subject and that while on the one hand he did not regard the actual facts recorded by mr murray as absolutely inconsistent with his own theory of subsidence on the other hand he did not believe that they necessitated or supported the hypothesis advanced by mr murray mr darwins attitude as i understood it towards mr murrays objections to the theory of subsidence was exactly similar to that maintained by him with respect to professor sempers criticism which was of a very similar character and his position with regard to the whole question was almost identical with that subsequently so clearly defined by professor dana in his wellknown articles published in the american journal of science for 1885  it is difficult to imagine how any one acquainted with the scientific literature of the last seven years could possibly suggest that mr murrays memoir published in 1880 had failed to secure a due amount of attention mr murray by his position in the challenger office occupied an exceptionally favourable position for making his views widely known and he had moreover the singular good fortune to secure from the first the advocacy of so able and brilliant a writer as professor archibald geikie who 328 in a special discourse and in several treatises on geology and physical geology very strongly supported the new theory it would be an endless task to attempt to give references to the various scientific journals which have discussed the subject but i may add that every treatise on geology which has been published since mr murrays views were made known has dealt with his observations at considerable length this is true of professor a h greens physical geology published in 1882 of professor prestwichs geology chemical and physical and of professor james geikies outlines of geology published in 1886 similar prominence is given to the subject in de lapparents traité de géologie published in 1885 and in credners elemente der geologie which has appeared during the present year if this be a conspiracy of silence where alas can the geological speculator seek for fameyours very truly    john w judd   october 10 1887                                        329  ix  agnosticism  within the last few months the public has received much and varied information on the subject of agnostics their tenets and even their future agnosticism exercised the orators of the church congress at manchester80 it has been furnished with a set of articles fewer but not less rigid and certainly not less consistent than the thirtynine its nature has been analysed and its future severely predicted by the most eloquent of that prophetical school whose samuel is auguste comte it may still be a question however whether the public is as much the wiser as might be expected considering all the trouble that has been taken to enlighten it not only are the three accounts of the agnostic position sadly out of harmony with one another but i propose to show cause for my belief that all three must be seriously questioned by any one who employs the term agnostic in the sense in which it was originally used the learned principal of kings college who brought 330 the topic of agnosticism before the church congress took a short and easy way of settling the business      but if this be so for a man to urge as an escape from this article of     belief that he has no means of a scientific knowledge of the unseen     world or of the future is irrelevant his difference from christians     lies not in the fact that he has no knowledge of these things but that     he does not believe the authority on which they are stated he may     prefer to call himself an agnostic but his real name is an older     onehe is an infidel that is to say an unbeliever the word infidel     perhaps carries an unpleasant significance perhaps it is right that     it should it is and it ought to be an unpleasant thing for a man to     have to say plainly that he does not believe in jesus christ81  so much of dr waces address either explicitly or implicitly concerns me that i take upon myself to deal with it but in so doing it must be understood that i speak for myself alone i am not aware that there is any sect of agnostics and if there be i am not its acknowledged prophet or pope i desire to leave to the comtists the entire monopoly of the manufacture of imitation ecclesiasticism  let us calmly and dispassionately consider dr waces appreciation of agnosticism the agnostic according to his view is a person who says he has no means of attaining a scientific knowledge of the unseen world or of the future by which somewhat loose 331 phraseology dr wace presumably means the theological unseen world and future i cannot think this description happy either in form or substance but for the present it may pass dr wace continues that is not his difference from christians are there then any christians who say that they know nothing about the unseen world and the future i was ignorant of the fact but i am ready to accept it on the authority of a professional theologian and i proceed to dr waces next proposition  the real state of the case then is that the agnostic does not believe the authority on which these things are stated which authority is jesus christ he is simply an oldfashioned infidel who is afraid to own to his right name as presbyter is priest writ large so is agnostic the mere greek equivalent for the latin infidel there is an attractive simplicity about this solution of the problem and it has that advantage of being somewhat offensive to the persons attacked which is so dear to the less refined sort of controversialist the agnostic says i cannot find good evidence that so and so is true ah says his adversary seizing his opportunity then you declare that jesus christ was untruthful for he said so and so a very telling method of rousing prejudice but suppose that the value of the evidence as to what jesus may have said and done and as to the exact nature and scope of his authority is just that which the agnostic finds it most difficult to determine if i venture to doubt that the duke of wellington gave the command up guards 332 and at em at waterloo i do not think that even dr wace would accuse me of disbelieving the duke yet it would be just as reasonable to do this as to accuse any one of denying what jesus said before the preliminary question as to what he did say is settled  now the question as to what jesus really said and did is strictly a scientific problem which is capable of solution by no other methods than those practised by the historian and the literary critic it is a problem of immense difficulty which has occupied some of the best heads in europe for the last century and it is only of late years that their investigations have begun to converge towards one conclusion82  that kind of faith which dr wace describes and lauds is of no use here indeed he himself takes pains to destroy its evidential value  what made the mahommedan world trust and faith in the declarations and assurances of mahommed and what made the christian world trust and 333 faith in the declarations and assurances of jesus christ and his apostles l c p 253 the triumphant tone of this imaginary catechism leads me to suspect that its author has hardly appreciated its full import presumably dr wace regards mahommed as an unbeliever or to use the term which he prefers infidel and considers that his assurances have given rise to a vast delusion which has led and is leading millions of men straight to everlasting punishment and this being so the trust and faith which have made the mahommedan world in just the same sense as they have made the christian world must be trust and faith in falsehood no man who has studied history or even attended to the occurrences of everyday life can doubt the enormous practical value of trust and faith but as little will he be inclined to deny that this practical value has not the least relation to the reality of the objects of that trust and faith in examples of patient constancy of faith and of unswerving trust the acta martyrum do not excel the annals of babism83    the discussion upon which we have now entered goes so thoroughly to the root of the whole matter the question of the day is so completely as the author of robert elsmere says the value of testimony that i shall offer no apology for following it out somewhat in detail and by way of giving substance to the 334 argument i shall base what i have to say upon a case the consideration of which lies strictly within the province of natural science and of that particular part of it known as the physiology and pathology of the nervous system  i find in the second gospel chap v a statement to all appearance intended to have the same evidential value as any other contained in that history it is the wellknown story of the devils who were cast out of a man and ordered or permitted to enter into a herd of swine to the great loss and damage of the innocent gerasene or gadarene pig owners there can be no doubt that the narrator intends to convey to his readers his own conviction that this casting out and entering in were effected by the agency of jesus of nazareth that by speech and action jesus enforced this conviction nor does any inkling of the legal and moral difficulties of the case manifest itself  on the other hand everything that i know of physiological and pathological science leads me to entertain a very strong conviction that the phenomena ascribed to possession are as purely natural as those which constitute smallpox everything that i know of anthropology leads me to think that the belief in demons and demoniacal possession is a mere survival of a once universal superstition and that its persistence at the present time is pretty much in the inverse ratio of the general instruction intelligence and sound judgment of the population among whom it prevails everything that i know of law and 335 justice convinces me that the wanton destruction of other peoples property is a misdemeanour of evil example again the study of history and especially of that of the fifteenth sixteenth and seventeenth centuries leaves no shadow of doubt on my mind that the belief in the reality of possession and of witchcraft justly based alike by catholics and protestants upon this and innumerable other passages in both the old and new testaments gave rise through the special influence of christian ecclesiastics to the most horrible persecutions and judicial murders of thousands upon thousands of innocent men women and children and when i reflect that the record of a plain and simple declaration upon such an occasion as this that the belief in witchcraft and possession is wicked nonsense would have rendered the long agony of mediæval humanity impossible i am prompted to reject as dishonouring the supposition that such declaration was withheld out of condescension to popular error  come forth thou unclean spirit out of the man mark v 884 are the words attributed to jesus if i declare as i have no hesitation in doing that i utterly disbelieve in the existence of unclean spirits and consequently in the possibility of their coming forth out of a man i suppose that dr wace will tell me i am disregarding the testimony of our lord l c p 255 for if these words were really used the most resourceful of reconcilers can hardly venture to affirm that they are compatible with a disbelief in these things as the learned and 336 fairminded as well as orthodox dr alexander remarks in an editorial note to the article demoniacs in the biblical cyclopædia vol i p 664 note       on the lowest grounds on which our lord and his apostles can be     placed they must at least be regarded as honest men now though     honest speech does not require that words should be used always and     only in their etymological sense it does require that they should not     be used so as to affirm what the speaker knows to be false whilst     therefore our lord and his apostles might use the word greek     daimonizesthai or the phrase greek daimonion echein as a popular     description of certain diseases without giving in to the belief which     lay at the source of such a mode of expression they could not speak of     demons entering into a man or being cast out of him without pledging     themselves to the belief of an actual possession of the man by the     demons campbell prel diss vi 1 10 if consequently they did     not hold this belief they spoke not as honest men  the story which we are considering does not rest on the authority of the second gospel alone the third confirms the second especially in the matter of commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man luke viii 29 and although the first gospel either gives a different version of the same story or tells another of like kind the essential point remains if thou cast us out send us away into the herd of swine and he said unto them go matt viii 31 32  if the concurrent testimony of the three synoptics then is really sufficient to do away with all rational doubt as to a matter of fact of the utmost practical and speculative importancebelief or disbelief in which may affect and has affected mens lives and their conduct towards other men in the most serious 337 waythen i am bound to believe that jesus implicitly affirmed himself to possess a knowledge of the unseen world which afforded full confirmation of the belief in demons and possession current among his contemporaries if the story is true the mediæval theory of the invisible world may be and probably is quite correct and the witchfinders from sprenger to hopkins and mather are muchmaligned men  on the other hand humanity noting the frightful consequences of this belief common sense observing the futility of the evidence on which it is based in all cases that have been properly investigated science more and more seeing its way to enclose all the phenomena of socalled possession within the domain of pathology so far as they are not to be relegated to that of the policeall these powerful influences concur in warning us at our peril against accepting the belief without the most careful scrutiny of the authority on which it rests  i can discern no escape from this dilemma either jesus said what he is reported to have said or he did not in the former case it is inevitable that his authority on matters connected with the unseen world should be roughly shaken in the latter the blow falls upon the authority of the synoptic gospels if their report on a matter of such stupendous and farreaching practical import as this is untrustworthy how can we be sure of its trustworthiness in other cases the favourite earth in which the hardpressed reconciler takes refuge that the bible does 338 not profess to teach science85 is stopped in this instance for the question of the existence of demons and of possession by them though it lies strictly within the province of science is also of the deepest moral and religious significance if physical and mental disorders are caused by demons gregory of tours and his contemporaries rightly considered that relics and exorcists were more useful than doctors the gravest questions arise as to the legal and moral responsibilities of persons inspired by demoniacal impulses and our whole conception of the universe and of our relations to it becomes totally different from what it would be on the contrary hypothesis  the theory of life of an average mediæval christian was as different from that of an average nineteenthcentury englishman as that of a west african negro is now in these respects the modern world is slowly but surely shaking off these and other monstrous survivals of savage delusions and whatever happens 339 it will not return to that wallowing in the mire until the contrary is proved i venture to doubt whether at this present moment any protestant theologian who has a reputation to lose will say that he believes the gadarene story  the choice then lies between discrediting those who compiled the gospel biographies and disbelieving the master whom they simple souls thought to honour by preserving such traditions of the exercise of his authority over satans invisible world this is the dilemma no deep scholarship nothing but a knowledge of the revised version on which it is to be supposed all that mere scholarship can do has been done with the application thereto of the commonest canons of common sense is needful to enable us to make a choice between its alternatives it is hardly doubtful that the story as told in the first gospel is merely a version of that told in the second and third nevertheless the discrepancies are serious and irreconcilable and on this ground alone a suspension of judgment at the least is called for but there is a great deal more to be said from the dawn of scientific biblical criticism until the present day the evidence against the longcherished notion that the three synoptic gospels are the works of three independent authors each prompted by divine inspiration has steadily accumulated until at the present time there is no visible escape from the conclusion that each of the three is a compilation consisting of a groundwork common to all threethe threefold tradition and of a superstructure consisting firstly 340 of matter common to it with one of the others and secondly of matter special to each the use of the terms groundwork and superstructure by no means implies that the latter must be of later date than the former on the contrary some parts of it may be and probably are older than some parts of the groundwork86  the story of the gadarene swine belongs to the groundwork at least the essential part of it in which the belief in demoniac possession is expressed does and therefore the compilers of the first second and third gospels whoever they were certainly accepted that belief which indeed was universal among both jews and pagans at that time and attributed it to jesus  what then do we know about the originator or originators of this groundworkof that threefold tradition which all three witnesses in paleys phrase agree uponthat we should allow their mere statements to outweigh the counter arguments of humanity of common sense of exact science and to imperil the respect which all would be glad to be able to render to their master  absolutely nothing87 there is no proof nothing 341 more than a fair presumption that any one of the gospels existed in the state in which we find it in the authorised version of the bible before the second century or in other words sixty or seventy years after the events recorded and between that time and the date of the oldest extant manuscripts of the gospels there is no telling what additions and alterations and interpolations may have been made it may be said that this is all mere speculation but it is a good deal more as competent scholars and honest men our revisers have felt compelled to point out that such things have happened even since the date of the oldest known manuscripts the oldest two copies of the second gospel end with the 8th verse of the 16th chapter the remaining twelve verses are spurious and it is noteworthy that the maker of the addition has not hesitated to introduce a speech in which jesus promises his disciples that in my name shall they cast out devils  the other passage rejected to the margin is still more instructive it is that touching apologue with its profound ethical sense of the woman taken in adulterywhich if internal evidence were an infallible guide might well be affirmed to be a typical example of the teachings of jesus yet say the revisers pitilessly most of the ancient authorities omit john vii 53viii 11 now let any reasonable man ask himself this question if after an approximate settlement of the canon of the new testament and even later than the fourth and fifth centuries literary fabricators had the skill and the audacity to 342 make such additions and interpolations as these what may they have done when no one had thought of a canon when oral tradition still unfixed was regarded as more valuable than such written records as may have existed in the latter portion of the first century or to take the other alternative if those who gradually settled the canon did not know of the existence of the oldest codices which have come down to us or if knowing them they rejected their authority what is to be thought of their competency as critics of the text  people who object to free criticism of the christian scriptures forget that they are what they are in virtue of very free criticism unless the advocates of inspiration are prepared to affirm that the majority of influential ecclesiastics during several centuries were safeguarded against error for even granting that some books of the period were inspired they were certainly few amongst many and those who selected the canonical books unless they themselves were also inspired must be regarded in the light of mere critics and from the evidence they have left of their intellectual habits very uncritical critics when one thinks that such delicate questions as those involved fell into the hands of men like papias who believed in the famous millenarian grape story of irenæus with his reasons for the existence of only four gospels and of such calm and dispassionate judges as tertullian with his credo quia impossibile the marvel is that the selection which constitutes our new testament is as free as it is from obviously objectionable 343 matter the apocryphal gospels certainly deserve to be apocryphal but one may suspect that a little more critical discrimination would have enlarged the apocrypha not inconsiderably  at this point a very obvious objection arises and deserves full and candid consideration it may be said that critical scepticism carried to the length suggested is historical pyrrhonism that if we are to altogether discredit an ancient or a modern historian because he has assumed fabulous matter to be true it will be as well to give up paying any attention to history it may be said and with great justice that eginhards life of charlemagne is none the less trustworthy because of the astounding revelation of credulity of lack of judgment and even of respect for the eighth commandment which he has unconsciously made in the history of the translation of the blessed martyrs marcellinus and paul or to go no further back than the last number of this review surely that excellent lady miss strickland is not to be refused all credence because of the myth about the second jamess remains which she seems to have unconsciously invented  of course this is perfectly true i am afraid there is no man alive whose witness could be accepted if the condition precedent were proof that he had never invented and promulgated a myth in the minds of all of us there are little places here and there like the indistinguishable spots on a rock which give foothold to moss or stonecrop on which if the germ of a myth fall it is certain to grow without in the least 344 degree affecting our accuracy or truthfulness elsewhere sir walter scott knew that he could not repeat a story without as he said giving it a new hat and stick most of us differ from sir walter only in not knowing about this tendency of the mythopoeic faculty to break out unnoticed but it is also perfectly true that the mythopoeic faculty is not equally active in all minds nor in all regions and under all conditions of the same mind david hume was certainly not so liable to temptation as the venerable bede or even as some recent historians who could be mentioned and the most imaginative of debtors if he owes five pounds never makes an obligation to pay a hundred out of it the rule of common sense is primâ facie to trust a witness in all matters in which neither his selfinterest his passions his prejudices nor that love of the marvellous which is inherent to a greater or less degree in all mankind are strongly concerned and when they are involved to require corroborative evidence in exact proportion to the contravention of probability by the thing testified  now in the gadarene affair i do not think i am unreasonably sceptical if i say that the existence of demons who can be transferred from a man to a pig does thus contravene probability let me be perfectly candid i admit i have no à priori objection to offer there are physical things such as tæniæ and trichinæ which can be transferred from men to pigs and vice versâ and which do undoubtedly produce most diabolical and deadly effects on both for 345 anything i can absolutely prove to the contrary there may be spiritual things capable of the same transmigration with like effects moreover i am bound to add that perfectly truthful persons for whom i have the greatest respect believe in stories about spirits of the present day quite as improbable as that we are considering  so i declare as plainly as i can that i am unable to show cause why these transferable devils should not exist nor can i deny that not merely the whole roman church but many wacean infidels of no mean repute do honestly and firmly believe that the activity of such like demonic beings is in full swing in this year of grace 1889  nevertheless as good bishop butler says probability is the guide of life and it seems to me that this is just one of the cases in which the canon of credibility and testimony which i have ventured to lay down has full force so that with the most entire respect for many by no means for all of our witnesses for the truth of demonology ancient and modern i conceive their evidence on this particular matter to be ridiculously insufficient to warrant their conclusion88  346  after what has been said i do not think that any sensible man unless he happen to be angry will accuse me of contradicting the lord and his apostles if i reiterate my total disbelief in the whole gadarene story but if that story is discredited all the other stories of demoniac possession fall under suspicion and if the belief in demons and demoniac possession which forms the sombre background of the whole picture of primitive christianity presented to us in the new testament is shaken what is to be said in any case of the uncorroborated testimony of the gospels with respect to the unseen world  i am not aware that i have been influenced by any more bias in regard to the gadarene story than i have been in dealing with other cases of like kind the investigation of which has interested me i was brought up in the strictest school of evangelical orthodoxy and when i was old enough to think for myself i started upon my journey of inquiry with little doubt about the general truth of what i had been taught and with that feeling of the unpleasantness of being called an infidel which we are told is so right and proper near my journeys end i find myself in a condition of something more than mere doubt about these matters  347  in the course of other inquiries i have had to do with fossil remains which looked quite plain at a distance and became more and more indistinct as i tried to define their outline by close inspection there was something theresomething which if i could win assurance about it might mark a new epoch in the history of the earth but study as long as i might certainty eluded my grasp so has it been with me in my efforts to define the grand figure of jesus as it lies in the primary strata of christian literature is he the kindly peaceful christ depicted in the catacombs or is he the stern judge who frowns above the altar of ss cosmas and damianus or can he be rightly represented by the bleeding ascetic broken down by physical pain of too many mediæval pictures are we to accept the jesus of the second or the jesus of the fourth gospel as the true jesus what did he really say and do and how much that is attributed to him in speech and action is the embroidery of the various parties into which his followers tended to split themselves within twenty years of his death when even the threefold tradition was only nascent  if any one will answer these questions for me with something more to the point than feeble talk about the cowardice of agnosticism i shall be deeply his debtor unless and until they are satisfactorily answered i say of agnosticism in this matter jy suis et jy reste  but as we have seen it is asserted that i have no business to call myself an agnostic that if i am 348 not a christian i am an infidel and that i ought to call myself by that name of unpleasant significance well i do not care much what i am called by other people and if i had at my side all those who since the christian era have been called infidels by other folks i could not desire better company if these are my ancestors i prefer with the old frank to be with them wherever they are but there are several points in dr waces contention which must be elucidated before i can even think of undertaking to carry out his wishes i must for instance know what a christian is now what is a christian by whose authority is the signification of that term defined is there any doubt that the immediate followers of jesus the sect of the nazarenes were strictly orthodox jews differing from other jews not more than the sadducees the pharisees and the essenes differed from one another in fact only in the belief that the messiah for whom the rest of their nation waited had come was not their chief james the brother of the lord reverenced alike by sadducee pharisee and nazarene at the famous conference which according to the acts took place at jerusalem does not james declare that myriads of jews who by that time had become nazarenes were all zealous for the law was not the name of christian first used to denote the converts to the doctrine promulgated by paul and barnabas at antioch does the subsequent history of christianity leave any doubt that from this time forth the little rift within 349 the lute caused by the new teaching developed if not inaugurated at antioch grew wider and wider until the two types of doctrine irreconcilably diverged did not the primitive nazarenism or ebionism develop into the nazarenism and ebionism and elkasaitism of later ages and finally die out in obscurity and condemnation as damnable heresy while the younger doctrine throve and pushed out its shoots into that endless variety of sects of which the three strongest survivors are the roman and greek churches and modern protestantism  singular state of things if i were to profess the doctrine which was held by james the brother of the lord and by every one of the myriads of his followers and coreligionists in jerusalem up to twenty or thirty years after the crucifixion and one knows not how much later at pella i should be condemned with unanimity as an ebionising heretic by the roman greek and protestant churches and probably this hearty and unanimous condemnation of the creed held by those who were in the closest personal relation with their lord is almost the only point upon which they would be cordially of one mind on the other hand though i hardly dare imagine such a thing i very much fear that the pillars of the primitive hierosolymitan church would have considered dr wace an infidel no one can read the famous second chapter of galatians and the book of revelations without seeing how narrow was even pauls escape from a similar 350 fate and if ecclesiastical history is to be trusted the thirtynine articles be they right or wrong diverge from the primitive doctrine of the nazarenes vastly more than even pauline christianity did  but further than this i have great difficulty in assuring myself that even james the brother of the lord and his myriads of nazarenes properly represented the doctrines of their master for it is constantly asserted by our modern pillars that one of the chief features of the work of jesus was the instauration of religion by the abolition of what our sticklers for articles and liturgies with unconscious humour call the narrow restrictions of the law yet if james knew this how could the bitter controversy with paul have arisen and why did one or the other side not quote any of the various sayings of jesus recorded in the gospels which directly bear on the questionsometimes apparently in opposite directions  so if i am asked to call myself an infidel i reply to what doctrine do you ask me to be faithful is it that contained in the nicene and the athanasian creeds my firm belief is that the nazarenes say of the year 40 headed by james would have stopped their ears and thought worthy of stoning the audacious man who propounded it to them is it contained in the socalled apostles creed i am pretty sure that even that would have created a recalcitrant commotion at pella in the year 70 among the nazarenes of jerusalem who had fled from the soldiers of titus and yet if the 351 unadulterated tradition of the teachings of the nazarene were to be found anywhere it surely should have been amidst those not very aged disciples who may have heard them as they were delivered  therefore however sorry i may be to be unable to demonstrate that if necessary i should not be afraid to call myself an infidel i cannot do it infidel is a term of reproach which christians and mahommedans in their modesty agree to apply to those who differ from them if he had only thought of it dr wace might have used the term miscreant which with the same etymological signification has the advantage of being still more unpleasant to the persons to whom it is applied but why should a man be expected to call himself a miscreant or an infidel that st patrick had two birthdays because he was a twin is a reasonable and intelligible utterance beside that of the man who should declare himself to be an infidel on the ground of denying his own belief it may be logically if not ethically defensible that a christian should call a mahommedan an infidel and vice versâ but on dr waces principles both ought to call themselves infidels because each applies the term to the other  now i am afraid that all the mahommedan world would agree in reciprocating that appellation to dr wace himself i once visited the hazar mosque the great university of mahommedanism in cairo in ignorance of the fact that i was unprovided with 352 proper authority a swarm of angry undergraduates as i suppose i ought to call them came buzzing about me and my guide and if i had known arabic i suspect that dog of an infidel would have been by no means the most unpleasant of the epithets showered upon me before i could explain and apologise for the mistake if i had had the pleasure of dr waces company on that occasion the undiscriminative followers of the prophet would i am afraid have made no difference between us not even if they had known that he was the head of an orthodox christian seminary and i have not the smallest doubt that even one of the learned mollahs if his grave courtesy would have permitted him to say anything offensive to men of another mode of belief would have told us that he wondered we did not find it very unpleasant to disbelieve in the prophet of islam  from what precedes i think it becomes sufficiently clear that dr waces account of the origin of the name of agnostic is quite wrong indeed i am bound to add that very slight effort to discover the truth would have convinced him that as a matter of fact the term arose otherwise i am loath to go over an old story once more but more than one object which i have in view will be served by telling it a little more fully than it has yet been told  looking back nearly fifty years i see myself as a boy whose education had been interrupted and who intellectually was left for some years altogether to his own devices at that time i was a voracious 353 and omnivorous reader a dreamer and speculator of the first water well endowed with that splendid courage in attacking any and every subject which is the blessed compensation of youth and inexperience among the books and essays on all sorts of topics from metaphysics to heraldry which i read at this time two left indelible impressions on my mind one was guizots history of civilisation the other was sir william hamiltons essay on the philosophy of the unconditioned which i came upon by chance in an odd volume of the edinburgh review the latter was certainly strange reading for a boy and i could not possibly have understood a great deal of it89 nevertheless i devoured it with avidity and it stamped upon my mind the strong conviction that on even the most solemn and important of questions men are apt to take cunning phrases for answers and that the limitation of our faculties in a great number of cases renders real answers to such questions not merely actually impossible but theoretically inconceivable  philosophy and history having laid hold of me in this eccentric fashion have never loosened their grip i have no pretension to be an expert in either subject but the turn for philosophical and historical reading which rendered hamilton and guizot attractive to me has not only filled many 354 lawful leisure hours and still more sleepless ones with the repose of changed mental occupation but has not unfrequently disputed my proper worktime with my liege lady natural science in this way i have found it possible to cover a good deal of ground in the territory of philosophy and all the more easily that i have never cared much about as or bs opinions but have rather sought to know what answer he had to give to the questions i had to put to himthat of the limitation of possible knowledge being the chief the ordinary examiner with his state the views of soandso would have floored me at any time if he had said what do you think about any given problem i might have got on fairly well  the reader who has had the patience to follow the enforced but unwilling egotism of this veritable history especially if his studies have led him in the same direction will now see why my mind steadily gravitated towards the conclusions of hume and kant so well stated by the latter in a sentence which i have quoted elsewhere      the greatest and perhaps the sole use of all philosophy of pure reason     is after all merely negative since it serves not as an organon for     the enlargement of knowledge but as a discipline for its     delimitation and instead of discovering truth has only the modest     merit of preventing error90  when i reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether i was an atheist a theist or 355 a pantheist a materialist or an idealist a christian or a freethinker i found that the more i learned and reflected the less ready was the answer until at last i came to the conclusion that i had neither art nor part with any of these denominations except the last the one thing in which most of these good people were agreed was the one thing in which i differed from them they were quite sure they had attained a certain gnosishad more or less successfully solved the problem of existence while i was quite sure i had not and had a pretty strong conviction that the problem was insoluble and with hume and kant on my side i could not think myself presumptuous in holding fast by that opinion like dante    nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita     mi ritrovai per una selva oscura  but unlike dante i cannot add    che la diritta via era smarrita  on the contrary i had and have the firmest conviction that i never left the verace viathe straight road and that this road led nowhere else but into the dark depths of a wild and tangled forest and though i have found leopards and lions in the path though i have made abundant acquaintance with the hungry wolf that with privy paw devours apace and nothing said as another great poet says of the ravening beast and though no friendly spectre has even yet offered his guidance i was and am minded to go straight on until i either come out on the 356 other side of the wood or find there is no other side to it at least none attainable by me  this was my situation when i had the good fortune to find a place among the members of that remarkable confraternity of antagonists long since deceased but of green and pious memory the metaphysical society every variety of philosophical and theological opinion was represented there and expressed itself with entire openness most of my colleagues were ists of one sort or another and however kind and friendly they might be i the man without a rag of a label to cover himself with could not fail to have some of the uneasy feelings which must have beset the historical fox when after leaving the trap in which his tail remained he presented himself to his normally elongated companions so i took thought and invented what i conceived to be the appropriate title of agnostic it came into my head as suggestively antithetic to the gnostic of church history who professed to know so much about the very things of which i was ignorant and i took the earliest opportunity of parading it at our society to show that i too had a tail like the other foxes to my great satisfaction the term took and when the spectator had stood godfather to it any suspicion in the minds of respectable people that a knowledge of its parentage might have awakened was of course completely lulled  that is the history of the origin of the terms agnostic and agnosticism and it will be observed that it does not quite agree with the 357 confident assertion of the reverend principal of kings college that the adoption of the term agnostic is only an attempt to shift the issue and that it involves a mere evasion in relation to the church and christianity91    the last objection i rejoice as much as my readers must do that it is the last which i have to take to dr waces deliverance before the church congress arises i am sorry to say on a question of morality  it is and it ought to be authoritatively declares this official representative of christian ethics an unpleasant thing for a man to have to say plainly that he does not believe in jesus christ l c p 254  whether it is so depends i imagine a good deal on whether the man was brought up in a christian household or not i do not see why it should be unpleasant for a mahommedan or buddhist to say so but that it ought to be unpleasant for any man to say anything which he sincerely and after due deliberation believes is to my mind a proposition of the most profoundly immoral character i verily believe that the great good which has been effected in the world by christianity has been largely counteracted by the pestilent doctrine on which all the churches have insisted that honest disbelief in their more or less astonishing creeds is a moral offence indeed a sin of the deepest dye deserving 358 and involving the same future retribution as murder and robbery if we could only see in one view the torrents of hypocrisy and cruelty the lies the slaughter the violations of every obligation of humanity which have flowed from this source along the course of the history of christian nations our worst imaginations of hell would pale beside the vision  a thousand times no it ought not to be unpleasant to say that which one honestly believes or disbelieves that it so constantly is painful to do so is quite enough obstacle to the progress of mankind in that most valuable of all qualities honesty of word or of deed without erecting a sad concomitant of human weakness into something to be admired and cherished the bravest of soldiers often and very naturally feel it unpleasant to go into action but a courtmartial which did its duty would make short work of the officer who promulgated the doctrine that his men ought to feel their duty unpleasant  i am very well aware as i suppose most thoughtful people are in these times that the process of breaking away from old beliefs is extremely unpleasant and i am much disposed to think that the encouragement the consolation and the peace afforded to earnest believers in even the worst forms of christianity are of great practical advantage to them what deductions must be made from this gain on the score of the harm done to the citizen by the ascetic otherworldliness of logical christianity to the ruler by 359 the hatred malice and all uncharitableness of sectarian bigotry to the legislator by the spirit of exclusiveness and domination of those that count themselves pillars of orthodoxy to the philosopher by the restraints on the freedom of learning and teaching which every church exercises when it is strong enough to the conscientious soul by the introspective hunting after sins of the mint and cummin type the fear of theological error and the overpowering terror of possible damnation which have accompanied the churches like their shadow i need not now consider but they are assuredly not small if agnostics lose heavily on the one side they gain a good deal on the other people who talk about the comforts of belief appear to forget its discomforts they ignore the fact that the christianity of the churches is something more than faith in the ideal personality of jesus which they create for themselves plus so much as can be carried into practice without disorganising civil society of the maxims of the sermon on the mount trip in morals or in doctrine especially in doctrine without due repentance or retractation or fail to get properly baptized before you die and a plébiscite of the christians of europe if they were true to their creeds would affirm your everlasting damnation by an immense majority  preachers orthodox and heterodox din into our ears that the world cannot get on without faith of some sort there is a sense in which that is as eminently as obviously true there is another in 360 which in my judgment it is as eminently as obviously false and it seems to me that the hortatory or pulpit mind is apt to oscillate between the false and the true meanings without being aware of the fact  it is quite true that the ground of every one of our actions and the validity of all our reasonings rest upon the great act of faith which leads us to take the experience of the past as a safe guide in our dealings with the present and the future from the nature of ratiocination it is obvious that the axioms on which it is based cannot be demonstrated by ratiocination it is also a trite observation that in the business of life we constantly take the most serious action upon evidence of an utterly insufficient character but it is surely plain that faith is not necessarily entitled to dispense with ratiocination because ratiocination cannot dispense with faith as a startingpoint and that because we are often obliged by the pressure of events to act on very bad evidence it does not follow that it is proper to act on such evidence when the pressure is absent  the writer of the epistle to the hebrews tells us that faith is the assurance of things hoped for the proving of things not seen in the authorised version substance stands for assurance and evidence for proving the question of the exact meaning of the two words greek hupostasis and greek elenchos affords a fine field of discussion for the scholar and the metaphysician but i fancy we shall be not far from the mark if we take the writer to have had in his mind the profound psychological 361 truth that men constantly feel certain about things for which they strongly hope but have no evidence in the legal or logical sense of the word and he calls this feeling faith i may have the most absolute faith that a friend has not committed the crime of which he is accused in the early days of english history if my friend could have obtained a few more compurgators of a like robust faith he would have been acquitted at the present day if i tendered myself as a witness on that score the judge would tell me to stand down and the youngest barrister would smile at my simplicity miserable indeed is the man who has not such faith in some of his fellowmenonly less miserable than the man who allows himself to forget that such faith is not strictly speaking evidence and when his faith is disappointed as will happen now and again turns timon and blames the universe for his own blunders and so if a man can find a friend the hypostasis of all his hopes the mirror of his ethical ideal in the jesus of any or all of the gospels let him live by faith in that ideal who shall or can forbid him but let him not delude himself with the notion that his faith is evidence of the objective reality of that in which he trusts such evidence is to be obtained only by the use of the methods of science as applied to history and to literature and it amounts at present to very little    it appears that mr gladstone some time ago asked mr laing if he could draw up a short summary 362 of the negative creed a body of negative propositions which have so far been adopted on the negative side as to be what the apostles and other accepted creeds are on the positive and mr laing at once kindly obliged mr gladstone with the desired articleseight of them  if any one had preferred this request to me i should have replied that if he referred to agnostics they have no creed and by the nature of the case cannot have any agnosticism in fact is not a creed but a method the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle that principle is of great antiquity it is as old as socrates as old as the writer who said try all things hold fast by that which is good it is the foundation of the reformation which simply illustrated the axiom that every man should be able to give a reason for the faith that is in him it is the great principle of descartes it is the fundamental axiom of modern science positively the principle may be expressed in matters of the intellect follow your reason as far as it will take you without regard to any other consideration and negatively in matters of the intellect do not pretend that conclusions are certain which are not demonstrated or demonstrable that i take to be the agnostic faith which if a man keep whole and undefiled he shall not be ashamed to look the universe in the face whatever the future may have in store for him  the results of the working out of the agnostic principle will vary according to individual knowledge 363 and capacity and according to the general condition of science that which is unproven today may be proven by the help of new discoveries tomorrow the only negative fixed points will be those negations which flow from the demonstrable limitation of our faculties and the only obligation accepted is to have the mind always open to conviction agnostics who never fail in carrying out their principles are i am afraid as rare as other people of whom the same consistency can be truthfully predicated but if you were to meet with such a phoenix and to tell him that you had discovered that two and two make five he would patiently ask you to state your reasons for that conviction and express his readiness to agree with you if he found them satisfactory the apostolic injunction to suffer fools gladly should be the rule of life of a true agnostic i am deeply conscious how far i myself fall short of this ideal but it is my personal conception of what agnostics ought to be  however as i began by stating i speak only for myself and i do not dream of anathematizing and excommunicating mr laing but when i consider his creed and compare it with the athanasian i think i have on the whole a clearer conception of the meaning of the latter polarity in article viii for example is a word about which i heard a good deal in my youth when naturphilosophie was in fashion and greatly did i suffer from it for many years past whenever i have met with polarity anywhere but in a discussion of some purely physical topic such as magnetism i have shut the book mr 364 laing must excuse me if the force of habit was too much for me when i read his eighth article    and now what is to be said to mr harrisons remarkable deliverance on the future of agnosticism92 i would that it were not my business to say anything for i am afraid that i can say nothing which shall manifest my great personal respect for this able writer and for the zeal and energy with which he ever and anon galvanises the weakly frame of positivism until it looks more than ever like john bunyans pope and pagan rolled into one there is a story often repeated and i am afraid none the less mythical on that account of a valiant and loudvoiced corporal in command of two full privates who falling in with a regiment of the enemy in the dark orders it to surrender under pain of instant annihilation by his force and the enemy surrenders accordingly i am always reminded of this tale when i read the positivist commands to the forces of christianity and of science only the enemy show no more signs of intending to obey now than they have done any time these forty years  the allocution under consideration has the papal flavour which is wont to hang about the utterances of the pontiffs of the church of comte mr harrison speaks with authority and not as one of the common scribes of the period he knows not only what agnosticism is and how it has come about but what will become of it the agnostic is to content 365 himself with being the precursor of the positivist in his place as a sort of navvy levelling the ground and cleansing it of such poor stuff as christianity he is a useful creature who deserves patting on the back on condition that he does not venture beyond his last but let not these scientific sanballats presume that they are good enough to take part in the building of the templethey are mere samaritans doomed to die out in proportion as the religion of humanity is accepted by mankind well if that is their fate they have time to be cheerful but let us hear mr harrisons pronouncement of their doom  agnosticism is a stage in the evolution of religion an entirely negative stage the point reached by physicists a purely mental conclusion with no relation to things social at all p 154 i am quite dazed by this declaration are there then any conclusions that are not purely mental is there no relation to things social in mental conclusions which affect mens whole conception of life was that prince of agnostics david hume particularly imbued with physical science supposing physical science to be nonexistent would not the agnostic principle applied by the philologist and the historian lead to exactly the same results is the modern more or less complete suspension of judgment as to the facts of the history of regal rome or the real origin of the homeric poems anything but agnosticism in history and in literature and if so how can agnosticism be the mere negation of the physicist 366  agnosticism is a stage in the evolution of religion no two people agree as to what is meant by the term religion but if it means as i think it ought to mean simply the reverence and love for the ethical ideal and the desire to realise that ideal in life which every man ought to feelthen i say agnosticism has no more to do with it than it has to do with music or painting if on the other hand mr harrison like most people means by religion theology then in my judgment agnosticism can be said to be a stage in its evolution only as death may be said to be the final stage in the evolution of life      when agnostic logic is simply one of the canons of thought     agnosticism as a distinctive faith will have spontaneously     disappeared p 155  i can but marvel that such sentences as this and those already quoted should have proceeded from mr harrisons pen does he really mean to suggest that agnostics have a logic peculiar to themselves will he kindly help me out of my bewilderment when i try to think of logic being anything else than the canon which i believe means rule of thought as to agnosticism being a distinctive faith i have already shown that it cannot possibly be anything of the kind unless perfect faith in logic is distinctive of agnostics which after all it may be      agnosticism as a religious philosophy per se rests on an almost total     ignoring of history and social evolution p 152  but neither per se nor per aliud has agnosticism if i know anything about it the least pretension to be a religious philosophy so far from resting on 367 ignorance of history and that social evolution of which history is the account it is and has been the inevitable result of the strict adherence to scientific methods by historical investigators our forefathers were quite confident about the existence of romulus and remus of king arthur and of hengist and horsa most of us have become agnostics in regard to the reality of these worthies it is a matter of notoriety of which mr harrison who accuses us all so freely of ignoring history should not be ignorant that the critical process which has shattered the foundations of orthodox christian doctrine owes its origin not to the devotees of physical science but before all to richard simon the learned french oratorian just two hundred years ago i cannot find evidence that either simon or any one of the great scholars and critics of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries who have continued simons work had any particular acquaintance with physical science i have already pointed out that hume was independent of it and certainly one of the most potent influences in the same direction upon history in the present century that of grote did not come from the physical side physical science in fact has had nothing directly to do with the criticism of the gospels it is wholly incompetent to furnish demonstrative evidence that any statement made in these histories is untrue indeed modern physiology can find parallels in nature for events of apparently the most eminently supernatural kind recounted in some of those histories 368  it is a comfort to hear upon mr harrisons authority that the laws of physical nature show no signs of becoming less definite less consistent or less popular as time goes on p 154 how a law of nature is to become indefinite or inconsistent passes my poor powers of imagination but with universal suffrage and the coachdog theory of premiership in full view the theory i mean that the whole duty of a political chief is to look sharp for the way the social coach is driving and then run in front and bark loudas if being the leading noisemaker and guiding were the same thingsit is truly satisfactory to me to know that the laws of nature are increasing in popularity looking at recent developments of the policy which is said to express the great heart of the people i have had my doubts of the fact and my love for my fellowcountrymen has led me to reflect with dread on what will happen to them if any of the laws of nature ever become so unpopular in their eyes as to be voted down by the transcendent authority of universal suffrage if the legion of demons before they set out on their journey in the swine had had time to hold a meeting and to resolve unanimously that the law of gravitation is oppressive and ought to be repealed i am afraid it would have made no sort of difference to the result when their two thousand unwilling porters were once launched down the steep slopes of the fatal shore of gennesaret      the question of the place of religion as an element of human nature as     a force of human society its origin analysis and 369 functions     has never been considered at all from an agnostic point of view p     152  i doubt not that mr harrison knows vastly more about history than i do in fact he tells the public that some of my friends and i have had no opportunity of occupying ourselves with that subject i do not like to contradict any statement which mr harrison makes on his own authority only if i may be true to my agnostic principles i humbly ask how he has obtained assurance on this head i do not profess to know anything about the range of mr harrisons studies but as he has thought it fitting to start the subject i may venture to point out that on evidence adduced it might be equally permissible to draw the conclusion that mr harrisons absorbing labours as the pontifex maximus of the positivist religion have not allowed him to acquire that acquaintance with the methods and results of physical science or with the history of philosophy or of philological and historical criticism which is essential to any one who desires to obtain a right understanding of agnosticism incompetence in philosophy and in all branches of science except mathematics is the wellknown mental characteristic of the founder of positivism faithfulness in disciples is an admirable quality in itself the pity is that it not unfrequently leads to the imitation of the weaknesses as well as of the strength of the master it is only such overfaithfulness which can account for a strong mind really saturated with the historical sense p 153 exhibiting the extraordinary forgetfulness of the 370 historical fact of the existence of david hume implied by the assertion that      it would be difficult to name a single known agnostic who has given to     history anything like the amount of thought and study which he brings     to a knowledge of the physical world p 153  whoso calls to mind what i may venture to term the bright side of christianitythat ideal of manhood with its strength and its patience its justice and its pity for human frailty its helpfulness to the extremity of selfsacrifice its ethical purity and nobility which apostles have pictured in which armies of martyrs have placed their unshakable faith and whence obscure men and women like catherine of sienna and john knox have derived the courage to rebuke popes and kingsis not likely to underrate the importance of the christian faith as a factor in human history or to doubt that if that faith should prove to be incompatible with our knowledge or necessary want of knowledge some other hypostasis of mens hopes genuine enough and worthy enough to replace it will arise but that the incongruous mixture of bad science with eviscerated papistry out of which comte manufactured the positivist religion will be the heir of the christian ages i have too much respect for the humanity of the future to believe charles the second told his brother they will not kill me james to make you king and if critical science is remorselessly destroying the historical foundations of the noblest ideal of humanity which mankind have yet 371 worshipped it is little likely to permit the pitiful reality to climb into the vacant shrine  that a man should determine to devote himself to the service of humanityincluding intellectual and moral selfculture under that name that this should be in the proper sense of the word his religionis not only an intelligible but i think a laudable resolution and i am greatly disposed to believe that it is the only religion which will prove itself to be unassailably acceptable so long as the human race endures but when the positivist asks me to worship humanitythat is to say to adore the generalised conception of men as they ever have been and probably ever will bei must reply that i could just as soon bow down and worship the generalised conception of a wilderness of apes surely we are not going back to the days of paganism when individual men were deified and the hard good sense of a dying vespasian could prompt the bitter jest ut puto deus fio no divinity doth hedge a modern man be he even a sovereign ruler nor is there any one except a municipal magistrate who is officially declared worshipful but if there is no spark of worshipworthy divinity in the individual twigs of humanity whence comes that godlike splendour which the moses of positivism fondly imagines to pervade the whole bush  i know no study which is so unutterably saddening as that of the evolution of humanity as it is set forth in the annals of history out of the darkness of prehistoric ages man emerges with the marks of 372 his lowly origin strong upon him he is a brute only more intelligent than the other brutes a blind prey to impulses which as often as not lead him to destruction a victim to endless illusions which make his mental existence a terror and a burden and fill his physical life with barren toil and battle he attains a certain degree of physical comfort and develops a more or less workable theory of life in such favourable situations as the plains of mesopotamia or of egypt and then for thousands and thousands of years struggles with varying fortunes attended by infinite wickedness bloodshed and misery to maintain himself at this point against the greed and the ambition of his fellowmen he makes a point of killing and otherwise persecuting all those who first try to get him to move on and when he has moved on a step foolishly confers postmortem deification on his victims he exactly repeats the process with all who want to move a step yet farther and the best men of the best epochs are simply those who make the fewest blunders and commit the fewest sins  that one should rejoice in the good man forgive the bad man and pity and help all men to the best of ones ability is surely indisputable it is the glory of judaism and of christianity to have proclaimed this truth through all their aberrations but the worship of a god who needs forgiveness and help and deserves pity every hour of his existence is no better than that of any other voluntarily selected fetish the emperor julians project was hopeful in 373 comparison with the prospects of the new anthropolatry    when the historian of religion in the twentieth century is writing about the nineteenth i foresee he will say something of this kind  the most curious and instructive events in the religious history of the preceding century are the rise and progress of two new sects called mormons and positivists to the student who has carefully considered these remarkable phenomena nothing in the records of religious selfdelusion can appear improbable  the mormons arose in the midst of the great republic which though comparatively insignificant at that time in territory as in the number of its citizens was as we know from the fragments of the speeches of its orators which have come down to us no less remarkable for the native intelligence of its population than for the wide extent of their information owing to the activity of their publishers in diffusing all that they could invent beg borrow or steal nor were they less noted for their perfect freedom from all restraints in thought or speech or deed except to be sure the beneficent and wise influence of the majority exerted in case of need through an institution known as tarring and feathering the exact nature of which is now disputed  there is a complete consensus of testimony that the founder of mormonism one joseph smith was a lowminded ignorant scamp and that he stole the 374 scriptures which he propounded not being clever enough to forge even such contemptible stuff as they contain nevertheless he must have been a man of some force of character for a considerable number of disciples soon gathered about him in spite of repeated outbursts of popular hatred and violenceduring one of which persecutions smith was brutally murderedthe mormon body steadily increased and became a flourishing community but the mormon practices being objectionable to the majority they were more than once without any pretence of law but by force of riot arson and murder driven away from the land they had occupied harried by these persecutions the mormon body eventually committed itself to the tender mercies of a desert as barren as that of sinai and after terrible sufferings and privations reached the oasis of utah here it grew and flourished sending out missionaries to and receiving converts from all parts of europe sometimes to the number of 10000 in a year until in 1880 the rich and flourishing community numbered 110000 souls in utah alone while there were probably 30000 or 40000 scattered abroad elsewhere in the whole history of religions there is no more remarkable example of the power of faith and in this case the founder of that faith was indubitably a most despicable creature it is interesting to observe that the course taken by the great republic and its citizens runs exactly parallel with that taken by the roman empire and its citizens towards the early christians except that the romans had a certain legal excuse for 375 their acts of violence inasmuch as the christian sodalitia were not licensed and consequently were ipso facto illegal assemblages until in the latter part of the nineteenth century the united states legislature decreed the illegality of polygamy the mormons were wholly within the law  nothing can present a greater contrast to all this than the history of the positivists this sect arose much about the same time as that of the mormons in the upper and most instructed stratum of the quickwitted sceptical population of paris the founder auguste comte was a teacher of mathematics but of no eminence in that department of knowledge and with nothing but an amateurs acquaintance with physical chemical and biological science his works are repulsive on account of the dull diffuseness of their style and a certain air as of a superior person which characterises them but nevertheless they contain good things here and there it would take too much space to reproduce in detail a system which proposes to regulate all human life by the promulgation of a gentile leviticus suffice it to say that m comte may be described as a syncretic who like the gnostics of early church history attempted to combine the substance of imperfectly comprehended contemporary science with the form of roman christianity it may be that this is the reason why his disciples were so very angry with some obscure people called agnostics whose views if we may judge by the account left in the works of a great positivist controversial writer were very absurd 376  to put the matter briefly m comte finding christianity and science at daggers drawn seems to have said to science you find christianity rotten at the core do you well i will scoop out the inside of it and to romanism you find science mere dry lightcold and bare well i will put your shell over it and so as schoolboys make a spectre out of a turnip and a tallow candle behold the new religion of humanity complete  unfortunately neither the romanists nor the people who were something more than amateurs in science could be got to worship m comtes new idol properly in the native country of positivism one distinguished man of letters and one of science for a time helped to make up a roomful of the faithful but their love soon grew cold in england on the other hand there appears to be little doubt that in the ninth decade of the century the multitude of disciples reached the grand total of several score they had the advantage of the advocacy of one or two most eloquent and learned apostles and at any rate the sympathy of several persons of light and leadingand if they were not seen they were heard all over the world on the other hand as a sect they laboured under the prodigious disadvantage of being refined estimable people living in the midst of the wornout civilisation of the old world where any one who had tried to persecute them as the mormons were persecuted would have been instantly hanged but the majority never dreamed of persecuting them on the contrary they were rather 377 given to scold and otherwise try the patience of the majority  the history of these sects in the closing years of the century is highly instructive mormonism   but i find i have suddenly slipped off mr harrisons tripod which i had borrowed for the occasion the fact is i am not equal to the prophetical business and ought not to have undertaken it                                        378  x  the value of witness to the miraculous  charles or more properly karl king of the franks consecrated roman emperor in st peters on christmas day ad 800 and known to posterity as the great chiefly by his agglutinative gallicised denomination of charlemagne was a man great in all ways physically and mentally within a couple of centuries after his death charlemagne became the centre of innumerable legends and the mythmaking process does not seem to have been sensibly interfered with by the existence of sober and truthful histories of the emperor and of the times which immediately preceded and followed his reign by a contemporary writer who occupied a high and confidential position in his court and in that of his successor this was one eginhard or einhard who appears to have been born about ad 770 and spent his youth at the court being educated along with charless sons there is excellent contemporary testimony not only to eginhards existence but to his abilities and to the place which he occupied in the circle of the intimate friends of the great ruler whose life he subsequently wrote 379 in fact there is as good evidence of eginhards existence of his official position and of his being the author of the chief works attributed to him as can reasonably be expected in the case of a man who lived more than a thousand years ago and was neither a great king nor a great warrior the works are1 the life of the emperor karl 2 the annals of the franks 3 letters 4 the history of the translation of the blessed martyrs of christ ss marcellinus and petrus  it is to the last as one of the most singular and interesting records of the period during which the roman world passed into that of the middle ages that i wish to direct attention93 it was written in the ninth century somewhere apparently about the year 830 when eginhard ailing in health and weary of political life had withdrawn to the monastery of seligenstadt of which he was the founder a manuscript copy of the work made in the tenth century and once the property of the monastery of st bavon on the scheldt of which eginhard was abbot is still extant and there is no reason to believe that in this copy the original has been in any way interpolated or otherwise tampered with the main features of the strange story contained in the historia translationis are set forth in the following pages in which in regard to all matters of importance i shall adhere as closely as possible to eginhards own words  380      while i was still at court busied with secular affairs i often     thought of the leisure which i hoped one day to enjoy in a solitary     place far away from the crowd with which the liberality of prince     louis whom i then served had provided me this place is situated in     that part of germany which lies between the neckar and the maine94     and is nowadays called the odenwald by those who live in and about it     and here having built according to my capacity and resources not only     houses and permanent dwellings but also a basilica fitted for the     performance of divine service and of no mean style of construction i     began to think to what saint or martyr i could best dedicate it a good     deal of time had passed while my thoughts fluctuated about this matter     when it happened that a certain deacon of the roman church named     deusdona arrived at the court for the purpose of seeking the favour of     the king in some affairs in which he was interested he remained some     time and then having transacted his business he was about to return     to rome when one day moved by courtesy to a stranger we invited him     to a modest refection and while talking of many things at table     mention was made of the translation of the body of the blessed     sebastian95 and of the neglected tombs of the martyrs of which     there is such a prodigious number at rome and the conversation having     turned towards the dedication of our new basilica i began to inquire     how it might be possible for me to obtain some of the true relics of     the saints which rest at rome he at first hesitated and declared that     he did not know how that could be done but observing that i was both     anxious and curious about the subject he promised to give me an answer     some other day      when i returned to the question some time afterwards he immediately     drew from his bosom a paper which he begged me to read when i was     alone and to tell him what i was disposed to think of that which was     therein stated i took the paper and as he desired read it alone and     in secret cap i 2 3  381  i shall have occasion to return to deacon deusdonas conditions and to what happened after eginhards acceptance of them suffice it for the present to say that eginhards notary ratleicus ratleig was despatched to rome and succeeded in securing two bodies supposed to be those of the holy martyrs marcellinus and petrus and when he had got as far on his homeward journey as the burgundian town of solothurn or soleure96 notary ratleig despatched to his master at st bavon a letter announcing the success of his mission      as soon as by reading it i was assured of the arrival of the saints i     despatched a confidential messenger to maestricht to gather together     priests other clerics and also laymen to go out to meet the coming     saints as speedily as possible and he and his companions having lost     no time after a few days met those who had charge of the saints at     solothurn joined with them and with a vast crowd of people who     gathered from all parts singing hymns and amidst great and universal     rejoicings they travelled quickly to the city of argentoratum which     is now called strasburg thence embarking on the rhine they came to     the place called portus97 and landing on the east bank of the river     at the fifth station thence they arrived at michilinstadt98     accompanied by an immense multitude praising god this place is in     that forest of germany which in modern times is called the odenwald     and about six leagues from the maine and here having found a basilica     recently built by me but not yet consecrated they carried the sacred     remains into it and deposited them therein as if it were to be their     final restingplace as soon as all this was reported to me i travelled     thither as quickly as i could cap ii 14  382  three days after eginhards arrival began the series of wonderful events which he narrates and for which we have his personal guarantee the first thing that he notices is the dream of a servant of ratleig the notary who being set to watch the holy relics in the church after vespers went to sleep and during his slumbers had a vision of two pigeons one white and one gray and white which came and sat upon the bier over the relics while at the same time a voice ordered the man to tell his master that the holy martyrs had chosen another restingplace and desired to be transported thither without delay  unfortunately the saints seem to have forgotten to mention where they wished to go and with the most anxious desire to gratify their smallest wishes eginhard was naturally greatly perplexed what to do while in this state of mind he was one day contemplating his great and wonderful treasure more precious than all the gold in the world when it struck him that the chest in which the relics were contained was quite unworthy of its contents and after vespers he gave orders to one of the sacristans to take the measure of the chest in order that a more fitting shrine might be constructed the man having lighted a wax candle and raised the pall which covered the relics in order to carry out his masters orders was astonished and terrified to observe that the chest was covered with a bloodlike exudation loculum mirum in modum humore sanguineo undique distillantem and at once sent a message to eginhard 383      then i and those priests who accompanied me beheld this stupendous     miracle worthy of all admiration for just as when it is going to     rain pillars and slabs and marble images exude moisture and as it     were sweat so the chest which contained the most sacred relics was     found moist with the blood exuding on all sides cap ii 16  three days fast was ordained in order that the meaning of the portent might be ascertained all that happened however was that at the end of that time the blood which had been exuding in drops all the while dried up eginhard is careful to say that the liquid had a saline taste something like that of tears and was thin as water though of the colour of true blood and he clearly thinks this satisfactory evidence that it was blood  the same night another servant had a vision in which still more imperative orders for the removal of the relics were given and from that time forth not a single night passed without one two or even three of our companions receiving revelations in dreams that the bodies of the saints were to be transferred from that place to another at last a priest hildfrid saw in a dream a venerable whitehaired man in a priests vestments who bitterly reproached eginhard for not obeying the repeated orders of the saints and upon this the journey was commenced why eginhard delayed obedience to these repeated visions so long does not appear he does not say so in so many words but the general tenor of the narrative leads one to suppose that mulinheim afterwards seligenstadt is the solitary place in which he had built the church which awaited dedication 384 in that case all the people about him would know that he desired that the saints should go there if a glimmering of secular sense led him to be a little suspicious about the real cause of the unanimity of the visionary beings who manifested themselves to his entourage in favour of moving on he does not say so  at the end of the first days journey the precious relics were deposited in the church of st martin in the village of ostheim hither a paralytic nun sanctimonialis quædam paralytica of the name of ruodlang was brought in a car by her friends and relatives from a monastery a league off she spent the night watching and praying by the bier of the saints and health returning to all her members on the morrow she went back to her place whence she came on her feet nobody supporting her or in any way giving her assistance cap ii 19  on the second day the relics were carried to upper mulinheim and finally in accordance with the orders of the martyrs deposited in the church of that place which was therefore renamed seligenstadt here daniel a beggar boy of fifteen and so bent that he could not look at the sky without lying on his back collapsed and fell down during the celebration of the mass thus he lay a long time as if asleep and all his limbs straightening and his flesh strengthening recepta firmitate nervorum he arose before our eyes quite well cap ii 20  some time afterwards an old man entered the church on his hands and knees being unable to use his limbs properly 385      he in presence of all of us by the power of god and the merits of the     blessed martyrs in the same hour in which he entered was so perfectly     cured that he walked without so much as a stick and he said that     though he had been deaf for five years his deafness had ceased along     with the palsy cap iii 33  eginhard was now obliged to return to the court at aixlachapelle where his duties kept him through the winter and he is careful to point out that the later miracles which he proceeds to speak of are known to him only at second hand but as he naturally observes having seen such wonderful events with his own eyes why should he doubt similar narrations when they are received from trustworthy sources  wonderful stories these are indeed but as they are for the most part of the same general character as those already recounted they may be passed over there is however an account of a possessed maiden which is worth attention this is set forth in a memoir the principal contents of which are the speeches of a demon who declared himself to possess the singular appellation of wiggo and revealed himself in the presence of many witnesses before the altar close to the relics of the blessed martyrs it is noteworthy that the revelations appear to have been made in the shape of replies to the questions of the exorcising priest and there is no means of judging how far the answers are really only the questions to which the patient replied yes or no  the possessed girl about sixteen years of age was brought by her parents to the basilica of the martyrs 386      when she approached the tomb containing the sacred bodies the priest     according to custom read the formula of exorcism over her head when     he began to ask how and when the demon had entered her she answered     not in the tongue of the barbarians which alone the girl knew but in     the roman tongue and when the priest was astonished and asked how she     came to know latin when her parents who stood by were wholly     ignorant of it thou hast never seen my parents was the reply to     this the priest whence art thou then if these are not thy parents     and the demon by the mouth of the girl i am a follower and disciple     of satan and for a long time i was gatekeeper janitor in hell but     for some years along with eleven companions i have ravaged the     kingdom of the franks cap v 49  he then goes on to tell how they blasted the crops and scattered pestilence among beasts and men because of the prevalent wickedness of the people99  the enumeration of all these iniquities in oratorical style takes up a whole octavo page and at the end it is stated all these things the demon spoke in latin by the mouth of the girl      and when the priest imperatively ordered him to come out i shall go     said he not in obedience to you but on account of the power of the     saints who do not allow me to remain any longer and having said     this he threw the girl down on the floor and there compelled her to     lie prostrate for a time as though she slumbered after a little     while however he going away the girl by the power of christ and the     merits of the blessed martyrs as it were awaking from sleep rose up     quite well to the astonishment of all present nor after the demon had     gone out was she able to speak latin so that it was plain enough that     it was not she who had spoken in that tongue but the demon by her     mouth cap v 51  387  if the historia translationis contained nothing more than has been at present laid before the reader disbelief in the miracles of which it gives so precise and full a record might well be regarded as hyperscepticism it might fairly be said here you have a man whose high character acute intelligence and large instruction are certified by eminent contemporaries a man who stood high in the confidence of one of the greatest rulers of any age and whose other works prove him to be an accurate and judicious narrator of ordinary events this man tells you in language which bears the stamp of sincerity of things which happened within his own knowledge or within that of persons in whose veracity he has entire confidence while he appeals to his sovereign and the court as witnesses of others what possible ground can there be for disbelieving him  well it is hard upon eginhard to say so but it is exactly the honesty and sincerity of the man which are his undoing as a witness to the miraculous he himself makes it quite obvious that when his profound piety comes on the stage his good sense and even his perception of right and wrong make their exit let us go back to the point at which we left him secretly perusing the letter of deacon deusdona as he tells us its contents were      that he the deacon had many relics of saints at home and that he     would give them to me if i would furnish him with the means of     returning to rome he had observed that i had two mules and if i would     let him have one of them and would despatch with him a confidential     servant to take charge of the 388 relics he would at once send them     to me this plausibly expressed proposition pleased me and i made up     my mind to test the value of the somewhat ambiguous promise at     once100 so giving him the mule and money for his journey i ordered     my notary ratleig who already desired to go to rome to offer his     devotions there to go with him therefore having left aixlachapelle     where the emperor and his court resided at the time they came to     soissons here they spoke with hildoin abbot of the monastery of st     medardus because the said deacon had assured him that he had the means     of placing in his possession the body of the blessed tiburtius the     martyr attracted by which promises he hildoin sent with them a     certain priest hunus by name a sharp man hominem callidum whom     he ordered to receive and bring back the body of the martyr in     question and so resuming their journey they proceeded to rome as     fast as they could cap i 3  unfortunately a servant of the notary one reginbald fell ill of a tertian fever and impeded the progress of the party however this piece of adversity had its sweet uses for three days before they reached rome reginbald had a vision somebody habited as a deacon appeared to him and asked why his master was in such a hurry to get to rome and when reginbald explained their business this visionary deacon who seems to have taken the measure of his brother in the flesh with some accuracy told him not by any means to expect that deusdona would fulfil his promises moreover taking the servant by the hand he led him to the top of a high mountain and showing him rome where the man had never been pointed 389 out a church adding tell ratleig the thing he wants is hidden there let him get it as quickly as he can and go back to his master and by way of a sign that the order was authoritative the servant was promised that from that time forth his fever should disappear and as the fever did vanish to return no more the faith of eginhards people in deacon deusdona naturally vanished with it et fidem diaconi promissis non haberent nevertheless they put up at the deacons house near st peter ad vincula but time went on and no relics made their appearance while the notary and the priest were put off with all sorts of excusesthe brother to whom the relics had been confided was gone to beneventum and not expected back for some time and so onuntil ratleig and hunus began to despair and were minded to return infecto negotio      but my notary calling to mind his servants dream proposed to his     companion that they should go to the cemetery which their host had     talked about without him so having found and hired a guide they went     in the first place to the basilica of the blessed tiburtius in the via     labicana about three thousand paces from the town and cautiously and     carefully inspected the tomb of that martyr in order to discover     whether it could be opened without any one being the wiser then they     descended into the adjoining crypt in which the bodies of the blessed     martyrs of christ marcellinus and petrus were buried and having made     out the nature of their tomb they went away thinking their host would     not know what they had been about but things fell out differently from     what they had imagined cap i 7  in fact deacon deusdona who doubtless kept an eye on his guests knew all about their manoeuvres and made haste to offer his services in order that 390 with the help of god si deus votis eorum favere dignaretur they should all work together the deacon was evidently alarmed lest they should succeed without his help  so by way of preparation for the contemplated vol avec effraction they fasted three days and then at night without being seen they betook themselves to the basilica of st tiburtius and tried to break open the altar erected over his remains but the marble proving too solid they descended to the crypt and having evoked our lord jesus christ and adored the holy martyrs they proceeded to prise off the stone which covered the tomb and thereby exposed the body of the most sacred martyr marcellinus whose head rested on a marble tablet on which his name was inscribed the body was taken up with the greatest veneration wrapped in a rich covering and given over to the keeping of the deacon and his brother lunison while the stone was replaced with such care that no sign of the theft remained  as sacrilegious proceedings of this kind were punishable with death by the roman law it seems not unnatural that deacon deusdona should have become uneasy and have urged ratleig to be satisfied with what he had got and be off with his spoils but the notary having thus cleverly captured the blessed marcellinus thought it a pity he should be parted from the blessed petrus side by side with whom he had rested for five hundred years and more in the same sepulchre as eginhard pathetically 391 observes and the pious man could neither eat drink nor sleep until he had compassed his desire to reunite the saintly colleagues this time apparently in consequence of deusdonas opposition to any further resurrectionist doings he took counsel with a greek monk one basil and accompanied by hunus but saying nothing to deusdona they committed another sacrilegious burglary securing this time not only the body of the blessed petrus but a quantity of dust which they agreed the priest should take and tell his employer that it was the remains of the blessed tiburtius how deusdona was squared and what he got for his not very valuable complicity in these transactions does not appear but at last the relics were sent off in charge of lunison the brother of deusdona and the priest hunus as far as pavia while ratleig stopped behind for a week to see if the robbery was discovered and presumably to act as a blind if any hue and cry was raised but as everything remained quiet the notary betook himself to pavia where he found lunison and hunus awaiting his arrival the notarys opinion of the character of his worthy colleagues however may be gathered from the fact that having persuaded them to set out in advance along a road which he told them he was about to take he immediately adopted another route and travelling by way of st maurice and the lake of geneva eventually reached soleure  eginhard tells all this story with the most naïve air of unconsciousness that there is anything remarkable about an abbot and a high officer of state to 392 boot being an accessory both before and after the fact to a most gross and scandalous act of sacrilegious and burglarious robbery and an amusing sequel to the story proves that where relics were concerned his friend hildoin another high ecclesiastical dignitary was even less scrupulous than himself  on going to the palace early one morning after the saints were safely bestowed at seligenstadt he found hildoin waiting for an audience in the emperors antechamber and began to talk to him about the miracle of the bloody exudation in the course of conversation eginhard happened to allude to the remarkable fineness of the garment of the blessed marcellinus whereupon abbot hildoin observed to eginhards stupefaction that his observation was quite correct much astonished at this remark from a person who was supposed not to have seen the relics eginhard asked him how he knew that upon this hildoin saw that he had better make a clean breast of it and he told the following story which he had received from his priestly agent hunus while hunus and lunison were at pavia waiting for eginhards notary hunus according to his own account had robbed the robbers the relics were placed in a church and a number of laymen and clerics of whom hunus was one undertook to keep watch over them one night however all the watchers save the wideawake hunus went to sleep and then according to the story which this sharp ecclesiastic foisted upon his patron 393      it was borne in upon his mind that there must be some great reason why     all the people except himself had suddenly become somnolent and     determining to avail himself of the opportunity thus offered oblata     occasione utendum he rose and having lighted a candle silently     approached the chests then having burnt through the threads of the     seals with the flame of the candle he quickly opened the chests which     had no locks101 and taking out portions of each of the bodies which     were thus exposed he closed the chests and connected the burnt ends of     the threads with the seals again so that they appeared not to have     been touched and no one having seen him he returned to his place     cap iii 23  hildoin went on to tell eginhard that hunus at first declared to him that these purloined relics belonged to st tiburtius but afterwards confessed as a great secret how he had come by them and he wound up his discourse thus      they have a place of honour beside st medardus where they are     worshipped with great veneration by all the people but whether we may     keep them or not is for your judgment cap iii 23  poor eginhard was thrown into a state of great perturbation of mind by this revelation an acquaintance of his had recently told him of a rumour that was spread about that hunus had contrived to abstract all the remains of ss marcellinus and petrus while eginhards agents were in a drunken sleep and that while the real relics were in abbot hildoins hands at st medardus the shrine at seligenstadt contained nothing but a little dust though greatly annoyed by this execrable rumour spread 394 everywhere by the subtlety of the devil eginhard had doubtless comforted himself by his supposed knowledge of its falsity and he only now discovered how considerable a foundation there was for the scandal there was nothing for it but to insist upon the return of the stolen treasures one would have thought that the holy man who had admitted himself to be knowingly a receiver of stolen goods would have made instant restitution and begged only for absolution but eginhard intimates that he had very great difficulty in getting his brother abbot to see that even restitution was necessary  hildoins proceedings were not of such a nature as to lead any one to place implicit confidence in anything he might say still less had his agent priest hunus established much claim to confidence and it is not surprising that eginhard should have lost no time in summoning his notary and lunison to his presence in order that he might hear what they had to say about the business they however at once protested that priest hunuss story was a parcel of lies and that after the relics left rome no one had any opportunity of meddling with them moreover lunison throwing himself at eginhards feet confessed with many tears what actually took place it will be remembered that after the body of st marcellinus was abstracted from its tomb ratleig deposited it in the house of deusdona in charge of the latters brother lunison but hunus being very much disappointed that he could not get hold of the body of st tiburtius and afraid to go back to his 395 abbot emptyhanded bribed lunison with four pieces of gold and five of silver to give him access to the chest this lunison did and hunus helped himself to as much as would fill a gallon measure vas sextarii mensuram of the sacred remains eginhards indignation at the rapine of this nequissimus nebulo is exquisitely droll it would appear that the adage about the receiver being as bad as the thief was not current in the ninth century    let us now briefly sum up the history of the acquisition of the relics eginhard makes a contract with deusdona for the delivery of certain relics which the latter says he possesses eginhard makes no inquiry how he came by them otherwise the transaction is innocent enough  deusdona turns out to be a swindler and has no relics thereupon eginhards agent after due fasting and prayer breaks open the tombs and helps himself  eginhard discovers by the selfbetrayal of his brother abbot hildoin that portions of his relics have been stolen and conveyed to the latter with much ado he succeeds in getting them back  hildoins agent hunus in delivering these stolen goods to him at first declared they were the relics of st tiburtius which hildoin desired him to obtain but afterwards invented a story of their being the product of a theft which the providential drowsiness of his companions enabled him to perpetrate from the relics which hildoin well knew were the property of his friend 396  lunison on the contrary swears that all this story is false and that he himself was bribed by hunus to allow him to steal what he pleased from the property confided to his own and his brothers care by their guest ratleig and the honest notary himself seems to have no hesitation about lying and stealing to any extent where the acquisition of relics is the object in view  for a parallel to these transactions one must read a police report of the doings of a long firm or of a set of horsecoupers yet eginhard seems to be aware of nothing but that he has been rather badly used by his friend hildoin and the nequissimus nebulo hunus  it is not easy for a modern protestant still less for any one who has the least tincture of scientific culture whether physical or historical to picture to himself the state of mind of a man of the ninth century however cultivated enlightened and sincere he may have been his deepest convictions his most cherished hopes were bound up with the belief in the miraculous life was a constant battle between saints and demons for the possession of the souls of men the most superstitious among our modern countrymen turn to supernatural agencies only when natural causes seem insufficient to eginhard and his friends the supernatural was the rule and the sufficiency of natural causes was allowed only when there was nothing to suggest others  moreover it must be recollected that the possession of miracleworking relics was greatly coveted 397 not only on high but on very low grounds to a man like eginhard the mere satisfaction of the religious sentiment was obviously a powerful attraction but more than this the possession of such a treasure was an immense practical advantage if the saints were duly flattered and worshipped there was no telling what benefits might result from their interposition on your behalf for physical evils access to the shrine was like the grant of the use of a universal pill and ointment manufactory and pilgrimages thereto might suffice to cleanse the performers from any amount of sin a letter to lupus subsequently abbot of ferrara written while eginhard was smarting under the grief caused by the loss of his muchloved wife imma affords a striking insight into the current view of the relation between the glorified saints and their worshippers the writer shows that he is anything but satisfied with the way in which he has been treated by the blessed martyrs whose remains he has taken such pains to convey to seligenstadt and to honour there as they would never have been honoured in their roman obscurity      it is an aggravation of my grief and a reopening of my wound that our     vows have been of no avail and that the faith which we placed in the     merits and intervention of the martyrs has been utterly disappointed  we may admit then without impeachment of eginhards sincerity or of his honour under all ordinary circumstances that when piety selfinterest the glory of the church in general and that of the church at seligenstadt in particular all pulled one way 398 even the workaday principles of morality were disregarded and à fortiori anything like proper investigation of the reality of alleged miracles was thrown to the winds  and if this was the condition of mind of such a man as eginhard what is it not legitimate to suppose may have been that of deacon deusdona lunison hunus and company thieves and cheats by their own confession or of the probably hysterical nun or of the professional beggars for whose incapacity to walk and straighten themselves there is no guarantee but their own who is to make sure that the exorcist of the demon wiggo was not just such another priest as hunus and is it not at least possible when eginhards servants dreamed night after night in such a curiously coincident fashion that a careful inquirer might have found they were very anxious to please their master  quite apart from deliberate and conscious fraud which is a rarer thing than is often supposed people whose mythopoeic faculty is once stirred are capable of saying the thing that is not and of acting as they should not to an extent which is hardly imaginable by persons who are not so easily affected by the contagion of blind faith there is no falsity so gross that honest men and still more virtuous women anxious to promote a good cause will not lend themselves to it without any clear consciousness of the moral bearings of what they are doing  the cases of miraculouslyeffected cures of which eginhard is ocular witness appear to belong to classes 399 of disease in which malingering is possible or hysteria presumable without modern means of diagnosis the names given to them are quite worthless one miracle however in which the patient a woman was cured by the mere sight of the church in which the relics of the blessed martyrs lay is an unmistakable case of dislocation of the lower jaw and it is obvious that as not unfrequently happens in such accidents in weakly subjects the jaw slipped suddenly back into place perhaps in consequence of a jolt as the woman rode towards the church cap v 53102  there is also a good deal said about a very questionable blind manone albricus alberichwho having been cured not of his blindness but of another disease under which he laboured took up his quarters at seligenstadt and came out as a prophet inspired by the archangel gabriel eginhard intimates that his prophecies were fulfilled but as he does not state exactly what they were or how they were accomplished the statement must be accepted with much caution it is obvious that he was not the man to hesitate to ease a prophecy until it fitted if the credit of the shrine of his favourite saints could be increased by such a procedure there is no impeachment of his honour in the supposition the logic of the matter is quite simple if somewhat sophistical the holiness of the church of the martyrs guarantees 400 the reality of the appearance of the archangel gabriel there and what the archangel says must be true therefore if anything seem to be wrong that must be the mistake of the transmitter and in justice to the archangel it must be suppressed or set right this sort of reconciliation is not unknown in quite modern times and among people who would be very much shocked to be compared with a benighted papist of the ninth century  the readers of this essay are i imagine very largely composed of people who would be shocked to be regarded as anything but enlightened protestants it is not unlikely that those of them who have accompanied me thus far may be disposed to say well this is all very amusing as a story but what is the practical interest of it we are not likely to believe in the miracles worked by the spolia of ss marcellinus and petrus or by those of any other saints in the roman calendar  the practical interest is this if you do not believe in these miracles recounted by a witness whose character and competency are firmly established whose sincerity cannot be doubted and who appeals to his sovereign and other contemporaries as witnesses of the truth of what he says in a document of which a ms copy exists probably dating within a century of the authors death why do you profess to believe in stories of a like character which are found in documents of the dates and of the authorship of which nothing is certainly determined and no known copies of which come within two or three centuries of the 401 events they record if it be true that the four gospels and the acts were written by matthew mark luke and john all that we know of these persons comes to nothing in comparison with our knowledge of eginhard and not only is there no proof that the traditional authors of these works wrote them but very strong reasons to the contrary may be alleged if therefore you refuse to believe that wiggo was cast out of the possessed girl on eginhards authority with what justice can you profess to believe that the legion of devils were cast out of the man among the tombs of the gadarenes and if on the other hand you accept eginhards evidence why do you laugh at the supposed efficacy of relics and the saintworship of the modern romanists it cannot be pretended in the face of all evidence that the jews of the year 30 ad or thereabouts were less imbued with the belief in the supernatural than were the franks of the year 800 ad the same influences were at work in each case and it is only reasonable to suppose that the results were the same if the evidence of eginhard is insufficient to lead reasonable men to believe in the miracles he relates à fortiori the evidence afforded by the gospels and the acts must be so103  but it may be said that no serious critic denies the genuineness of the four great pauline epistlesgalatians first and second corinthians and 402 romansand that in three out of these four paul lays claim to the power of working miracles104 must we suppose therefore that the apostle to the gentiles has stated that which is false but to how much does this socalled claim amount it may mean much or little paul nowhere tells us what he did in this direction and in his sore need to justify his assumption of apostleship against the sneers of his enemies it is hardly likely that if he had any very striking cases to bring forward he would have neglected evidence so well calculated to put them to shame and without the slightest impeachment of pauls veracity we must further remember that his stronglymarked mental characteristics displayed in unmistakable fashion in these epistles are anything but those which would justify us in regarding him as a critical witness respecting matters of fact or as a trustworthy interpreter of their significance when a man testifies to a miracle he not only states a fact but he adds an interpretation of the fact we may admit his evidence as to the former and yet think his opinion as to the latter worthless if eginhards calm and objective narrative of the historical events of his time is no guarantee for the soundness of his judgment where the supernatural is concerned the heated rhetoric of the apostle of the gentiles his absolute confidence in the inner light and the extraordinary conceptions of the nature and requirements of logical proof which he betrays in page after page of his epistles afford still less security  403  there is a comparatively modern man who shared to the full pauls trust in the inner light and who though widely different from the fiery evangelist of tarsus in various obvious particulars yet if i am not mistaken shares his deepest characteristics i speak of george fox who separated himself from the current protestantism of england in the seventeenth century as paul separated himself from the judaism of the first century at the bidding of the inner light who went through persecutions as serious as those which paul enumerates who was beaten stoned cast out for dead imprisoned nine times sometimes for long periods who was in perils on land and perils at sea george fox was an even more widely travelled missionary while his success in founding congregations and his energy in visiting them not merely in great britain and ireland and the west india islands but on the continent of europe and that of north america was no less remarkable a few years after fox began to preach there were reckoned to be a thousand friends in prison in the various gaols of england at his death less than fifty years after the foundation of the sect there were 70000 quakers in the united kingdom the cheerfulness with which these peoplewomen as well as menunderwent martyrdom in this country and in the new england states is one of the most remarkable facts in the history of religion  no one who reads the voluminous autobiography of honest george can doubt the mans utter truthfulness and though in his multitudinous letters 404 he but rarely rises far above the incoherent commonplaces of a street preacher there can be no question of his power as a speaker nor any doubt as to the dignity and attractiveness of his personality or of his possession of a large amount of practical good sense and governing faculty  but that george fox had full faith in his own powers as a miracleworker the following passage of his autobiography to which others might be added demonstrates      now after i was set at liberty from nottingham gaol where i had been     kept a prisoner a pretty long time i travelled as before in the work     of the lord and coming to mansfield woodhouse there was a distracted     woman under a doctors hand with her hair let loose all about her     ears and he was about to let her blood she being first bound and     many people being about her holding her by violence but he could get     no blood from her and i desired them to unbind her and let her alone     for they could not touch the spirit in her by which she was tormented     so they did unbind her and i was moved to speak to her and in the     name of the lord to bid her be quiet and still and she was so and the     lords power settled her mind and she mended and afterwards received     the truth and continued in it to her death and the lords name was     honoured to whom the glory of all his works belongs many great and     wonderful things were wrought by the heavenly power in those days for     the lord made bare his omnipotent arm and manifested his power to the     astonishment of many by the healing virtue whereof many have been     delivered from great infirmities and the devils were made subject     through his name of which particular instances might be given beyond     what this unbelieving age is able to receive or bear105  it needs no long study of foxs writings however 405 to arrive at the conviction that the distinction between subjective and objective verities had not the same place in his mind as it has in that of ordinary mortals when an ordinary person would say i thought so and so or i made up my mind to do so and so george fox says it was opened to me or at the command of god i did so and so then at the command of god on the ninth day of the seventh month 1643 fox being just nineteen i left my relations and brake off all familiarity or friendship with young or old about the beginning of the year 1647 i was moved of the lord to go into darbyshire fox hears voices and he sees visions some of which he brings before the reader with apocalyptic power in the simple and strong english alike untutored and undefiled of which like john bunyan his contemporary he was a master  and one morning as i was sitting by the fire a great cloud came over me and a temptation beset me and i sate still and it was said all things come by nature and the elements and stars came over me so that i was in a manner quite clouded with it and as i sate still under it and let it alone a living hope arose in me and a true voice arose in me which said there is a living god who made all things and immediately the cloud and the temptation vanished away and life rose over it all and my heart was glad and i praised the living god p 13  if george fox could speak as he proves in this and some other passages he could write his 406 astounding influence on the contemporaries of milton and of cromwell is no mystery but this modern reproduction of the ancient prophet with his thus saith the lord this is the work of the lord steeped in supernaturalism and glorying in blind faith is the mental antipodes of the philosopher founded in naturalism and a fanatic for evidence to whom these affirmations inevitably suggest the previous question how do you know that the lord saith it how do you know that the lord doeth it and who is compelled to demand that rational ground for belief without which to the man of science assent is merely an immoral pretence  and it is this rational ground of belief which the writers of the gospels no less than paul and eginhard and fox so little dream of offering that they would regard the demand for it as a kind of blasphemy                                        407  xi  agnosticism a rejoinder  those who passed from dr waces article in the last number of this review to the anticipatory confutation of it which followed in the new reformation must have enjoyed the pleasure of a dramatic surprisejust as when the fifth act of a new play proves unexpectedly bright and interesting mrs ward will i hope pardon the comparison if i say that her effective clearing away of antiquated incumbrances from the lists of the controversy reminds me of nothing so much as of the action of some neathanded but strongwristed phyllis who gracefully wielding her longhandled turks head sweeps away the accumulated results of the toil of generations of spiders i am the more indebted to this luminous sketch of the results of critical investigation as it is carried out among those theologians who are men of science and not mere counsel for creeds since it has relieved me from the necessity of dealing with the greater part of dr waces polemic and enables me to devote more space to the really important issues which have been raised106  408  perhaps however it may be well for me to observe that approbation of the manner in which a great biblical scholar for instance reuss does his work does not commit me to the adoption of all or indeed any of his views and further that the disagreements of a series of investigators do not in any way interfere with the fact that each of them has made important contributions to the body of truth ultimately established if i cite buffon linnæus lamarck and cuvier as having each and all taken a leading share in building up modern biology the statement that every one of these great naturalists disagreed with and even more or less contradicted all the rest is quite true but the supposition that the latter assertion is in any way inconsistent with the former would betray a strange ignorance of the manner in which all true science advances  dr wace takes a great deal of trouble to make it appear that i have desired to evade the real questions raised by his attack upon me at the church congress i assure the reverend principal that in this as in some other respects he has entertained a very erroneous conception of my intentions things would assume more accurate proportions in dr waces mind if he would kindly remember that it is just thirty years since ecclesiastical thunderbolts 409 began to fly about my ears i have had the lion and the bear to deal with and it is long since i got quite used to the threatenings of episcopal goliaths whose croziers were like unto a weavers beam so that i almost think i might not have noticed dr waces attack personal as it was and although as he is good enough to tell us separate copies are to be had for the modest equivalent of twopence as a matter of fact it did not come under my notice for a long time after it was made may i further venture to point out that reckoning postage the expenditure of twopencehalfpenny or at the most threepence would have enabled dr wace so far to comply with ordinary conventions as to direct my attention to the fact that he had attacked me before a meeting at which i was not present i really am not responsible for the five months neglect of which dr wace complains singularly enough the englishry who swarmed about the engadine during the three months that i was being brought back to life by the glorious air and perfect comfort of the maloja did not in my hearing say anything about the important events which had taken place at the church congress and i think i can venture to affirm that there was not a single copy of dr waces pamphlet in any of the hotel libraries which i rummaged in search of something more edifying than dull english or questionable french novels  and now having as i hope set myself right with the public as regards the sins of commission and 410 omission with which i have been charged i feel free to deal with matters to which time and type may be more profitably devoted  i believe that there is not a solitary argument i have used or that i am about to use which is original or has anything to do with the fact that i have been chiefly occupied with natural science they are all facts and reasoning alike either identical with or consequential upon propositions which are to be found in the works of scholars and theologians of the highest repute in the only two countries holland and germany107 in which at the present time professors of theology are to be found whose tenure of their posts does not depend upon the results to which their inquiries lead them108 it is true that to the best of my ability i have satisfied myself of the soundness of the foundations on which my arguments are built and i desire to be held fully 411 responsible for everything i say but nevertheless my position is really no more than that of an expositor and my justification for undertaking it is simply that conviction of the supremacy of private judgment indeed of the impossibility of escaping it which is the foundation of the protestant reformation and which was the doctrine accepted by the vast majority of the anglicans of my youth before that backsliding towards the beggarly rudiments of an effete and idolatrous sacerdotalism which has even now provided us with the saddest spectacle which has been offered to the eyes of englishmen in this generation a high court of ecclesiastical jurisdiction with a host of great lawyers in battle array is and for heaven knows how long will be occupied with these very questions of washing of cups and pots and brazen vessels which the master whose professed representatives are rending the church over these squabbles had in his mind when as we are told he uttered the scathing rebuke    well did isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites as it is written         this people honoureth me with their lips         but their heart is far from me         but in vain do they worship me         teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men    mark vii 67  men who can be absorbed in bickerings over miserable disputes of this kind can have but little sympathy with the old evangelical doctrine of the open bible or anything but a grave misgiving of the results of diligent reading of the bible without the 412 help of ecclesiastical spectacles by the mass of the people greatly to the surprise of many of my friends i have always advocated the reading of the bible and the diffusion of the study of that most remarkable collection of books among the people its teachings are so infinitely superior to those of the sects who are just as busy now as the pharisees were eighteen hundred years ago in smothering them under the precepts of men it is so certain to my mind that the bible contains within itself the refutation of ninetenths of the mixture of sophistical metaphysics and oldworld superstition which has been piled round it by the socalled christians of later times it is so clear that the only immediate and ready antidote to the poison which has been mixed with christianity to the intoxication and delusion of mankind lies in copious draughts from the undefiled spring that i exercise the right and duty of free judgment on the part of every man mainly for the purpose of inducing other laymen to follow my example if the new testament is translated into zulu by protestant missionaries it must be assumed that a zulu convert is competent to draw from its contents all the truths which it is necessary for him to believe i trust that i may without immodesty claim to be put on the same footing as the zulu  the most constant reproach which is launched against persons of my way of thinking is that it is all very well for us to talk about the deductions of scientific thought but what are the poor and the 413 uneducated to do has it ever occurred to those who talk in this fashion that their creeds and the articles of their several confessions their determination of the exact nature and extent of the teachings of jesus their expositions of the real meaning of that which is written in the epistles to leave aside all questions concerning the old testament are nothing more than deductions which at any rate profess to be the result of strictly scientific thinking and which are not worth attending to unless they really possess that character if it is not historically true that such and such things happened in palestine eighteen centuries ago what becomes of christianity and what is historical truth but that of which the evidence bears strict scientific investigation i do not call to mind any problem of natural science which has come under my notice which is more difficult or more curiously interesting as a mere problem than that of the origin of the synoptic gospels and that of the historical value of the narratives which they contain the christianity of the churches stands or falls by the results of the purely scientific investigation of these questions they were first taken up in a purely scientific spirit just about a century ago they have been studied over and over again by men of vast knowledge and critical acumen but he would be a rash man who should assert that any solution of these problems as yet formulated is exhaustive the most that can be said is that certain prevalent solutions are certainly false while others are more or less probably true 414  if i am doing my best to rouse my countrymen out of their dogmatic slumbers it is not that they may be amused by seeing who gets the best of it in a contest between a scientist and a theologian the serious question is whether theological men of science or theological special pleaders are to have the confidence of the general public it is the question whether a country in which it is possible for a body of excellent clerical and lay gentlemen to discuss in public meeting assembled how much it is desirable to let the congregations of the faithful know of the results of biblical criticism is likely to wake up with anything short of the grasp of a rough lay hand upon its shoulder it is the question whether the new testament books being as i believe they were written and compiled by people who according to their lights were perfectly sincere will not when properly studied as ordinary historical documents afford us the means of selfcriticism and it must be remembered that the new testament books are not responsible for the doctrine invented by the churches that they are anything but ordinary historical documents the author of the third gospel tells us as straightforwardly as a man can that he has no claim to any other character than that of an ordinary compiler and editor who had before him the works of many and variously qualified predecessors    in my former papers according to dr wace i have evaded giving an answer to his main proposition which he states as follows 415      apart from all disputed points of criticism no one practically doubts     that our lord lived and that he died on the cross in the most intense     sense of filial relation to his father in heaven and that he bore     testimony to that fathers providence love and grace towards mankind     the lords prayer affords a sufficient evidence on these points if the     sermon on the mount alone be added the whole unseen world of which     the agnostic refuses to know anything stands unveiled before us if     jesus christ preached that sermon made those promises and taught that     prayer then any one who says that we know nothing of god or of a     future life or of an unseen world says that he does not believe jesus     christ pp 354355  again      the main question at issue in a word is one which professor huxley     has chosen to leave entirely on one sidewhether namely allowing for     the utmost uncertainty on other points of the criticism to which he     appeals there is any reasonable doubt that the lords prayer and the     sermon on the mount afford a true account of our lords essential     belief and cardinal teaching p 355  i certainly was not aware that i had evaded the questions here stated indeed i should say that i have indicated my reply to them pretty clearly but as dr wace wants a plainer answer he shall certainly be gratified if as dr wace declares it is his whole case is involved in the argument as stated in the latter of these two extracts so much the worse for his whole case for i am of opinion that there is the gravest reason for doubting whether the sermon on the mount was ever preached and whether the socalled lords prayer was ever prayed by jesus of nazareth my reasons for this opinion are among others thesethere is now no doubt that the three synoptic gospels so far from being the work of three 416 independent writers are closely interdependent109 and that in one of two ways either all three contain as their foundation versions to a large extent verbally identical of one and the same tradition or two of them are thus closely dependent on the third and the opinion of the majority of the best critics has of late years more and more converged towards the conviction that our canonical second gospel the socalled marks gospel is that which most closely represents the primitive groundwork of the three110 that i take to be one of the most valid results of new testament criticism of immeasurably greater importance than the discussion about dates and authorship  but if as i believe to be the case beyond any rational doubt or dispute the second gospel is the nearest extant representative of the oldest tradition 417 whether written or oral how comes it that it contains neither the sermon on the mount nor the lords prayer those typical embodiments according to dr wace of the essential belief and cardinal teaching of jesus not only does marks gospel fail to contain the sermon on the mount or anything but a very few of the sayings contained in that collection but at the point of the history of jesus where the sermon occurs in matthew there is in mark an apparently unbroken narrative from the calling of james and john to the healing of simons wifes mother thus the oldest tradition not only ignores the sermon on the mount but by implication raises a probability against its being delivered when and where the later matthew inserts it in his compilation  and still more weighty is the fact that the third gospel the author of which tells us that he wrote after many others had taken in hand the same enterprise who should therefore have known the first gospel if it existed and was bound to pay to it the deference due to the work of an apostolic eyewitness if he had any reason for thinking it was sothis writer who exhibits far more literary competence than the other two ignores any sermon on the mount such as that reported by matthew just as much as the oldest authority does yet luke has a great many passages identical or parallel with those in matthews sermon on the mount which are for the most part scattered about in a totally different connection 418  interposed however between the nomination of the apostles and a visit to capernaum occupying therefore a place which answers to that of the sermon on the mount in the first gospel there is in the third gospel a discourse which is as closely similar to the sermon on the mount in some particulars as it is widely unlike it in others  this discourse is said to have been delivered in a plain or level place luke vi 17 and by way of distinction we may call it the sermon on the plain  i see no reason to doubt that the two evangelists are dealing to a considerable extent with the same traditional material and a comparison of the two sermons suggests very strongly that lukes version is the earlier the correspondences between the two forbid the notion that they are independent they both begin with a series of blessings some of which are almost verbally identical in the middle of each luke vi 2738 matt v 4348 there is a striking exposition of the ethical spirit of the command given in leviticus xix 18 and each ends with a passage containing the declaration that a tree is to be known by its fruit and the parable of the house built on the sand but while there are only 29 verses in the sermon on the plain there are 107 in the sermon on the mount the excess in length of the latter being chiefly due to the long interpolations one of 30 verses before and one of 34 verses after the middlemost parallelism with luke under these circumstances it is quite impossible to 419 admit that there is more probability that matthews version of the sermon is historically accurate than there is that lukes version is so and they cannot both be accurate  luke either knew the collection of looselyconnected and aphoristic utterances which appear under the name of the sermon on the mount in matthew or he did not if he did not he must have been ignorant of the existence of such a document as our canonical matthew a fact which does not make for the genuineness or the authority of that book if he did he has shown that he does not care for its authority on a matter of fact of no small importance and that does not permit us to conceive that he believed the first gospel to be the work of an authority to whom he ought to defer let alone that of an apostolic eyewitness  the tradition of the church about the second gospel which i believe to be quite worthless but which is all the evidence there is for marks authorship would have us believe that mark was little more than the mouthpiece of the apostle peter consequently we are to suppose that peter either did not know or did not care very much for that account of the essential belief and cardinal teaching of jesus which is contained in the sermon on the mount and certainly he could not have shared dr waces view of its importance111  420  i thought that all fairly attentive and intelligent students of the gospels to say nothing of theologians of reputation knew these things but how can any one who does know them have the conscience to ask whether there is any reasonable doubt that the sermon on the mount was preached by jesus of nazareth if conjecture is permissible where nothing else is possible the most probable conjecture seems to be that matthew having a cento of sayings attributedrightly or wrongly it is impossible to sayto jesus among his materials thought they were or might be records of a continuous discourse and put them in at the place he thought likeliest ancient historians of the highest character saw no harm in composing long speeches which never were spoken and putting them into the mouths of statesmen and warriors and i presume that whoever is represented by matthew would have been grievously astonished to find that any one objected to his following the example of the best models accessible to him  so with the lords prayer absent in our representative of the oldest tradition it appears in both matthew and luke there is reason to believe that every pious jew at the commencement of our era prayed three times a day according to a formula which is embodied in the present schmoneesre112 of 421 the jewish prayerbook jesus who was assuredly in all respects a pious jew whatever else he may have been doubtless did the same whether he modified the current formula or whether the socalled lords prayer is the prayer substituted for the schmoneesre in the congregations of the gentiles is a question which can hardly be answered  in a subsequent passage of dr waces article p 356 he adds to the list of the verities which he imagines to be unassailable the story of the passion i am not quite sure what he means by this i am not aware that any one with the exception of certain ancient heretics has propounded doubts as to the reality of the crucifixion and certainly i have no inclination to argue about the precise accuracy of every detail of that pathetic story of suffering and wrong but if dr wace means as i suppose he does that that which according to the orthodox view happened after the crucifixion and which is in a dogmatic sense the most important part of the story is founded on solid historical proofs i must beg leave to express a diametrically opposite conviction  what do we find when the accounts of the events in question contained in the three synoptic gospels are compared together in the oldest there is a simple straightforward statement which for anything that i have to urge to the contrary may be exactly true in the other two there is round this possible and probable nucleus a mass of accretions of the most questionable character 422  the cruelty of death by crucifixion depended very much upon its lingering character if there were a support for the weight of the body as not unfrequently was the practice the pain during the first hours of the infliction was not necessarily extreme nor need any serious physical symptoms at once arise from the wounds made by the nails in the hands and feet supposing they were nailed which was not invariably the case when exhaustion set in and hunger thirst and nervous irritation had done their work the agony of the sufferer must have been terrible and the more terrible that in the absence of any effectual disturbance of the machinery of physical life it might be prolonged for many hours or even days temperate strong men such as were the ordinary galilean peasants might live for several days on the cross it is necessary to bear these facts in mind when we read the account contained in the fifteenth chapter of the second gospel  jesus was crucified at the third hour xv 25 and the narrative seems to imply that he died immediately after the ninth hour v 34 in this case he would have been crucified only six hours and the time spent on the cross cannot have been much longer because joseph of arimathæa must have gone to pilate made his preparations and deposited the body in the rockcut tomb before sunset which at that time of the year was about the twelfth hour that any one should die after only six hours crucifixion could not have been at all in accordance with pilates large experience of the effects of that method of 423 punishment it therefore quite agrees with what might be expected if pilate marvelled if he were already dead and required to be satisfied on this point by the testimony of the roman officer who was in command of the execution party those who have paid attention to the extraordinarily difficult question what are the indisputable signs of deathwill be able to estimate the value of the opinion of a rough soldier on such a subject even if his report to the procurator were in no wise affected by the fact that the friend of jesus who anxiously awaited his answer was a man of influence and of wealth  the inanimate body wrapped in linen was deposited in a spacious113 cool rock chamber the entrance of which was closed not by a wellfitting door but by a stone rolled against the opening which would of course allow free passage of air a little more than thirtysix hours afterwards friday 6 pm to sunday 6 am or a little after three women visit the tomb and find it empty and they are told by a young man arrayed in a white robe that jesus is gone to his native country of galilee and that the disciples and peter will find him there  thus it stands plainly recorded in the oldest tradition that for any evidence to the contrary the sepulchre may have been vacated at any time during the friday or saturday nights if it is said that no jew would have violated the sabbath by taking the former course it is to be recollected that joseph of 424 arimathæa might well be familiar with that wise and liberal interpretation of the fourth commandment which permitted works of mercy to mennay even the drawing of an ox or an ass out of a piton the sabbath at any rate the saturday night was free to the most scrupulous of observers of the law  these are the facts of the case as stated by the oldest extant narrative of them i do not see why any one should have a word to say against the inherent probability of that narrative and for my part i am quite ready to accept it as an historical fact that so much and no more is positively known of the end of jesus of nazareth on what grounds can a reasonable man be asked to believe any more so far as the narrative in the first gospel on the one hand and those in the third gospel and the acts on the other go beyond what is stated in the second gospel they are hopelessly discrepant with one another and this is the more significant because the pregnant phrase some doubted in the first gospel is ignored in the third  but it is said that we have the witness paul speaking to us directly in the epistles there is little doubt that we have and a very singular witness he is according to his own showing paul in the vigour of his manhood with every means of becoming acquainted at first hand with the evidence of eyewitnesses not merely refused to credit them but persecuted the church of god and made havoc of it the reasoning of stephen fell dead upon the acute intellect of this zealot for the traditions of 425 his fathers his eyes were blind to the ecstatic illumination of the martyrs countenance as it had been the face of an angel and when at the words behold i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of god the murderous mob rushed upon and stoned the rapt disciple of jesus paul ostentatiously made himself their official accomplice  yet this strange man because he has a vision one day at once and with equally headlong zeal flies to the opposite pole of opinion and he is most careful to tell us that he abstained from any reexamination of the facts      immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood neither went i up to     jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went away into     arabia galatians i 16 17  i do not presume to quarrel with pauls procedure if it satisfied him that was his affair and if it satisfies any else i am not called upon to dispute the right of that person to be satisfied but i certainly have the right to say that it would not satisfy me in like case that i should be very much ashamed to pretend that it could or ought to satisfy me and that i can entertain but a very low estimate of the value of the evidence of people who are to be satisfied in this fashion when questions of objective fact in which their faith is interested are concerned so that when i am called upon to believe a great deal more than the oldest gospel tells me about the final events of the history of jesus on the authority of paul 1 corinthians xv 58 i must pause did he think it 426 at any subsequent time worth while to confer with flesh and blood or in modern phrase to reexamine the facts for himself or was he ready to accept anything that fitted in with his preconceived ideas does he mean when he speaks of all the appearances of jesus after the crucifixion as if they were of the same kind that they were all visions like the manifestation to himself and finally how is this account to be reconciled with those in the first and third gospelswhich as we have seen disagree with one another  until these questions are satisfactorily answered i am afraid that so far as i am concerned pauls testimony cannot be seriously regarded except as it may afford evidence of the state of traditional opinion at the time at which he wrote say between 55 and 60 ad that is more than twenty years after the event a period much more than sufficient for the development of any amount of mythology about matters of which nothing was really known a few years later among the contemporaries and neighbours of the jews and if the most probable interpretation of the apocalypse can be trusted among the followers of jesus also it was fully believed in spite of all the evidence to the contrary that the emperor nero was not really dead but that he was hidden away somewhere in the east and would speedily come again at the head of a great army to be revenged upon his enemies114  thus i conceive that i have shown cause for the 427 opinion that dr waces challenge touching the sermon on the mount the lords prayer and the passion was more valorous than discreet after all this discussion i am still at the agnostic point tell me first what jesus can be proved to have been said and done and i will say whether i believe him or in him115 or not as dr wace admits that i have dissipated his lingering shade of unbelief about the bedevilment of the gadarene pigs he might have done something to help mine instead of that he manifests a total want of conception of the nature of the obstacles which impede the conversion of his infidels  the truth i believe to be that the difficulties in the way of arriving at a sure conclusion as to these matters from the sermon on the mount the lords prayer or any other data offered by the synoptic gospels and à fortiori from the fourth gospel are insuperable every one of these records is coloured by the prepossessions of those among whom the primitive traditions arose and of those by whom they were collected and edited and the difficulty of making allowance for these prepossessions is enhanced by our ignorance of the exact dates at which the documents were first put together of the extent to 428 which they have been subsequently worked over and interpolated and of the historical sense or want of sense and the dogmatic tendencies of their compilers and editors let us see if there is any other road which will take us into something better than negation  there is a widespread notion that the primitive church while under the guidance of the apostles and their immediate successors was a sort of dogmatic dovecot pervaded by the most loving unity and doctrinal harmony protestants especially are fond of attributing to themselves the merit of being nearer the church of the apostles than their neighbours and they are the less to be excused for their strange delusion because they are great readers of the documents which prove the exact contrary the fact is that in the course of the first three centuries of its existence the church rapidly underwent a process of evolution of the most remarkable character the final stage of which is far more different from the first than anglicanism is from quakerism the key to the comprehension of the problem of the origin of that which is now called christianity and its relation to jesus of nazareth lies here nor can we arrive at any sound conclusion as to what it is probable that jesus actually said and did without being clear on this head by far the most important and subsequently influential steps in the evolution of christianity took place in the course of the century more or less which followed upon the crucifixion it is almost the darkest period of church 429 history but most fortunately the beginning and the end of the period are brightly illuminated by the contemporary evidence of two writers of whose historical existence there is no doubt116 and against the genuineness of whose most important works there is no widelyadmitted objection these are justin the philosopher and martyr and paul the apostle to the gentiles i shall call upon these witnesses only to testify to the condition of opinion among those who called themselves disciples of jesus in their time  justin in his dialogue with trypho the jew which was written somewhere about the middle of the second century enumerates certain categories of persons who in his opinion will or will not be saved117 these are  1 orthodox jews who refuse to believe that jesus is the christ not saved  2 jews who observe the law believe jesus to be the christ but who insist on the observance of the law by gentile converts not saved  3 jews who observe the law believe jesus to be the christ and hold that gentile converts need not observe the law saved in justins opinion but some of his fellowchristians think the contrary  4 gentile converts to the belief in jesus as the christ who observe the law saved possibly  5 gentile believers in jesus as the christ who do 430 not observe the law themselves except so far as the refusal of idol sacrifices but do not consider those who do observe it heretics saved this is justins own view  6 gentile believers who do not observe the law except in refusing idol sacrifices and hold those who do observe it to be heretics saved  7 gentiles who believe jesus to be the christ and call themselves christians but who eat meats sacrificed to idols not saved  8 gentiles who disbelieve in jesus as the christ not saved  justin does not consider christians who believe in the natural birth of jesus of whom he implies that there is a respectable minority to be heretics though he himself strongly holds the preternatural birth of jesus and his preexistence as the logos or word he conceives the logos to be a second god inferior to the first unknowable god with respect to whom justin like philo is a complete agnostic the holy spirit is not regarded by justin as a separate personality and is often mixed up with the logos the doctrine of the natural immortality of the soul is for justin a heresy and he is as firm a believer in the resurrection of the body as in the speedy second coming and establishment of the millennium  this pillar of the church in the middle of the second centurya muchtravelled native of samariawas certainly well acquainted with rome probably with alexandria and it is likely that he knew 431 the state of opinion throughout the length and breadth of the christian world as well as any man of his time if the various categories above enumerated are arranged in a series thus                        justins christianity                        \     orthodox  judæochristianity          idolothytic     judaism    \                 christianity    paganism        i       ii   iii  iv     v   vi     vii              viii  it is obvious that they form a gradational series from orthodox judaism on the extreme left to paganism whether philosophic or popular on the extreme right and it will further be observed that while justins conception of christianity is very broad he rigorously excludes two classes of persons who in his time called themselves christians namely those who insist on circumcision and other observances of the law on the part of gentile converts that is to say the strict judæochristians ii and on the other hand those who assert the lawfulness of eating meat offered to idolswhether they are gnostic or not vii these last i have called idolothytic christians because i cannot devise a better name not because it is strictly defensible etymologically  at the present moment i do not suppose there is an english missionary in any heathen land who would trouble himself whether the materials of his dinner had been previously offered to idols or not on the other hand i suppose there is no protestant sect within the pale of orthodoxy to say nothing of the roman and greek churches which would hesitate to declare the practice of circumcision and the 432 observance of the jewish sabbath and dietary rules shockingly heretical  modern christianity has in fact not only shifted far to the right of justins position but it is of much narrower compass                                justin                       \                judæochristianity       modern christianity  paganism     judaism   \         \          i      ii    iii     iv   v  vi       vii        viii  for though it includes vii and even in saint and relic worship cuts a monstrous cantle out of paganism it excludes not only all judæochristians but all who doubt that such are heretics ever since the thirteenth century the inquisition would have cheerfully burned and in spain did abundantly burn all persons who came under the categories ii iii iv v and the wolf would play the same havoc now if it could only get its bloodstained jaws free from the muzzle imposed by the secular arm  further there is not a protestant body except the unitarian which would not declare justin himself a heretic on account of his doctrine of the inferior godship of the logos while i am very much afraid that in strict logic dr wace would be under the necessity so painful to him of calling him an infidel on the same and on other grounds  now let us turn to our other authority if there is any result of critical investigations of the sources of christianity which is certain118 it is that paul of 433 tarsus wrote the epistle to the galatians somewhere between the years 55 and 60 ad that is to say roughly twenty or fiveandtwenty years after the crucifixion if this is so the epistle to the galatians is one of the oldest if not the very oldest of extant documentary evidences of the state of the primitive church and be it observed if it is pauls writing it unquestionably furnishes us with the evidence of a participator in the transactions narrated with the exception of two or three of the other pauline epistles there is not one solitary book in the new testament of the authorship and authority of which we have such good evidence  and what is the state of things we find disclosed a bitter quarrel in his account of which paul by no means minces matters or hesitates to hurl defiant sarcasms against those who were reputed to be pillars james the brother of the lord peter the rock on whom jesus is said to have built his church and john the beloved disciple and no deference toward the rock withholds paul from charging peter to his face with dissimulation  the subject of the hot dispute was simply this were gentile converts bound to obey the law or not paul answered in the negative and acting upon his opinion had created at antioch and elsewhere a specifically christian community the sole qualifications for admission into which were the confession of the belief that jesus was the messiah and baptism upon that confession in the epistle in question paul puts thishis gospel as he calls 434 itin its most extreme form not only does he deny the necessity of conformity with the law but he declares such conformity to have a negative value behold i paul say unto you that if ye receive circumcision christ will profit you nothing galatians v 2 he calls the legal observances beggarly rudiments and anathematises every one who preaches to the galatians any other gospel than his own that is to say by direct consequence he anathematises the nazarenes of jerusalem whose zeal for the law is testified by james in a passage of the acts cited further on in the first epistle to the corinthians dealing with the question of eating meat offered to idols it is clear that paul himself thinks it a matter of indifference but he advises that it should not be done for the sake of the weaker brethren on the other hand the nazarenes of jerusalem most strenuously opposed pauls gospel insisting on every convert becoming a regular jewish proselyte and consequently on his observance of the whole law and this party was led by james and peter and john galatians ii 9 paul does not suggest that the question of principle was settled by the discussion referred to in galatians all he says is that it ended in the practical agreement that he and barnabas should do as they had been doing in respect to the gentiles while james and peter and john should deal in their own fashion with jewish converts afterwards he complains bitterly of peter because when on a visit to antioch he at first inclined to pauls view and ate with the gentile converts but when certain came from james 435 drew back and separated himself fearing them that were of the circumcision and the rest of the jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that even barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation galatians ii 1213  there is but one conclusion to be drawn from pauls account of this famous dispute the settlement of which determined the fortunes of the nascent religion it is that the disciples at jerusalem headed by james the lords brother and by the leading apostles peter and john were strict jews who had objected to admit any converts into their body unless these either by birth or by becoming proselytes were also strict jews in fact the sole difference between james and peter and john with the body of the disciples whom they led and the jews by whom they were surrounded and with whom they for many years shared the religious observances of the temple was that they believed that the messiah whom the leaders of the nation yet looked for had already come in the person of jesus of nazareth  the acts of the apostles is hardly a very trustworthy history it is certainly of later date than the pauline epistles supposing them to be genuine and the writers version of the conference of which paul gives so graphic a description if that is correct is unmistakably coloured with all the art of a reconciler anxious to cover up a scandal but it is none the less instructive on this account the judgment of the council delivered by james is that the gentile converts shall merely abstain from things 436 sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication but notwithstanding the accommodation in which the writer of the acts would have us believe the jerusalem church held to its endeavour to retain the observance of the law long after the conference some time after the writing of the epistles to the galatians and corinthians and immediately after the despatch of that to the romans paul makes his last visit to jerusalem and presents himself to james and all the elders and this is what the acts tells us of the interview      and they said unto him thou seest brother how many thousands or     myriads there are among the jews of them which have believed and they     are all zealous for the law and they have been informed concerning     thee that thou teachest all the jews which are among the gentiles to     forsake moses telling them not to circumcise their children neither     to walk after the customs acts xxi 20 21  they therefore request that he should perform a certain public religious act in the temple in order that      all shall know that there is no truth in the things whereof they have     been informed concerning thee but that thou thyself walkest orderly     keeping the law ibid 24119  how far paul could do what he is here requested to do and which the writer of the acts goes on to say he did with a clear conscience if he wrote the epistles to the galatians and corinthians i may leave any candid reader of these epistles to decide the 437 point to which i wish to direct attention is the declaration that the jerusalem church led by the brother of jesus and by his personal disciples and friends twenty years and more after his death consisted of strict and zealous jews  tertullus the orator caring very little about the internal dissensions of the followers of jesus speaks of paul as a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes acts xxiv 5 which must have affected james much in the same way as it would have moved the archbishop of canterbury in george foxs day to hear the latter called a ringleader of the sect of anglicans in fact nazarene was as is well known the distinctive appellation applied to jesus his immediate followers were known as nazarenes while the congregation of the disciples and later of converts at jerusalemthe jerusalem churchwas emphatically the sect of the nazarenes no more in itself to be regarded as anything outside judaism than the sect of the sadducees or of the essenes120 in fact the tenets of both the sadducees and the essenes diverged much more widely from the pharisaic standard of orthodoxy than nazarenism did  let us consider the position of affairs now ad 5060 in relation to that which obtained in justins time a century later it is plain that the nazarenespresided over by james the brother of the lord and comprising within their body all the twelve 438 apostlesbelonged to justins second category of jews who observe the law believe jesus to be the christ but who insist on the observance of the law by gentile converts up till the time at which the controversy reported by paul arose they then according to paul simply allowed him to form his congregations of nonlegal gentile converts at antioch and elsewhere and it would seem that it was to these converts who would come under justins fifth category that the title of christian was first applied if any of these christians had acted upon the more than halfpermission given by paul and had eaten meats offered to idols they would have belonged to justins seventh category  hence it appears that if justins opinion which was probably that of the church generally in the middle of the second century was correct james and peter and john and their followers could not be saved neither could paul if he carried into practice his views as to the indifference of eating meats offered to idols or to put the matter another way the centre of gravity of orthodoxy which is at the extreme right of the series in the nineteenth century was at the extreme left just before the middle of the first century when the sect of the nazarenes constituted the whole church founded by jesus and the apostles while in the time of justin it lay midway between the two it is therefore a profound mistake to imagine that the judæochristians nazarenes and ebionites of later times were heretical outgrowths from a primitive universalist christianity on the 439 contrary the universalist christianity is an outgrowth from the primitive purely jewish nazarenism which gradually eliminating all the ceremonial and dietary parts of the jewish law has thrust aside its parent and all the intermediate stages of its development into the position of damnable heresies  such being the case we are in a position to form a safe judgment of the limits within which the teaching of jesus of nazareth must have been confined ecclesiastical authority would have us believe that the words which are given at the end of the first gospel go ye therefore and make disciples of all the nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost are part of the last commands of jesus issued at the moment of his parting with the eleven if so peter and john must have heard these words they are too plain to be misunderstood and the occasion is too solemn for them ever to be forgotten yet the acts tell us that peter needed a vision to enable him so much as to baptize cornelius and paul in the galatians knows nothing of words which would have completely borne him out as against those who though they heard must be supposed to have either forgotten or ignored them on the other hand peter and john who are supposed to have heard the sermon on the mount know nothing of the saying that jesus had not come to destroy the law but that every jot and tittle of the law must be fulfilled which surely would have been pretty good evidence for their view of the question 440  we are sometimes told that the personal friends and daily companions of jesus remained zealous jews and opposed pauls innovations because they were hard of heart and dull of comprehension this hypothesis is hardly in accordance with the concomitant faith of those who adopt it in the miraculous insight and superhuman sagacity of their master nor do i see any way of getting it to harmonise with the orthodox postulate namely that matthew was the author of the first gospel and john of the fourth if that is so then most assuredly matthew was no dullard and as for the fourth gospela theosophic romance of the first orderit could have been written by none but a man of remarkable literary capacity who had drunk deep of alexandrian philosophy moreover the doctrine of the writer of the fourth gospel is more remote from that of the sect of the nazarenes than is that of paul himself i am quite aware that orthodox critics have been capable of maintaining that john the nazarene who was probably well past fifty years of age when he is supposed to have written the most thoroughly judaising book in the new testamentthe apocalypsein the roughest of greek underwent an astounding metamorphosis of both doctrine and style by the time he reached the ripe age of ninety or so and provided the world with a history in which the acutest critic cannot always make out where the speeches of jesus end and the text of the narrative begins while that narrative is utterly irreconcilable in regard to matters of fact with that of his fellowapostle matthew 441  the end of the whole matter is thisthe sect of the nazarenes the brother and the immediate followers of jesus commissioned by him as apostles and those who were taught by them up to the year 50 ad were not christians in the sense in which that term has been understood ever since its asserted origin at antioch but jewsstrict orthodox jewswhose belief in the messiahship of jesus never led to their exclusion from the temple services nor would have shut them out from the wide embrace of judaism121 the open proclamation of their special view about the messiah was doubtless offensive to the pharisees just as rampant low churchism is offensive to bigoted high churchism in our own country or as any kind of dissent is offensive to fervid religionists of all creeds to the sadducees no doubt the political danger of any messianic movement was serious and they would have been glad to put down nazarenism lest it should end in useless rebellion against their roman masters like that other galilean movement headed by judas a generation earlier galilee was always a hotbed of seditious enthusiasm against the rule of rome and high priest and procurator alike had need to keep a sharp eye upon natives of that district on the whole however the nazarenes were but little troubled for the first twenty years of their existence and the undying hatred of the jews against those later 442 converts whom they regarded as apostates and fautors of a sham judaism was awakened by paul from their point of view he was a mere renegade jew opposed alike to orthodox judaism and to orthodox nazarenism and whose teachings threatened judaism with destruction and from their point of view they were quite right in the course of a century pauline influences had a large share in driving primitive nazarenism from being the very heart of the new faith into the position of scouted error and the spirit of pauls doctrine continued its work of driving christianity farther and farther away from judaism until meats offered to idols might be eaten without scruple while the nazarene methods of observing even the sabbath or the passover were branded with the mark of judaising heresy  but if the primitive nazarenes of whom the acts speaks were orthodox jews what sort of probability can there be that jesus was anything else how can he have founded the universal religion which was not heard of till twenty years after his death122 that jesus possessed in a rare degree the gift of attaching men to his person and to his fortunes that he was the author of many a striking saying and the advocate of equity of love and of humility that he may have disregarded the subtleties of the bigots for legal observance and appealed rather to those noble 443 conceptions of religion which constituted the pith and kernel of the teaching of the great prophets of his nation seven hundred years earlier and that in the last scenes of his career he may have embodied the ideal sufferer of isaiah may be as i think it is extremely probable but all this involves not a step beyond the borders of orthodox judaism again who is to say whether jesus proclaimed himself the veritable messiah expected by his nation since the appearance of the pseudoprophetic work of daniel a century and a half before his time or whether the enthusiasm of his followers gradually forced him to assume that position  but one thing is quite certain if that belief in the speedy second coming of the messiah which was shared by all parties in the primitive church whether nazarene or pauline which jesus is made to prophesy over and over again in the synoptic gospels and which dominated the life of christians during the first century after the crucifixionif he believed and taught that then assuredly he was under an illusion and he is responsible for that which the mere effluxion of time has demonstrated to be a prodigious error    when i ventured to doubt whether any protestant theologian who has a reputation to lose will say that he believes the gadarene story it appears that i reckoned without dr wace who referring to this passage in my paper says      he will judge whether i fall under his description but i repeat that i     believe it and that he has removed the only objection to my believing     it p 363  444  far be it from me to set myself up as a judge of any such delicate question as that put before me but i think i may venture to express the conviction that in the matter of courage dr wace has raised for himself a monument ære perennius for really in my poor judgment a certain splendid intrepidity such as one admires in the leader of a forlorn hope is manifested by dr wace when he solemnly affirms that he believes the gadarene story on the evidence offered i feel less complimented perhaps than i ought to do when i am told that i have been an accomplice in extinguishing in dr waces mind the last glimmer of doubt which common sense may have suggested in fact i must disclaim all responsibility for the use to which the information i supplied has been put i formally decline to admit that the expression of my ignorance whether devils in the existence of which i do not believe if they did exist might or might not be made to go out of men into pigs can as a matter of logic have been of any use whatever to a person who already believed in devils and in the historical accuracy of the gospels  of the gadarene story dr wace with all solemnity and twice over affirms that he believes it i am sorry to trouble him further but what does he mean by it because there are two stories one in mark and luke and the other in matthew in the former which i quoted in my previous paper there is one possessed man in the latter there are two the story is told fully with the vigorous homely diction and the 445 picturesque details of a piece of folklore in the second gospel the immediately antecedent event is the storm on the lake of gennesaret the immediately consequent events are the message from the ruler of the synagogue and the healing of the woman with an issue of blood in the third gospel the order of events is exactly the same and there is an extremely close general and verbal correspondence between the narratives of the miracle both agree in stating that there was only one possessed man and that he was the residence of many devils whose name was legion  in the first gospel the event which immediately precedes the gadarene affair is as before the storm the message from the ruler and the healing of the issue are separated from it by the accounts of the healing of a paralytic of the calling of matthew and of a discussion with some pharisees again while the second gospel speaks of the country of the gerasenes as the locality of the event the third gospel has gerasenes gergesenes and gadarenes in different ancient mss while the first has gadarenes  the really important points to be noticed however in the narrative of the first gospel are thesethat there are two possessed men instead of one and that while the story is abbreviated by omissions what there is of it is often verbally identical with the corresponding passages in the other two gospels the most unabashed of reconcilers cannot well say that one man is the same as two or two as one and 446 though the suggestion really has been made that two different miracles agreeing in all essential particulars except the number of the possessed were effected immediately after the storm on the lake i should be sorry to accuse any one of seriously adopting it nor will it be pretended that the allegory refuge is accessible in this particular case  so when dr wace says that he believes in the synoptic evangelists account of the miraculous bedevilment of swine i may fairly ask which of them does he believe does he hold by the one evangelists story or by that of the two evangelists and having made his election what reasons has he to give for his choice if it is suggested that the witness of two is to be taken against that of one not only is the testimony dealt with in that commonsense fashion against which the theologians of his school protest so warmly not only is all question of inspiration at an end but the further inquiry arises after all is it the testimony of two against one are the authors of the versions in the second and the third gospels really independent witnesses in order to answer this question it is only needful to place the english versions of the two side by side and compare them carefully it will then be seen that the coincidences between them not merely in substance but in arrangement and in the use of identical words in the same order are such that only two alternatives are conceivable either one evangelist freely copied from the other or both based themselves upon a common source which may either have been a written 447 document or a definite oral tradition learned by heart assuredly these two testimonies are not those of independent witnesses further when the narrative in the first gospel is compared with that in the other two the same fact comes out  supposing then that dr wace is right in his assumption that matthew mark and luke wrote the works which we find attributed to them by tradition what is the value of their agreement even that something more or less like this particular miracle occurred since it is demonstrable either that all depend on some antecedent statement of the authorship of which nothing is known or that two are dependent upon the third  dr wace says he believes the gadarene story whichever version of it he accepts therefore he believes that jesus said what he is stated in all the versions to have said and thereby virtually declared that the theory of the nature of the spiritual world involved in the story is true now i hold that this theory is false that it is a monstrous and mischievous fiction and i unhesitatingly express my disbelief in any assertion that it is true by whomsoever made so that if dr wace is right in his belief he is also quite right in classing me among the people he calls infidels and although i cannot fulfil the eccentric expectation that i shall glory in a title which from my point of view it would be simply silly to adopt i certainly shall rejoice not to be reckoned among christians so long as the profession of belief in such stories as the gadarene pig affair on the 448 strength of a tradition of unknown origin of which two discrepant reports also of unknown origin alone remain forms any part of the christian faith and although i have more than once repudiated the gift of prophecy yet i think i may venture to express the anticipation that if christians generally are going to follow the line taken by dr wace it will not be long before all men of common sense qualify for a place among the infidels                                        449  xii  agnosticism and christianity      nemo ergo ex me scire quærat quod me nescire scio nisi forte ut     nescire discataugustinus de civ dei xii 7  123the present discussion has arisen out of the use which has become general in the last few years of the terms agnostic and agnosticism  the people who call themselves agnostics have been charged with doing so because they have not the courage to declare themselves infidels it has been insinuated that they have adopted a new name in order to escape the unpleasantness which attaches to their proper denomination to this wholly erroneous imputation i have replied by showing that the term agnostic did as a matter of fact arise in a manner which negatives it and my statement has not been and cannot be refuted moreover speaking for myself and without impugning the right of any other person to use the term in another sense i further say that agnosticism 450 is not properly described as a negative creed nor indeed as a creed of any kind except in so far as it expresses absolute faith in the validity of a principle which is as much ethical as intellectual this principle may be stated in various ways but they all amount to this that it is wrong for a man to say that he is certain of the objective truth of any proposition unless he can produce evidence which logically justifies that certainty this is what agnosticism asserts and in my opinion it is all that is essential to agnosticism that which agnostics deny and repudiate as immoral is the contrary doctrine that there are propositions which men ought to believe without logically satisfactory evidence and that reprobation ought to attach to the profession of disbelief in such inadequately supported propositions the justification of the agnostic principle lies in the success which follows upon its application whether in the field of natural or in that of civil history and in the fact that so far as these topics are concerned no sane man thinks of denying its validity  still speaking for myself i add that though agnosticism is not and cannot be a creed except in so far as its general principle is concerned yet that the application of that principle results in the denial of or the suspension of judgment concerning a number of propositions respecting which our contemporary ecclesiastical gnostics profess entire certainty and in so far as these ecclesiastical persons can be justified in their oldestablished 451 custom which many nowadays think more honoured in the breach than the observance of using opprobrious names to those who differ from them i fully admit their right to call me and those who think with me infidels all i have ventured to urge is that they must not expect us to speak of ourselves by that title  the extent of the region of the uncertain the number of the problems the investigation of which ends in a verdict of not proven will vary according to the knowledge and the intellectual habits of the individual agnostic i do not very much care to speak of anything as unknowable what i am sure about is that there are many topics about which i know nothing and which so far as i can see are out of reach of my faculties but whether these things are knowable by any one else is exactly one of those matters which is beyond my knowledge though i may have a tolerably strong opinion as to the probabilities of the case relatively to myself i am quite sure that the region of uncertaintythe nebulous country in which words play the part of realitiesis far more extensive than i could wish materialism and idealism theism and atheism the doctrine of the soul and its mortality or immortalityappear in the history of philosophy like the shades of scandinavian heroes eternally slaying one another and eternally coming to life again in a metaphysical nifelheim it is getting on for twentyfive centuries at least since mankind began seriously to give their minds to these topics 452 generation after generation philosophy has been doomed to roll the stone uphill and just as all the world swore it was at the top down it has rolled to the bottom again all this is written in innumerable books and he who will toil through them will discover that the stone is just where it was when the work began hume saw this kant saw it since their time more and more eyes have been cleansed of the films which prevented them from seeing it until now the weight and number of those who refuse to be the prey of verbal mystifications has begun to tell in practical life  it was inevitable that a conflict should arise between agnosticism and theology or rather i ought to say between agnosticism and ecclesiasticism for theology the science is one thing and ecclesiasticism the championship of a foregone conclusion124 as to the truth of a particular form of theology is another with scientific theology agnosticism has no quarrel on the contrary the agnostic knowing too well the influence of prejudice and idiosyncrasy even on those who desire most earnestly to be impartial can wish for nothing more urgently than that the scientific theologian should not only be at perfect liberty to thresh out the matter in his own fashion but that he should if he can find flaws in the agnostic position and even if demonstration is not to be had that he should put in their full force the grounds of the conclusions he thinks probable the 453 scientific theologian admits the agnostic principle however widely his results may differ from those reached by the majority of agnostics  but as between agnosticism and ecclesiasticism or as our neighbours across the channel call it clericalism there can be neither peace nor truce the cleric asserts that it is morally wrong not to believe certain propositions whatever the results of a strict scientific investigation of the evidence of these propositions he tells us that religious error is in itself of an immoral nature125 he declares that he has prejudged certain conclusions and looks upon those who show cause for arrest of judgment as emissaries of satan it necessarily follows that for him the attainment of faith not the ascertainment of truth is the highest aim of mental life and on careful analysis of the nature of this faith it will too often be found to be not the mystic process of unity with the divine understood by the religious enthusiastbut that which the candid simplicity of a sunday scholar once defined it to be faith said this unconscious plagiarist of tertullian is the power of saying you believe things which are incredible  now i and many other agnostics believe that faith in this sense is an abomination and though we do not indulge in the luxury of selfrighteousness so far as to call those who are not of our way of thinking hard names we do feel that the disagreement between ourselves and those who hold this 454 doctrine is even more moral than intellectual it is desirable there should be an end of any mistakes on this topic if our clerical opponents were clearly aware of the real state of the case there would be an end of the curious delusion which often appears between the lines of their writings that those whom they are so fond of calling infidels are people who not only ought to be but in their hearts are ashamed of themselves it would be discourteous to do more than hint the antipodal opposition of this pleasant dream of theirs to facts  the clerics and their lay allies commonly tell us that if we refuse to admit that there is good ground for expressing definite convictions about certain topics the bonds of human society will dissolve and mankind lapse into savagery there are several answers to this assertion one is that the bonds of human society were formed without the aid of their theology and in the opinion of not a few competent judges have been weakened rather than strengthened by a good deal of it greek science greek art the ethics of old israel the social organisation of old rome contrived to come into being without the help of any one who believed in a single distinctive article of the simplest of the christian creeds the science the art the jurisprudence the chief political and social theories of the modern world have grown out of those of greece and romenot by favour of but in the teeth of the fundamental teachings of early christianity to which science art and any serious occupation with the things of this world were alike despicable 455  again all that is best in the ethics of the modern world in so far as it has not grown out of greek thought or barbarian manhood is the direct development of the ethics of old israel there is no code of legislation ancient or modern at once so just and so merciful so tender to the weak and poor as the jewish law and if the gospels are to be trusted jesus of nazareth himself declared that he taught nothing but that which lay implicitly or explicitly in the religious and ethical system of his people      and the scribe said unto him of a truth teacher thou hast well said     that he is one and there is none other but he and to love him with all     the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength     and to love his neighbour as himself is much more than all whole burnt     offerings and sacrifices mark xii 32 33  here is the briefest of summaries of the teaching of the prophets of israel of the eighth century does the teacher whose doctrine is thus set forth in his presence repudiate the exposition nay we are told on the contrary that jesus saw that he answered discreetly and replied thou art not far from the kingdom of god  so that i think that even if the creeds from the socalled apostles to the socalled athanasian were swept into oblivion and even if the human race should arrive at the conclusion that whether a bishop washes a cup or leaves it unwashed is not a matter of the least consequence it will get on very well the causes which have led to the development of morality in mankind which have guided or 456 impelled us all the way from the savage to the civilised state will not cease to operate because a number of ecclesiastical hypotheses turn out to be baseless and even if the absurd notion that morality is more the child of speculation than of practical necessity and inherited instinct had any foundation if all the world is going to thieve murder and otherwise misconduct itself as soon as it discovers that certain portions of ancient history are mythical what is the relevance of such arguments to any one who holds by the agnostic principle  surely the attempt to cast out beelzebub by the aid of beelzebub is a hopeful procedure as compared to that of preserving morality by the aid of immorality for i suppose it is admitted that an agnostic may be perfectly sincere may be competent and may have studied the question at issue with as much care as his clerical opponents but if the agnostic really believes what he says the dreadful consequence argufier consistently i admit with his own principles virtually asks him to abstain from telling the truth or to say what he believes to be untrue because of the supposed injurious consequences to morality beloved brethren that we may be spotlessly moral before all things let us lie is the sum total of many an exhortation addressed to the infidel now as i have already pointed out we cannot oblige our exhorters we leave the practical application of the convenient doctrines of reserve and nonnatural interpretation to those who invented them 457  i trust that i have now made amends for any ambiguity or want of fulness in my previous exposition of that which i hold to be the essence of the agnostic doctrine henceforward i might hope to hear no more of the assertion that we are necessarily materialists idealists atheists theists or any other ists if experience had led me to think that the proved falsity of a statement was any guarantee against its repetition and those who appreciate the nature of our position will see at once that when ecclesiasticism declares that we ought to believe this that and the other and are very wicked if we dont it is impossible for us to give any answer but this we have not the slightest objection to believe anything you like if you will give us good grounds for belief but if you cannot we must respectfully refuse even if that refusal should wreck morality and insure our own damnation several times over we are quite content to leave that to the decision of the future the course of the past has impressed us with the firm conviction that no good ever comes of falsehood and we feel warranted in refusing even to experiment in that direction    in the course of the present discussion it has been asserted that the sermon on the mount and the lords prayer furnish a summary and condensed view of the essentials of the teaching of jesus of nazareth set forth by himself now this supposed summa of nazarene theology distinctly affirms the existence of a spiritual world of a heaven and of a 458 hell of fire it teaches the fatherhood of god and the malignity of the devil it declares the superintending providence of the former and our need of deliverance from the machinations of the latter it affirms the fact of demoniac possession and the power of casting out devils by the faithful and from these premises the conclusion is drawn that those agnostics who deny that there is any evidence of such a character as to justify certainty respecting the existence and the nature of the spiritual world contradict the express declarations of jesus i have replied to this argumentation by showing that there is strong reason to doubt the historical accuracy of the attribution to jesus of either the sermon on the mount or the lords prayer and therefore that the conclusion in question is not warranted at any rate on the grounds set forth  but whether the gospels contain trustworthy statements about this and other alleged historical facts or not it is quite certain that from them taken together with the other books of the new testament we may collect a pretty complete exposition of that theory of the spiritual world which was held by both nazarenes and christians and which was undoubtedly supposed by them to be fully sanctioned by jesus though it is just as clear that they did not imagine it contained any revelation by him of something heretofore unknown if the pneumatological doctrine which pervades the whole new testament is nowhere systematically stated it is everywhere assumed the writers of 459 the gospels and of the acts take it for granted as a matter of common knowledge and it is easy to gather from these sources a series of propositions which only need arrangement to form a complete system  in this system man is considered to be a duality formed of a spiritual element the soul and a corporeal126 element the body and this duality is repeated in the universe which consists of a corporeal world embraced and interpenetrated by a spiritual world the former consists of the earth as its principal and central constituent with the subsidiary sun planets and stars above the earth is the air and below it the watery abyss whether the heaven which is conceived to be above the air and the hell in or below the subterranean deeps are to be taken as corporeal or incorporeal is not clear however this may be the heaven and the air the earth and the abyss are peopled by innumerable beings analogous in nature to the spiritual element in man and these spirits are of two kinds good and bad the chief of the good spirits infinitely superior to all the others and their creator as well as the creator of the corporeal world and of the bad spirits is god his residence is heaven where he is 460 surrounded by the ordered hosts of good spirits his angels or messengers and the executors of his will throughout the universe  on the other hand the chief of the bad spirits is satan the devil par excellence he and his company of demons are free to roam through all parts of the universe except the heaven these bad spirits are far superior to man in power and subtlety and their whole energies are devoted to bringing physical and moral evils upon him and to thwarting so far as their power goes the benevolent intentions of the supreme being in fact the souls and bodies of men form both the theatre and the prize of an incessant warfare between the good and the evil spiritsthe powers of light and the powers of darkness by leading eve astray satan brought sin and death upon mankind as the gods of the heathen the demons are the founders and maintainers of idolatry as the powers of the air they afflict mankind with pestilence and famine as unclean spirits they cause disease of mind and body  the significance of the appearance of jesus in the capacity of the messiah or christ is the reversal of the satanic work by putting an end to both sin and death he announces that the kingdom of god is at hand when the prince of this world shall be finally cast out john xii 31 from the cosmos as jesus during his earthly career cast him out from individuals then will satan and all his devilry along with the wicked whom they have seduced to their destruction be hurled into the abyss of 461 unquenchable firethere to endure continual torture without a hope of winning pardon from the merciful god their father or of moving the glorified messiah to one more act of pitiful intercession or even of interrupting by a momentary sympathy with their wretchedness the harmonious psalmody of their brother angels and men eternally lapped in bliss unspeakable  the straitest protestant who refuses to admit the existence of any source of divine truth except the bible will not deny that every point of the pneumatological theory here set forth has ample scriptural warranty the gospels the acts the epistles and the apocalypse assert the existence of the devil of his demons and of hell as plainly as they do that of god and his angels and heaven it is plain that the messianic and the satanic conceptions of the writers of these books are the obverse and the reverse of the same intellectual coinage if we turn from scripture to the traditions of the fathers and the confessions of the churches it will appear that in this one particular at any rate time has brought about no important deviation from primitive belief from justin onwards it may often be a fair question whether god or the devil occupies a larger share of the attention of the fathers it is the devil who instigates the roman authorities to persecute the gods and goddesses of paganism are devils and idolatry itself is an invention of satan if a saint falls away from grace it is by the seduction of the demon if heresy arises the devil has suggested it 462 and some of the fathers127 go so far as to challenge the pagans to a sort of exorcising match by way of testing the truth of christianity mediæval christianity is at one with patristic on this head the masses the clergy the theologians and the philosophers alike live and move and have their being in a world full of demons in which sorcery and possession are everyday occurrences nor did the reformation make any difference whatever else luther assailed he left the traditional demonology untouched nor could any one have entertained a more hearty and uncompromising belief in the devil than he and at a later period the calvinistic fanatics of new england did finally in these last years of the nineteenth century the demonological hypotheses of the first century are explicitly or implicitly held and occasionally acted upon by the immense majority of christians of all confessions  only here and there has the progress of scientific thought outside the ecclesiastical world so far affected christians that they and their teachers fight shy of the demonology of their creed they are fain to conceal their real disbelief in one half of christian doctrine by judicious silence about it or by flight to those refuges for the logically destitute accommodation or allegory but the faithful who fly to allegory in order to escape absurdity resemble nothing so 463 much as the sheep in the fable whoto save their livesjumped into the pit the allegory pit is too commodious is ready to swallow up so much more than one wants to put into it if the story of the temptation is an allegory if the early recognition of jesus as the son of god by the demons is an allegory if the plain declaration of the writer of the first epistle of john iii 8 to this end was the son of god manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil is allegorical then the pauline version of the fall may be allegorical and still more the words of consecration of the eucharist or the promise of the second coming in fact there is not a dogma of ecclesiastical christianity the scriptural basis of which may not be whittled away by a similar process  as to accommodation let any honest man who can read the new testament ask himself whether jesus and his immediate friends and disciples can be dishonoured more grossly than by the supposition that they said and did that which is attributed to them while in reality they disbelieved in satan and his demons in possession and in exorcism128  an eminent theologian has justly observed that we have no right to look at the propositions of the christian faith with one eye open and the other shut tract 85 p 29 it really is not permissible to see with one eye that jesus is affirmed to declare the personality and the fatherhood of god his loving providence and his accessibility to prayer and to 464 shut the other to the no less definite teaching ascribed to jesus in regard to the personality and the misanthropy of the devil his malignant watchfulness and his subjection to exorcistic formulæ and rites jesus is made to say that the devil was a murderer from the beginning john viii 44 by the same authority as that upon which we depend for his asserted declaration that god is a spirit john iv 24  to those who admit the authority of the famous vincentian dictum that the doctrine which has been held always everywhere and by all is to be received as authoritative the demonology must possess a higher sanction than any other christian dogma except perhaps those of the resurrection and of the messiahship of jesus for it would be difficult to name any other points of doctrine on which the nazarene does not differ from the christian and the different historical stages and contemporary subdivisions of christianity from one another and if the demonology is accepted there can be no reason for rejecting all those miracles in which demons play a part the gadarene story fits into the general scheme of christianity and the evidence for legion and their doings is just as good as any other in the new testament for the doctrine which the story illustrates  it was with the purpose of bringing this great fact into prominence of getting people to open both their eyes when they look at ecclesiasticism that i devoted so much space to that miraculous story which happens to be one of the best types of its class and 465 i could not wish for a better justification of the course i have adopted than the fact that my heroically consistent adversary has declared his implicit belief in the gadarene story and by necessary consequence in the christian demonology as a whole it must be obvious by this time that if the account of the spiritual world given in the new testament professedly on the authority of jesus is true then the demonological half of that account must be just as true as the other half and therefore those who question the demonology or try to explain it away deny the truth of what jesus said and are in ecclesiastical terminology infidels just as much as those who deny the spirituality of god this is as plain as anything can well be and the dilemma for my opponent was either to assert that the gadarene pigbedevilment actually occurred or to write himself down an infidel as was to be expected he chose the former alternative and i may express my great satisfaction at finding that there is one spot of common ground on which both he and i stand so far as i can judge we are agreed to state one of the broad issues between the consequences of agnostic principles as i draw them and the consequences of ecclesiastical dogmatism as he accepts it as follows  ecclesiasticism says the demonology of the gospels is an essential part of that account of that spiritual world the truth of which it declares to be certified by jesus  agnosticism me judice says there is no good 466 evidence of the existence of a demonic spiritual world and much reason for doubting it  hereupon the ecclesiastic may observe your doubt means that you disbelieve jesus therefore you are an infidel instead of an agnostic to which the agnostic may reply no for two reasons first because your evidence that jesus said what you say he said is worth very little and secondly because a man may be an agnostic in the sense of admitting he has no positive knowledge and yet consider that he has more or less probable ground for accepting any given hypothesis about the spiritual world just as a man may frankly declare that he has no means of knowing whether the planets generally are inhabited or not and yet may think one of the two possible hypotheses more likely than the other so he may admit that he has no means of knowing anything about the spiritual world and yet may think one or other of the current views on the subject to some extent probable  the second answer is so obviously valid that it needs no discussion i draw attention to it simply in justice to those agnostics who may attach greater value than i do to any sort of pneumatological speculations and not because i wish to escape the responsibility of declaring that whether jesus sanctioned the demonological part of christianity or not i unhesitatingly reject it the first answer on the other hand opens up the whole question of the claim of the biblical and other sources from which hypotheses concerning the spiritual world are derived to be 467 regarded as unimpeachable historical evidence as to matters of fact  now in respect of the trustworthiness of the gospel narratives i was anxious to get rid of the common assumption that the determination of the authorship and of the dates of these works is a matter of fundamental importance that assumption is based upon the notion that what contemporary witnesses say must be true or at least has always a primâ facie claim to be so regarded so that if the writers of any of the gospels were contemporaries of the events and still more if they were in the position of eyewitnesses the miracles they narrate must be historically true and consequently the demonology which they involve must be accepted but the story of the translation of the blessed martyrs marcellinus and petrus and the other considerations to which endless additions might have been made from the fathers and the mediæval writers set forth in a preceding essay yield in my judgment satisfactory proof that where the miraculous is concerned neither considerable intellectual ability nor undoubted honesty nor knowledge of the world nor proved faithfulness as civil historians nor profound piety on the part of eyewitnesses and contemporaries affords any guarantee of the objective truth of their statements when we know that a firm belief in the miraculous was ingrained in their minds and was the presupposition of their observations and reasonings  therefore although it be as i believe demonstrable that we have no real knowledge of the 468 authorship or of the date of composition of the gospels as they have come down to us and that nothing better than more or less probable guesses can be arrived at on that subject i have not cared to expend any space on the question it will be admitted i suppose that the authors of the works attributed to matthew mark luke and john whoever they may be are personages whose capacity and judgment in the narration of ordinary events are not quite so well certified as those of eginhard and we have seen what the value of eginhards evidence is when the miraculous is in question    i have been careful to explain that the arguments which i have used in the course of this discussion are not new that they are historical and have nothing to do with what is commonly called science and that they are all to the best of my belief to be found in the works of theologians of repute  the position which i have taken up that the evidence in favour of such miracles as those recorded by eginhard and consequently of mediæval demonology is quite as good as that in favour of such miracles as the gadarene and consequently of nazarene demonology is none of my discovery its strength was wittingly or unwittingly suggested a century and a half ago by a theological scholar of eminence and it has been if not exactly occupied yet so fortified with bastions and redoubts by a living ecclesiastical vauban that in my judgment it has been rendered impregnable in the early part of 469 the last century the ecclesiastical mind in this country was much exercised by the question not exactly of miracles the occurrence of which in biblical times was axiomatic but by the problem when did miracles cease anglican divines were quite sure that no miracles had happened in their day nor for some time past they were equally sure that they happened sixteen or seventeen centuries earlier and it was a vital question for them to determine at what point of time between this terminus a quo and that terminus ad quem miracles came to an end  the anglicans and the romanists agreed in the assumption that the possession of the gift of miracleworking was primâ facie evidence of the soundness of the faith of the miracleworkers the supposition that miraculous powers might be wielded by heretics though it might be supported by high authority led to consequences too frightful to be entertained by people who were busied in building their dogmatic house on the sands of early church history if as the romanists maintained an unbroken series of genuine miracles adorned the records of their church throughout the whole of its existence no anglican could lightly venture to accuse them of doctrinal corruption hence the anglicans who indulged in such accusations were bound to prove the modern the mediæval roman and the later patristic miracles false and to shut off the wonderworking power from the church at the exact point of time when anglican doctrine ceased and roman doctrine 470 began with a little adjustmenta squeeze here and a pull therethe christianity of the first three or four centuries might be made to fit or seem to fit pretty well into the anglican scheme so the miracles from justin say to jerome might be recognised while in later times the church having become corruptthat is to say having pursued one and the same line of development further than was pleasing to anglicansits alleged miracles must needs be shams and impostures  under these circumstances it may be imagined that the establishment of a scientific frontier between the earlier realm of supposed fact and the later of asserted delusion had its difficulties and torrents of theological special pleading about the subject flowed from clerical pens until that learned and acute anglican divine conyers middleton in his free inquiry tore the sophistical web they had laboriously woven to pieces and demonstrated that the miracles of the patristric age early and late must stand or fall together inasmuch as the evidence for the later is just as good as the evidence for the earlier wonders if the one set are certified by contemporaneous witnesses of high repute so are the other and in point of probability there is not a pin to choose between the two that is the solid and irrefragable result of middletons contribution to the subject but the free inquirers freedom had its limits and he draws a sharp line of demarcation between the patristic and the new testament miracleson the professed ground that the accounts of the 471 latter being inspired are out of the reach of criticism  a century later the question was taken up by another divine middletons equal in learning and acuteness and far his superior in subtlety and dialectic skill who though an anglican scorned the name of protestant and while yet a churchman made it his business to parade with infinite skill the utter hollowness of the arguments of those of his brother churchmen who dreamed that they could be both anglicans and protestants the argument of the essay on the miracles recorded in the ecclesiastical history of the early ages129 by the present roman cardinal but then anglican doctor john henry newman is compendiously stated by himself in the following passage      if the miracles of church history cannot be defended by the arguments     of leslie lyttleton paley or douglas how many of the scripture     miracles satisfy their conditions p cvii  and although the answer is not given in so many words little doubt is left on the mind of the reader that in the mind of the writer it is none in fact this conclusion is one which cannot be resisted if the argument in favour of the scripture miracles is based upon that which laymen whether lawyers or men of science or historians or ordinary men of affairs call evidence but there is something really impressive 472 in the magnificent contempt with which at times dr newman sweeps aside alike those who offer and those who demand such evidence      some infidel authors advise us to accept no miracles which would not     have a verdict in their favour in a court of justice that is they     employ against scripture a weapon which protestants would confine to     attacks upon the church as if moral and religious questions required     legal proof and evidence were the test of truth130 p cvii  as if evidence were the test of truthalthough the truth in question is the occurrence or the nonoccurrence of certain phenomena at a certain time and in a certain place this sudden revelation of the great gulf fixed between the ecclesiastical and the scientific mind is enough to take away the breath of any one unfamiliar with the clerical organon as if one may retort the assumption that miracles may or have served a moral or a religious end in any way alters the fact that they profess to be historical events things that actually happened and as such must needs be exactly those subjects about which evidence is appropriate and legal proofs which are such merely because they afford adequate evidence may be justly demanded the gadarene miracle either happened or it did not whether the gadarene question is moral or religious or not has nothing to do with the fact that it is a purely 473 historical question whether the demons said what they are declared to have said and the devilpossessed pigs did or did not rush over the cliffs bounding the lake of gennesaret on a certain day of a certain year after ad 26 and before ad 36 for vague and uncertain as new testament chronology is i suppose it may be assumed that the event in question if it happened at all took place during the procuratorship of pilate if that is not a matter about which evidence ought to be required and not only legal but strict scientific proof demanded by sane men who are asked to believe the storywhat is is a reasonable being to be seriously asked to credit statements which to put the case gently are not exactly probable and on the acceptance or rejection of which his whole view of life may depend without asking for as much legal proof as would send an alleged pickpocket to gaol or as would suffice to prove the validity of a disputed will  infidel authors if as i am assured i may answer for them will decline to waste time on mere darkenings of counsel of this sort but to those anglicans who accept his premises dr newman is a truly formidable antagonist what indeed are they to reply when he puts the very pertinent question      whether persons who not merely question but prejudge the     ecclesiastical miracles on the ground of their want of resemblance     whatever that be to those contained in scriptureas if the almighty     could not do in the christian church what he had not already done at     the time of its foundation or under the mosaic covenantwhether such     reasoners are not siding with the sceptic  474  and      whether it is not a happy inconsistency by which they continue to     believe the scriptures while they reject the church131 p liii  again i invite anglican orthodoxy to consider this passage      the narrative of the combats of st antony with evil spirits is a     development rather than a contradiction of revelation viz of such     texts as speak of satan being cast out by prayer and fasting to be     shocked then at the miracles of ecclesiastical history or to     ridicule them for their strangeness is no part of a scriptural     philosophy pp liiiliv  further on dr newman declares that it has been admitted      that a distinct line can be drawn in point of character and     circumstance between the miracles of scripture and of church history     but this is by no means the case p lv  specimens are not wanting     in the history of the church of miracles as awful in their character     and as momentous in their effects as those which are recorded in     scripture the fire interrupting the rebuilding of the jewish temple     and the death of arius are instances in ecclesiastical history of     such solemn events on the other hand difficult instances in the     scripture history are such as these the serpent in eden the ark     jacobs vision for the multiplication of his cattle the speaking of     balaams ass the axe swimming at elishas word the miracle on the     swine and various instances of prayers or prophecies in which as in     that of noahs blessing and curse words which seem the result of     private feeling are expressly or virtually ascribed to a divine     suggestion p lvi  who is to gainsay our ecclesiastical authority 475 here infidel authors might be accused of a wish to ridicule the scripture miracles by putting them on a level with the remarkable story about the fire which stopped the rebuilding of the temple or that about the death of ariusbut dr newman is above suspicion the pity is that his list of what he delicately terms difficult instances is so short why omit the manufacture of eve out of adams rib on the strict historical accuracy of which the chief argument of the defenders of an iniquitous portion of our present marriage law depends why leave out the account of the bene elohim and their gallantries on which a large part of the worst practices of the mediæval inquisitors into witchcraft was based why forget the angel who wrestled with jacob and as the account suggests somewhat overstepped the bounds of fair play at the end of the struggle surely we must agree with dr newman that if all these camels have gone down it savours of affectation to strain at such gnats as the sudden ailment of arius in the midst of his deadly if prayerful132 enemies and the fiery explosion which 476 stopped the julian building operations though the words of the conclusion of the essay on miracles may perhaps be quoted against me i may express my satisfaction at finding myself in substantial accordance with a theologian above all suspicion of heterodoxy with all my heart i can declare my belief that there is just as good reason for believing in the miraculous slaying of the man who fell short of the athanasian power of affirming contradictories with respect to the nature of the godhead as there is for believing in the stories of the serpent and the ark told in genesis the speaking of balaams ass in numbers or the floating of the axe at elishas order in the second book of kings    it is one of the peculiarities of a really sound argument that it is susceptible of the fullest development and that it sometimes leads to conclusions unexpected by those who employ it to my mind it is impossible to refuse to follow dr newman when he extends his reasoning from the miracles of the patristic and mediæval ages backward in time as far as miracles are recorded but if the rules of logic are valid i feel compelled to extend the argument forward to the alleged roman miracles of the present day which dr newman might not have admitted but which cardinal newman may hardly reject beyond question there is as good or perhaps better evidence for the miracles worked by our lady of lourdes as there is for the floating of elishas axe 477 or the speaking of balaams ass but we must go still further there is a modern system of thaumaturgy and demonology which is just as well certified as the ancient133 veracious excellent sometimes learned and acute persons even philosophers of no mean pretensions testify to the levitation of bodies much heavier than elishas axe to the existence of spirits who to the mere tactile sense have been indistinguishable from flesh and blood and occasionally have wrestled with all the vigour of jacobs opponent yet further to the speech in the language of raps of spiritual beings whose discourses in point of coherence and value are far inferior to that of balaams humble but sagacious steed i have not the smallest doubt that if these were persecuting times there is many 478 a worthy spiritualist who would cheerfully go to the stake in support of his pneumatological faith and furnish evidence after paleys own heart in proof of the truth of his doctrines not a few modern divines doubtless struck by the impossibility of refusing the spiritualist evidence if the ecclesiastical evidence is accepted and deprived of any à priori objection by their implicit belief in christian demonology show themselves ready to take poor sludge seriously and to believe that he is possessed by other devils than those of need greed and vainglory  under these circumstances it was to be expected though it is none the less interesting to note the fact that the arguments of the latest school of spiritualists present a wonderful family likeness to those which adorn the subtle disquisitions of the advocate of ecclesiastical miracles of forty years ago it is unfortunate for the spiritualists that over and over again celebrated and trusted media who really in some respects call to mind the montanist134 and gnostic seers of the second century are either proved in courts of law to be fraudulent impostors 479 or in sheer weariness as it would seem of the honest dupes who swear by them spontaneously confess their longcontinued iniquities as the fox women did the other day in new york135 but whenever a catastrophe of this kind takes place the believers are no wise dismayed by it they freely admit that not only the media but the spirits whom they summon are sadly apt to lose sight of the elementary principles of right and wrong and they triumphantly ask how does the occurrence of occasional impostures disprove the genuine manifestations that is to say all those which have not yet been proved to be impostures or delusions and in this they unconsciously plagiarise from the churchman who just as freely admits that many ecclesiastical miracles may have been forged and asks with calm contempt not only of legal proofs but of commonsense probability why does it follow that none are to be supposed genuine i must say however that the spiritualists so far as i know do not venture to outrage right reason so boldly as the ecclesiastics they do not sneer at evidence nor repudiate the requirement of legal proofs in fact there can be no doubt that the spiritualists produce better evidence for their manifestations than can be shown either for the miraculous death of arius or for the invention of the cross136  480  from the levitation of the axe at one end of a period of near three thousand years to the levitation of sludge  co at the other end there is a complete continuity of the miraculous with every gradation from the childish to the stupendous from the gratification of a caprice to the illustration of sublime truth there is no drawing a line in the series that might be set out of plausibly attested cases of spiritual intervention if one is true all may be true if one is false all may be false    this is to my mind the inevitable result of that method of reasoning which is applied to the confutation of protestantism with so much success by one of the acutest and subtlest disputants who have ever championed ecclesiasticismand one cannot put his claims to acuteness and subtlety higher       the christianity of history is not protestantism if ever there     were a safe truth it is this to be deep in history is to cease to     be a protestant137  i have not a shadow of doubt that these antiprotestant epigrams are profoundly true but i have as little that in the same sense the christianity of history is not romanism and that to be deeper in history is to cease to be a romanist the reasons which compel my doubts about the compatibility of the roman doctrine or any other form 481 of catholicism with history arise out of exactly the same line of argument as that adopted by dr newman in the famous essay which i have just cited if with one hand dr newman has destroyed protestantism he has annihilated romanism with the other and the total result of his ambidextral efforts is to shake christianity to its foundations nor was any one better aware that this must be the inevitable result of his argumentsif the world should refuse to accept roman doctrines and roman miraclesthan the writer of tract 85  dr newman made his choice and passed over to the roman church half a century ago some of those who were essentially in harmony with his views preceded and many followed him but many remained and as the quondam puseyite and present ritualistic party they are continuing that work of sapping and mining the protestantism of the anglican church which he and his friends so ably commenced at the present time they have no little claim to be considered victorious all along the line i am old enough to recollect the small beginnings of the tractarian party and i am amazed when i consider the present position of their heirs their little leaven has leavened if not the whole yet a very large lump of the anglican church which is now pretty much of a preparatory school for papistry so that it really behoves englishmen who as i have been informed by high authority are all legally members of the state church if they profess to belong to no other sect to wake up to what that 482 powerful organisation is about and whither it is tending on this point the writings of dr newman while he still remained within the anglican fold are a vast store of the best and the most authoritative information his doctrines on ecclesiastical miracles and on development are the cornerstones of the tractarian fabric he believed that his arguments led either romeward or to what ecclesiastics call infidelity and i call agnosticism i believe that he was quite right in this conviction but while he chooses the one alternative i choose the other as he rejects protestantism on the ground of its incompatibility with history so à fortiori i conceive that romanism ought to be rejected and that an impartial consideration of the evidence must refuse the authority of jesus to anything more than the nazarenism of james and peter and john and let it not be supposed that this is a mere infidel perversion of the facts no one has more openly and clearly admitted the possibility that they may be fairly interpreted in this way than dr newman if he says there are texts which seem to show that jesus contemplated the evangelisation of the heathen       did not the apostles hear our lord and what was their impression     from what they heard is it not certain that the apostles did not     gather this truth from his teaching tract 85 p 63      he said preach the gospel to every creature these words need have     only meant bring all men to christianity through judaism make them     jews that they may enjoy christs privileges which are lodged in     judaism teach them those rites and ceremonies circumcision and the     like which 483 hitherto have been dead ordinances and now are     living and so the apostles seem to have understood them ibid p     65  so far as nazarenism differentiated itself from contemporary orthodox judaism it seems to have tended towards a revival of the ethical and religious spirit of the prophetic age accompanied by the belief in jesus as the messiah and by various accretions which had grown round judaism subsequently to the exile to these belong the doctrines of the resurrection of the last judgment of heaven and hell of the hierarchy of good angels of satan and the hierarchy of evil spirits and there is very strong ground for believing that all these doctrines at least in the shapes in which they were held by the postexilic jews were derived from persian and babylonian138 sources and are essentially of heathen origin  how far jesus positively sanctioned all these indrainings of circumjacent paganism into judaism how far any one has a right to declare that the refusal to accept one or other of these doctrines as ascertained verities comes to the same thing as contradicting jesus it appears to me not easy to say but it is hardly less difficult to conceive that he could have distinctly negatived any of them and more especially that demonology which has been accepted by 484 the christian churches in every age and under all their mutual antagonisms but i repeat my conviction that whether jesus sanctioned the demonology of his time and nation or not it is doomed the future of christianity as a dogmatic system and apart from the old israelitish ethics which it has appropriated and developed lies in the answer which mankind will eventually give to the question whether they are prepared to believe such stories as the gadarene and the pneumatological hypotheses which go with it or not my belief is they will decline to do anything of the sort whenever and wherever their minds have been disciplined by science and that discipline must and will at once follow and lead the footsteps of advancing civilisation    the preceding pages were written before i became acquainted with the contents of the may number of the nineteenth century wherein i discover many things which are decidedly not to my advantage it would appear that evasion is my chief resource incapacity for strict argument and rottenness of ratiocination my main mental characteristics and that it is barely credible that a statement which i profess to make of my own knowledge is true all which things i notice merely to illustrate the great truth forced on me by long experience that it is only from those who enjoy the blessing of a firm hold of the christian faith that such manifestations of meekness patience and charity are to be expected 485  i had imagined that no one who had read my preceding papers could entertain a doubt as to my position in respect of the main issue as it has been stated and restated by my opponent      an agnosticism which knows nothing of the relation of man to god must     not only refuse belief to our lords most undoubted teaching but must     deny the reality of the spiritual convictions in which he lived139  that is said to be the simple question which is at issue between us and the three testimonies to that teaching and those convictions selected are the sermon on the mount the lords prayer and the story of the passion  my answer reduced to its briefest form has been in the first place the evidence is such that the exact nature of the teachings and the convictions of jesus is extremely uncertain so that what ecclesiastics are pleased to call a denial of them may be nothing of the kind and in the second place if jesus taught the demonological system involved in the gadarene storyif a belief in that system formed a part of the spiritual convictions in which he lived and diedthen i for my part unhesitatingly refuse belief in that teaching and deny the reality of those spiritual convictions and i go further and add that exactly in so far as it can be proved that jesus sanctioned the essentially pagan demonological theories current among the jews of his age exactly in so far for me will his authority in any matter touching the spiritual world be weakened  486  with respect to the first half of my answer i have pointed out that the sermon on the mount as given in the first gospel is in the opinion of the best critics a mosaic work of materials derived from different sources and i do not understand that this statement is challenged the only other gospel the third which contains something like it makes not only the discourse but the circumstances under which it was delivered very different now it is one thing to say that there was something real at the bottom of the two discourseswhich is quite possible and another to affirm that we have any right to say what that something was or to fix upon any particular phrase and declare it to be a genuine utterance those who pursue theology as a science and bring to the study an adequate knowledge of the ways of ancient historians will find no difficulty in providing illustrations of my meaning i may supply one which has come within range of my own limited vision  in josephuss history of the wars of the jews chap xix that writer reports a speech which he says herod made at the opening of a war with the arabians it is in the first person and would naturally be supposed by the reader to be intended for a true version of what herod said in the antiquities written some seventeen years later the same writer gives another report also in the first person of herods speech on the same occasion this second oration is twice as long as the first and though the general tenour of the two speeches is 487 pretty much the same there is hardly any verbal identity and a good deal of matter is introduced into the one which is absent from the other josephus prides himself on his accuracy people whose fathers might have heard herods oration were his contemporaries and yet his historical sense is so curiously undeveloped that he can quite innocently perpetrate an obvious literary fabrication for one of the two accounts must be incorrect now if i am asked whether i believe that herod made some particular statement on this occasion whether for example he uttered the pious aphorism where god is there is both multitude and courage which is given in the antiquities but not in the wars i am compelled to say i do not know one of the two reports must be erroneous possibly both are at any rate i cannot tell how much of either is true and if some fervent admirer of the idumean should build up a theory of herods piety upon josephuss evidence that he propounded the aphorism is it a mere evasion to say in reply that the evidence that he did utter it is worthless  it appears again that adopting the tactics of conachar when brought face to face with hal o the wynd i have been trying to get my simpleminded adversary to follow me on a wildgoose chase through the early history of christianity in the hope of escaping impending defeat on the main issue but i may be permitted to point out that there is an alternative hypothesis which equally fits the facts and that after all there 488 may have been method in the madness of my supposed panic  for suppose it to be established that gentile christianity was a totally different thing from the nazarenism of jesus and his immediate disciples suppose it to be demonstrable that as early as the sixth decade of our era at least there were violent divergencies of opinion among the followers of jesus suppose it to be hardly doubtful that the gospels and the acts took their present shapes under the influence of these divergencies suppose that their authors and those through whose hands they passed had notions of historical veracity not more eccentric than those which josephus occasionally displays surely the chances that the gospels are altogether trustworthy records of the teachings of jesus become very slender and since the whole of the case of the other side is based on the supposition that they are accurate records especially of speeches about which ancient historians are so curiously loose i really do venture to submit that this part of my argument bears very seriously on the main issue and as ratiocination is sound to the core  again when i passed by the topic of the speeches of jesus on the cross it appears that i could have had no other motive than the dictates of my native evasiveness an ecclesiastical dignitary may have respectable reasons for declining a fencing match in sight of gethsemane and calvary but an ecclesiastical infidel never it is obviously impossible that in the belief that the greater includes the less 489 i having declared the gospel evidence in general as to the sayings of jesus to be of questionable value thought it needless to select for illustration of my views those particular instances which were likely to be most offensive to persons of another way of thinking but any supposition that may have been entertained that the old familiar tones of the ecclesiastical wardrum will tempt me to engage in such needless discussion had better be renounced i shall do nothing of the kind let it suffice that i ask my readers to turn to the twentythird chapter of luke revised version verse thirtyfour and he will find in the margin      some ancient authorities omit and jesus said father forgive them for     they know not what they do  so that even as late as the fourth century there were ancient authorities indeed some of the most ancient and weightiest who either did not know of this utterance so often quoted as characteristic of jesus or did not believe it had been uttered  many years ago i received an anonymous letter which abused me heartily for my want of moral courage in not speaking out i thought that one of the oddest charges an anonymous letterwriter could bring but i am not sure that the plentiful sowing of the pages of the article with which i am dealing with accusations of evasion may not seem odder to those who consider that the main strength of the answers with which i have been favoured in this review and elsewhere is devoted not to anything in 490 the text of my first paper but to a note which occurs at p 171 in this i say      dr wace tells us it may be asked how far we can rely on the accounts     we possess of our lords teaching on these subjects and he seems to     think the question appropriately answered by the assertion that it     ought to be regarded as settled by m renans practical surrender of     the adverse case  i requested dr wace to point out the passages of m renans works in which as he affirms this practical surrender not merely as to the age and authorship of the gospels be it observed but as to their historical value is made and he has been so good as to do so now let us consider the parts of dr waces citation from renan which are relevant to the issue      the author of this gospel luke is certainly the same as the author of     the acts of the apostles now the author of the acts seems to be a     companion of st paula character which accords completely with st     luke i know that more than one objection may be opposed to this     reasoning but one thing at all events is beyond doubt namely that     the author of the third gospel and of the acts is a man who belonged to     the second apostolic generation and this suffices for our purpose  this is a curious practical surrender of the adverse case m renan thinks that there is no doubt that the author of the third gospel is the author of the actsa conclusion in which i suppose critics generally agree he goes on to remark that this person seems to be a companion of st paul and adds that luke was a companion of st paul then somewhat needlessly m renan points out that there is more than one objection to jumping from such data as these to 491 the conclusion that luke is the writer of the third gospel and finally m renan is content to reduce that which is beyond doubt to the fact that the author of the two books is a man of the second apostolic generation well it seems to me that i could agree with all that m renan considers beyond doubt here without surrendering anything either practically or theoretically  dr wace nineteenth century march p 363 states that he derives the above citation from the preface to the 15th edition of the vie de jésus my copy of les Évangiles dated 1877 contains a list of renans oeuvres complètes at the head of which i find vie de jésus 15e édition it is therefore a later work than the edition of the vie de jésus which dr wace quotes now les Évangiles as its name implies treats fully of the questions respecting the date and authorship of the gospels and any one who desired not merely to use m renans expressions for controversial purposes but to give a fair account of his views in their full significance would i think refer to the later source  if this course had been taken dr wace might have found some as decided expressions of opinion in favour of lukes authorship of the third gospel as he has discovered in the apostles i mention this circumstance because i desire to point out that taking even the strongest of renans statements i am still at a loss to see how it justifies that largesounding phrase practical surrender of the adverse case for on p 438 of les Évangiles renan speaks of the way in 492 which lukes excellent intentions have led him to torture history in the acts he declares luke to be the founder of that eternal fiction which is called ecclesiastical history and on the preceding page he talks of the myth of the ascensionwith its mise en scène voulue at p 435 i find luc ou lauteur quel quil soit du troisième Évangile at p 280 the accounts of the passion the death and the resurrection of jesus are said to be peu historiques at p 283 la valeur historique du troisième Évangile est sûrement moindre que celles des deux premiers a pyrrhic sort of victory for orthodoxy this surrender and all the while the scientific student of theology knows that the more reason there may be to believe that luke was the companion of paul the more doubtful becomes his credibility if he really wrote the acts for in that case he could not fail to have been acquainted with pauls account of the jerusalem conference and he must have consciously misrepresented it  we may next turn to the essential part of dr waces citation nineteenth century p 365 touching the first gospel      st matthew evidently deserves peculiar confidence for the discourses     here are the oraclesthe very notes taken while the memory of the     instruction of jesus was living and definite  m renan here expresses the very general opinion as to the existence of a collection of logia having a different origin from the text in which they are embedded in matthew notes are somewhat suggestive of a shorthand writer but the suggestion is 493 unintentional for m renan assumes that these notes were taken not at the time of the delivery of the logia but subsequently while as he assumes the memory of them was living and definite so that in this very citation m renan leaves open the question of the general historical value of the first gospel while it is obvious that the accuracy of notes taken not at the time of delivery but from memory is a matter about which more than one opinion may be fairly held moreover renan expressly calls attention to the difficulty of distinguishing the authentic logia from later additions of the same kind les Évangiles p 201 the fact is there is no contradiction here to that opinion about the first gospel which is expressed in les Évangiles p 175      the text of the socalled matthew supposes the preexistence of that of     mark and does little more than complete it he completes it in two     fashionsfirst by the insertion of those long discourses which gave     their chief value to the hebrew gospels then by adding traditions of a     more modern formation results of successive developments of the     legend and to which the christian consciousness already attached     infinite value  m renan goes on to suggest that besides mark pseudomatthew used an aramaic version of the gospel originally set forth in that dialect finally as to the second gospel nineteenth century p 365      he mark is full of minute observations proceeding beyond doubt     from an eyewitness there is nothing to conflict with the supposition     that this eyewitness  was the apostle peter himself as papias has     it  let us consider this citation by the light of les Évangiles 494      this work although composed after the death of peter was in a sense     the work of peter it represents the way in which peter was accustomed     to relate the life of jesus p 116  m renan goes on to say that as an historical document the gospel of mark has a great superiority p 116 but mark has a motive for omitting the discourses and he attaches a puerile importance to miracles p 117 the gospel of mark is less a legend than a biography written with credulity p 118 it would be rash to say that mark has not been interpolated and retouched p 120  if any one thinks that i have not been warranted in drawing a sharp distinction between scientific theologians and counsels for creeds or that my warning against the too ready acceptance of certain declarations as to the state of biblical criticism was needless or that my anxiety as to the sense of the word practical was superfluous let him compare the statement that m renan has made a practical surrender of the adverse case with the facts just set forth for what is the adverse case the question as dr wace puts it is it may be asked how far can we rely on the accounts we possess of our lords teaching on these subjects it will be obvious that m renans statements amount to an adverse answerto a practical denial that any great reliance can be placed on these accounts he does not believe that matthew the apostle wrote the first gospel he does not profess to know who is responsible for the collection of logia or how many of them are authentic though he calls the second gospel the 495 most historical he points out that it is written with credulity and may have been interpolated and retouched and as to the author quel quil soit of the third gospel who is to rely on the accounts of a writer who deserves the cavalier treatment which luke meets with at m renans hands  i repeat what i have already more than once said that the question of the age and the authorship of the gospels has not in my judgment the importance which is so commonly assigned to it for the simple reason that the reports even of eyewitnesses would not suffice to justify belief in a large and essential part of their contents on the contrary these reports would discredit the witnesses the gadarene miracle for example is so extremely improbable that the fact of its being reported by three even independent authorities could not justify belief in it unless we had the clearest evidence as to their capacity as observers and as interpreters of their observations but it is evident that the three authorities are not independent that they have simply adopted a legend of which there were two versions and instead of their proving its truth it suggests their superstitious credulity so that if matthew mark and luke are really responsible for the gospels it is not the better for the gadarene story but the worse for them  a wonderful amount of controversial capital has been made out of my assertion in the note to which i have referred as an obiter dictum of no consequence 496 to my argument that if renans work140 were nonextant the main results of biblical criticism as set forth in the works of strauss baur reuss and volkmar for example would not be sensibly affected i thought i had explained it satisfactorily already but it seems that my explanation has only exhibited still more of my native perversity so i ask for one more chance  in the course of the historical development of any branch of science what is universally observed is this that the men who make epochs and are the real architects of the fabric of exact knowledge are those who introduce fruitful ideas or methods as a rule the man who does this pushes his idea or his method too far or if he does not his school is sure to do so and those who follow have to reduce his work to its proper value and assign it its place in the whole not unfrequently they in their turn overdo the critical process and in trying to eliminate error throw away truth  thus as i said linnæus buffon cuvier lamarck really set forth the results of a developing science although they often heartily contradict one another notwithstanding this circumstance modern classificatory method and nomenclature have largely grown out of the work of linnæus the modern conception of biology as a science and of its relation to climatology geography and geology are as largely rooted in the results of the labours of buffon comparative 497 anatomy and palæontology owe a vast debt to cuviers results while invertebrate zoology and the revival of the idea of evolution are intimately dependent on the results of the work of lamarck in other words the main results of biology up to the early years of this century are to be found in or spring out of the works of these men  so if i mistake not strauss if he did not originate the idea of taking the mythopoeic faculty into account in the development of the gospel narratives and though he may have exaggerated the influence of that faculty obliged scientific theology hereafter to take that element into serious consideration so baur in giving prominence to the cardinal fact of the divergence of the nazarene and pauline tendencies in the primitive church so reuss in setting a marvellous example of the cool and dispassionate application of the principles of scientific criticism over the whole field of scripture so volkmar in his clear and forcible statement of the nazarene limitations of jesus contributed results of permanent value in scientific theology i took these names as they occurred to me undoubtedly i might have advantageously added to them perhaps i might have made a better selection but it really is absurd to try to make out that i did not know that these writers widely disagree and i believe that no scientific theologian will deny that in principle what i have said is perfectly correct ecclesiastical advocates of course cannot be expected to take this view of the matter to them these mere seekers after truth in so far as 498 their results are unfavourable to the creed the clerics have to support are more or less infidels or favourers of infidelity and the only thing they care to see or probably can see is the fact that in a great many matters the truthseekers differ from one another and therefore can easily be exhibited to the public as if they did nothing else as if any one who referred to their having each and all contributed his share to the results of theological science was merely showing his ignorance and as if a charge of inconsistency could be based on the fact that he himself often disagrees with what they say i have never lent a shadow of foundation to the assumption that i am a follower of either strauss or baur or reuss or volkmar or renan my debt to these eminent menso far my superiors in theological knowledgeis indeed great yet it is not for their opinions but for those i have been able to form for myself by their help  in agnosticism a rejoinder p 410 i have referred to the difficulties under which those professors of the science of theology whose tenure of their posts depends on the results of their investigations must labour and in a note i add      imagine that all our chairs of astronomy had been founded in the     fourteenth century and that their incumbents were bound to sign     ptolemaic articles in that case with every respect for the efforts of     persons thus hampered to attain and expound the truth i think men of     common sense would go elsewhere to learn astronomy  i did not write this paragraph without a 499 knowledge that its sense would be open to the kind of perversion which it has suffered but if that was clear the necessity for the statement was still clearer it is my deliberate opinion i reiterate it and i say that in my judgment it is extremely inexpedient that any subject which calls itself a science should be entrusted to teachers who are debarred from freely following out scientific methods to their legitimate conclusions whatever those conclusions may be if i may borrow a phrase paraded at the church congress i think it ought to be unpleasant for any man of science to find himself in the position of such a teacher  human nature is not altered by seating it in a professorial chair even of theology i have very little doubt that if in the year 1859 the tenure of my office had depended upon my adherence to the doctrines of cuvier the objections to those set forth in the origin of species would have had a halo of gravity about them that being free to teach what i pleased i failed to discover and in making that statement it does not appear to me that i am confessing that i should have been debarred by selfish interests from making candid inquiry or that i should have been biassed by sordid motives i hope that even such a fragment of moral sense as may remain in an ecclesiastical infidel might have got me through the difficulty but it would be unworthy to deny or disguise the fact that a very serious difficulty must have been created for me by the nature of my tenure and let it be observed that 500 the temptation in my case would have been far slighter than in that of a professor of theology whatever biological doctrine i had repudiated nobody i cared for would have thought the worse of me for so doing no scientific journals would have howled me down as the religious newspapers howled down my too honest friend the late bishop of natal nor would my colleagues of the royal society have turned their backs upon me as his episcopal colleagues boycotted him  i say these facts are obvious and that it is wholesome and needful that they should be stated it is in the interests of theology if it be a science and it is in the interests of those teachers of theology who desire to be something better than counsel for creeds that it should be taken to heart the seeker after theological truth and that only will no more suppose that i have insulted him than the prisoner who works in fetters will try to pick a quarrel with me if i suggest that he would get on better if the fetters were knocked off unless indeed as it is said does happen in the course of long captivities that the victim at length ceases to feel the weight of his chains or even takes to hugging them as if they were honourable ornaments141                                        501  xiii  the lights of the church and the light of science  there are three ways of regarding any account of past occurrences whether delivered to us orally or recorded in writing  the narrative may be exactly true that is to say the words taken in their natural sense and interpreted according to the rules of grammar may convey to the mind of the hearer or of the reader an idea precisely correspondent with one which would have remained in the mind of a witness for example the statement that king charles the first was beheaded at whitehall on the 30th day of january 1649 is as exactly true as any proposition in mathematics or physics no one doubts that any person of sound faculties properly placed who was present at whitehall throughout that day and who used his eyes would have seen the kings head cut off and that there would have remained in his mind an idea of that occurrence which he would have put into words of the same value as those which we use to express it 502  or the narrative may be partly true and partly false thus some histories of the time tell us what the king said and what bishop juxon said or report royalist conspiracies to effect a rescue or detail the motives which induced the chiefs of the commonwealth to resolve that the king should die one account declares that the king knelt at a high block another that he lay down with his neck on a mere plank and there are contemporary pictorial representations of both these modes of procedure such narratives while veracious as to the main event may and do exhibit various degrees of unconscious and conscious misrepresentation suppression and invention till they become hardly distinguishable from pure fictions thus they present a transition to narratives of a third class in which the fictitious element predominates here again there are all imaginable gradations from such works as defoes quasihistorical account of the plague year which probably gives a truer conception of that dreadful time than any authentic history through the historical novel drama and epic to the purely phantasmal creations of imaginative genius such as the old arabian nights or the modern shaving of shagpat it is not strictly needful for my present purpose that i should say anything about narratives which are professedly fictitious yet it may be well perhaps if i disclaim any intention of derogating from their value when i insist upon the paramount necessity of recollecting that there is no sort of relation between the ethical or the æsthetic or even 503 the scientific importance of such works and their worth as historical documents unquestionably to the poetic artist or even to the student of psychology hamlet and macbeth may be better instructors than all the books of a wilderness of professors of æsthetics or of moral philosophy but as evidence of occurrences in denmark or in scotland at the times and places indicated they are out of court the profoundest admiration for them the deepest gratitude for their influence are consistent with the knowledge that historically speaking they are worthless fables in which any foundation of reality that may exist is submerged beneath the imaginative superstructure  at present however i am not concerned to dwell upon the importance of fictitious literature and the immensity of the work which it has effected in the education of the human race i propose to deal with the much more limited inquiry are there two other classes of consecutive narratives as distinct from statements of individual facts or only one is there any known historical work which is throughout exactly true or is there not in the case of the great majority of histories the answer is not doubtful they are all only partially true even those venerable works which bear the names of some of the greatest of ancient greek and roman writers and which have been accepted by generation after generation down to modern times as stores of unquestionable truth have been compelled by scientific criticism after a long battle to descend to the common level and to confess to a large admixture of error i might 504 fairly take this for granted but it may be well that i should entrench myself behind the very apposite words of a historical authority who is certainly not obnoxious to even a suspicion of sceptical tendencies      time wasand that not very long agowhen all the relations of ancient     authors concerning the old world were received with a ready belief and     an unreasoning and uncritical faith accepted with equal satisfaction     the narrative of the campaigns of cæsar and of the doings of romulus     the account of alexanders marches and of the conquests of semiramis     we can most of us remember when in this country the whole story of     regal rome and even the legend of the trojan settlement in latium     were seriously placed before boys as history and discoursed of as     unhesitatingly and in as dogmatic a tone as the tale of the catiline     conspiracy or the conquest of britain      but all this is now changed the last century has seen the birth and     growth of a new sciencethe science of historical criticism the     whole world of profane history has been revolutionised142  if these utterances were true when they fell from the lips of a bampton lecturer in 1859 with how much greater force do they appeal to us now when the immense labours of the generation now passing away constitute one vast illustration of the power and fruitfulness of scientific methods of investigation in history no less than in all other departments of knowledge  at the present time i suppose there is no one who doubts that histories which appertain to any 505 other people than the jews and their spiritual progeny in the first century fall within the second class of the three enumerated like goethes autobiography they might all be entitled wahrheit und dichtungtruth and fiction the proportion of the two constituents changes indefinitely and the quality of the fiction varies through the whole gamut of unveracity but dichtung is always there for the most acute and learned of historians cannot remedy the imperfections of his sources of information nor can the most impartial wholly escape the influence of the personal equation generated by his temperament and by his education therefore from the narratives of herodotus to those set forth in yesterdays times all history is to be read subject to the warning that fiction has its share therein the modern vast development of fugitive literature cannot be the unmitigated evil that some do vainly say it is since it has put an end to the popular delusion of less pressridden times that what appears in print must be true we should rather hope that some beneficent influence may create among the erudite a like healthy suspicion of manuscripts and inscriptions however ancient for a bulletin may lie even though it be written in cuneiform characters hotspurs starling that was to be taught to speak nothing but mortimer into the ears of king henry the fourth might be a useful inmate of every historians library if fiction were substituted for the name of harry percys friend 506  but it was the chief object of the lecturer to the congregation gathered in st marys oxford thirtyone years ago to prove to them by evidence gathered with no little labour and marshalled with much skill that one group of historical works was exempt from the general rule and that the narratives contained in the canonical scriptures are free from any admixture of error with justice and candour the lecturer impresses upon his hearers that the special distinction of christianity among the religions of the world lies in its claim to be historical to be surely founded upon events which have happened exactly as they are declared to have happened in its sacred books which are true that is in the sense that the statement about the execution of charles the first is true further it is affirmed that the new testament presupposes the historical exactness of the old testament that the points of contact of sacred and profane history are innumerable and that the demonstration of the falsity of the hebrew records especially in regard to those narratives which are assumed to be true in the new testament would be fatal to christian theology  my utmost ingenuity does not enable me to discover a flaw in the argument thus briefly summarised i am fairly at a loss to comprehend how any one for a moment can doubt that christian theology must stand or fall with the historical trustworthiness of the jewish scriptures the very conception of the messiah or christ is inextricably interwoven with jewish history the identification 507 of jesus of nazareth with that messiah rests upon the interpretation of passages of the hebrew scriptures which have no evidential value unless they possess the historical character assigned to them if the covenant with abraham was not made if circumcision and sacrifices were not ordained by jahveh if the ten words were not written by gods hand on the stone tables if abraham is more or less a mythical hero such as theseus the story of the deluge a fiction that of the fall a legend and that of the creation the dream of a seer if all these definite and detailed narratives of apparently real events have no more value as history than have the stories of the regal period of romewhat is to be said about the messianic doctrine which is so much less clearly enunciated and what about the authority of the writers of the books of the new testament who on this theory have not merely accepted flimsy fictions for solid truths but have built the very foundations of christian dogma upon legendary quicksands  but these may be said to be merely the carpings of that carnal reason which the profane call common sense i hasten therefore to bring up the forces of unimpeachable ecclesiastical authority in support of my position in a sermon preached last december in st pauls cathedral143 canon liddon declares  508      for christians it will be enough to know that our lord jesus christ set     the seal of his infallible sanction on the whole of the old testament     he found the hebrew canon as we have it in our hands today and he     treated it as an authority which was above discussion nay more he     went out of his wayif we may reverently speak thusto sanction not a     few portions of it which modern scepticism rejects when he would warn     his hearers against the dangers of spiritual relapse he bids them     remember lots wife144 when he would point out how worldly     engagements may blind the soul to a coming judgment he reminds them     how men ate and drank and married and were given in marriage until     the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and     destroyed them all145 if he would put his finger on a fact in past     jewish history which by its admitted reality would warrant belief in     his own coming resurrection he points to jonahs being three days and     three nights in the whales belly p 23146  the preacher proceeds to brush aside the commoni had almost said vulgarapologetic pretext that jesus was using ad hominem arguments or accommodating his better knowledge to popular ignorance as well as to point out the inadmissibility of the other alternative that he shared the popular ignorance and to those who hold the latter view sarcasm is dealt out with no niggard hand      but they will find it difficult to persuade mankind that if he could     be mistaken on a matter of such strictly religious importance as the     value of the sacred literature of his countrymen he can be safely     trusted about anything else the trustworthiness of the old testament     is in fact inseparable from the trustworthiness of our lord jesus     christ and if we believe that he is the true light of the world we     shall close our ears against suggestions impairing the credit of those     jewish scriptures which have received the stamp of his divine authority     p 25  509  moreover i learn from the public journals that a brilliant and sharplycut view of orthodoxy of like hue and pattern was only the other day exhibited in that great theological kaleidoscope the pulpit of st marys recalling the time so long past by when a bampton lecturer in the same place performed the unusual feat of leaving the faith of oldfashioned christians undisturbed  yet many things have happened in the intervening thirtyone years the bampton lecturer of 1859 had to grapple only with the infant hercules of historical criticism and he is now a fullgrown athlete bearing on his shoulders the spoils of all the lions that have stood in his path surely a martyrs courage as well as a martyrs faith is needed by any one who at this time is prepared to stand by the following plea for the veracity of the pentateuch      adam according to the hebrew original was for 243 years contemporary     with methuselah who conversed for a hundred years with shem shem was     for fifty years contemporary with jacob who probably saw jochebed     mosess mother thus moses might by oral tradition have obtained the     history of abraham and even of the deluge at third hand and that of     the temptation and the fall at fifth hand      if it be grantedas it seems to bethat the great and stirring events     in a nations life will under ordinary circumstances be remembered     apart from all written memorials for the space of 150 years being     handed down through five generations it must be allowed even on mere     human grounds that the account which moses gives of the temptation and     the fall is to be depended upon if it passed through no more than four     hands between him and adam147  510  if the trustworthiness of our lord jesus christ is to stand or fall with the belief in the sudden transmutation of the chemical components of a womans body into sodium chloride or on the admitted reality of jonahs ejection safe and sound on the shores of the levant after three days seajourney in the stomach of a gigantic marine animal what possible pretext can there be for even hinting a doubt as to the precise truth of the longevity attributed to the patriarchs who that has swallowed the camel of jonahs journey will be guilty of the affectation of straining at such a historical gnatnay midgeas the supposition that the mother of moses was told the story of the flood by jacob who had it straight from shem who was on friendly terms with methuselah who knew adam quite well  yet by the strange irony of things the illustrious brother of the divine who propounded this remarkable theory has been the guide and foremost worker of that band of investigators of the records of assyria and of babylonia who have opened to our view not merely a new chapter but a new volume of primeval history relating to the very people who have the most numerous points of contact with the life of the ancient hebrews now whatever imperfections may yet obscure the full value of the mesopotamian records everything that has been clearly ascertained tends to the conclusion that the assignment of no more than 4000 years to the period between the time of the origin of mankind and that of augustus cæsar is wholly inadmissible therefore the biblical 511 chronology which canon rawlinson trusted so implicitly in 1859 is relegated by all serious critics to the domain of fable  but if scientific method operating in the region of history of philology of archæology in the course of the last thirty or forty years has become thus formidable to the theological dogmatist what may not be said about scientific method working in the province of physical science for if it be true that the canonical scriptures have innumerable points of contact with civil history it is no less true that they have almost as many with natural history and their accuracy is put to the test as severely by the latter as by the former the origin of the present state of the heavens and the earth is a problem which lies strictly within the province of physical science so is that of the origin of man among living things so is that of the physical changes which the earth has undergone since the origin of man so is that of the origin of the various races and nations of men with all their varieties of language and physical conformation whether the earth moves round the sun or the contrary whether the bodily and mental diseases of men and animals are caused by evil spirits or not whether there is such an agency as witchcraft or notall these are purely scientific questions and to all of them the canonical scriptures profess to give true answers and though nothing is more common than the assumption that these books come into conflict only with the speculative part of modern physical science no assumption can have less foundation 512  the antagonism between natural knowledge and the pentateuch would be as great if the speculations of our time had never been heard of it arises out of contradiction upon matters of fact the books of ecclesiastical authority declare that certain events happened in a certain fashion the books of scientific authority say they did not as it seems that this unquestionable truth has not yet penetrated among many of those who speak and write on these subjects it may be useful to give a full illustration of it and for that purpose i propose to deal at some length with the narrative of the noachian deluge given in genesis    the bampton lecturer in 1859 and the canon of st pauls in 1890 are in full agreement that this history is true in the sense in which i have defined historical truth the former is of opinion that the account attributed to berosus records a tradition      not drawn from the hebrew record much less the foundation of that     record yet coinciding with it in the most remarkable way the     babylonian version is tricked out with a few extravagances as the     monstrous size of the vessel and the translation of xisuthros but     otherwise it is the hebrew history down to its minutiæ p 64  moreover correcting niebuhr the bampton lecturer points out that the narrative of berosus implies the universality of the flood      it is plain that the waters are represented as prevailing above the     tops of the loftiest mountains in armeniaa height which must have     been seen to involve the submersion of all the countries with which the     babylonians were acquainted p 66  513  i may remark in passing that many people think the size of noahs ark monstrous considering the probable state of the art of shipbuilding only 1600 years after the origin of man while others are so unreasonable as to inquire why the translation of enoch is less an extravagance than that of xisuthros it is more important however to note that the universality of the deluge is recognised not merely as a part of the story but as a necessary consequence of some of its details the latest exponent of anglican orthodoxy as we have seen insists upon the accuracy of the pentateuchal history of the flood in a still more forcible manner it is cited as one of those very narratives to which the authority of the founder of christianity is pledged and upon the accuracy of which the trustworthiness of our lord jesus christ is staked just as others have staked it upon the truth of the histories of demoniac possession in the gospels  now when those who put their trust in scientific methods of ascertaining the truth in the province of natural history find themselves confronted and opposed on their own ground by ecclesiastical pretensions to better knowledge it is undoubtedly most desirable for them to make sure that their conclusions whatever they may be are well founded and if they put aside the unauthorised interference with their business and relegate the pentateuchal history to the region of pure fiction they are bound to assure themselves that they do so because the plainest teachings of nature apart from all doubtful 514 speculations are irreconcilable with the assertions which they reject  at the present time it is difficult to persuade serious scientific inquirers to occupy themselves in any way with the noachian deluge they look at you with a smile and a shrug and say they have more important matters to attend to than mere antiquarianism but it was not so in my youth at that time geologists and biologists could hardly follow to the end any path of inquiry without finding the way blocked by noah and his ark or by the first chapter of genesis and it was a serious matter in this country at any rate for a man to be suspected of doubting the literal truth of the diluvial or any other pentateuchal history the fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the geological club in 1824 was if i remember rightly the last occasion on which the late sir charles lyell spoke to even so small a public as the members of that body our veteran leader lighted up once more and referring to the difficulties which beset his early efforts to create a rational science of geology spoke with his wonted clearness and vigour of the social ostracism which pursued him after the publication of the principles of geology in 1830 on account of the obvious tendency of that noble work to discredit the pentateuchal accounts of the creation and the deluge if my younger contemporaries find this hard to believe i may refer them to a grave book on the doctrine of the deluge published eight years later and dedicated by its author to his father the then archbishop of york the first chapter 515 refers to the treatment of the mosaic deluge by dr buckland and mr lyell in the following terms      their respect for revealed religion has prevented them from arraying     themselves openly against the scriptural account of itmuch less do     they deny its truthbut they are in a great hurry to escape from the     consideration of it and evidently concur in the opinion of linnæus     that no proofs whatever of the deluge are to be discovered in the     structure of the earth p 1  and after an attempt to reply to some of lyells arguments which it would be cruel to reproduce the writer continues      when therefore upon such slender grounds it is determined in answer     to those who insist upon its universality that the mosaic deluge must     be considered a preternatural event far beyond the reach of     philosophical inquiry not only as to the causes employed to produce     it but as to the effects most likely to result from it that     determination wears an aspect of scepticism which however much soever     it may be unintentional in the mind of the writer yet cannot but     produce an evil impression on those who are already predisposed to carp     and cavil at the evidences of revelation pp 89  the kindly and courteous writer of these curious passages is evidently unwilling to make the geologists the victims of general opprobrium by pressing the obvious consequences of their teaching home one is therefore pained to think of the feelings with which if he lived so long as to become acquainted with the dictionary of the bible he must have perused the article noah written by a dignitary of the church for that standard compendium and published in 1863 for the doctrine of the universality of the deluge is therein altogether given up and i 516 permit myself to hope that a long criticism of the story from the point of view of natural science with which at the request of the learned theologian who wrote it i supplied him may in some degree have contributed towards this happy result  notwithstanding diligent search i have been unable to discover that the universality of the deluge has any defender left at least among those who have so far mastered the rudiments of natural knowledge as to be able to appreciate the weight of evidence against it for example when i turned to the speakers bible published under the sanction of high anglican authority i found the following judicial and judicious deliverance the skilful wording of which may adorn but does not hide the completeness of the surrender of the old teaching      without pronouncing too hastily on any fair inferences from the words     of scripture we may reasonably say that their most natural     interpretation is that the whole race of man had become grievously     corrupted since the faithful had intermingled with the ungodly that     the inhabited world was consequently filled with violence and that god     had decreed to destroy all mankind except one single family that     therefore all that portion of the earth perhaps as yet a very small     portion into which mankind had spread was overwhelmed with water the     ark was ordained to save one faithful family and lest that family on     the subsidence of the waters should find the whole country round them     a desert a pair of all the beasts of the land and of the fowls of the     air were preserved along with them and along with them went forth to     replenish the now desolated continent the words of scripture     confirmed as they are by universal tradition appear at least to mean     as much as this they do not necessarily mean more148  517  in the third edition of kittos cyclopædia of biblical literature 1876 the article deluge written by my friend the present distinguished head of the geological survey of great britain extinguishes the universality doctrine as thoroughly as might be expected from its authorship and since the writer of the article noah refers his readers to that entitled deluge it is to be supposed notwithstanding his generally orthodox tone that he does not dissent from its conclusions again the writers in herzogs realencyclopädie bd x 1882 and in riehms handwörterbuch 1884both works with a conservative leaningare on the same side and diestel149 in his full discussion of the subject remorselessly rejects the universality doctrine even that staunch opponent of scientific rationalismmay i say rationalityzöckler150 flinches from a distinct defence of the thesis any opposition to which well within my recollection was howled down by the orthodox as mere infidelity all that in his sore straits dr zöckler is able to do is to pronounce a faint commendation upon a particularly absurd attempt at reconciliation which would make out the noachian deluge to be a catastrophe which occurred at the end of the glacial epoch this hypothesis involves only the trifle of a physical revolution of which geology knows nothing and which if it secured the accuracy of the pentateuchal writer about the fact of the deluge would leave the details of his 518 account as irreconcilable with the truths of elementary physical science as ever thus i may be permitted to spare myself and my readers the weariness of a recapitulation of the overwhelming arguments against the universality of the deluge which they will now find for themselves stated as fully and forcibly as could be wished by anglican and other theologians whose orthodoxy and conservative tendencies have hitherto been above suspicion yet many fully admit and indeed nothing can be plainer that the pentateuchal narrator means to convey that as a matter of fact the whole earth known to him was inundated nor is it less obvious that unless all mankind with the exception of noah and his family were actually destroyed the references to the flood in the new testament are unintelligible  but i am quite aware that the strength of the demonstration that no universal deluge ever took place has produced a change of front in the army of apologetic writers they have imagined that the substitution of the adjective partial for universal will save the credit of the pentateuch and permit them after all without too many blushes to declare that the progress of modern science only strengthens the authority of moses nowhere have i found the case of the advocates of this method of escaping from the difficulties of the actual position better put than in the lecture of professor diestel to which i have referred after frankly admitting that the old doctrine of universality involves physical impossibilities he continues 519      all these difficulties fall away as soon as we give up the universality     of the deluge and imagine a partial flooding of the earth say in     western asia but have we a right to do so the narrative speaks of     the whole earth but what is the meaning of this expression surely     not the whole surface of the earth according to the ideas of modern     geographers but at most according to the conceptions of the biblical     author this very simple conclusion however is never drawn by too     many readers of the bible but one need only cast ones eyes over the     tenth chapter of genesis in order to become acquainted with the     geographical horizon of the jews in the north it was bounded by the     black sea and the mountains of armenia extended towards the east very     little beyond the tigris hardly reached the apex of the persian gulf     passed then through the middle of arabia and the red sea went     southward through abyssinia and then turned westward by the frontiers     of egypt and inclosed the easternmost islands of the mediterranean p     11  the justice of this observation must be admitted no less than the further remark that in still earlier times the pastoral hebrews very probably had yet more restricted notions of what constituted the whole earth moreover i for one fully agree with professor diestel that the motive or generative incident of the whole story is to be sought in the occasionally excessive and desolating floods of the euphrates and the tigris  let us provisionally accept the theory of a partial deluge and try to form a clear mental picture of the occurrence let us suppose that for forty days and forty nights such a vast quantity of water was poured upon the ground that the whole surface of mesopotamia was covered by water to a depth certainly greater probably much greater than fifteen cubits or 520 twenty feet gen vii 20 the inundation prevails upon the earth for one hundred and fifty days and then the flood gradually decreases until on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark which had previously floated on its surface grounds upon the mountains of ararat151 gen viii 34 then as diestel has acutely pointed out sintflut p 13 we are to imagine the further subsidence of the flood to take place so gradually that it was not until nearly two months and ahalf after this time that is to say on the first day of the tenth month that the tops of the mountains became visible hence it follows that if the ark drew even as much as twenty feet of water the level of the inundation fell very slowlyat a rate of only a few inches a dayuntil the top of the mountain on which it rested became visible this is an amount of movement which if it took place in the sea would be overlooked by ordinary people on the shore but the mesopotamian plain slopes gently from an elevation of 500 or 600 feet at its northern end to the sea at its southern end with hardly so much as a notable ridge to break its uniform flatness for 300 to 400 miles these being the conditions of the case the following inquiry naturally presents itself not be it observed as a recondite problem generated by modern speculation but as a plain suggestion flowing out of that very ordinary and archaic piece of knowledge that water cannot be piled up 521 in a heap like sand or that it seeks the lowest level when after 150 days the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained gen viii 2 what prevented the mass of water several possibly very many fathoms deep which covered say the present site of bagdad from sweeping seaward in a furious torrent and in a very few hours leaving not only the tops of the mountains but the whole plain save any minor depressions bare how could its subsidence by any possibility be an affair of weeks and months  and if this difficulty is not enough let any one try to imagine how a mass of water several perhaps very many fathoms deep could be accumulated on a flat surface of land rising well above the sea and separated from it by no sort of barrier most people know lords cricketground would it not be an absurd contradiction to our common knowledge of the properties of water to imagine that if all the mains of all the waterworks of london were turned on to it they could maintain a heap of water twenty feet deep over its level surface is it not obvious that the water whatever momentary accumulation might take place at first would not stop there but that it would dash like a mighty millrace southwards down the gentle slope which ends in the thames and is it not further obvious that whatever depth of water might be maintained over the cricketground so long as all the mains poured on to it anything which floated there would be speedily whirled away by the current like a cork in a gutter when the rain pours 522 but if this is so then it is no less certain that noahs deeply laden sailless oarless and rudderless craft if by good fortune it escaped capsizing in whirlpools or having its bottom knocked into holes by snags like those which prove fatal even to wellbuilt steamers on the mississippi in our day would have speedily found itself a good way down the persian gulf and not long after in the indian ocean somewhere between arabia and hindostan even if eventually the ark might have gone ashore with other jetsam and flotsam on the coasts of arabia or of hindostan or of the maldives or of madagascar its return to the mountains of ararat would have been a miracle more stupendous than all the rest  thus the last state of the wouldbe reconcilers of the story of the deluge with fact is worse than the first all that they have done is to transfer the contradictions to established truth from the region of science proper to that of common information and common sense for really the assertion that the surface of a body of deep water to which no addition was made and which there was nothing to stop from running into the sea sank at the rate of only a few inches or even feet a day simply outrages the most ordinary and familiar teachings of every mans daily experience a child may see the folly of it  in addition i may remark that the necessary assumption of the partial deluge hypothesis if it is confined to mesopotamia that the hebrew writer must have meant low hills when he said high mountains is quite untenable on the eastern side of the 523 mesopotamian plain the snowy peaks of the frontier ranges of persia are visible from bagdad152 and even the most ignorant herdsmen in the neighbourhood of ur of the chaldees near its western limit could hardly have been unacquainted with the comparatively elevated plateau of the syrian desert which lay close at hand but surely we must suppose the biblical writer to be acquainted with the highlands of palestine and with the masses of the sinaitic peninsula which soar more than 8000 feet above the sea if he knew of no higher elevations and if so he could not well have meant to refer to mere hillocks when he said that all the high mountains which were under the whole heaven were covered genesis vii 19 even the hillcountry of galilee reaches an elevation of 4000 feet and a flood which covered it could by no possibility have been other than universal in its superficial extent water really cannot be got to stand at say 4000 feet above the sealevel over palestine without covering the rest of the globe to the same height even if in the course of noahs six hundredth year some prodigious convulsion had sunk the whole region inclosed within the horizon of the geographical knowledge of the israelites by that much and another had pushed it up again just in time to catch the ark upon the mountains of ararat matters are not much mended i am afraid to think of what would have become of a vessel so little seaworthy as the ark and of its very numerous passengers 524 under the peculiar obstacles to quiet flotation which such rapid movements of depression and upheaval would have generated  thus in view not i repeat of the recondite speculations of infidel philosophers but in the face of the plainest and most commonplace of ascertained physical facts the story of the noachian deluge has no more claim to credit than has that of deucalion and whether it was or was not suggested by the familiar acquaintance of its originators with the effects of unusually great overflows of the tigris and euphrates it is utterly devoid of historical truth    that is in my judgment the necessary result of the application of criticism based upon assured physical knowledge to the story of the deluge and it is satisfactory that the criticism which is based not upon literary and historical speculations but upon wellascertained facts in the departments of literature and history tends to exactly the same conclusion  for i find this much agreed upon by all biblical scholars of repute that the story of the deluge in genesis is separable into at least two sets of statements and that when the statements thus separated are recombined in their proper order each set furnishes an account of the event coherent and complete within itself but in some respects discordant with that afforded by the other set this fact as i understand is not disputed whether one of these is the work of an elohist and the other of a jehovist narrator whether the two have been pieced together in this 525 strange fashion because in the estimation of the compilers and editors of the pentateuch they had equal and independent authority or not or whether there is some other way of accounting for itare questions the answers to which do not affect the fact if possible i avoid à priori arguments but still i think it may be urged without imprudence that a narrative having this structure is hardly such as might be expected from a writer possessed of full and infallibly accurate knowledge once more it would seem that it is not necessarily the mere inclination of the sceptical spirit to question everything or the wilful blindness of infidels which prompts grave doubts as to the value of a narrative thus curiously unlike the ordinary run of veracious histories  but the voice of archæological and historical criticism still has to be heard and it gives forth no uncertain sound the marvellous recovery of the records of an antiquity far superior to any that can be ascribed to the pentateuch which has been effected by the decipherers of cuneiform characters has put us in possession of a series once more not of speculations but of facts which have a most remarkable bearing upon the question of the trustworthiness of the narrative of the flood it is established that for centuries before the asserted migration of terah from ur of the chaldees which according to the orthodox interpreters of the pentateuch took place after the year 2000 bc lower mesopotamia was the seat of a civilisation in which art and science and literature had attained a development formerly unsuspected or 526 if there were faint reports of it treated as fabulous and it is also no matter of speculation but a fact that the libraries of these people contain versions of a long epic poem one of the twelve books of which tells a story of a deluge which in a number of its leading features corresponds with the story attributed to berosus no less than with the story given in genesis with curious exactness thus the correctness of canon rawlinsons conclusion cited above that the story of berosus was neither drawn from the hebrew record nor is the foundation of it can hardly be questioned it is highly probable if not certain that berosus relied upon one of the versions for there seem to have been several of the old babylonian epos extant in his time and if that is a reasonable conclusion why is it unreasonable to believe that the two stories which the hebrew compiler has put together in such an inartistic fashion were ultimately derived from the same source i say ultimately because it does not at all follow that the two versions possibly trimmed by the jehovistic writer on the one hand and by the elohistic on the other to suit hebrew requirements may not have been current among the israelites for ages and they may have acquired great authority before they were combined in the pentateuch  looking at the convergence of all these lines of evidence to the one conclusionthat the story of the flood in genesis is merely a bowdlerised version of one of the oldest pieces of purely fictitious literature extant that whether this is or is not its origin the 527 events asserted in it to have taken place assuredly never did take place further that in point of fact the story in the plain and logically necessary sense of its words has long since been given up by orthodox and conservative commentators of the established churchi can but admire the courage and clear foresight of the anglican divine who tells us that we must be prepared to choose between the trustworthiness of scientific method and the trustworthiness of that which the church declares to be divine authority for to my mind this declaration of war to the knife against secular science even in its most elementary form this rejection without a moments hesitation of any and all evidence which conflicts with theological dogmais the only position which is logically reconcilable with the axioms of orthodoxy if the gospels truly report that which an incarnation of the god of truth communicated to the world then it surely is absurd to attend to any other evidence touching matters about which he made any clear statement or the truth of which is distinctly implied by his words if the exact historical truth of the gospels is an axiom of christianity it is as just and right for a christian to say let us close our ears against suggestions of scientific critics as it is for the man of science to refuse to waste his time upon circlesquarers and flatearth fanatics  it is commonly reported that the manifesto by which the canon of st pauls proclaims that he nails the colours of the straitest biblical infallibility to the mast of the ship ecclesiastical was put forth as a 528 counterblast to lux mundi and that the passages which i have more particularly quoted are directed against the essay on the holy spirit and inspiration in that collection of treatises by anglican divines of high standing who must assuredly be acquitted of conscious infidel proclivities i fancy that rumour must for once be right for it is impossible to imagine a more direct and diametrical contradiction than that between the passages from the sermon cited above and those which follow      what is questioned is that our lords words foreclose certain critical     positions as to the character of old testament literature for example     does his use of jonahs resurrection as a type of his own depend in     any real degree upon whether it is historical fact or allegory once     more our lord uses the time before the flood to illustrate the     carelessness of men before his own coming in referring to the flood     he certainly suggests that he is treating it as typical for he     introduces circumstanceseating and drinking marrying and giving in     marriagewhich have no counterpart in the original narrative p     3589  while insisting on the flow of inspiration through the whole of the old testament the essayist does not admit its universality here also the new apologetic demands a partial flood      but does the inspiration of the recorder guarantee the exact historical     truth of what he records and in matter of fact can the record with     due regard to legitimate historical criticism be pronounced true now     to the latter of these two questions and they are quite distinct     questions we may reply that there is nothing to prevent our believing     as our faith strongly disposes us to believe that the record from     abraham downward is in substance in the strict sense historical p     351  it would appear therefore that there is nothing 529 to prevent our believing that the record from abraham upward consists of stories in the strict sense unhistorical and that the preabrahamic narratives are mere moral and religious types and parables  i confess i soon lose my way when i try to follow those who walk delicately among types and allegories a certain passion for clearness forces me to ask bluntly whether the writer means to say that jesus did not believe the stories in question or that he did when jesus spoke as of a matter of fact that the flood came and destroyed them all did he believe that the deluge really took place or not it seems to me that as the narrative mentions noahs wife and his sons wives there is good scriptural warranty for the statement that the antediluvians married and were given in marriage and i should have thought that their eating and drinking might be assumed by the firmest believer in the literal truth of the story moreover i venture to ask what sort of value as an illustration of gods methods of dealing with sin has an account of an event that never happened if no flood swept the careless people away how is the warning of more worth than the cry of wolf when there is no wolf if jonahs three days residence in the whale is not an admitted reality how could it warrant belief in the coming resurrection if lots wife was not turned into a pillar of salt the bidding those who turn back from the narrow path to remember it is morally about on a level with telling a naughty child that a bogy is 530 coming to fetch it away suppose that a conservative orator warns his hearers to beware of great political and social changes lest they end as in france in the domination of a robespierre what becomes not only of his argument but of his veracity if he personally does not believe that robespierre existed and did the deeds attributed to him  like all other attempts to reconcile the results of scientificallyconducted investigation with the demands of the outworn creeds of ecclesiasticism the essay on inspiration is just such a failure as must await mediation when the mediator is unable properly to appreciate the weight of the evidence for the case of one of the two parties the question of inspiration really possesses no interest for those who have cast ecclesiasticism and all its works aside and have no faith in any source of truth save that which is reached by the patient application of scientific methods theories of inspiration are speculations as to the means by which the authors of statements in the bible or elsewhere have been led to say what they have saidand it assumes that natural agencies are insufficient for the purpose i prefer to stop short of this problem finding it more profitable to undertake the inquiry which naturally precedes itnamely are these statements true or false if they are true it may be worth while to go into the question of their supernatural generation if they are false it certainly is not worth mine  now not only do i hold it to be proven that the story of the deluge is a pure fiction but i have no 531 hesitation in affirming the same thing of the story of the creation153 between these two lies the story of the creation of man and woman and their fall from primitive innocence which is even more monstrously improbable than either of the other two though from the nature of the case it is not so easily capable of direct refutation it can be demonstrated that the earth took longer than six days in the making and that the deluge as described is a physical impossibility but there is no proving especially to those who are perfect in the art of closing their ears to that which they do not wish to hear that a snake did not speak or that eve was not made out of one of adams ribs  the compiler of genesis in its present form evidently had a definite plan in his mind his countrymen like all other men were doubtless curious to know how the world began how men and especially wicked men came into being and how existing nations and races arose among the descendants of one stock and finally what was the history of their own particular tribe they like ourselves desired to solve the four great problems of cosmogeny anthropogeny ethnogeny and geneogeny the pentateuch 532 furnishes the solutions which appeared satisfactory to its author one of these as we have seen was borrowed from a babylonian fable and i know of no reason to suspect any different origin for the rest now i would ask is the story of the fabrication of eve to be regarded as one of those preabrahamic narratives the historical truth of which is an open question in face of the reference to it in a speech unhappily famous for the legal oppression to which it has been wrongfully forced to lend itself      have ye not read that he which made them from the beginning made them     male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave his father     and mother and cleave to his wife and the twain shall become one     flesh matt xix 5  if divine authority is not here claimed for the twentyfourth verse of the second chapter of genesis what is the value of language and again i ask if one may play fast and loose with the story of the fall as a type or allegory what becomes of the foundation of pauline theology      for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the     dead for as in adam all die so also in christ shall all be made alive     1 corinthians xv 21 22  if adam may be held to be no more real a personage than prometheus and if the story of the fall is merely an instructive type comparable to the profound promethean mythus what value has pauls dialectic  while therefore every rightminded man must sympathise with the efforts of those theologians who 533 have not been able altogether to close their ears to the still small voice of reason to escape from the fetters which ecclesiasticism has forged the melancholy fact remains that the position they have taken up is hopelessly untenable it is raked alike by the oldfashioned artillery of the churches and by the fatal weapons of precision with which the enfants perdus of the advancing forces of science are armed they must surrender or fall back into a more sheltered position and it is possible that they may long find safety in such retreat  it is indeed probable that the proportional number of those who will distinctly profess their belief in the transubstantiation of lots wife and the anticipatory experience of submarine navigation by jonah in water standing fathoms deep on the side of a declivity without anything to hold it up and in devils who enter swinewill not increase but neither is there ground for much hope that the proportion of those who cast aside these fictions and adopt the consequence of that repudiation are for some generations likely to constitute a majority our age is a day of compromises the present and the near future seem given over to those happily if curiously constituted people who see as little difficulty in throwing aside any amount of postabrahamic scriptural narrative as the authors of lux mundi see in sacrificing the preabrahamic stories and having distilled away every inconvenient matter of fact in christian history continue to pay divine honours to the residue there really seems to be no reason why the next generation 534 should not listen to a bampton lecture modelled upon that addressed to the last      time wasand that not very long agowhen all the relations of     biblical authors concerning the old world were received with a ready     belief and an unreasoning and uncritical faith accepted with equal     satisfaction the narrative of the captivity and the doings of moses at     the court of pharaoh the account of the apostolic meeting in the     epistle to the galatians and that of the fabrication of eve we can     most of us remember when in this country the whole story of the     exodus and even the legend of jonah were seriously placed before boys     as history and discoursed of in as dogmatic a tone as the tale of     agincourt or the history of the norman conquest      but all this is now changed the last century has seen the growth of     scientific criticism to its full strength the whole world of history     has been revolutionised and the mythology which embarrassed earnest     christians has vanished as an evil mist the lifting of which has only     more fully revealed the lineaments of infallible truth no longer in     contact with fact of any kind faith stands now and for ever proudly     inaccessible to the attacks of the infidel  so far the apologist of the future why not cantabit vacuus                                        535  xiv  the keepers of the herd of swine  i had fondly hoped that mr gladstone and i had come to an end of disputation and that the hatchet of war was finally superseded by the calumet which as mr gladstone i believe objects to tobacco i was quite willing to smoke for both but i have had once again to discover that the adage that whoso seeks peace will ensue it is a somewhat hasty generalisation the renowned warrior with whom it is my misfortune to be opposed in most things has dug up the axe and is on the warpath once more the weapon has been wielded with all the dexterity which long practice has conferred on a past master in craft whether of wood or state and i have reason to believe that the simpler sort of the great tribe which he heads imagine that my scalp is already on its way to adorn their big chiefs wigwam i am glad therefore to be able to relieve any anxieties which my friends may entertain without delay i assure them that my skull retains its normal covering and that though naturally i may have felt alarmed nothing serious has happened my doughty 536 adversary has merely performed a war dance and his blows have for the most part cut the air i regret to add however that by misadventure and i am afraid i must say carelessness he has inflicted one or two severe contusions on himself  when the noise of approaching battle roused me from the dreams of peace which occupy my retirement i was glad to observe since i must fight that the campaign was to be opened upon a new field when the contest raged over the pentateuchal myth of the creation mr gladstones manifest want of acquaintance with the facts and principles involved in the discussion no less than with the best literature on his own side of the subject gave me the uncomfortable feeling that i had my adversary at a disadvantage the sun of science at my back was in his eyes but on the present occasion we are happily on an equality history and biblical criticism are as much or as little my vocation as they are that of mr gladstone the blinding from too much light or the blindness from too little may be presumed to be equally shared by both of us  mr gladstone takes up his new position in the country of the gadarenes his strategic sense justly leads him to see that the authority of the teachings of the synoptic gospels touching the nature of the spiritual world turns upon the acceptance or the rejection of the gadarene and other like stories as we accept or repudiate such histories as that of the possessed pigs so shall we 537 accept or reject the witness of the synoptics to such miraculous interventions  it is exactly because these stories constitute the keystone of the orthodox arch that i originally drew attention to them and in spite of my longing for peace i am truly obliged to mr gladstone for compelling me to place my case before the public once more it may be thought that this is a work of supererogation by those who are aware that my essay is the subject of attack in a work so largely circulated as the impregnable rock of holy scripture and who may possibly in their simplicity assume that it must be truthfully set forth in that work but the warmest admirers of mr gladstone will hardly be prepared to maintain that mathematical accuracy in stating the opinions of an opponent is the most prominent feature of his controversial method and what follows will show that in the present case the desire to be fair and accurate the existence of which i am bound to assume has not borne as much fruit as might have been expected  in referring to the statement of the narrators that the herd of swine perished in consequence of the entrance into them of the demons by the permission or order of jesus of nazareth i said  everything that i know of law and justice convinces me that the wanton destruction of other peoples property is a misdemeanour of evil example nineteenth century february 1889 p 172  mr gladstone has not found it convenient to cite this passage and in view of various considerations 538 i dare not assume that he would assent to it without sundry subtle modifications which for me might possibly rob it of its argumentative value but until the proposition is seriously controverted i shall assume it to be true and content myself with warning the reader that neither he nor i have any grounds for assuming mr gladstones concurrence with this caution i proceed to remark that i think it may be granted that the people whose herd of 2000 swine more or fewer was suddenly destroyed suffered great loss and damage and it is quite certain that the narrators of the gadarene story do not in any way refer to the point of morality and legality thus raised as i said they show no inkling of the moral and legal difficulties which arise  such being the facts of the case i submit that for those who admit the principle laid down the conclusion which i have drawn necessarily follows though i repeat that since mr gladstone does not explicitly admit the principle i am far from suggesting that he is bound by its logical consequences however i distinctly repeat the opinion that any one who acted in the way described in the story would in my judgment be guilty of a misdemeanour of evil example about that point i desire to leave no ambiguity whatever and it follows that if i believed the story i should have no hesitation in applying this judgment to the chief actor in it  but if any one will do me the favour to turn to the paper in which these passages occur he will find that a considerable part of it is devoted to the 539 exposure of the familiar trick of the counsel for creeds who when they wish to profit by the easily stirred odium theologicum are careful to confuse disbelief in a narrative of a mans act or disapproval of the acts as narrated with disbelieving and vilipending the man himself if i say that according to paragraphs in several newspapers my valued separatist friend a b has houghed a lot of cattle which he considered to be unlawfully in the possession of an irish landgrabber that in my opinion any such act is a misdemeanour of evil example but that i utterly disbelieve the whole story and have no doubt that it is a mere fabrication it really appears to me that if any one charges me with calling a b an immoral misdemeanant i should be justified in using very strong language respecting either his sanity or his veracity and if an analogous charge has been brought in reference to the gadarene story there is certainly no excuse producible on account of any lack of plain speech on my part surely no language can be more explicit than that which follows  i can discern no escape from this dilemma either jesus said what he is reported to have said or he did not in the former case it is inevitable that his authority on matters connected with the unseen world should be roughly shaken in the latter the blow falls upon the authority of the synoptic gospels p 173 the choice then lies between discrediting those who compiled the gospel biographies and disbelieving the master whom 540 they simple souls thought to honour by preserving such traditions of the exercise of his authority over satans invisible world p 174 and i leave no shadow of doubt as to my own choice after what has been said i do not think that any sensible man unless he happen to be angry will accuse me of contradicting the lord and his apostles if i reiterate my total disbelief in the whole gadarene story p 178  i am afraid therefore that mr gladstone must have been exceedingly angry when he committed himself to such a statement as follows      so then after eighteen centuries of worship offered to our lord by     the most cultivated the most developed and the most progressive     portion of the human race it has been reserved to a scientific     inquirer to discover that he was no better than a lawbreaker and an     evildoer how in such a matter came the honours of originality to     be reserved to our time and to professor huxley pp 269 270  truly the hatchet is hardly a weapon of precision but would seem to have rather more the character of the boomerang which returns to damage the reckless thrower doubtless such incidents are somewhat ludicrous but they have a very serious side and if i rated the opinion of those who blindly follow mr gladstones leading but not light in these matters much higher than the great duke of wellingtons famous standard of minimum value i think i might fairly beg them to reflect upon the general bearings of this particular example of his controversial method i imagine it can hardly commend itself to their cool judgment 541  after this tragicomical ending to what an old historian calls a robustious and rough coming on and after some praises of the provisions of the mosaic law in the matter of not eating porkin which as pork disagrees with me and for some other reasons i am much disposed to concur though i do not see what they have to do with the matter in handcomes the serious onslaught      mr huxley exercising his rapid judgment on the text does not appear     to have encumbered himself with the labour of inquiring what anybody     else had known or said about it he has thus missed a point which might     have been set up in support of his accusation against our lord p     273  unhappily for my comfort i have been much exercised in controversy during the past thirty years and the only compensation for the loss of time and the trials of temper which it has inflicted upon me is that i have come to regard it as a branch of the fine arts and to take an impartial and æsthetic interest in the way it is conducted even by those whose efforts are directed against myself now from the purely artistic point of view which as we are all being told has nothing to do with morals i consider it an axiom that one should never appear to doubt that the other side has performed the elementary duty of acquiring proper elementary information unless there is demonstrative evidence to the contrary and i think though i admit that this may be a purely subjective appreciation that unless you are quite certain there is a want of finish as a great 542 master of disputation once put it about the suggestion that your opponent has missed a point on his own side because it may happen that he has not missed it at all but only thought it unworthy of serious notice and if he proves that the suggestion looks foolish  merely noting the careful repetition of a charge the absurdity of which has been sufficiently exposed above i now ask my readers to accompany me on a little voyage of discovery in search of the side on which the rapid judgment and the ignorance of the literature of the subject lie i think i may promise them very little trouble and a good deal of entertainment  mr gladstone is of opinion that the gadarene swinefolk were hebrews bound by the mosaic law p 274 and he conceives that it has not occurred to me to learn what may be said in favour of and against this view he tells us that      some commentators have alleged the authority of josephus for stating     that gadara was a city of greeks rather than of jews from whence it     might be inferred that to keep swine was innocent and lawful p 273  mr gladstone then goes on to inform his readers that in his painstaking search after truth he has submitted to the labour of personally examining the writings of josephus moreover in a note he positively exhibits an acquaintance in addition with the works of bishop wordsworth and of archbishop trench and even shows that he has read hudsons commentary on josephus and yet people say that 543 our biblical critics do not equal the germans in research but mr gladstones citation of cuvier and sir john herschel about the creation myth and his ignorance of all the best modern writings on his own side produced a great impression on my mind i have had the audacity to suspect that his acquaintance with what has been done in biblical history might stand at no higher level than his information about the natural sciences however unwillingly i have felt bound to consider the possibility that mr gladstones labours in this matter may have carried him no further than josephus and the worthy but somewhat antique episcopal and other authorities to whom he refers that even his reading of josephus may have been of the most cursory nature directed not to the understanding of his author but to the discovery of useful controversial matter and that in view of the not inconsiderable misrepresentation of my statements to which i have drawn attention it might be that mr gladstones exposition of the evidence of josephus was not more trustworthy i proceed to show that my previsions have been fully justified i doubt if controversial literature contains anything more piquant than the story i have to unfold  that i should be reproved for rapidity of judgment is very just however quaint the situation of mr gladstone as the reprover may seem to people blessed with a sense of humour but it is a quality the defects of which have been painfully obvious to me all my life and i try to keep my pegasusat 544 best a poor shetland variety of that species of quadrupedat a respectable jogtrot by loading him heavily with bales of reading those who took the trouble to study my paper in good faith and not for mere controversial purposes have a right to know that something more than a hasty glimpse of two or three passages of josephus even with as many episcopal works thrown in lay at the back of the few paragraphs i devoted to the gadarene story i proceed to set forth as briefly as i can some results of that preparatory work my artistic principles do not permit me at present to express a doubt that mr gladstone was acquainted with the facts i am about to mention when he undertook to write but if he did know them then both what he has said and what he has not said his assertions and his omissions alike will require a paragraph to themselves  the common consent of the synoptic gospels affirms that the miraculous transference of devils from a man or men to sundry pigs took place somewhere on the eastern shore of the lake of tiberias on the other side of the sea over against galilee the western shore being without doubt included in the latter province but there is no such concord when we come to the name of the part of the eastern shore on which according to the story jesus and his disciples landed in the revised version matthew calls it the country of the gadarenes luke and mark have gerasenes in sundry very ancient manuscripts gergesenes occurs 545  the existence of any place called gergesa however is declared by the weightiest authorities whom i have consulted to be very questionable and no such town is mentioned in the list of the cities of the decapolis in the territory of which as it would seem from mark v 20 the transaction was supposed to take place about gerasa on the other hand there hangs no such doubt it was a large and important member of the group of the decapolitan cities but gerasa is more than thirty miles distant from the nearest part of the lake of tiberias while the city mentioned in the narrative could not have been very far off the scene of the event however as gerasa was a very important hellenic city not much more than a score of miles from gadara it is easily imaginable that a locality which was part of decapolitan territory may have been spoken of as belonging to one of the two cities when it really appertained to the other after weighing all the arguments no doubt remains on my mind that gadarene is the proper reading at the period under consideration gadara appears to have been a goodsized fortified town about two miles in circumference it was a place of considerable strategic importance inasmuch as it lay on a high ridge at the point of intersection of the roads from tiberias scythopolis damascus and gerasa three miles north from it where the tiberias road descended into the valley of the hieromices lay the famous hot springs and the fashionable baths of amatha on the northeast side the remains of the extensive necropolis of gadara are still to be seen 546 innumerable sepulchral chambers are excavated in the limestone cliffs and many of them still contain sarcophaguses of basalt while not a few are converted into dwellings by the inhabitants of the present village of um keis the distance of gadara from the southeastern shore of the lake of tiberias is less than seven miles the nearest of the other cities of the decapolis to the north is hippos which also lay some seven miles off on the southeastern corner of the shore of the lake in accordance with the ancient hellenic practice that each city should be surrounded by a certain amount of territory amenable to its jurisdiction154 and on the other grounds it may be taken for certain that the intermediate country was divided between gadara and hippos and that the citizens of gadara had free access to a port on the lake hence the title of country of the gadarenes applied to the locality of the porcine catastrophe becomes easily intelligible the swine may well be imagined to have been feeding as they do now in the adjacent region on the hillsides which slope somewhat steeply down to the lake from the northern boundary wall of the valley of the hieromices nahr yarmuk about halfway between the city and the shore and doubtless lay well within the territory of the polis of gadara  the proof that gadara was to all intents and purposes a gentile and not a jewish city is complete 547 the date and the occasion of its foundation are unknown but it certainly existed in the third century bc antiochus the great annexed it to his dominions in bc 198 after this during the brief revival of jewish autonomy alexander jannæus took it and for the first time so far as the records go it fell under jewish rule155 from this it was rescued by pompey bc 63 who rebuilt the city and incorporated it with the province of syria in gratitude to the romans for the dissolution of a hated union the gadarenes adopted the pompeian era on their coinage gadara was a commercial centre of some importance and therefore it may be assumed jews settled in it as they settled in almost all considerable gentile cities but a wholly mistaken estimate of the magnitude of the jewish colony has been based upon the notion that gabinius proconsul of syria in 5755 bc seated one of the five sanhedrims in gadara schürer has pointed out that what he really did was to lodge one of them in gazara far away on the other side of the jordan this is one of the many errors which have arisen out of the confusion of the names gadara gazara and gabara  augustus made a present of gadara to herod the great as an appanage personal to himself and upon herods death recognising it to be a grecian city like hippos and gaza156 he transferred it back to its former 548 place in the province of syria that herod made no effort to judaise his temporary possession but rather the contrary is obvious from the fact that the coins of gadara while under his rule bear the image of augustus with the superscription greek sebastosa flying in the face of jewish prejudices which even he did not dare to venture upon in judæa and i may remark that if my cotrustee of the british museum had taken the trouble to visit the splendid numismatic collection under our charge he might have seen two coins of gadara one of the time of tiberius and the other of that of titus each bearing the effigies of the emperor on the obverse while the personified genius of the city is on the reverse of the former further the wellknown works of de saulcy and of ekhel would have supplied the information that from the time of augustus to that of gordian the gadarene coinage had the same thoroughly gentile character curious that a city of hebrews bound by the mosaic law should tolerate such a mint  whatever increase in population the ghetto of gadara may have undergone between bc 4 and ad 66 it nowise affected the gentile and antijudaic character of the city at the outbreak of the great war for josephus tells us that immediately after the great massacre at cæsarea the revolted jews laid waste the villages of the syrians and their neighbouring cities philadelphia and sebonitis and gerasa and pella and scythopolis and after them gadara and hippos wars ii xviii 1 i submit that if gadara had been a city of hebrews bound by the 549 mosaic law the ravaging of their territory by their brother jews in revenge for the massacre of the cæsarean jews by the gentile population of that place would surely have been a somewhat unaccountable proceeding but when we proceed a little further to the fifth section of the chapter in which this statement occurs the whole affair becomes intelligible enough      besides this murder at scythopolis the other cities rose up against     the jews that were among them those of askelon slew two thousand five     hundred and those of ptolemais two thousand and put not a few into     bonds those of tyre also put a great number to death but kept a     greater number in prison moreover those of hippos and those of gadara     did the like while they put to death the boldest of the jews but kept     those of whom they were most afraid in custody as did the rest of the     cities of syria according as they every one either hated them or were     afraid of them  josephus is not always trustworthy but he has no conceivable motive for altering facts here he speaks of contemporary events in which he himself took an active part and he characterises the cities in the way familiar to him for josephus gadara is just as much a gentile city as ptolemais it was reserved for his latest commentator either ignoring or ignorant of all this to tell us that gadara had a hebrew population bound by the mosaic law  in the face of all this evidence most of which has been put before serious students with full reference to the needful authorities and in a thoroughly judicial manner by schürer in his classical work157 one reads 550 with stupefaction the statement which mr gladstone has thought fit to put before the uninstructed public      some commentators have alleged the authority of josephus for stating     that gadara was a city of greeks rather than of jews from whence it     might be inferred that to keep swine was innocent and lawful this is     not quite the place for a critical examination of the matter but i     have examined it and have satisfied myself that josephus gives no     reason whatever to suppose that the population of gadara and still     less if less may be the population of the neighbourhood and least of     all the swineherding or lower portion of that population were other     than hebrews bound by the mosaic law pp 3734  even rapid judgment cannot be pleaded in excuse for this surprising statement because a note on the gadarene miracle is added in a special appendix in which the references are given to the passages of josephus by the improved interpretation of which mr gladstone has thus contrived to satisfy himself of the thing which is not one of these is antiquities xvii xiii 4 in which section i regret to say i can find no mention of gadara in antiquities xvii xi 4 however there is a passage which would appear to be that which mr gladstone means and i will give it in full although i have already cited part of it      there were also certain of the cities which paid tribute to archelaus     stratos tower and sebaste with joppa and jerusalem for as to gaza     gadara and hippos they were grecian cities which cæsar separated     from his government and added them to the province of syria  that is to say augustus simply restored the state of things which existed before he gave gadara then certainly a gentile city lying outside judæa to 551 herod as a mark of great personal favour yet mr gladstone can gravely tell those who are not in a position to check his statements      the sense seems to be not that these cities were inhabited by a greek     population but that they had politically been taken out of judæa and     added to syria which i presume was classified as simply hellenic a     portion of the great greek empire erected by alexander pp 2956  mr gladstones next reference is to the wars iii vii 1      so vespasian marched to the city gadara and took it upon the first     onset because he found it destitute of a considerable number of men     grown up fit for war he then came into it and slew all the youth the     romans having no mercy on any age whatsoever and this was done out of     the hatred they bore the nation and because of the iniquity they had     been guilty of in the affair of cestius  obviously then gadara was an ultrajewish city qed but a student trained in the use of weapons of precision rather than in that of rhetorical tomahawks has had many and painful warnings to look well about him before trusting an argument to the mercies of a passage the context of which he has not carefully considered if mr gladstone had not been too much in a hurry to turn his imaginary prize to accountif he had paused just to look at the preceding chapter of josephushe would have discovered that his much haste meant very little speed he would have found wars iii vi 2 that vespasian marched from his base the port of ptolemais acre on the shores of the mediterranean into galilee and having dealt with the socalled gadara was minded 552 to finish with jotapata a strong place about fourteen miles southeast of ptolemais into which josephus who at first had fled to tiberias eventually threw himselfvespasian arriving before jotapata the very next day now if any one will take a decent map of ancient palestine in hand he will see that jotapata as i have said lies about fourteen miles in a straight line eastsoutheast of ptolemais while a certain town gabara which was also held by the jews is situated about the same distance to the east of that port nothing can be more obvious than that vespasian wishing to advance from ptolemais into galilee could not afford to leave these strongholds in the possession of the enemy and as gabara would lie on his left flank when he moved to jotapata he took that city whence his communications with his base could easily be threatened first it might really have been fair evidence of demoniac possession if the best general of rome had marched forty odd miles as the crow flies through hostile galilee to take a city which moreover had just tried to abolish its jewish population on the other side of the jordan and then marched back again to a place fourteen miles off his startingpoint158 one would think that the most careless of readers must be startled by this incongruity into inquiring whether there might not be something wrong with the text and if he had done so he would 553 have easily discovered that since the time of reland a century and a half ago careful scholars have read gabara for gadara159  once more i venture to point out that training in the use of the weapons of precision of science may have its value in historical studies if only in preventing the occurrence of droll blunders in geography  in the third citation wars iv vii josephus tells us that vespasian marched against gadara which he calls the metropolis of peræa it was possibly the seat of a common festival of the decapolitan cities and entered it without opposition the wealthy and powerful citizens having opened negotiations with him without the knowledge of an opposite party who as being inferior in number to their enemies who were within the city and seeing the romans very near the city resolved to fly before doing so however they after a fashion unfortunately too common among the zealots murdered and shockingly mutilated dolesus a man of the first rank who had promoted the embassy to vespasian and then ran out of the city hereupon the people of gadara surely not this time hebrews bound by the mosaic law received vespasian with joyful acclamations voluntarily pulled down their wall so that the city could not in future be used as a fortress by the jews and accepted a roman garrison for their future protection granting that this gadara really is the city of the gadarenes the reference without citation to 554 the passage in support of mr gladstones contention seems rather remarkable taken in conjunction with the shortly antecedent ravaging of the gadarene territory by the jews in fact better proof could hardly be expected of the real state of the case namely that the population of gadara and notably the wealthy and respectable part of it was thoroughly hellenic though as in cæsarea and elsewhere among the palestinian cities the rabble contained a considerable body of fanatical jews whose reckless ferocity made them even though a mere minority of the population a standing danger to the city  thus mr gladstones conclusion from his study of josephus that the population of gadara were hebrews bound by the mosaic law turns out to depend upon nothing better than a marvellously complete misinterpretation of what that author says combined with equally marvellous geographical misunderstandings long since exposed and rectified while the positive evidence that gadara like other cities of the decapolis was thoroughly hellenic in organisation and essentially gentile in population is overwhelming  and that being the fact of the matter patent to all who will take the trouble to inquire about what has been said about it however obscure to those who merely talk of so doing the thesis that the gadarene swineherds or owners were jews violating the mosaic law shows itself to be an empty and most unfortunate guess but really whether they that kept the swine were jews or whether they were gentiles is a 555 consideration which has no relevance whatever to my case the legal provisions which alone had authority over an inhabitant of the country of the gadarenes were the gentile laws sanctioned by the roman suzerain of the province of syria just as the only law which has authority in england is that recognised by the sovereign legislature jewish communities in england may have their private code as they doubtless had in gadara but an english magistrate if called upon to enforce their peculiar laws would dismiss the complainants from the judgment seat let us hope with more politeness than gallio did in a like case but quite as firmly moreover in the matter of keeping pigs we may be quite certain that gadarene law left everybody free to do as he pleased indeed encouraged the practice rather than otherwise not only was pork one of the commonest and one of the most favourite articles of roman diet but to both greeks and romans the pig was a sacrificial animal of high importance sucking pigs played an important part in hellenic purificatory rites and everybody knows the significance of the roman suovetaurilia depicted on so many basreliefs  under these circumstances only the extreme need of a despairing reconciler drowning in a sea of adverse facts can explain the catching at such a poor straw as the reckless guess that the swineherds of the country of the gadarenes were erring jews doing a little clandestine business on their own account the endeavour to justify the asserted destruction of the swine by the analogy of breaking open a cask of 556 smuggled spirits and wasting their contents on the ground is curiously unfortunate does mr gladstone mean to suggest that a frenchman landing at dover and coming upon a cask of smuggled brandy in the course of a stroll along the cliffs has the right to break it open and waste its contents on the ground yet the party of galileans who according to the narrative landed and took a walk on the gadarene territory were as much foreigners in the decapolis as frenchmen would be at dover herod antipas their sovereign had no jurisdiction in the decapolisthey were strangers and aliens with no more right to interfere with a pigkeeping hebrew than i have a right to interfere with an english professor of the israelitic faith if i see a slice of ham on his plate according to the law of the country in which these galilean foreigners found themselves men might keep pigs if they pleased if the men who kept them were jews it might be permissible for the strangers to inform the religious authority acknowledged by the jews of gadara but to interfere themselves in such a matter was a step devoid of either moral or legal justification  suppose a modern english sabbatarian fanatic who believes on the strength of his interpretation of the fourth commandment that it is a deadly sin to work on the lords day sees a fellow puritan yielding to the temptation of getting in his harvest on a fine sunday morningis the former justified in setting fire to the latters corn would not an english court of justice speedily teach him better 557  in truth the government which permits private persons on any pretext especially pious and patriotic pretexts to take the law into their own hands fails in the performance of the primary duties of all governments while those who set the example of such acts or who approve them or who fail to disapprove them are doing their best to dissolve civil societythey are compassers of illegality and fautors of immorality  i fully understand that mr gladstone may not see the matter in this light he may possibly consider that the union of gadara with the decapolis by augustus was a blackguard transaction which deprived hellenic gadarene law of all moral force and that it was quite proper for a jewish galilean going back to the time when the land of the girgashites was given to his ancestors some 1500 years before to act as if the state of things which ought to obtain in territory which traditionally at any rate belonged to his forefathers did really exist and that being so i can only say i do not agree with him but leave the matter to the appreciation of those of our countrymen happily not yet the minority who believe that the first condition of enduring liberty is obedience to the law of the land    the end of the month drawing nigh i thought it well to send away the manuscript of the foregoing pages yesterday leaving open in my own mind the possibility of adding a succinct characterisation of mr gladstones controversial methods as illustrated 558 therein this morning however i had the pleasure of reading a speech which i think must satisfy the requirements of the most fastidious of controversial artists and there occurs in it so concise yet so complete a delineation of mr gladstones way of dealing with disputed questions of another kind that no poor effort of mine could better it as a description of the aspect which his treatment of scientific historical and critical questions presents to me      the smallest examination would have told a man of his capacity and of     his experience that he was uttering the grossest exaggerations that he     was basing arguments upon the slightest hypotheses and that his     discussions only had to be critically examined by the most careless     critic in order to show their intrinsic hollowness  those who have followed me through this paper will hardly dispute the justice of this judgment severe as it is but the chief secretary for ireland has science in the blood and has the advantage of a natural as well as a highly cultivated aptitude for the use of methods of precision in investigation and for the exact enunciation of the results thereby obtained                                        559  xv  illustrations of mr gladstones controversial methods  the series of essays in defence of the historical accuracy of the jewish and christian scriptures contributed by mr gladstone to good words having been revised and enlarged by their author appeared last year as a separate volume under the somewhat defiant title of the impregnable rock of holy scripture  the last of these essays entitled conclusion contains an attack or rather several attacks couched in language which certainly does not err upon the side of moderation or of courtesy upon statements and opinions of mine one of these assaults is a deliberately devised attempt not merely to rouse the theological prejudices ingrained in the majority of mr gladstones readers but to hold me up as a person who has endeavoured to besmirch the personal character of the object of their veneration for mr gladstone asserts that i have undertaken to try the character of our lord p 268 and he tells the many who are as i think unfortunately predisposed 560 to place implicit credit in his assertions that it has been reserved for me to discover that jesus was no better than a lawbreaker and an evildoer p 269  it was extremely easy for me to prove as i did in the pages of this review last december that under the most favourable interpretation this amazing declaration must be ascribed to extreme confusion of thought and by bringing an abundance of goodwill to the consideration of the subject i have now convinced myself that it is right for me to admit that a person of mr gladstones intellectual acuteness really did mistake the reprobation of the course of conduct ascribed to jesus in a story of which i expressly say i do not believe a word for an attack on his character and a declaration that he was no better than a lawbreaker and evildoer at any rate so far as i can see this is what mr gladstone wished to be believed when he wrote the following passage      i must however in passing make the confession that i did not state     with accuracy as i ought to have done the precise form of the     accusation i treated it as an imputation on the action of our lord he     replies that it is only an imputation on the narrative of three     evangelists respecting him the difference from his point of view is     probably material and i therefore regret that i overlooked it160  considering the gravity of the error which is here admitted the fashion of the withdrawal appears more singular than admirable from my point of viewnot from mr gladstones apparentlythe little discrepancy between the facts and mr gladstones 561 carefully offensive travesty of them is probably only probably material however as mr gladstone concludes with an official expression of regret for his error it is my business to return an equally official expression of gratitude for the attenuated reparation with which i am favoured  having cleared this specimen of mr gladstones controversial method out of the way i may proceed to the next assault that on a passage in an article on agnosticism nineteenth century february 1889 published two years ago i there said in referring to the gadarene story everything i know of law and justice convinces me that the wanton destruction of other peoples property is a misdemeanour of evil example on this mr gladstone continuing his candid and urbane observations remarks impregnable rock p 273 that exercising his rapid judgment on the text and not inquiring what anybody else had known or said about it i had missed a point in support of that accusation against our lord which he has now been constrained to admit i never made  the point in question is that gadara was a city of greeks rather than of jews from whence it might be inferred that to keep swine was innocent and lawful i conceive that i have abundantly proved that gadara answered exactly to the description here given of it and i shall show byandby that mr gladstone has used language which to my mind involves the admission that the authorities of the city were not jews but i have also taken a 562 good deal of pains to show that the question thus raised is of no importance in relation to the main issue161 if gadara was as i maintain it was a city of the decapolis hellenistic in constitution and containing a predominantly gentile population my case is superabundantly fortified on the other hand if the hypothesis that gadara was under jewish government which mr gladstone seems sometimes to defend and sometimes to give up were accepted my case would be nowise weakened at any rate gadara was not included within the jurisdiction of the tetrarch of galilee if it had been the galileans who crossed over the lake to gadara had no official status and they had no more civil right to punish lawbreakers than any other strangers  in my turn however i may remark that there is a point which appears to have escaped mr gladstones notice and that is somewhat unfortunate because his whole argument turns upon it mr gladstone assumes as a matter of course that pigkeeping was an offence against the law of moses and therefore that jews who kept pigs were as much liable to legal pains and penalties 563 as englishmen who smuggle brandy impregnable rock p 274  there can be no doubt that according to the law as it is defined in the pentateuch the pig was an unclean animal and that pork was a forbidden article of diet moreover since pigs are hardly likely to be kept for the mere love of those unsavoury animals pigowning or swineherding must have been and evidently was regarded as a suspicious and degrading occupation by strict jews in the first century ad but i should like to know on what provision of the mosaic law as it is laid down in the pentateuch mr gladstone bases the assumption which is essential to his case that the possession of pigs and the calling of a swineherd were actually illegal the inquiry was put to me the other day and as i could not answer it i turned up the article schwein  in riehms standard handwörterbuch for help out of my difficulty but unfortunately without success after speaking of the martyrdom which the jews under antiochus epiphanes preferred to eating pork the writer proceeds      it may be nevertheless that the practice of keeping pigs may have     found its way into palestine in the græcoroman time in consequence of     the great increase of the nonjewish population yet there is no     evidence of it in the new testament the great herd of swine 2000 in     number mentioned in the narrative of the possessed was feeding in the     territory of gadara which belonged to the decapolis and the prodigal     son became a swineherd with the native of a far country into which he     had wandered in neither of these cases is there 564 reason for     thinking that the possessors of these herds were jews162  having failed in my search so far i took up the next work of reference at hand kittos cyclopædia vol iii 1876 there under swine the writer colonel hamilton smith seemed at first to give me what i wanted as he says that swine appear to have been repeatedly introduced and reared by the hebrew people163 notwithstanding the strong prohibition in the law of moses is lxv 4 but in the first place isaiahs writings form no part of the law of moses and in the second place the people denounced by the prophet in this passage are neither the possessors of pigs nor swineherds but those which eat swines flesh and broth of abominable things is in their vessels and when in despair i turned to the provisions of the law itself my difficulty was not cleared up leviticus xi 8 revised version says in reference to the pig and other unclean animals of their flesh ye shall not eat and their carcases ye shall not touch in the revised version of deuteronomy xiv 8 the words of the prohibition are identical and a skilful refiner might possibly satisfy himself even if he satisfied nobody else that carcase means the body of a live 565 animal as well as of a dead one and that since swineherds could hardly avoid contact with their charges their calling was implicitly forbidden164 unfortunately the authorised version expressly says dead carcase and thus the most rabbinically minded of reconcilers might find his casuistry foiled by that great source of surprises the original hebrew that such check is at any rate possible is clear from the fact that the legal uncleanness of some animals as food did not interfere with their being lawfully possessed cared for and sold by jews the provisions for the ransoming of unclean beasts lev xxvii 27 and for the redemption of their sucklings numbers xviii 15 sufficiently prove this as the late dr kalisch has observed in his commentary on leviticus part ii p 129 note      though asses and horses camels and dogs were kept by the israelites     they were to a certain extent associated with the notion of impurity     they might be turned to profitable account by their labour or     otherwise but in respect to food they were an abomination  the same learned commentator loc cit p 88 proves that the talmudists forbade the rearing of pigs by jews unconditionally and everywhere and even included it under the same ban as the study of greek philosophy since both alike were considered to lead to the desertion of the jewish faith it is very possible indeed probable that the pharisees of the fourth decade of our first century took as 566 strong a view of pigkeeping as did their spiritual descendants but for all that it does not follow that the practice was illegal the stricter jews could not have despised and hated swineherds more than they did publicans but so far as i know there is no provision in the law against the practice of the calling of a taxgatherer by a jew the publican was in fact very much in the position of an irish processserver at the present daymore rather than less despised and hated on account of the perfect legality of his occupation except for certain sacrificial purposes pigs were held in such abhorrence by the ancient egyptians that swineherds were not permitted to enter a temple or to intermarry with other castes and any one who had touched a pig even accidentally was unclean but these very regulations prove that pigkeeping was not illegal it merely involved certain civil and religious disabilities for the jews dogs were typically unclean animals but when that eminently pious hebrew tobit went forth with the angel the young mans dog went with them tobit v 16 without apparent remonstrance from the celestial guide i really do not see how an appeal to the law could have justified any one in drowning tobits dog on the ground that his master was keeping and feeding an animal quite as unclean as any pig certainly the excellent raguel must have failed to see the harm of dogkeeping for we are told that on the travellers return homewards the dog went after them xi 4 567  until better light than i have been able to obtain is thrown upon the subject therefore it is obvious that mr gladstones argumentative house has been built upon an extremely slippery quicksand perhaps even has no foundation at all  yet another point does not seem to have occurred to mr gladstone who is so much shocked that i attach no overwhelming weight to the assertions contained in the synoptic gospels even when all three concur these gospels agree in stating in the most express and to some extent verbally identical terms that the devils entered the pigs at their own request165 and the third gospel viii 31 tells us what the motive of the demons was in asking the singular boon they intreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss from this it would seem that the devils thought to exchange the heavy punishment of transportation to the abyss for the lighter penalty of imprisonment in swine and some commentators more ingenious than respectful to the supposed chief actor in this extraordinary fable have dwelt with satisfaction upon the very unpleasant quarter of an hour which the evil spirits must have had when the headlong rush of their maddened tenements convinced them how completely they were taken in in the whole story there is not one solitary hint that the destruction of 568 the pigs was intended as a punishment of their owners or of the swineherds on the contrary the concurrent testimony of the three narratives is to the effect that the catastrophe was the consequence of diabolic suggestion and indeed no source could be more appropriate for an act of such manifest injustice and illegality  i can but marvel that modern defenders of the faith should not be glad of any reasonable excuse for getting rid of a story which if it had been invented by voltaire would have justly let loose floods of orthodox indignation    thus the hypothesis to which mr gladstone so fondly clings finds no support in the provisions of the law of moses as that law is defined in the pentateuch while it is wholly inconsistent with the concurrent testimony of the synoptic gospels to which mr gladstone attaches so much weight in my judgment it is directly contrary to everything which profane history tells us about the constitution and the population of the city of gadara and it commits those who accept it to a story which if it were true would implicate the founder of christianity in an illegal and inequitable act  such being the case i consider myself excused from following mr gladstone through all the meanderings of his late attempt to extricate himself from the maze of historical and exegetical difficulties in which he is entangled i content myself with assuring those who with my paper not mr gladstones 569 version of my arguments in hand consult the original authorities that they will find full justification for every statement i have made but in order to dispose those who cannot or will not take that trouble to believe that the proverbial blindness of one that judges his own cause plays no part in inducing me to speak thus decidedly i beg their attention to the following examination which shall be as brief as i can make it of the seven propositions in which mr gladstone professes to give a faithful summary of my errors  when in the middle of the seventeenth century the holy see declared that certain propositions contained in the works of bishop jansen were heretical the jansenists of port royal replied that while they were ready to defer to the papal authority about questions of faith and morals they must be permitted to judge about questions of fact for themselves and that really the condemned propositions were not to be found in jansens writings as everybody knows his holiness and the grand monarque replied to this surely not unreasonable plea after the manner of lord peter in the tale of a tub it is therefore not without some apprehension of meeting with a similar fate that i put in a like plea against mr gladstones bull the seven propositions declared to be false and condemnable in that kindly and gentle way which so pleasantly compares with the authoritative style of the vatican no 5 more particularly may or may not be true but they are not to be found in anything i have written 570 and some of them diametrically contravene that which i have written i proceed to prove my assertions  prop 1 throughout the paper he confounds together what i had distinguished namely the city of gadara and the vicinage attached to it not as a mere pomoerium but as a rural district  in my judgment this statement is devoid of foundation in my paper on the keepers of the herd of swine i point out at some length that in accordance with the ancient hellenic practice each city of the decapolis must have been surrounded by a certain amount of territory amenable to its jurisdiction and to enforce this conclusion i quote what josephus says about the villages that belonged to gadara and hippos as i understand the term pomerium or pomoerium166 it means the space which according to roman custom was kept free from buildings immediately within and without the walls of a city and which defined the range of the auspicia urbana the conception of a pomoerium as a vicinage attached to a city appears to be something quite novel and original but then to be sure i do not know how many senses mr gladstone may attach to the word vicinage  whether gadara had a pomoerium in the proper technical sense or not is a point on which i offer no opinion but that the city had a very considerable rural district attached to it and notwithstanding 571 its distinctness amenable to the jurisdiction of the gentile municipal authorities is one of the main points of my case  prop 2 he more fatally confounds the local civil government and its following including perhaps the whole wealthy class and those attached to it with the ethnical character of the general population  having survived confusion no 1 which turns out not to be on my side i am now confronted in no 2 with a more fatal errorand so it is if there be degrees of fatality but again it is mr gladstones and not mine it would appear from this proposition about the grammatical interpretation of which however i admit there are difficulties that mr gladstone holds that the local civil government and its following among the wealthy were ethnically different from the general population on p 348 he further admits that the wealthy and the local governing power were friendly to the romans are we then to suppose that it was the persons of jewish ethnical character who favoured the romans while those of gentile ethnical character were opposed to them but if that supposition is absurd the only alternative is that the local civil government was ethnically gentile this is exactly my contention  at pp 547 and 553 of the essay on the keepers of the herd of swine i have fully discussed the question of the ethnical character of the general population i have shown that according to josephus who surely ought to have known gadara was as much a gentile 572 city as ptolemais i have proved that he includes gadara amongst the cities that rose up against the jews that were amongst them which is a pretty definite expression of his belief that the ethnical character of the general population was gentile there is no question here of jews of the roman party fighting with jews of the zealot party as mr gladstone suggests it is the nonjewish and antijewish general population which rises up against the jews who had settled among them  prop 3 his one item of direct evidence as to the gentile character of the city refers only to the former and not to the latter  more fatal still but once more not to me i adduce not one but a variety of items in proof of the nonjudaic character of the population of gadara the evidence of history that of the coinage of the city the direct testimony of josephus just citedto mention no others i repeat if the wealthy people and those connected with themthe classes and the hangers on of mr gladstones wellknown taxonomywere as he appears to admit they were gentiles if the civil government of the city was in their hands as the coinage proves it was what becomes of mr gladstones original proposition in the impregnable rock of scripture that the population of gadara and still less if less may be the population of the neighbourhood were hebrews bound by the mosaic law and what is the importance of estimating the precise proportion of hebrews who may have resided either in the city of gadara 573 or in its dependant territory when as mr gladstone now seems to admit i am careful to say seems the government and consequently the law which ruled in that territory and defined civil right and wrong was gentile and not judaic but perhaps mr gladstone is prepared to maintain that the gentile local civil government of a city of the decapolis administered jewish law and showed their respect for it more particularly by stamping their coinage with effigies of the emperors  in point of fact in his haste to attribute to me errors which i have not committed mr gladstone has given away his case  prop 4 he fatally confounds the question of political party with those of nationality and of religion and assumes that those who took the side of rome in the factions that prevailed could not be subject to the mosaic law  it would seem that i have a feline tenacity of life once more a fatal error but mr gladstone has forgotten an excellent rule of controversy say what is true of course but mind that it is decently probable now it is not decently probable hardly indeed conceivable that any one who has read josephus or any other historian of the jewish war should be unaware that there were jews of whom josephus himself was one who romanised and more or less openly opposed the war party but however that may be i assert that mr gladstone neither has produced nor can produce a passage of my writing which affords the slightest 574 foundation for this particular article of his indictment  prop 5 his examination of the text of josephus is alike onesided inadequate and erroneous  easy to say hard to prove so long as the authorities whom i have cited are on my side i do not know why this singularly temperate and convincing dictum should trouble me i have yet to become acquainted with mr gladstones claims to speak with an authority equal to that of scholars of the rank of schürer whose obviously just and necessary emendations he so unceremoniously poohpoohs  prop 6 finally he sets aside on grounds not critical or historical but partly subjective the primary historical testimony on the subject namely that of the three synoptic evangelists who write as contemporaries and deal directly with the subject neither of which is done by any other authority  really this is too much the fact is as anybody can see who will turn to my article of february 1889 out of which all this discussion has arisen that the arguments upon which i rest the strength of my case touching the swinemiracle are exactly historical and critical expressly and in words that cannot be misunderstood i refuse to rest on what mr gladstone calls subjective evidence i abstain from denying the possibility of the gadarene occurrence and i even go so far as to speak of some physical analogies to possession in fact my quondam opponent dr wace shrewdly but quite fairly made the most of these admissions and stated that i had 575 removed the only consideration which would have been a serious obstacle in the way of his belief in the gadarene story167  so far from setting aside the authority of the synoptics on subjective grounds i have taken a great deal of trouble to show that my nonbelief in the story is based upon what appears to me to be evident firstly that the accounts of the three synoptic gospels are not independent but are founded upon a common source secondly that even if the story of the common tradition proceeded from a contemporary it would still be worthy of very little credit seeing the manner in which the legends about mediæval miracles have been propounded by contemporaries and in illustration of this position i wrote a special essay about the miracles reported by eginhard168  in truth one need go no further than mr gladstones sixth proposition to be convinced that contemporary testimony even of wellknown and distinguished persons may be but a very frail reed for the support of the historian when theological prepossession blinds the witness169  576  prop 7 and he treats the entire question in the narrowed form in which it arises upon secular testimony as if it were capable of a solution so clear and summary as to warrant the use of the extremest weapons of controversy against those who presume to differ from him  the six heretical propositions which have gone before are enunciated with sufficient clearness to enable me to prove without any difficulty that whosesoever they are they are not mine but number seven i confess is too hard for me i cannot undertake to contradict that which i do not understand  what is the entire question which arises in a narrowed form upon secular testimony after much guessing i am fain to give up the conundrum the question may be the ownership of the pigs or the ethnological character of the 577 gadarenes or the propriety of meddling with other peoples property without legal warrant and each of these questions might be so narrowed when it arose on secular testimony that i should not know where i was so i am silent on this part of the proposition  but i do dimly discern in the latter moiety of this mysterious paragraph a reproof of that use of the extremest weapons of controversy which is attributed to me upon which i have to observe that i guide myself in such matters very much by the maxim of a great statesman do ut des if mr gladstone objects to the employment of such weapons in defence he would do well to abstain from them in attack he should not frame charges which he has afterwards to admit are erroneous in language of carefully calculated offensiveness impregnable rock pp 26970 he should not assume that persons with whom he disagrees are so recklessly unconscientious as to evade the trouble of inquiring what has been said or known about a grave question impregnable rock p 273 he should not qualify the results of careful thought as handoverhead reasoning impregnable rock p 274 he should not as in the extraordinary propositions which i have just analysed make assertions respecting his opponents position and arguments which are contradicted by the plainest facts  persons who like myself having spent their lives outside the political world yet take a mild and philosophical concern in what goes on in it often find 578 it difficult to understand what our neighbours call the psychological moment of this or that party leader and are occasionally loth to believe in the seeming conditions of certain kinds of success and when some chieftain famous in political warfare adventures into the region of letters or of science in full confidence that the methods which have brought fame and honour in his own province will answer there he is apt to forget that he will be judged by these people on whom rhetorical artifices have long ceased to take effect and to whom mere dexterity in putting together cleverly ambiguous phrases and even the great art of offensive misrepresentation are unspeakably wearisome and if that weariness finds its expression in sarcasm the offender really has no right to cry out assuredly ridicule is no test of truth but it is the righteous meed of some kinds of error nor ought the attempt to confound the expression of a revolted sense of fair dealing with arrogant impatience of contradiction to restrain those to whom the extreme weapons of controversy come handy from using them the function of police in the intellectual if not in the civil economy may sometimes be legitimately discharged by volunteers    some time ago in one of the many criticisms with which i am favoured i met with the remark that at our time of life mr gladstone and i might be better occupied than in fighting over the gadarene pigs and if these too famous swine were the only parties to the suit i for my part should fully admit the 579 justice of the rebuke but under the beneficent rule of the court of chancery in former times it was not uncommon that a quarrel about a few perches of worthless land ended in the ruin of ancient families and the engulfing of great estates and i think that our admonisher failed to observe the analogyto note the momentous consequences of the judgment which may be awarded in the present apparently insignificant action in re the swineherds of gadara  the immediate effect of such judgment will be the decision of the question whether the men of the nineteenth century are to adopt the demonology of the men of the first century as divinely revealed truth or to reject it as degrading falsity the reverend principal of kings college has delivered his judgment in perfectly clear and candid terms two years since dr wace said that he believed the story as it stands and consequently he holds as a part of divine revelation that the spiritual world comprises devils who under certain circumstances may enter men and be transferred from them to fourfooted beasts for the distinguished anglican divine and biblical scholar that is part and parcel of the teachings respecting the spiritual world which we owe to the founder of christianity it is an inseparable part of that christian orthodoxy which if a man rejects he is to be considered and called an infidel according to the ordinary rules of interpretation of language mr gladstone must hold the same view  if antiquity and universality are valid tests of the truth of any belief no doubt this is one of the beliefs 580 so certified there are no known savages nor people sunk in the ignorance of partial civilisation who do not hold them the great majority of christians have held them and still hold them moreover the oldest records we possess of the early conceptions of mankind in egypt and in mesopotamia prove that exactly such demonology as is implied in the gadarene story formed the substratum and among the early accadians apparently the greater part of their supposed knowledge of the spiritual world m lenormants profoundly interesting work on babylonian magic and the magical texts given in the appendix to professor sayces hibbert lectures leave no doubt on this head they prove that the doctrine of possession and even the particular case of pig possession170 were firmly believed in by the egyptians and the mesopotamians before the tribes of israel invaded palestine and it is evident that these beliefs from some time after the exile and probably much earlier completely interpenetrated the jewish mind and thus became inseparably interwoven with the fabric of the synoptic gospels  therefore behind the question of the acceptance of the doctrines of the oldest heathen demonology as part of the fundamental beliefs of christianity there lies the question of the credibility of the gospels and of their claim to act as our instructors outside that ethical 581 province in which they appeal to the consciousness of all thoughtful men and still behind this problem there lies anotherhow far do these ancient records give a sure foundation to the prodigious fabric of christian dogma which has been built upon them by the continuous labours of speculative theologians during eighteen centuries  i submit that there are few questions before the men of the rising generation on the answer to which the future hangs more fatally than this we are at the parting of the ways whether the twentieth century shall see a recrudescence of the superstitions of mediæval papistry or whether it shall witness the severance of the living body of the ethical ideal of prophetic israel from the carcase foul with savage superstitions and cankered with false philosophy to which the theologians have bound it turns upon their final judgment of the gadarene tale    the gravity of the problems ultimately involved in the discussion of the legend of gadara will i hope excuse a persistence in returning to the subject to which i should not have been moved by merely personal considerations    with respect to the diluvial invective which overflowed thirtythree pages of this review last january i doubt not that it has a catastrophic importance in the estimation of its author i on the other hand may be permitted to regard it as a mere spate noisy and threatening while it lasted but forgotten almost 582 as soon as it was over without my help it will be judged by every instructed and clearheaded reader and that is fortunate because were aid necessary i have cogent reasons for withholding it  in an article characterised by the same qualities of thought and diction entitled a great lesson which appeared in this review for september 1887 the duke of argyll firstly charged the whole body of men of science interested in the question with having conspired to ignore certain criticisms of mr darwins theory of the origin and coral reefs and secondly he asserted that some person unnamed had actually induced mr john murray to delay the publication of his views on that subject for two years  it was easy for me and for others to prove that the first statement was not only to use the duke of argylls favourite expression contrary to fact but that it was without any foundation whatever the second statement rested on the duke of argylls personal authority all i could do was to demand the production of the evidence for it up to the present time so far as i know that evidence has not made its appearance nor has there been any withdrawal of or apology for the erroneous charge  under these circumstances most people will understand why the duke of argyll may feel quite secure of having the battle all to himself whenever it pleases him to attack me                                        583  xvi  hasisadras adventure  some thousands of years ago there was a city in mesopotamia called surippak one night a strange dream came to a dweller therein whose name if rightly reported was hasisadra the dream foretold the speedy coming of a great flood and it warned hasisadra to lose no time in building a ship in which when notice was given he his family and friends with their domestic animals and a collection of the wild creatures and seed of plants of the land might take refuge and be rescued from destruction hasisadra awoke and at once acted upon the warning a strong decked ship was built and her sides were paid inside and out with the mineral pitch or bitumen with which the country abounded the vessels seaworthiness was tested the cargo was stowed away and a trusty pilot or steersman appointed  the promised signal arrived wife and friends embarked hasisadra following prudently shut the door or as we should say put on the hatches and neshea the pilot was left alone on deck to do 584 his best for the ship thereupon a hurricane began to rage rain fell in torrents the subterranean waters burst forth a deluge swept over the land and the wind lashed it into waves sky high heaven and earth became mingled in chaotic gloom for six days and seven nights the gale raged but the good ship held out until on the seventh day the storm lulled hasisadra ventured on deck and seeing nothing but a waste of waters strewed with floating corpses and wreck wept over the destruction of his land and people far away the mountains of nizir were visible the ship was steered for them and ran aground upon the higher land yet another seven days passed by on the seventh hasisadra sent forth a dove which found no resting place and returned then he liberated a swallow which also came back finally a raven was let loose and that sagacious bird when it found that the water had abated came near the ship but refused to return to it upon this hasisadra liberated the rest of the wild animals which immediately dispersed in all directions while he with his family and friends ascending a mountain hard by offered sacrifices upon its summit to the gods    the story thus given in summary abstract told in an ancient semitic dialect is inscribed in cuneiform characters upon a tablet of burnt clay many thousands of such tablets collected by assurbanipal king of assyria in the middle of the seventh century bc were stored in the library of his palace at 585 nineveh and though in a sadly broken and mutilated condition they have yielded a marvellous amount of information to the patient and sagacious labour which modern scholars have bestowed upon them among the multitude of documents of various kinds this narrative of hasisadras adventure has been found in a tolerably complete state but assyriologists agree that it is only a copy of a much more ancient work and there are weighty reasons for believing that the story of hasisadras flood was well known in mesopotamia before the year 2000 bc  no doubt then we are in presence of a narrative which has all the authority which antiquity can confer and it is proper to deal respectfully with it even though it is quite as proper and indeed necessary to act no less respectfully towards ourselves and before professing to put implicit faith in it to inquire what claim it has to be regarded as a serious account of an historical event  it is of no use to appeal to contemporary history although the annals of babylonia no less than those of egypt go much further back than 2000 bc all that can be said is that the former are hardly consistent with the supposition that any catastrophe competent to destroy all the population has befallen the land since civilisation began and that the latter are notoriously silent about deluges in such a case as this however the silence of history does not leave the inquirer wholly at fault natural science has something to say when the phenomena of nature 586 are in question natural science may be able to show from the nature of the country either that such an event as that described in the story is impossible or at any rate highly improbable or on the other hand that it is consonant with probability in the former case the narrative must be suspected or rejected in the latter no such summary verdict can be given on the contrary it must be admitted that the story may be true and then if certain strangely prevalent canons of criticism are accepted and if the evidence that an event might have happened is to be accepted as proof that it did happen assyriologists will be at liberty to congratulate one another on the confirmation by modern science of the authority of their ancient books  it will be interesting therefore to inquire how far the physical structure and the other conditions of the region in which surippak was situated are compatible with such a flood as is described in the assyrian record  the scene of hasisadras adventure is laid in the broad valley six or seven hundred miles long and hardly anywhere less than a hundred miles in width which is traversed by the lower courses of the rivers euphrates and tigris and which is commonly known as the euphrates valley rising at the one end into a hill country which gradually passes into the alpine heights of armenia and at the other dipping beneath the shallow waters of the head of the persian gulf which continues in the same direction from northwest to southeast for some eight hundred 587 miles farther the floor of the valley presents a gradual slope from eight hundred feet above the sea level to the depths of the southern end of the persian gulf the boundary between sea and land formed by the extremest mudflats of the delta of the two rivers is but vaguely defined and year by year it advances seaward on the northeastern side the western frontier ranges of persia rise abruptly to great heights on the southwestern side a more gradual ascent leads to a tableland of less elevation which very broad in the south where it is occupied by the deserts of arabia and of southern syria narrows northwards into the highlands of palestine and is continued by the ranges of the lebanon the antilebanon and the taurus into the highlands of armenia  the wide and gently inclined plain thus inclosed between the gulf and the highlands on each side and at its upper extremity is distinguishable into two regions of very different character one of which lies north and the other south of the parallel of hit on the euphrates except in the immediate vicinity of the river the northern division is stony and scantily covered with vegetation except in spring over the southern division on the contrary spreads a deep alluvial soil in which even a pebble is rare and which though under the existing misrule mainly a waste of marsh and wilderness needs only intelligent attention to become as it was of old the granary of western asia except in the extreme south the rainfall is small and the air dry the heat in summer is intense while bitterly cold northern blasts 588 sweep the plain in winter whirlwinds are not uncommon and in the intervals of the periodical inundations the fine dry powdery soil is swept even by moderate breezes into stifling clouds or rather fogs of dust low inequalities elevations here and depressions there diversify the surface of the alluvial region the latter are occupied by enormous marshes while the former support the permanent dwellings of the present scanty and miserable population  in antiquity so long as the canalisation of the country was properly carried out the fertility of the alluvial plain enabled great and prosperous nations to have their home in the euphrates valley its abundant clay furnished the materials for the masses of sundried and burnt bricks the remains of which in the shape of huge artificial mounds still testify to both the magnitude and the industry of the population thousands of years ago good cement is plentiful while the bitumen which wells from the rocks at hit and elsewhere not only answers the same purpose but is used to this day as it was in hasisadras time to pay the inside and the outside of boats  in the broad lower course of the euphrates the stream rarely acquires a velocity of more than three miles an hour while the lower tigris attains double that rate in times of flood the water of both great rivers is mainly derived from the northern and eastern highlands in armenia and in kurdistan and stands at its lowest level in early autumn and in january 589 but when the snows accumulated in the upper basins of the great rivers during the winter melt under the hot sunshine of spring they rapidly rise171 and at length overflow their banks covering the alluvial plain with a vast inland sea interrupted only by the higher ridges and hummocks which form islands in a seemingly boundless expanse of water  in the occurrence of these annual inundations lies one of several resemblances between the valley of the euphrates and that of the nile but there are important differences the time of the annual flood is reversed the nile being highest in autumn and winter and lowest in spring and early summer the periodical overflows of the nile regulated by the great lake basins in the south are usually punctual in arrival gradual in growth and beneficial in operation no lakes are interposed between the mountain torrents of the upper basis of the tigris and the euphrates and their lower courses hence heavy rain or an unusually rapid thaw in the uplands gives rise to the sudden irruption of a vast volume of water which not even the rapid tigris still less its more sluggish companion can carry off in time to prevent violent and dangerous overflows without an elaborate system of canalisation providing an escape for such sudden excesses of the supply of water the annual floods of the euphrates and especially of the 590 tigris must always be attended with risk and often prove harmful  there are other peculiarities of the euphrates valley which may occasionally tend to exacerbate the evils attendant on the inundations it is very subject to seismic disturbances and the ordinary consequences of a sharp earthquake shock might be seriously complicated by its effect on a broad sheet of water moreover the indian ocean lies within the region of typhoons and if at the height of an inundation a hurricane from the southeast swept up the persian gulf driving its shallow waters upon the delta and damming back the outflow perhaps for hundreds of miles upstream a diluvial catastrophe fairly up to the mark of hasisadras might easily result172  thus there seems to be no valid reason for rejecting hasisadras story on physical grounds i do not gather from the narrative that the mountains of nizir were supposed to be submerged but merely that they came into view above the distant horizon of the waters as the vessel drove in that direction certainly the ship is not supposed to ground on any of their higher summits for hasisadra has to ascend a peak in order to offer his sacrifice the country of nizir lay on the northeastern side of the euphrates 591 valley about the courses of the two rivers zab which enter the tigris where it traverses the plain of assyria some eight or nine hundred feet above the sea and so far as i can judge from maps173 and other sources of information it is possible under the circumstances supposed that such a ship as hasisadras might drive before a southerly gale over a continuously flooded country until it grounded on some of the low hills between which both the lower and the upper zab enter upon the assyrian plain  the tablet which contains the story under consideration is the eleventh of a series of twelve each of these answers to a month and to the corresponding sign of the zodiac the assyrian year began with the spring equinox consequently the eleventh month called the rainy answers to our januaryfebruary and to the sign which corresponds with our aquarius the aquatic adventure of hasisadra therefore is not inappropriately placed it is curious however that the season thus indirectly assigned to the flood is not that of the present highest level of the rivers it is too late for the winter rise and too early for the spring floods  i think it must be admitted that so far the physical crossexamination to which hasisadra has been subjected does not break down his story on the contrary he proves to have kept it in all essential respects174 within the bounds of probability or 592 possibility however we have not yet done with him for the conditions which obtained in the euphrates valley four or five thousand years ago may have differed to such an extent from those which now exist that we should be able to convict him of having made up his tale but here again everything is in favour of his credibility indeed he may claim very powerful support for it does not lie in the mouths of those who accept the authority of the pentateuch to deny that the euphrates valley was what it is even six thousand years back according to the book of genesis phrat and hiddekelthe euphrates and the tigrisare coeval with paradise an edition of the scriptures recently published under high authority with an elaborate apparatus of helps for the use of studentsand therefore as i am bound to suppose purged of all statements that could by any possibility mislead the youngassigns the year bc 4004 as the date of adams too brief residence in that locality  but i am far from depending on this authority for the age of the mesopotamian plain on the contrary i venture to rely with much more confidence on another kind of evidence which tends to show that the age of the great rivers must be carried back to a date earlier than that at which our ingenuous youth is instructed that the earth came into existence for the alluvial deposit having been brought down by the rivers they must needs be older than the plain it 593 forms as navvies must needs antecede the embankment painfully built up by the contents of their wheelbarrows for thousands of years heat and cold rain snow and frost the scrubbing of glaciers and the scouring of torrents laden with sand and gravel have been wearing down the rocks of the upper basins of the rivers over an area of many thousand square miles and these materials ground to fine powder in the course of their long journey have slowly subsided as the water which carried them spread out and lost its velocity in the sea it is because this process is still going on that the shore of the delta constantly encroaches on the head of the gulf175 into which the two rivers are constantly throwing the waste of armenia and of kurdistan hence as might be expected fluviatile and marine shells are common in the alluvial deposit and loftus found strata containing subfossil marine shells of species now living in the persian gulf at warka two hundred miles in a straight line from the shore of the delta176 it follows that if a trustworthy estimate of the average rate of growth of the alluvial can be formed the lowest limit by no means the highest limit of age of the rivers can be determined all such estimates are beset 594 with sources of error of very various kinds and the best of them can only be regarded as approximations to the truth but i think it will be quite safe to assume a maximum rate of growth of four miles in a century for the lower half of the alluvial plain  now the cycle of narratives of which hasisadras adventure forms a part contains allusions not only to surippak the exact position of which is doubtful but to other cities such as erech the vast ruins at the present village of warka have been carefully explored and determined to be all that remains of that once great and flourishing city erech the lofty supposing that the two hundred miles of alluvial country which separates them from the head of the persian gulf at present have been deposited at the very high rate of four miles in a century it will follow that 4000 years ago or about the year 2100 bc the city of erech still lay forty miles inland indeed the city might have been built a thousand years earlier moreover there is plenty of independent archæological and other evidence that in the whole thousand years 2000 to 3000 bc the alluvial plain was inhabited by a numerous people among whom industry art and literature had attained a very considerable development and it can be shown that the physical conditions and the climate of the euphrates valley at that time must have been extremely similar to what they are now  thus once more we reach the conclusion that as a question of physical probability there is no ground for objecting to the reality of hasisadras adventure 595 it would be unreasonable to doubt that such a flood might have happened and that such a person might have escaped in the way described any time during the last 5000 years and if the postulate of loose thinkers in search of scientific confirmations of questionable narrativesproof that an event may have happened is evidence that it did happenis to be accepted surely hasisadras story is confirmed by modern scientific investigation beyond all cavil however it may be well to pause before adopting this conclusion because the original story of which i have set forth only the broad outlines contains a great many statements which rest upon just the same foundation as those cited and yet are hardly likely to meet with general acceptance the account of the circumstances which led up to the flood of those under which hasisadras adventure was made known to his descendant of certain remarkable incidents before and after the flood are inseparably bound up with the details already given and i am unable to discover any justification for arbitrarily picking out some of these and dubbing them historical verities while rejecting the rest as legendary fictions they stand or fall together  before proceeding to the consideration of these less satisfactory details it is needful to remark that hasisadras adventure is a mere episode in a cycle of stories of which a personage whose name is provisionally read izdubar is the centre the nature of izdubar hovers vaguely between the heroic and the divine sometimes he seems a mere man sometimes 596 approaches so closely to the divinities of fire and of the sun as to be hardly distinguishable from them as i have already mentioned the tablet which sets forth hasisadras perils is one of twelve and since each of these represents a month and bears a story appropriate to the corresponding sign of the zodiac great weight must be attached to sir henry rawlinsons suggestion that the epos of izdubar is a poetical embodiment of solar mythology  in the earlier books of the epos the hero not content with rejecting the proffered love of the chaldæan aphrodite istar freely expresses his very low estimate of her character and it is interesting to observe that even in this early stage of human experience men had reached a conception of that law of nature which expresses the inevitable consequences of an imperfect appreciation of feminine charms the injured goddess makes izdubars life a burden to him until at last sick in body and sorry in mind he is driven to seek aid and comfort from his forbears in the world of spirits so this antitype of odysseus journeys to the shore of the waters of death and there takes ship with a chaldæan charon who carries him within hail of his ancestor hasisadra that venerable personage not only gives izdubar instructions how to regain his health but tells him somewhat à propos des bottes after the manner of venerable personages the long story of his perilous adventure and how it befell that he his wife and his steersman came to dwell among the blessed gods without passing through the portals of death like ordinary mortals 597  according to the full story the sins of mankind had become grievous and at a council of the gods it was resolved to extirpate the whole race by a great flood and once more let us note the uniformity of human experience it would appear that four thousand years ago the obligations of confidential intercourse about matters of state were sometimes violatedof course from the best of motives ea one of the three chiefs of the chaldæan pantheon the god of justice and of practical wisdom was also the god of the sea and yielding to the temptation to do a friend a good turn irresistible to kindly seafaring folks of all ranks he warned hasisadra of what was coming when bel subsequently reproached him for this breach of confidence ea defended himself by declaring that he did not tell hasisadra anything he only sent him a dream this was undoubtedly sailing very near the wind but the attribution of a little benevolent obliquity of conduct to one of the highest of the gods is a trifle compared with the truly homeric anthropomorphism which characterises other parts of the epos  the chaldæan deities are in truth extremely human and occasionally the narrator does not scruple to represent them in a manner which is not only inconsistent with our idea of reverence but is sometimes distinctly humorous177 when the storm is at its height he exhibits them flying in a state of panic to anu the god of heaven and crouching 598 before his portal like frightened dogs as the smoke of hasisadras sacrifice arises the gods attracted by the sweet savour are compared to swarms of flies i have already remarked that the lady istars reputation is torn to shreds while she and ea scold bel handsomely for his ferocity and injustice in destroying the innocent along with the guilty one is reminded of here hung up with weighted heels of misleading dreams sent by zeus of ares howling as he flies from the trojan battlefield and of the very questionable dealings of aphrodite with helen and paris  but to return to the story bel was at first excluded from the sacrifice as the author of all the mischief which really was somewhat hard upon him since the other gods agreed to his proposal but eventually a reconciliation takes place the great bow of anu is displayed in the heavens bel agrees that he will be satisfied with what war pestilence famine and wild beasts can do in the way of destroying men and that henceforward he will not have recourse to extraordinary measures finally it is bel himself who by way of making amends transports hasisadra his wife and the faithful neshea to the abode of the gods  it is as indubitable as it is incomprehensible to most of us that for thousands of years a great people quite as intelligent as we are and living in as high a state of civilisation as that which had been attained in the greater part of europe a few centuries ago entertained not the slightest doubt that anu 599 bel ea istar and the rest were real personages possessed of boundless powers for good and evil the sincerity of the monarchs whose inscriptions gratefully attribute their victories to merodach or to assur is as little to be questioned as that of the authors of the hymns and penitential psalms which give full expression to the heights and depths of religious devotion an infidel bold enough to deny the existence or to doubt the influence of these deities probably did not exist in all mesopotamia and even constructive rebellion against their authority was apt to end in the deprivation not merely of the good name but of the skin of the offender the adherents of modern theological systems dismiss these objects of the love and fear of a hundred generations of their equals offhand as gods of the heathen mere creations of a wicked and idolatrous imagination and along with them they disown as senseless the crude theology with its gross anthropomorphism and its low ethical conception of the divinity which satisfied the pious souls of chaldæa  i imagine though i do not presume to be sure that any endeavour to save the intellectual and moral credit of chaldæan religion by suggesting the application to it of that universal solvent of absurdities the allegorical method would be scouted i will not even suggest that any ingenuity can be equal to the discovery of the antitypes of the personifications effected by the religious imagination of later ages in the triad anu ea and bel still less in istar therefore unless some plausible reconciliatory scheme 600 should be propounded by a neochaldæan devotee and with neobuddhists to the fore this supposition is not so wild as it looks i suppose the moderns will continue to smile in a superior way at the grievous absurdity of the polytheistic idolatry of these ancient people  it is probably a congenital absence of some faculty which i ought to possess which withholds me from adopting this summary procedure but i am not ashamed to share david humes want of ability to discover that polytheism is in itself altogether absurd if we are bound or permitted to judge the government of the world by human standards it appears to me that directorates are proved by familiar experience to conduct the largest and the most complicated concerns quite as well as solitary despots i have never been able to see why the hypothesis of a divine syndicate should be found guilty of innate absurdity those assyrians in particular who held assur to be the one supreme and creative deity to whom all the other supernal powers were subordinate might fairly ask that the essential difference between their system and that which obtains among the great majority of their modern theological critics should be demonstrated in my apprehension it is not the quantity but the quality of the persons among whom the attributes of divinity are distributed which is the serious matter if the divine might is associated with no higher ethical attributes than those which obtain among ordinary men if the divine intelligence is supposed to be so imperfect 601 that it cannot foresee the consequences of its own contrivances if the supernal powers can become furiously angry with the creatures of their omnipotence and in their senseless wrath destroy the innocent along with the guilty or if they can show themselves to be as easily placated by presents and gross flattery as any oriental or occidental despot if in short they are only stronger than mortal men and no better as it must be admitted hasisadras deities proved themselves to bethen surely it is time for us to look somewhat closely into their credentials and to accept none but conclusive evidence of their existence  to the majority of my respected contemporaries this reasoning will doubtless appear feeble if not worse however to my mind such are the only arguments by which the chaldæan theology can be satisfactorily upset so far from there being any ground for the belief that ea anu and bel are or ever were real entities it seems to me quite infinitely more probable that they are products of the religious imagination such as are to be found everywhere and in all ages so long as that imagination riots uncontrolled by scientific criticism  it is on these grounds that i venture at the risk of being called an atheist by the ghosts of all the principals of all the colleges of babylonia or by their living successors among the neochaldæans if that sect should arise to express my utter disbelief in the gods of hasisadra hence it follows that i find hasisadras account of their share in his adventure 602 incredible and as the physical details of the flood are inseparable from its theophanic accompaniments and are guaranteed by the same authority i must let them go with the rest the consistency of such details with probability counts for nothing the inhabitants of chaldæa must always have been familiar with inundations probably no generation failed to witness an inundation which rose unusually high or was rendered serious by coincident atmospheric or other disturbances and the memory of the general features of any exceptionally severe and devastating flood would be preserved by popular tradition for long ages what then could be more natural than that a chaldæan poet should seek for the incidents of a great catastrophe among such phenomena in what other way than by such an appeal to their experience could he so surely awaken in his audience the tragic pity and terror what possible ground is there for insisting that he must have had some individual flood in view and that his history is historical in the sense that the account of the effects of a hurricane in the bay of bengal in the year 1875 is historical    more than three centuries after the time of assurbanipal berosus of babylon born in the reign of alexander the great wrote an account of the history of his country in greek the work of berosus has vanished but extracts from ithow far faithful is uncertainhave been preserved by later writers among these occurs the wellknown 603 story of the deluge of xisuthros which is evidently built upon the same foundation as that of hasisadra the incidents of the divine warning the building of the ship the sending out of birds the ascension of the hero betray their common origin but stories like madeira acquire a heightened flavour with time and travel and the version of berosus is characterised by those circumstantial improbabilities which habitually gather round the legend of a legend the later narrator knows the exact day of the month on which the flood began the dimensions of the ship are stated with munchausenian precision at five stadia by twosay half by onefifth of an english mile the ship runs aground among the gordæan mountains to the south of lake van in armenia beyond the limits of any imaginable real inundation of the euphrates valley and by way of climax we have the assertion worthy of the sailor who said that he had brought up one of pharaohs chariot wheels on the fluke of his anchor in the red sea that pilgrims visited the locality and made amulets of the bitumen which they scraped off from the still extant remains of the mighty ship of xisuthros  suppose that some later polyhistor as devoid of critical faculty as most of his tribe had found the version of berosus as well as another much nearer the original story that having too much respect for his authorities to make up a tertium quid of his own out of the materials offered he followed a practice common enough among ancient and particularly among semitic historians of dividing 604 both into fragments and piecing them together without troubling himself very much about the resulting repetitions and inconsistencies the product of such a primitive editorial operation would be a narrative analogous to that which treats of the noachian deluge in the book of genesis for the pentateuchal story is indubitably a patchwork composed of fragments of at least two different and partly discrepant narratives quilted together in such an inartistic fashion that the seams remain conspicuous and in the matter of circumstantial exaggeration it in some respects excels even the secondhand legend of berosus  there is a certain practicality about the notion of taking refuge from floods and storms in a ship provided with a steersman but surely no one who had ever seen more water than he could wade through would dream of facing even a moderate breeze in a huge threestoried coffer or box three hundred cubits long fifty wide and thirty high left to drift without rudder or pilot178 not content with giving the exact year of noahs age in which the flood began the pentateuchal story adds the month and the day of 605 the month it is the deity himself who shuts in noah the modest week assigned to the full deluge in hasisadras story becomes forty days in one of the pentateuchal accounts and a hundred and fifty in the other the flood which in the version of berosus has grown so high as to cast the ship among the mountains of armenia is improved upon in the hebrew account until it covers all the high hills that were under the whole heaven and when it begins to subside the ark is left stranded on the summit of the highest peak commonly identified with ararat itself  while the details of hasisadras adventure are at least compatible with the physical conditions of the euphrates valley and as we have seen involve no catastrophe greater than such as might be brought under those conditions many of the very precisely stated details of noahs flood contradict some of the best established results of scientific inquiry  if it is certain that the alluvium of the mesopotamian plain has been brought down by the tigris and the euphrates then it is no less certain that the physical structure of the whole valley has persisted without material modification for many thousand years before the date assigned to the flood if the summits even of the moderately elevated ridges which immediately bound the valley still more those of the kurdish and armenian mountains were ever covered by water for even forty days that water must have extended over the whole earth if the earth was thus covered anywhere between 4000 and 5000 years ago or at any other time since the 606 higher terrestrial animals came into existence they must have been destroyed from the whole face of it as the pentateuchal account declares they were three several times genesis vii 21 22 23 in language which cannot be made more emphatic or more solemn than it is and the present population must consist of the descendants of emigrants from the ark and if that is the case then as has often been pointed out the sloths of the brazilian forests the kangaroos of australia the great tortoises of the galapagos islands must have respectively hobbled hopped and crawled over many thousand miles of land and sea from ararat to their present habitations thus the unquestionable facts of the geographical distribution of recent land animals alone form an insuperable obstacle to the acceptance of the assertion that the kinds of animals composing the present terrestrial fauna have been at any time universally destroyed in the way described in the pentateuch  it is upon this and other unimpeachable grounds that as i ventured to say some time ago persons who are duly conversant with even the elements of natural science decline to take the noachian deluge seriously and that as i also pointed out candid theologians who without special scientific knowledge have appreciated the weight of scientific arguments have long since given it up but as goethe has remarked there is nothing more terrible than energetic ignorance179 and there are even yet very 607 energetic people who are neither candid nor clearheaded nor theologians still less properly instructed in the elements of natural science who make prodigious efforts to obscure the effect of these plain truths and to conceal their real surrender of the historical character of noahs deluge under cover of the smoke of a great discharge of pseudoscientific artillery they seem to imagine that the proofs which abound in all parts of the world of large oscillations of the relative level of land and sea combined with the probability that when the sealevel was rising sudden incursions of the sea like that which broke in over holland and formed the zuyder zee may have often occurred can be made to look like evidence that something that by courtesy might be called a general deluge has really taken place their discursive energy drags misunderstood truth into their service and the glacial epoch is as sure to crop up among them as king charless head in a famous memorialwith about as much appropriateness the old story of the raised beach on moel tryfaen is trotted out though even if the facts are as yet rightly interpreted there is not a shadow of evidence that the change of sealevel in that locality was sudden or that glacial welshmen would have known it was taking place180 surely it is difficult to perceive the relevancy of bringing in something that happened in the glacial 608 epoch if it did happen to account for the tradition of a flood in the euphrates valley between 2000 and 3000 bc but the date of the noachian flood is solidly fixed by the sole authority for it no shuffling of the chronological data will carry it so far back as 3000 bc and the hebrew epos agrees with the chaldæan in placing it after the development of a somewhat advanced civilisation the only authority for the noachian deluge assures us that before it visited the earth cain had built cities jubal had invented harps and organs while mankind had advanced so far beyond the neolithic nay even the bronze stage that tubalcain was a worker in iron therefore if the noachian legend is to be taken for the history of an event which happened in the glacial epoch we must revise our notions of pleistocene civilisation on the other hand if the pentateuchal story only means something quite different that happened somewhere else thousands of years earlier dressed up what becomes of its credit as history i wonder what would be said to a modern historian who asserted that pekin was burnt down in 1886 and then tried to justify the assertion by adducing evidence of the great fire of london in 1666 yet the attempt to save the credit of the noachian story by reference to something which is supposed to have happened in the far north in the glacial epoch is far more preposterous  moreover these dustraising dialecticians ignore some of the most important and wellknown facts 609 which bear upon the question anything more than a parochial acquaintance with physical geography and geology would suffice to remind its possessor that the holy land itself offers a standing protest against bringing such a deluge as that of noah anywhere near it either in historical times or in the course of that pleistocene period of which the great ice age formed a part  judæa and galilee moab and gilead occupy part of that extensive tableland at the summit of the western boundary of the euphrates valley to which i have already referred if that valley had ever been filled with water to a height sufficient not indeed to cover a third of ararat in the north or half some of the mountains of the persian frontier in the east but to reach even four or five thousand feet it must have stood over the palestinian hogsback and have filled up to the brim every depression on its surface therefore it could not have failed to fill that remarkable trench in which the dead sea the jordan and the sea of galilee lie and which is known as the jordanarabah valley  this long and deep hollow extends more than 200 miles from near the site of ancient dan in the north to the waterparting at the head of the wady arabah in the south and its deepest part at the bottom of the basin of the dead sea lies 2500 feet below the surface of the adjacent mediterranean the lowest portion of the rim of the jordanarabah valley is situated at the village of el fuleh 257 feet above the mediterranean everywhere else the 610 circumjacent heights rise to a very much greater altitude hence of the water which stood over the syrian tableland when as much drained off as could run away enough would remain to form a mere without an outlet 2757 feet deep over the present site of the dead sea from this time forth the level of the palestinian mere could be lowered only by evaporation it is an extremely interesting fact which has happily escaped capture for the purposes of the energetic misunderstanding that the valley at one time was filled certainly within 150 feet of this heightprobably higher and it is almost equally certain that the time at which this great jordanarabah mere reached its highest level coincides with the glacial epoch but then the evidence which goes to prove this also leads to the conclusion that this state of things obtained at a period considerably older than even 4004 bc when the world according to the helps or shall we say hindrances provided for the simple student of the bible was created that it was not brought about by any diluvial catastrophe but was the result of a change in the relative activities of certain natural operations which are quietly going on now and that since the level of the mere began to sink many thousand years ago no serious catastrophe of any description has affected the valley  the evidence that the jordanarabah valley really was once filled with water the surface of which reached within 160 feet of the level of the pass of jezrael and possibly stood higher is this remains 611 of alluvial strata containing shells of the freshwater mollusks which still inhabit the valley worn down into terraces by waves which long rippled at the same level and furrowed by the channels excavated by modern rainfalls have been found at the former height and they are repeated at intervals lower down until the ghor or plain of the jordan itself an alluvial deposit is reached these strata attain a considerable thickness and they indicate that the epoch at which the freshwater mere of palestine reached its highest level is extremely remote that its diminution has taken place very slowly and with periods of rest during which the first formed deposits were cut down into terraces this conclusion is strikingly borne out by other facts a volcanic region stretches from galilee to gilead and the hauran on each side of the northern end of the valley some of the streams of basaltic lava which have been thrown out from its craters and clefts in times of which history has no record have run athwart the course of the jordan itself or of that of some of its tributary streams the lava streams therefore must be of later date than the depressions they fill and yet where they have thus temporarily dammed the jordan and the jermuk these streams have had time to cut through the hard basalts and lay bare the beds over which before the lava streams invaded them they flowed  in fact the antiquity of the present jordanarabah valley as a hollow in a tableland out of reach of the sea and troubled by no diluvial or other 612 disturbances beyond the volcanic eruptions of gilead and of galilee is vast even as estimated by a geological standard no marine deposits of later than miocene age occur in or about it and there is every reason to believe that the syroarabian plateau has been dry land throughout the pliocene and later epochs down to the present time raised beaches containing recent shells on the levantine shores of the mediterranean and on those of the red sea testify to a geologically recent change of the sea level to the extent of 250 or 300 feet probably produced by the slow elevation of the land and as i have already remarked the alluvial plain of the euphrates and tigris appears to have been affected in the same way though seemingly to a less extent but of violent or catastrophic change there is no trace even the volcanic outbursts have flowed in even sheets over the old land surface and the long lines of the horizontal terraces which remain testify to the geological insignificance of such earthquakes as have taken place it is indeed possible that the original formation of the valley may have been determined by the wellknown fault along which the western rocks are relatively depressed and the eastern elevated but whether that fault was effected slowly or quickly and whenever it came into existence the excavation of the valley to its present width no less than the sculpturing of its steep walls and of the innumerable deep ravines which score them down to the very bottom are indubitably due to the operation of rain and streams during an enormous length of time 613 without interruption or disturbance of any magnitude the alluvial deposits which have been mentioned are continued into the lateral ravines and have more or less filled them but since the waters have been lowered these deposits have been cut down to great depths and are still being excavated by the present temporary or permanent streams hence it follows that all these ravines must have existed before the time at which the valley was occupied by the great mere this fact acquires a peculiar importance when we proceed to consider the grounds for the conclusion that the old palestinian mere attained its highest level in the cold period of the pleistocene epoch it is well known that glaciers formerly came low down on the flanks of lebanon and antilebanon indeed the old moraines are the haunts of the few survivors of the famous cedars this implies a perennial snowcap of great extent on hermon therefore a vastly greater supply of water to the sources of the jordan which rise on its flanks and in addition such a total change in the general climate that the innumerable wadys now traversed only by occasional storm torrents must have been occupied by perennial streams all this involves a lower annual temperature and a moist and rainy atmosphere if such a change of meteorological conditions could be effected now when the loss by evaporation from the surface of the dead sea saltpan balances all the gain from the jordan and other streams the scale would be turned in the other direction the waters of the dead sea would become diluted its level would rise 614 it would cover first the plain of the jordan then the lake of galilee then the middle jordan between this lake and that of huleh the ancient merom and finally it would encroach northwards along the course of the upper jordan and southwards up the wady arabah until it reached some 260 feet above the level of the mediterranean when it would attain a permanent level by sending any superfluity through the pass of jezrael to swell the waters of the kishon and flow thence into the mediterranean  reverse the process in consequence of the excess of loss by evaporation over gain by inflow which must have set in as the climate of syria changed after the end of the pleistocene epoch and without taking into consideration any other circumstances the present state of things must eventually be reacheda concentrated saline solution in the deepest part of the valleywater rather more charged with saline matter than ordinary fresh water in the lower jordan and the lake of galileefresh waters still largely derived from the snows of hermon in the upper jordan and in lake huleh but if the full state of jordan valley marks the glacial epoch then it follows that the excavation of that valley by atmospheric agencies must have occupied an immense antecedent timea large part perhaps the whole of the pliocene epoch and we are thus forced to the conclusion that since the miocene epoch the physical conformation of the holy land has been substantially what it is now it has been more or less rained upon searched by 615 earthquakes here and there partially overflowed by lava streams slowly raised relatively to the sealevel a few hundred feet but there is not a shadow of ground for supposing that throughout all this time terrestrial animals have ceased to inhabit a large part of its surface or that in many parts they have been in any respect incommoded by the changes which have taken place  the evidence of the general stability of the physical conditions of western asia which is furnished by palestine and by the euphrates valley is only fortified if we extend our view northwards to the black sea and the caspian the caspian is a sort of magnified replica of the dead sea the bottom of the deepest part of this vast inland mere is 3000 feet below the level of the mediterranean while its surface is lower by 85 feet at present it is separated on the west by wide spaces of dry land from the black sea which has the same height as the mediterranean and on the east from the aral 138 feet above that level the waters of the black sea now in communication with the mediterranean by the dardanelles and the bosphorus are salt but become brackish northwards where the rivers of the steppes pour in a great volume of fresh water those of the shallower northern half of the caspian are similarly affected by the volga and the ural while in the shallow bays of the southern division they become extremely saline in consequence of the intense evaporation the aral sea though supplied by the jaxartes and the oxus has brackish water there is evidence 616 that in the pliocene and pleistocene periods to go no farther back the strait of the dardanelles did not exist and that the vast area from the valley of the danube to that of the jaxartes was covered by brackish or in some parts fresh water to a height of at least 200 feet above the level of the mediterranean at the present time the waterparting which separates the northern part of the basin of the caspian from the vast plains traversed by the tobol and the obi in their course to the arctic ocean appears to be less than 200 feet above the latter it would seem therefore to be very probable that under the climatal conditions of part of the pleistocene period the valley of the obi played the same part in relation to the pontoaralian sea as that of the kishon may have done to the great mere of the jordan valley and that the outflow formed the channel by which the wellknown arctic elements of the fauna of the caspian entered it for the fossil remains imbedded in the strata continuously deposited in the aralocaspian area since the latter end of the miocene epoch show no sign that from that time onward it has ever been covered by sea water therefore the supposition of a free inflow of the arctic ocean which at one time was generally received as well as that of various hypothetical deluges from that quarter must be seriously questioned  the caspian and the aral stand in somewhat the same relation to the vast basin of dry land in which they lie as the dead sea and the lake of galilee to the jordan valley they are the remains of a vast 617 mostly brackish mere which has dried up in consequence of the excess of evaporation over supply since the cold and damp climate of the pleistocene epoch gave place to the increasing dryness and great summer heats of central asia in more modern times the desiccation of the aralocaspian basin which communicated with the black sea only by a comparatively narrow and shallow strait along the present valley of manytsch the bottom of which was less than 100 feet above the mediterranean must have been vastly aided by the erosion of the strait of the dardanelles towards the end of the pleistocene epoch or perhaps later for the result of thus opening a passage for the waters of the black sea into the mediterranean must have been the gradual lowering of its level to that of the latter sea when this process had gone so far as to bring down the black sea water to within less than a hundred feet of its present level the strait of manytsch ceased to exist and the vast body of fresh water brought down by the danube the dnieper the don and other south russian rivers was cut off from the caspian and eventually delivered into the mediterranean thus there is as conclusive evidence as one can well hope to obtain in these matters that north of the euphrates valley the physical geography of an area as large as all central europe has remained essentially unchanged from the miocene period down to our time just as to the west of the euphrates valley palestine has exhibited a similar persistence of geographical type to the south the valley of the nile 618 tells exactly the same story the holes bored by miocene mollusks in the cliffs east and west of cairo bear witness that in the miocene epoch it contained an arm of the sea the bottom of which has since been gradually filled up by the alluvium of the nile and elevated to its present position but the higher parts of the mokattam and of the desert about ghizeh have been dry land from that time to this too little is known of the geology of persia at present to allow any positive conclusion to be enunciated but taking the name to indicate the whole continental mass of iran between the valleys of the indus and the euphrates the supposition that its physical geography has remained unchanged for an immensely long period is hardly rash the country is in fact an enormous basin surrounded on all sides by a mountainous rim and subdivided within by ridges into plateaus and hollows the bottom of the deepest of which in the province of seistan probably descends to the level of the indian ocean these depressions are occupied by salt marshes and deserts in which the waters of the streams which flow down the sides of the basin are now dissipated by evaporation i am acquainted with no evidence that the present iranian basin was ever occupied by the sea but the accumulations of gravel over a great extent of its surface indicate longcontinued water action it is therefore a fair presumption that large lakes have covered much of its present deserts and that they have dried up by the operation of the same changed climatal conditions as those which have 619 reduced the caspian and the dead sea to their present dimensions181  thus it would seem that the euphrates valley the centre of the fabled noachian deluge is also the centre of a region covering some millions of square miles of the present continents of europe asia and africa in which all the facts relevant to the argument at present known converge to the conclusion that since the miocene epoch the essential features of its physical geography have remained unchanged that it has neither been depressed below the sea nor swept by diluvial waters since that time and that the chaldean version of the legend of a flood in the euphrates valley is of all those which are extant the only one which is even consistent with probability since it depicts a local inundation not more severe than one which might be brought about by a concurrence of favourable conditions at the present day and which might probably have been more easily effected when the persian gulf extended farther north hence the recourse to the glacial epoch for some event which might colourably represent a flood distinctly asserted by the only authority for it to have occurred in historical times is peculiarly unfortunate even a welsh antiquarian might hesitate over the supposition that a tradition of the fate of moel tryfaen in the glacial epoch had furnished the basis of fact for a legend 620 which arose among people whose own experience abundantly supplied them with the needful precedents moreover if evidence of interchanges of land and sea are to be accepted as confirmations of noahs deluge there are plenty of sources for the tradition to be had much nearer than wales  the depression now filled by the red sea for example appears to be geologically of very recent origin the later deposits found on its shores two or three hundred feet above the sea level contain no remains older than those of the present fauna while as i have already mentioned the valley of the adjacent delta of the nile was a gulf of the sea in miocene times but there is not a particle of evidence that the change of relative level which admitted the waters of the indian ocean between arabia and africa took place any faster than that which is now going on in greenland and scandinavia and which has left their inhabitants undisturbed even more remarkable changes were effected towards the end of or since the glacial epoch over the region now occupied by the levantine mediterranean and the Ægean sea the eastern coast region of asia minor the western of greece and many of the intermediate islands exhibit thick masses of stratified deposits of later tertiary age and of purely lacustrine characters and it is remarkable that on the south side of the island of crete such masses present steep cliffs facing the sea so that the southern boundary of the lake in which they were formed must have been situated where the sea now flows indeed there are 621 valid reasons for the supposition that the dry land once extended far to the west of the present levantine coast and not improbably forced the nile to seek an outlet to the northeast of its present deltaa possibility of no small importance in relation to certain puzzling facts in the geographical distribution of animals in this region at any rate continuous land joined asia minor with the balkan peninsula and its surface bore deep freshwater lakes apparently disconnected with the pontoaralian sea this state of things lasted long enough to allow of the formation of the thick lacustrine strata to which i have referred i am not aware that there is the smallest ground for the assumption that the Ægean land was broken up in consequence of any of the catastrophes which are so commonly invoked182 for anything that appears to the contrary the narrow steepsided straits between the islands of the Ægean archipelago may have been originally brought about by ordinary atmospheric and stream action and then filled from the mediterranean during a slow submergence proceeding from the south northwards the strait of the dardanelles is bounded by undisturbed pleistocene strata forty feet thick through which to all appearance the present passage has been quietly cut  that olympus and ossa were torn asunder and the waters of the thessalian basin poured forth is a very ancient notion and an often cited confirmation of deucalions flood it has not yet ceased to 622 be in vogue apparently because those who entertain it are not aware that modern geological investigation has conclusively proved that the gorge of the peneus is as typical an example of a valley of erosion as any to be seen in auvergne or in colorado183  thus in the immediate vicinity of the vast expanse of country which can be proved to have been untouched by any catastrophe before during and since the glacial epoch lie the great areas of the Ægean and the red sea in which during or since the glacial epoch changes of the relative positions of land and sea have taken place in comparison with which the submergence of moel tryfaen with all wales and scotland to boot does not come to much  what then is the relevancy of talk about the glacial epoch to the question of the historical veracity of the narrator of the story of the noachian deluge so far as my knowledge goes there is not a particle of evidence that destructive inundations were more common over the general surface of the earth in the glacial epoch than they have been before or since no doubt the fringe of an icecovered region must be always liable to them but if we examine the records of such catastrophes in historical times those produced in the deltas of great rivers or in lowlands like holland by sudden floods combined with gales of wind or with unusual tides far excel all others  with respect to such inundations as are the 623 consequences of earthquakes and other slight movements of the crust of the earth i have never heard of anything to show that they were more frequent and severer in the quaternary or tertiary epochs than they are now in the discussion of these as of all other geological problems the appeal to needless catastrophes is born of that impatience of the slow and painful search after sufficient causes in the ordinary course of nature which is a temptation to all though only energetic ignorance nowadays completely succumbs to it      postscript      my best thanks are due to mr gladstone for his courteous withdrawal of     one of the statements to which i have thought it needful to take     exception the familiarity with controversy to which mr gladstone     alludes will have accustomed him to the misadventures which arise     when as sometimes will happen in the heat of fence the buttons come     off the foils i trust that any scratch which he may have received will     heal as quickly as my own flesh wounds have done        a contribution to the last number of this review of a different order     would be left unnoticed were it not that my silence would convert me     into an accessory to misrepresentations of a very grave character     however i shall restrict myself to the barest possible statement of     facts leaving my readers to draw their own conclusions      in an article entitled a great lesson published in this review for     september 1887      1 the duke of argyll says the overthrow of darwins speculations     p 301 concerning the origin of coral reefs which he fancied had     taken place had been received by men of science with a grudging     silence as far as public discussion is concerned p 301      624 the truth is that as every one acquainted with the literature of     the subject was well aware the views supposed to have effected this     overthrow had been fully and publicly discussed by dana in the united     states by geikie green and prestwich in this country by lapparent     in france and by credner in germany      2 the duke of argyll says that no serious reply has ever been     attempted p 305      the truth is that the highest living authority on the subject     professor dana published a most weighty reply two years before the     duke of argyll committed himself to this statement      3 the duke of argyll uses the preceding products of defective     knowledge multiplied by excessive imagination to illustrate the     manner in which certain accepted opinions established a sort of     reign of terror in their own behalf p 307      the truth is that no plea except that of total ignorance of the     literature of the subject can excuse the errors cited and that the     reign of terror is a purely subjective phenomenon      4 the letter in nature for the 17th of november 1887 to which i am     referred contains neither substantiation nor retractation of     statements 1 and 2 nevertheless it repeats number 3 the duke of     argyll says of his article that it has done what i intended it to do     it has called wide attention to the influence of mere authority in     establishing erroneous theories and in retarding the progress of     scientific truth      5 the duke of argyll illustrates the influence of his fictitious     reign of terror by the statement that mr john murray was strongly     advised against the publication of his views in derogation of darwins     longaccepted theory of the coral islands and was actually induced to     delay it for two years p 307 and in nature for the 17th november     1887 the duke of argyll states that he has seen a letter from sir     wyville thomson in which he urged and almost insisted that mr murray     should withdraw the reading of his papers on the subject from the royal     society of edinburgh this was in february 1877 the next paragraph     however contains the confession no special reason was assigned the     duke of argyll proceeds to give a speculative opinion that sir wyville     625 dreaded some injury to the scientific reputation of the body of     which he was the chief truly a very probable supposition but as sir     wyville thomsons tendencies were notoriously antidarwinian it does     not appear to me to lend the slightest justification to the duke of     argylls insinuation that the darwinian terror influenced him     however the question was finally set at rest by a letter which     appeared in nature 29th of december 1887 in which the writer says     that          talking with sir wyville about murrays new theory i asked what         objection he had to its being brought before the public the answer         simply was he considered that the grounds of the theory had not         as yet been sufficiently investigated or sufficiently         corroborated and that therefore any immature dogmatic publication         of it would do less than little service either to science or to the         author of the paper      sir wyville thomson was an intimate friend of mine and i am glad to     have been afforded one more opportunity of clearing his character from     the aspersions which have been so recklessly cast upon his good sense     and his scientific honour      6 as to the overthrow of darwins theory which according to the     duke of argyll was patent to every unprejudiced person four years ago     i have recently become acquainted with a work in which a really     competent authority184 thoroughly acquainted with all the new lights     which have been thrown upon the subject during the last ten years     pronounces the judgment firstly that some of the facts brought     forward by messrs murray and guppy against darwins theory are not     facts secondly that the others are reconcilable with darwins theory     and thirdly that the theories of messrs murray and guppy are     contradicted by a series of important facts p 13

objected that i have not put the case fairly inasmuch as the solitary insects wing which was discovered twelve months ago in silurian rocks and which is at present the sole evidence of insects older than the devonian epoch came from strata of middle silurian age and is therefore older than the scorpions which within the last two years have been found in upper silurian strata in sweden britain and the united states but no one who comprehends the nature of the evidence afforded by fossil remains would venture to say that the nondiscovery of scorpions in the middle silurian strata up to this time affords any more ground for supposing that they did not exist than the nondiscovery of flying insects in the upper silurian strata up to this time throws any doubt on the certainty that they existed which is derived from the occurrence of the wing in the middle silurian in fact i have stretched a point in admitting that these fossils afford a colourable pretext for the assumption that the land and airpopulation were of contemporaneous origin  14 the nineteenth century 1886  15 both dolphins and dugongs occur in the red sea porpoises and dolphins in the mediterranean so that the mosaic writer may well have been acquainted with them  16 i said nothing about the greater number of schools of greek philosophy as mr gladstone implies that i did but expressly spoke of the founders of greek philosophy  17 see heinze die lehre vom logos p 9 et seq  18 reprinted in lay sermons addresses and reviews 1870  19 ancient doubtless but his antiquity must not be exaggerated for example there is no proof that the mosaic cosmogony was known to the israelites of solomons time  20 when jeremiah iv 23 says i beheld the earth and lo it was waste and void he certainly does not mean to imply that the form of the earth was less definite or its substance less solid than before  21 in looking through the delightful volume recently published by the astronomer royal for ireland a day or two ago i find the following remarks on the nebular hypothesis which i should have been glad to quote in my text if i had known them sooner  nor can it be ever more than a speculation it cannot be established by observation nor can it be proved by calculation it is merely a conjecture more or less plausible but perhaps in some degree necessarily true if our present laws of heat as we understand them admit of the extreme application here required and if the present order of things has reigned for sufficient time without the intervention of any influence at present known to us the story of the heavens p 506  would any prudent advocate base a plea either for or against revelation upon the coincidence or want of coincidence of the declarations of the latter with the requirements of an hypothesis thus guardedly dealt with by an astronomical expert  22 lectures on evolution delivered in new york american addresses  23 reuss lhistoire sainte et la loi vol i p 275  24 for the sense of the term elohim see p 141  25 perhaps even hippopotamuses and otters  26 even the most sturdy believers in the popular theory that the proper or titular names attached to the books of the bible are those of their authors will hardly be prepared to maintain that jephthah gideon and their colleagues wrote the book of judges nor is it easily admissible that samuel wrote the two books which pass under his name one of which deals entirely with events which took place after his death in fact no one knows who wrote either judges or samuel nor when within the range of 100 years their present form was given to these books  27 my citations are taken from the revised version but for lord and god i have substituted jahveh and elohim  28 i need hardly say that i depend upon authoritative biblical critics whenever a question of interpretation of the text arises as reuss appears to me to be one of the most learned acute and fairminded of those whose works i have studied i have made most use of the commentary and dissertations in his splendid french edition of the bible but i have also had recourse to the works of dillman kalisch kuenen thenius tuch and others in cases in which another opinion seemed desirable  29 see divination by hazoral journal of anthropology bombay vol i no 1  30 see for example the message of jephthah to the king of the ammonites so now jahveh the elohim of israel hath dispossessed the amorites from before his people israel and shouldest thou possess them wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy elohim giveth thee to possess jud xi 23 24 for jephthah chemosh is obviously as real a personage as jahveh  31 for example my oblation my food for my offerings made by fire of a sweet savour to me shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season num xxviii 2  32 in 2 samuel xv 27 david says to zadok the priest art thou not a seer and gad is called davids seer  33 this would at first appear to be inconsistent with the use of the word prophetess for deborah but it does not follow because the writer of judges applies the name to deborah that it was used in her day  34 samuel tells the cook bring the portion which i gave thee of which i said to thee set it by thee it was therefore samuels to give and the cook took up the thigh or shoulder and that which was upon it and set it before saul but in the levitical regulations it is the thigh or shoulder which becomes the priests own property and the right thigh or shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heaveoffering which is given along with the wave breast unto aaron the priest and unto his sons as a due for ever from the children of israel lev vii 3134 reuss writes on this passage la cuisse nest point agitée mais simplement prelevée sur ce que les convives mangeront  35 see for example elkanahs sacrifice 1 sam i 39  36 the ghost was not supposed to be capable of devouring the gross material substance of the offering but his vaporous body appropriated the smoke of the burnt sacrifice the visible and odorous exhalations of other offerings the blood of the victim was particularly useful because it was thought to be the special seat of its soul or life a west african negro replied to an european sceptic of course the spirit cannot eat corporeal food but he extracts its spiritual part and as we see leaves the material part behind lippert seelencult p 16  37 it is further well worth consideration whether indications of former ancestorworship are not to be found in the singular weight attached to the veneration of parents in the fourth commandment it is the only positive commandment in addition to those respecting the deity and that concerning the sabbath and the penalties for infringing it were of the same character in china a corresponding reverence for parents is part and parcel of ancestorworship so in ancient rome and in greece where parents were even called greek deuteroi kai epigeoi theoi the fifth commandment as it stands would be an excellent compromise between ancestorworship and monotheism the larger hereditary share allotted by israelitic law to the eldest son reminds one of the privileges attached to primogeniture in ancient rome which were closely connected with ancestorworship there is a good deal to be said in favour of the speculation that the ark of the covenant may have been a relic of ancestorworship but that topic is too large to be dealt with incidentally in this place  38 the scientific aspects of positivism fortnightly review 1869 republished in lay sermons  39 oeuvres de bossuet ed 1808 t xxxv p 282  40 i should like further to add the expression of my indebtedness to two works by herr julius lippert der seelencult in seinen beziehungen zur althebraischen religion and die religionen der europäischen culturvölker both published in 1881 i have found them full of valuable suggestions  41 see among others the remarkable work of fustel de coulanges la cité antique in which the social importance of the old roman ancestorworship is brought out with great clearness  42 supposed to be the finer or more aeriform part of the body standing in the same relation to the body as the perfume and the more essential qualities of a flower do to the more solid substances mariner vol ii p 127  43 a kind of clients in the roman sense  44 it is worthy of remark that greek daimôn among the greeks and deus among the

a precedent for my coinage  51 kami is used in the sense of elohim and is also like our word lord employed as a title of respect among men as indeed elohim was  52 the assyrians thus raised assur to a position of preeminence  53 i refer those who wish to know the reasons which lead me to take up this position to the works of reuss and wellhausen and especially to stades geschichte des volkes israel  54 bunsen egypts place vol v p 129 note  55 see birch in egypts place vol v and brugsch history of egypt  56 even by graetz who though a fair enough historian cannot be accused of any desire to

it should be remembered was a most devout jew held in the highest esteem by his countrymen in siegfrieds philo von alexandrien 1875 also dr j drummonds philo judæus 1888  59 i am not unaware of the existence of many and widely divergent sects and schools among the jews at all periods of their history since the dispersion but i imagine that orthodox judaism is now pretty much what it was in philos time while peter and paul if they could return to life would certainly have to learn the catechism of either the roman greek or anglican churches if they desired to be considered orthodox

perfectly polynesian in conception  61 see the famous collection of papers published by clarke in 1717 leibnitz says tis also a supernatural thing that bodies should attract one another at a distance without any intermediate means and clarke on behalf of newton caps this as follows that one body should attract another without any intermediate means is indeed not a miracle but a contradiction for tis supposing something to act where it is not  62 i may cite in support of this obvious conclusion of sound reasoning two authorities who will certainly not be regarded lightly by mr lilly these are augustine and thomas aquinas the former declares that fate is only an illchosen name for providence  prorsus divina providentia regna constituuntur humana quæ si propterea quisquam fato tribuit quia ipsam dei voluntatem vel potestatem fati nomine appellat sententiam teneat linguam corrigat augustinus de civitate dei v c i  the other great doctor of the catholic church divus thomas as suarez calls him whose marvellous grasp and subtlety of intellect seem to me to be almost without a parallel puts the whole case into a nutshell when he says that the ground for doing a thing in the mind of the doer is as it were the preexistence of the thing done  ratio autem alicujus fiendi in mente actoris existens est quædam præexistentia rei fiendæ in eo summa qu xxiii art i  if this is not enough i may further ask what materialist has ever given a better statement of the case for determinism on theistic grounds than is to be found in the following passage of the summa qu xiv art xiii  omnia quæ sunt in tempore sunt deo ab æterno præsentia non solum ea ex ratione quâ habet rationes rerum apud se presentes ut quidam dicunt sed quia ejus intuitus fertur ab æterno supra omnia prout sunt in sua præsentialitate unde manifestum est quod contingentia infallibiliter a deo cognoscuntur in quantum subduntur divino conspectui secundum suam præsentialitatem et tamen sunt futura contingentia suis causis proximis comparata  as i have not said that thomas aquinas is professedly a determinist i do not see the bearing of citations from him which may be more or less inconsistent with the foregoing  63 there is no exaggeration in this brief and summary view of the catholic cosmos but it would be unfair to leave it to be supposed that the reformation made any essential alteration except perhaps for the worse in that cosmology which called itself christian the protagonist of the reformation from whom the whole of the evangelical sects are lineally descended states the case with that plainness of speech not to say brutality which characterised him luther says that man is a beast of burden who only moves as his rider orders sometimes god rides him and sometimes satan sic voluntas humana in

zealous volunteer missionaries of evangelicism any sunday in modern london why these doctrines which are conspicuous by their absence in the four gospels should arrogate to themselves the title of evangelical in contradistinction to catholic christianity may well perplex the impartial inquirer who if he were obliged to choose between the two might naturally prefer that which leaves the poor beast of burden a little freedom of choice  64 i say socalled not by way of offence but as a protest against the monstrous assumption that catholic christianity is explicitly or implicitly contained in any trustworthy record of the teaching of jesus of nazareth  65 it may be desirable to observe that in modern times the term realism has acquired a signification wholly different from that which attached to it in the middle ages we commonly use it as the contrary of idealism the idealist holds that the phenomenal world has only a subjective existence the realist that it has an objective existence i am not aware that any mediæval philosopher was an idealist in the sense in which we apply the term to berkeley in fact the cardinal defect of their speculations lies in their oversight of the considerations which lead to idealism if many of them regarded the material world as a negation it was an active negation not zero but a minus quantity  66 at any rate a catastrophe greater than the flood which as i observe with interest is as calmly assumed by the preacher to be an historical event as if science had never had a word to say on that subject  67 les formes des anciens ou entéléchies ne sont autre chose que les forces leibnitz lettre au père bouvet 1697  68 nineteenth century march 1887  69 the duke of argyll speaks of the recent date of the demonstration of the fallacy of the doctrine in question recent is a relative term but i may mention that the question is fully discussed in my book on hume which if i may believe my publishers has been read by a good many people since it appeared in 1879 moreover i observe from a note at page 89 of the reign of law a work to which i shall have occasion to advert by and by that the duke of argyll draws attention to the circumstance that so long ago as 1866 the views which i hold on this subject were well known the duke in fact writing about this time says after quoting a phrase of mine the question of miracles seems now to be admitted on all hands to be simply a question of evidence in science we think that a teacher who ignores views which have been discussed coram populo for twenty years is hardly up to the mark  70 see also vol i p 460 in the ninth edition 1853 published twentythree years after the first lyell deprives even the most careless reader of any excuse for misunderstanding him so in regard to subterranean movements the theory of the perpetual uniformity of the force which they exert on the earthcrust is quite consistent with the admission of their alternate development and suspension for indefinite periods within limited geographical areas p 187  71 a great many years ago presidential address to the geological society 1869 i ventured to indicate that which seemed to me to be the weak point not in the fundamental principles of uniformitarianism but in uniformitarianism as taught by lyell it lay to my mind in the refusal by hutton and in a less degree by lyell to look beyond the limits of the time recorded by the stratified rocks i said this attempt to limit at a particular point the progress of inductive and deductive reasoning from the things which are to the things which werethis faithlessness to its own logic seems to me to have cost uniformitarianism the place as the permanent form of geological speculation which it might otherwise have held lay sermons p 260 the context shows that uniformitarianism here means that doctrine as limited in application by hutton and lyell and that what i mean by evolutionism is consistent and thoroughgoing uniformitarianism

the facts of observation i add i have hitherto said nothing about their meaning as in an inquiry so difficult and fraught with interest as this it seems to me to be in the highest degree important to keep the questions of fact and the questions of interpretation well apart p 210  80 see the official report of the church congress held at manchester october 1888 pp 253 254  81 in this place and in the eleventh essay there are references to the late archbishop of york which are of no importance to my main argument and which i have expunged because i desire to obliterate the traces of a temporary

after our little skirmish well is it to be peace or war i replied a little of both but there was only peace when we parted and ever after  82 dr wace tells us it may be asked how far we can rely on the accounts we possess of our lords teaching on these subjects and he seems to think the question appropriately answered by the assertion that it ought to be regarded as settled by m renans practical surrender of the adverse case i thought i knew m renans works pretty well but i have contrived to miss this practical i wish dr wace had defined the scope of that useful adjective surrender however as dr wace can find no difficulty in pointing out the passage of m renans writings by which he feels justified in making his statement i shall wait for further enlightenment contenting myself for the present with remarking that if m renan were to retract and do penance in notredame tomorrow for any contributions to biblical criticism that may be specially his property the main results of that criticism as they are set forth in the works of strauss baur reuss and volkmar for example would not be sensibly affected  83 see de gobineau les religions et les philosophies dans lasie centrale and the recently published work of mr e g browne the episode of the bab  84 here as always the revised version is cited  85 does any one really mean to say that there is any internal or external criterion by which the reader of a biblical statement in which scientific matter is contained is enabled to judge whether it is to be taken au sérieux or not is the account of the deluge accepted as true in the new testament less precise and specific than that of the call of abraham also accepted as true therein by what mark does the story of the feeding with manna in the wilderness which involves some very curious scientific problems show that it is meant merely for edification while the story of the inscription of the law on stone by the hand of jahveh is literally true if the story of the fall is not the true record of an historical occurrence what becomes of pauline theology yet the story of the fall as directly conflicts with probability and is as devoid of trustworthy evidence as that of the creation or that of the deluge with which it forms an harmoniously legendary series  86 see for an admirable discussion of the whole subject dr abbotts article on the gospels in the encyclopædia britannica and the remarkable monograph by professor volkmar jesus nazarenus und die erste christliche zeit 1882 whether we agree with the conclusions of these writers or not the method of critical investigation which they adopt is unimpeachable  87 notwithstanding the hard words shot at me from behind the hedge of anonymity by a writer in a recent number of the quarterly review i repeat without the slightest fear of refutation that the four gospels as they have come to us are the work of unknown writers  88 their arguments in the long run are always reducible to one form otherwise trustworthy witnesses affirm that such and such events took place these events are inexplicable except the agency of spirits is admitted therefore spirits were the cause of the phenomena  and the heads of the reply are always the same remember goethes aphorism alles factische ist schon theorie trustworthy witnesses are constantly deceived or deceive themselves in their interpretation of sensible phenomena no one can prove that the sensible phenomena in these cases could be caused only by the agency of spirits and there is abundant ground for believing that they may be produced in other ways therefore the utmost that can be reasonably asked for on the evidence as it stands is suspension of judgment and on the necessity for even that suspension reasonable men may differ according to their views of probability  89 yet i must somehow have laid hold of the pith of the matter for many years afterwards when dean mansells bampton lectures were published it seemed to me i already knew all that this eminently agnostic thinker had to tell me  90 kritik der reinen vernunft edit hartenstein p 256  91 report of the church congress manchester 1888 p 252  92 fortnightly

sufferings with herbs and frivolous incantations vain enough no doubt but the mulierculæ might have returned the epithet superstitious with interest  103 of course there is nothing new in this argument but it does not grow weaker by age and the case of eginhard is far more instructive than that of augustine because the former has so very frankly though incidentally revealed to us not only his own mental and moral habits but those of the people about him  104 see 1 cor xii 1028 2 cor vi 12 rom xv 19  105 a journal or historical account of the life travels sufferings and christian

the tenets of their sect have written for the opinion of a scientific theologian about theologians of this stamp see pp 225 and 227 of the vorträge  109 i suppose this is what dr wace is thinking about when he says that i allege that there is no visible escape from the supposition of an urmarcus p 367 that a theologian of repute should confound an indisputable fact with one of the modes of explaining that fact is not so singular as those who are unaccustomed to the ways of theologians might imagine  110 any examiner whose duty it has been to examine into a case of copying will be particularly well prepared to appreciate the force of the case stated in that most excellent little book the common tradition of the synoptic gospels by dr abbott and mr rushbrooke macmillan 1884 to those who have not passed through such painful experiences i may recommend the brief discussion of the genuineness of the casket letters in my friend mr skeltons interesting book maitland of lethington the second edition of holtzmanns lehrbuch published in 1886 gives a remarkably fair and full account of the present results of criticism at p 366 he writes that the present burning question is whether the relatively primitive narrative and the root of the other synoptic texts is contained in matthew or in mark it is only on this point that properlyinformed sachkundige critics differ and he decides in favour of mark  111 holtzmann die synoptischen evangelien 1863 p 75 following ewald argues that the source a   the threefold tradition more or less contained something that answered to the sermon on the plain immediately after the words of our present mark and he cometh into a house iii 19 but what conceivable motive could mark have for omitting it holtzmann has no doubt however

prayer that of bishop alexander who begged god to take arius away is said to have been offered about 3 pm on the saturday that same evening arius was in the great square of constantine when he was suddenly seized with indisposition p clxx the infidel gibbon seems to have dared to suggest that an option between poison and miracle is presented by this case and it must be admitted that if the bishop had been within the reach of a modern police magistrate things might have gone hardly with him modern infidels possessed of a slight knowledge of chemistry are not unlikely with no less audacity to suggest an option between firedamp and miracle in seeking for the cause of the fiery outburst at jerusalem  133 a writer in a spiritualist journal takes me roundly to task for venturing to doubt the historical and literal truth of the gadarene story the following passage in his letter is worth quotation now to the materialistic and scientific mind to the uninitiated in spiritual verities certainly this story of the gadarene or gergesene swine presents insurmountable difficulties it seems grotesque and nonsensical to the experienced trained and cultivated spiritualist this miracle is as i am prepared to show one of the most instructive the most profoundly useful and the most beneficent which jesus ever wrought in the whole course of his pilgrimage of redemption on earth
