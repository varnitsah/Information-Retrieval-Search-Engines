84929621	mr crewes career complete  by winston churchill     book 1     chapter i the honourable hilary vane sits for his portrait  i may as well begin this story with mr hilary vane more frequently addressed as the honourable hilary vane although it was the gentlemans proud boast that he had never held an office in his life he belonged to the vanes of camden streeta beautiful village in the hills near riptonand was in common with some other great men who had made a noise in new york and the nation a graduate of camden wentworth academy but mr vane when he was at home lived on a wide mapleshaded street in the city of ripton cared for by an elderly housekeeper who had more edges than a newfangled mowing machine the house was a porticoed one which had belonged to the austens for a hundred years or more for hilary vane had married towards middle age miss sarah austen in two years he was a widower and he never tried it again he had the austens house and that manyedged woman euphrasia cotton the austens housekeeper  the house was of wood and was painted white as regularly as leap year from the street front to the vegetable garden in the extreme rear it was exceedingly long and perhaps for proprietys sakehilary vane lived at one end of it and euphrasia at the other hilary was sixtyfive euphrasia seventy which is not old for frugal people though it is just as well to add that there had never been a breath of scandal about either of them in ripton or elsewhere for the honourable hilarys modest needs one room sufficed and the front parlour had not been used since poor sarah austens demise thirty years before this story opens  in those thirty years by a sane and steady growth hilary vane had achieved his present eminent position in the state he was trustee for i know not how many people and institutions a deacon in the first church a lawyer of such ability that he sometimes was accorded the courtesytitle of judge his only viceif it could be called suchwas in occasionally placing a piece the size of a pea of a particular kind of plug tobacco under his tongueand this was not known to many people euphrasia could not be called a wasteful person and hilary had accumulated no small portion of this worlds goods and placed them as propriety demanded where they were not visible to the naked eye and be it added in his favour that he gave as secretly to institutions and hospitals the finances and methods of which were known to him  as concrete evidence of the honourable hilary vanes importance when he travelled he had only to withdraw from his hippocket a book in which many coloured cards were neatly inserted an opensesame which permitted him to sit without payment even in those wheeled palaces of luxury known as pullman cars within the limits of the state he did not even have to open the book but merely say with a twinkle of his eyes to the conductor good morning john and john would reply with a bow and a genial and usually witty remark and point him out to a nobody who sat in the back of the car so far had mr hilary vanes talents carried him  the beginning of this eminence dated back to the days before the empire when there were many little principalities of railroads fighting among themselves for we are come to a changed america there was a time in the days of the sixth edward of england when the great landowners found it more profitable to consolidate the farms seize the common lands and acquire riches hitherto undreamed of hence the rising of tailor ket and others and the leveling of fences and barriers and the eating of many sheep it may have been that mr vane had come across this passage in english history but he drew no parallels his first position of trust had been as counsel for that principality known in the old days as the central railroad of which a certain mr duncan had been president and hilary vane had fought the centrals battles with such telling effect that when it was merged into the one imperial railroad its stockholdersto the admiration of financierswere guaranteed ten per cent it was indeed rumoured that hilary drew the act of consolidation itself at any rate he was too valuable an opponent to neglect and after a certain interval of time mr vane became chief counsel in the state for the imperial railroad on which dizzy height we now behold him and he found by degrees that he had no longer time for private practice  it is perhaps gratuitous to add that the honourable hilary vane was a man of convictions in politics he would have told youwith some vehemence if you seemed to doubtthat he was a republican treason to party he regarded with a deepseated abhorrence as an act for which a man should be justly outlawed if he were in a mellow mood with the right quantity of honey dew tobacco under his tongue he would perhaps tell you why he was a republican if he thought you worthy of his confidence he believed in the gold standard for one thing in the tariff left unimpaired in its glory for another and with a wave of his hand would indicate the prosperity of the nation which surrounded hima prosperity too sacred to tamper with  one article of his belief and in reality the chief article mr vane would not mention to you it was perhaps because he had never formulated the article for himself it might be called a faith in the divine right of imperial railroads to rule but it was left out of the verbal creed this is far from implying hypocrisy to mr vane it was his foundationrock and too sacred for light conversation when he allowed himself to be bitter against various young men with missions who had sprung up in various states of the union socalled purifiers of politics he would call them the unsuccessful with a grievance and recommend to them the practice of charity forbearance and other christian virtues thank god his state was not troubled with such  in person mr hilary vane was tall with a slight stoop to his shoulders and he wore the conventional doublebreasted black coat which reached to his knees and squaretoed congress boots he had a puritan beard the hawklike vane nose and a twinkling eye that spoke of a sense of humour and a knowledge of the world in short he was no mans fool and on occasions had been more than a match for certain new york lawyers with national reputations  it is rare in this world of trouble that such an apparently ideal and happy state of existence is without a canker and i have left the revelation of the canker to the last ripton knew it was there camden street knew it and mr vanes acquaintances throughout the state but nobody ever spoke of it euphrasia shed over it the only tears she had known since sarah austen died and some of these blotted the only letters she wrote hilary vane did not shed tears but his friends suspected that his heartstrings were torn and pitied him hilary vane fiercely resented pity and that was why they did not speak of it this trouble of his was the common point on which he and euphrasia touched and they touched only to quarrel let us out with ithilary vane had a wild son whose name was austen  euphrasia knew that in his secret soul mr vane attributed this wildness and what he was pleased to designate as profligacy to the austen blood and euphrasia resented it bitterly sarah austen had been a young elfish thing when he married hera dryad the elderly and learned mrs tredway had called her mr vane had understood her about as well as he would have understood mary queen of scots if he had been married to that lady sarah austen had a wild shy beauty startled alert eyes like an animal and rebellious black hair that curled about her ears and gave her a faunlike appearance with a pipe and the costume of rosalind she would have been perfect she had had a habit of running off for the day into the hills with her son and the conventions of ripton had been to her as so many defunct blue laws during her brief married life there had been periods of defiance from her lasting a week when she would not speak to hilary or look at him and these periods would be followed by violent spells of weeping in euphrasias arms when the house was no place for hilary he possessed by matrimony and intricate mechanism of which his really admirable brain could not grasp the first principles he felt for her a real if uncomfortable affection but when she died he heaved a sigh of relief at which he was immediately horrified  austen he understood little better but his affection for the child may be likened to the force of a great river rushing through a narrow gorge and he vied with euphrasia in spoiling him neither knew what they were doing and the spoiling process was interspersed with occasional and to austen unmeaning intervals of severe discipline the boy loved the streets and the woods and his fellowbeings his punishments were a series of afternoons in the house during one of which he wrecked the bedroom where he was confined and was soundly whaled with an old slipper that broke under the process euphrasia kept the slipper and once showed it to hilary during a quarrel they had when the boy was grown up and gone and the house was silent and hilary had turned away choking and left the room such was his cross  to make it worse the boy had love his father nay still loved him as a little fellow after a scolding for some wayward prank he would throw himself into hilarys arms and cling to him and would never know how near he came to unmanning him as austen grew up they saw the world in different colours blue to hilary was red to austen and white black essentials to one were nonessentials to the other boys and girls men and women abhorred by one were boon companions to the other  austen made fun of the minister and was compelled to go church twice on sundays and to prayermeeting on wednesdays then he went to camden street to live with his grandparents in the old vane house and attend camden wentworth academy his letters such as they were were inimitable if crude but contained not the kind of humour hilary vane knew camden wentworth principal and teachers was painted to the life and the lad could hardly wait for vacation time to see his father only to begin quarreling with him again  i pass over escapades in ripton that shocked one half of the population and convulsed the other half austen went to the college which his father had attendeda college of splendid american traditionsand his career there might well have puzzled a father of far greater tolerance and catholicity hilary vane was a trustee and journeyed more than once to talk the matter over with the president who had been his classmate there  i love that boy hilary the president had said at length when pressed for a frank opinionthere isnt a soul in the place i believe that doesntundergraduates and facultybut he has given me more anxious thought than any scholar i have ever had  trouble corrected mr vane sententiously  well yes trouble answered the president smiling but upon my soul i think it is all animal spirits  a euphemism for the devil said hilary grimly he is the animal part of us i have been brought up to believe  the president was a wise man and took another tack  he has a really remarkable mind when he chooses to use it every once in a while he takes your breath awaybut he has to become interested a few weeks ago hays came to me direct from his lecture room to tell me about a discussion of austens in constitutional law hays you know is not easily enthused but he declares your son has as fine a legal brain as he has come across in his experience but since then i am bound to admit added the president sadly austen seems not to have looked at a lesson  unstable as water thou shalt not excel replied hilary  hell sober down said the president stretching his conviction a little he has two great handicaps he learns too easily and he is too popular the president looked out of his study window across the common surrounded by the great elms which had been planted when indian lads played among the stumps and the red flag of england had flown from the tall pine staff the green was covered now with students of a conquering race skylarking to and fro as they looked on at a desultory baseball game i verily believe said the president at a word from your son most of them would put on their coats and follow him on any mad expedition that came into his mind  hilary vane groaned more than once in the train back to ripton it meant nothing to him to be the father of the most popular man in college  the mad expedition came at length in the shape of a fight with the townspeople in which austen of course was the ringleader if he had inherited his mothers eccentricities he had height and physique from the vanes and one result was a week in bed for the son of the local plumber and a damage suit against the honourable hilary another result was that austen and a tom gaylord came back to ripton on a long suspension which rumour said would have been expulsion if hilary were not a trustee tom gaylord was proud of suspension in such company more of him later he was the son of old tom gaylord who owned more lumber than any man in the state and whom hilary vane believed to be the receptacle of all the vices  eventually austen went back and graduatednot summa cum laude honesty compels me to add then came the inevitable discussion and to please his father he went to the harvard law school for two years at the end of that time instead of returning to ripton a letter had come from him with the postmark of a western state where he had fled with a classmate who owned ranch evidently the worldly consideration to be derived from conformity counted little with austen vane money was a medium onlynot an end he was in the saddle all day with nothing but the horizon to limit him he loved his father and did not doubt his fathers love for him and he loved euphrasia he could support himself but he must see life the succeeding years brought letters and quaint useless presents to both the occupants of the lonely housenavajo blankets and indian jeweler and basketworkand austen little knew how carefully these were packed away and surreptitiously gazed at from time to time but to hilary the western career was a disgrace and such meagre reports of it as came from other sources than austen tended only to confirm him in this opinion  it was commonly said of mr paul pardriff that not a newspaper fell from the press that he did not have a knowledge of its contents certain it was that mr pardriff made a specialty of many kinds of knowledge political and otherwise and the information he could giveif he choseabout state and national affairs was of a recondite and cynical nature that made one wish to forget about the american flag mr pardriff was under forty and with these gifts many innocent citizens of ripton naturally wondered why the columns of his newspaper the ripton record did not more closely resemble the spiciness of his talk in the office of gales hotel the columns contained instead such efforts as essays on a national flower and the abnormal size of the hats of certain great men notably andrew jackson yes and the gold standard and in times of political stress they were devoted to a somewhat fulsome praise of regular and orthodox republican candidatesand praise of any one was not in character with the editor illnatured people said that the matter in his paper might possibly be accounted for by the gratitude of the candidates and the fact that mr pardriff and his wife and his maidservant and his hired man travelled on pink mileage books which could only be had for lovenot money on the other hand reputable witnesses had had it often from mr pardriff that he was a reformer and not at all in sympathy with certain practices which undoubtedly existed  some years beforeto be exact the year austen vane left the law schoolmr pardriff had proposed to exchange the ripton record with the editor of the pepper county plainsman in afar western state the exchange was effected and mr pardriff glanced over the plainsman regularly once a week though i doubt whether the western editor ever read the record after the first copy one day in june mr pardriff was seated in his sanctum above merrills drug store when his keen green eyes fell upon the followingthe plainsman considers it safe to say that the sympathy of the people of pepper county at large is with mr austen vane whose personal difficulty with jim blodgett resulted so disastrously for mr blodgett the latter gentleman has long made himself obnoxious to local ranch owners by his persistent disregard of property lines and property and it will be recalled that he is at present in hot water with the energetic secretary of the interior for fencing government lands vane who was recently made manager of ready money ranch is one of the most popular young men in the county he was unwillingly assisted over the state line by his friends although he has never been a citizen of the state the plainsman trusts that he may soon be back and become one of us at last report mr blodgett was resting easily  this article obtained circulation in ripton although it was not copied into the record out of deference to the feelings of the honourable hilary vane in addition to the personal regard mr pardriff professed to have for the honourable hilary it maybe well to remember that austens father was among other things chairman of the state committee mr tredway largest railroad stockholder in ripton pursed his lips that were already pursed tom gaylord roared with laughter two or three days later the honourable hilary still in blissful ignorance received a letter that agitated him sorely  dear father i hope you dont object to receiving a little visit from a prodigal wayward son to tell the truth i have found it convenient to leave the ready money ranch for a while although bob tyner is good enough to say i may have the place when i come back you know i often think of you and phrasie back in ripton and i long to see the dear old town again expect me when you see me  your aff son  austen     chapter ii on the treatment of prodigals  while euphrasia in a frenzy of anticipation garnished and swept the room which held for her so many memories of austens boyhood even beating the carpet with her own hands hilary vane went about his business with no apparent lack of diligence but he was meditating he had many times listened to the reverend mr weightman read the parable from the pulpit but he had never reflected how it would be to be the father of a real prodigal what was to be done about the calf was there to be a calf or was there not to tell the truth hilary wanted a calf and yet to have one in spite of holy writ would seem to set a premium on disobedience and riotous living  again austen had reached thirty an age when it was not likely he would settle down and live an orderly and godly life among civilized beings and therefore a fatted calf was likely to be the first of many follies which he hilary would live to regret no he would deal with justice how he dealt will be seen presently but when he finally reached this conclusion the clipping from the pepper county plainsman had not yet come before his eyes  it is worth relating how the clipping did come before his eyes for no one in ripton had the temerity to speak of it primarily it was because miss victoria flint had lost a terrier and secondarily because she was a person of strong likes and dislikes in pursuit of the terrier she drove madly through leith which as everybody knows is a famous colony of rich summer residents victoria probably stopped at every house in leith and searched them with characteristic vigour and lack of ceremony sometimes entering by the side door and sometimes by the front and caring very little whether the owners were at home or not mr humphrey crewe discovered her in a boastall at wedderburnas his place was calledfor it made little difference to victoria that mr crewe was a bachelor of marriageable age and millions full as ever of practical suggestions mr crewe proposed to telephone to ripton and put an advertisement in the record whichas he happened to knowwent to press the next day victoria would not trust to the telephone whereupon mr crewe offered to drive down with her  youd bore me humphrey said she as she climbed into her runabout with the father and grandfather of the absentee mr crewe laughed as she drove away he had a chemical quality of turning invidious remarks into compliments and he took this one as victorias manner of saying that she did not wish to disturb so important a man  arriving in the hot main street of ripton her sharp eyes descried the record sign over the drug store and in an astonishingly short time she was in the empty office mr pardriff was at dinner she sat down in the editorial chair and read a great deal of uninteresting matter but at last found something on the floor where the wind had blown it which made her laugh it was the account of austen vanes difficulty with mr blodgett victoria did not know austen but she knew that the honourable hilary had a son of that name who had gone west and this was what tickled her she thrust the clipping in the pocket of her linen coat just as mr pardriff came in  her conversation with the editor of the record proved so entertaining that she forgot all about the clipping until she had reached fairview and had satisfied a somewhat imperious appetite by a combination of lunch and afternoon tea fairview was the summer place of mr augustus p flint her father on a shelf of the hills in the town of tunbridge equidistant from leith and ripton and mr flint was the president of the imperial railroad no less  yes he had once been plain gus flint many years ago when he used to fetch the pockethandkerchiefs of mr isaac d worthington of brampton and he was still gus to his friends mr flints had been the brain which had largely conceived and executed the consolidation of principalities of which the imperial railroad was the result and as surely as tough metal prevails mr flint after many other trials and errors of weaker stuff had been elected to the place for which he was so supremely fitted we are so used in america to these tremendous rises that a paragraph will suffice to place mr flint in his aladdins palace to do him justice he cared not a fig for the palace and he would have been content with the farmhouse under the hill where his gardener lived you could not fool mr flint on a horse or a farm and he knew to a dot what a railroad was worth by travelling over it like his governorgeneral and dependent mr hilary vane he had married a wife who had upset all his calculations the lady discovered mr flints balance in the bank and had proceeded to use it for her own glorification and the irony of it all was that he could defend it from everybody else mrs flint spent and mr flint paid the bills for the first ten years protestingly and after that he gave it up and let her go her own gait  she had come from the town of sharon in another state through which mr flints railroad also ran and she had been known as the rose of that place she had begun to rise immediately with the kitelike adaptability of the american woman for high altitudes and the leaden weight of the husband at the end of the tail was as nothing to her she had begun it all by the study of people in hotels while mr flint was closeted with officials and directors by dint of minute observation and reasoning powers and unflagging determination she passed rapidly through several strata and had made a country place out of her husbands farm in tunbridge so happily and conveniently situated near leith in winter they lived on fifth avenue  one daughter alone had halted for a minute period this progress and this daughter was victorianamed by her mother victoria was now twentyone and was not only of another generation but might almost have been judged of another race than her parents the things for which her mother had striven she took for granted and thought of them not at all and she had by nature that simplicity and astonishing frankness of manner and speech which was once believed to be an exclusive privilege of duchesses  to return to fairview victoria after sharing her five oclock luncheon with her dogs went to seek her father for the purpose if it must be told of asking him for a cheque mr flint was at fairview on the average of two days out of the week during the summer and then he was nearly always closeted with a secretary and two stenographers and a longdistance telephone in two plain little rooms at the back of the house and mr hilary vane was often in consultation with him as he was on the present occasion when victoria flung open the door at sight of mr vane she halted suddenly on the threshold and a gleam of mischief came into her eye as she thrust her hand into her coat pocket the two regarded her with the detached air of men whose thread of thought has been broken  well victoria said her father kindly if resignedly what is it now  money replied victoria promptly i went to avalon this morning and bought that horse you said i might have  what horse asked mr flint vaguely but never mind tell mr freeman to make out the cheque  mr vane glanced at mr flint and his eyes twinkled victoria who had long ago discovered the secret of the honey dew knew that he was rolling it under his tongue and thinking her father a fool for his indulgence  how do you do mr vane she said austens coming home isnt he she had got this by feminine arts out of mr paul pardriff to whom she had not confided the fact of her possession of the clipping  the honourable hilary gave a grunt as he always did when he was surprised and displeased as though some one had prodded him with a stick in a sensitive spot  your son why vane you never told me that said mr flint i didnt know that you knew him victoria  i dont answered victoria but id like to what did he do to mr blodgett she demanded of hilary  mr blodgett exclaimed that gentleman i never heard of him whats happened to him  he will probably recover she assured him  the honourable hilary trying in vain to suppress his agitation rose to his feet  i dont know what youre talking about victoria he said but his glance was fixed on the clipping in her hand  havent you seen it she asked giving it to him  he read it in silence groaned and handed it to mr flint who had been drumming on the table and glancing at victoria with vague disapproval mr flint read it and gave it back to the honourable hilary who groaned again and looked out of the window  why do you feel badly about it asked victoria id be proud of him if i were you  proud of him echoed mr vane grimly proud of him  victoria what do you mean said mr flint  why not said victoria hes done nothing to make you ashamed according to that clipping hes punished a man who richly deserved to be punished and he has the sympathy of an entire county  hilary vane was not a man to discuss his domestic affliction with anybody so he merely grunted and gazed persistently out of the window and was not aware of the fact that victoria made a little face at him as she left the room the young are not always impartial judges of the old and victoria had never forgiven him for carrying to her father the news of an escapade of hers in ripton  as he drove through the silent forest roads on his way homeward that afternoon the honourable hilary revolved the new and intensely disagreeable fact in his mind as to how he should treat a prodigal who had attempted manslaughter and was a fugitive from justice in the meantime a tall and spare young man of a redbronze colour alighted from the five oclock express at ripton and grinned delightedly at the gentlemen who made the station their headquarters about train time they were privately disappointed that the gray felt hat although broadbrimmed was not a sombrero and the respectable loosefitting suit of clothes was not of buckskin with tassels on the trousers and likewise that he came without the cartridge belt and holster which they had pictured in anticipatory sessions on the baggagetrucks there could be no doubt of the warmth of their greeting as they sidled up and seized a hand somewhat larger than theirs but the welcome had in it an ingredient of awe that puzzled the newcomer who did not hesitate to inquirewhats the matter ed why so ceremonious perley  but his eagerness did not permit him to wait for explanations grasping his bag the only baggage he possessed he started off at a swinging stride for hanover street pausing only to shake the hands of the few who recognized him unconscious of the wildfire at his back hanover street was empty that drowsy summer afternoon and he stopped under the wellremembered maples before the house and gazed at it long and tenderly even at the windows of that roomopen now for the first time in yearswhere he had served so many sentences of imprisonment then he went cautiously around by the side and looked in at the kitchen door to other eyes than his euphrasia might not have seemed a safe person to embrace but in a moment he had her locked in his arms and weeping she knew nothing as yet of mr blodgetts misfortunes but if austen vane had depopulated a county it would have made no difference in her affection  my but youre a man exclaimed euphrasia backing away at last and staring at him with the only complete approval she had ever accorded to any human being save one  what did you expect phrasie  come and ill show you your room she said in a gutter she could not hide its got all the same pictures in your mothers pictures and the chair you broke that time when hilary locked you in its mended  hold on phrasie said austen seizing her by the apronstrings how about the judge it was by this title he usually designated his father  what about him demanded euphrasia sharply  well its his house for one thing answered austen and he may prefer to have that roomempty  empty turn you out id like to see him cried euphrasia it wouldnt take me long to leave him high and dry  she paused at the sound of wheels and there was the honourable hilary across the garden patch in the act of slipping out of his buggy at the stable door in the absence of luke the hired man the chief counsel for the railroad was wont to put up the horse himself and he already had the reins festooned from the bit rings when he felt a heavy hand on his shoulder and heard a voice sayhow are you judge  if the truth be told that voice and that touch threw the honourable hilarys heart out of beat many days he had been schooling himself for this occasion this very afternoon he had determined his course of action which emphatically did not include a fatted calf and now surged up a dryadlike memory which had troubled him many a wakeful night of startled appealing eyes that sought his in vain and of the son she had left him flinging himself into his arms in the face of chastisement for the moment hilary vane under this traitorous influence was unable to speak but he let the hand rest on his shoulder and at length was able to pronounce in a shamefully shaky voice the name of his son whereupon austen seized him by the other shoulder and turned him round and looked into his face  the same old judge he said  but hilary was startled even as euphrasia had been was this strange bronzed quietly humorous young man his son hilary even had to raise his eyes a little he had forgotten how tall austen was strange emotions unbidden and unwelcome ran riot in his breast and hilary vane who made no slips before legislative committees or supreme courts actually found himself sayingeuphrasias got your room ready  its good of you to take me in judge said austen patting his shoulder and then he began quite naturally to unbuckle the breechings and loose the traces which he did with such deftness and celerity that he had the horse unharnessed and in the stall in a twinkling and had hauled the buggy through the stable door the honourable hilary watching him the while he was troubled but for the life of him could find no adequate words who usually had the dictionary at his disposal  didnt write me why you came home said the honourable hilary as his son washed his hands at the spigot  didnt i well the truth was i wanted to see you again judge  his father grunted not with absolute displeasure but suspiciously  how about blodgett he asked  blodgett have you heard about that who told you  never mind you didnt nothing in your letter about it  it wasnt worth mentioning replied austen tyner and the boys liked it pretty well but i didnt think youd be interested it was a local affair  not interested not worth mentioning exclaimed the honourable hilary outraged to discover that his son was modestly deprecating an achievement instead of defending a crime godfrey murder aint worth mentioning i presume  not when it isnt successful said austen if blodgett had succeeded i guess youd have heard of it before you did  do you mean to say this blodgett tried to kill you demanded the honourable hilary  yes said his son and ive never understood why he didnt hes a good deal better shot than i am  the honourable hilary grunted and sat down on a bucket and carefully prepared a piece of honey dew he was surprised and agitated  then why are you a fugitive from justice if you were acting in selfdefence he inquired  well you see there were no witnesses except a mexican of blodgetts and blodgett runs the pepper county machine for the railroad out there id been wanting to come east and have a look at you for some time and i thought i might as well come now  how did thisthis affair start asked mr vane  blodgett was driving in some of tyners calves and i caught him i told him what i thought of him and he shot at me through his pocket that was all  all you shot him didnt you  i was lucky enough to hit him first said austen  extraordinary as it may seem the honourable hilary experienced a sense of pride  where did you hit him he asked  it was euphrasia who took matters in her own hands and killed the fatted calf and the meal to which they presently sat down was very different from the frugal suppers mr vane usually had but he made no comment it is perhaps not too much to say that he would have been distinctly disappointed had it been otherwise there was austens favourite pie and austens favourite cake all inherited from the austens who had thought more of the fleshpots than people should and the prodigal did full justice to the occasion     chapter iii concerning the practice of law  so instinctively do we hark back to the primeval man that there was a tendency to lionize the prodigal in ripton which proves the finished civilization of the east not to be so far removed from that land of outlaws pepper county mr paul pardriff who had a guilty conscience about the clipping and vividly bearing in mind mr blodgetts mishap alone avoided young mr vane and escaped through the typesetting room and down an outside stairway in the rear when that gentleman called it gave an ironical turn to the incident that mr pardriff was at the moment engaged in a welcome home paragraph meant to be propitiatory  austen cared very little for lionizing he spent most of his time with young tom gaylord now his fathers righthand man in a tremendous lumber business and tom albeit he had become so important habitually fell once more under the domination of the hero of his youthful days together these two visited haunts of their boyhood camping and fishing and scaling mountains tom with an eye to lumbering prospects the while  after a matter of two or three months bad passed away in this pleasant though unprofitable manner the honourable hilary requested the presence of his son one morning at his office this office was in what had once been a large residence and from its ample windows you could look out through the elms on to the square oldfashioned bookcases lined with musty books filled the walls except where a steel engraving of a legal light or a railroad map of the state was hung and the honourable hilary sat in a windsor chair at a mahogany table in the middle  the anteroom next door where the clerks sat was also a waitingroom for various individuals from the different parts of the state who continually sought the counsels presence  havent seen much of you since youve ben home austen his father remarked as an opening  yourlegal business compels you to travel a great deal answered austen turning from the window and smiling  somewhat said the honourable hilary on whom this pleasantry was not lost youve ben travelling on the lumber business i take it  i know more about it than i did his son admitted  the honourable hilary grunted  caught a good many fish havent you  austen crossed the room and sat on the edge of the desk beside his fathers chair  see here judge he said what are you driving at out with it  when are yougoing back west asked mr vane  austen did not answer at once but looked down into his fathers inscrutable face  do you want to get rid of me he said  sowed enough wild oats havent you inquired the father  ive sowed a good many austen admitted  why not settle down  i havent yet met the lady judge replied his son  couldnt support her if you had said mr vane  then its fortunate said austen resolved not to be the necessary second in a quarrel he knew his father and perceived that these preliminary and caustic openings of his were really olive branches  sometimes i think you might as well be in that outlandish country for all i see of you said the honourable hilary  you ought to retire from business and try fishing his son suggested  the honourable hilary sometimes smiled  youve got a good brain austen and whats the use of wasting it chasing cattle and practising with a pistol on your fellowbeings you wont have much trouble in getting admitted to the bar come into the office  austen did not answer at once he suspected that it had cost his father not a little to make these advances  do you believe you and i could get along judge how long do you think it would last  ive considered that some answered the honourable hilary but i wont last a great while longer myself  youre as sound as a bronco declared austen patting him  i never was what you might call dissipated agreed mr vane but men dont go on forever ive worked hard all my life and got where i am and ive always thought id like to hand it on to you its a position of honour and trust austen and one of which any lawyer might be proud  my ambition hasnt run in exactly that channel said his son  didnt know as you had any precise ambition responded the honourable hilary but i never heard of a man refusing to be chief counsel for a great railroad i dont say you can be mind but i say with work and brains its as easy for the son of hilary vane as for anybody else  i dont know much about the duties of such a position said austen laughing but at all events i shall have time to make up my mind how to answer mr flint when he comes to me with the proposal to speak frankly judge i hadnt thought of spending the whole of what might otherwise prove a brilliant life in ripton  the honourable hilary smiled again and then he grunted  i tell you what ill do he said you come in with me and agree to stay five years if youve done well for yourself and want to go to new york or some large place at the end of that time i wont hinder you but i feel it my duty to say if you dont accept my offer no son of mine shall inherit what ive laid up by hard labour its against american doctrine and its against my principles you can go back to pepper county and get put in jail but you cant say i havent warned you fairly  you ought to leave your fortune to the railroad judge said austen generations to come would bless your name if you put up a new station in ripton and built bridges over bunker hill grade crossing and the other one on heath street where nic adams was killed last month i shouldnt begrudge a cent of the money  i suppose i was a fool to talk to you said the honourable hilary getting up  but his son pushed him down again into the windsor chair  hold on judge he said that was just my way of saying if i accepted your offer it wouldnt be because i yearned after the money thinking of it has never kept me awake nights now if youll allow me to take a few days once in a while to let off steam ill make a counter proposal in the nature of a compromise  whats that the honourable hilary demanded suspiciously  provided i get admitted to the bar i will take a room in another part of this building and pick up what crumbs of practice i can by myself of course sir i realize that these if they come at all will be owing to the lustre of your name but i should before i become mr flints righthand man like to learn to walk with my own legs  the speech pleased the honourable hilary and he put out his hand  its a bargain austen he said  i dont mind telling you now judge that when i left the west i left it for good provided you and i could live within a decent proximity and i ought to add that i always intended going into the law after id had a fling it isnt fair to leave you with the impression that this is a sudden determination prodigals dont become good as quick as all that  ripton caught its breath a second time the day austen hired a law office nor did the surprise wholly cease when in one season he was admitted to the bar for the proceeding was not in keeping with the habits and customs of prodigals needless to say the practice did not immediately begin to pour in but the little office rarely lacked a visitor and sometimes had as many as five or six there was an irresistible attraction about that room and apparently very little law read there though sometimes its occupant arose and pushed the visitors into the hall and locked the door and opened the window at the top to let the smoke out many of the honourable hilarys callers preferred the little room in the far corridor to the great mans own office  these visitors of the elder mr vanes as has been before hinted were not all clients without burdening the reader too early with a treatise on the fabric of a system suffice it to say that something was continually going on that was not law and gentlemen came and wentfat and thin sharpeyed and redfacedwho were neither clients nor lawyers these were really secretive gentlemen though most of them had a hailfellowwellmet manner and a hearty greeting but when they talked to the honourable hilary it was with doors shut and even then they sat very close to his ear many of them preferred now to wait in austens office instead of the anteroom and some of them were not so cautious with the son of hilary vane that they did not let drop certain observations to set him thinking he had a fanciful if somewhat facetious way of calling them by feudal titles which made them grin  how is the duke of putnam this morning he would ask of the gentleman of whom the ripton record would frequently make the following announcement among the prominent residents of putnam county in town this week was the honourable brush bascom  the honourable brush and many of his associates barons and earls albeit the shrewdest of men did not know exactly how to take the son of hilary vane this was true also of the honourable hilary himself who did not wholly appreciate the humour in austens parallel of the feudal system although austen had set up for himself there were many waysnot legalin which the son might have been helpful to the father but the honourable hilary hesitated for some unformulated reason to make use of him and the consequence was that mr hamilton tooting and other young men of a hustling nature in the honourable hilarys office found that austens advent did not tend greatly to lighten a certain class of their labours in fact father and son were not much nearer in spirit than when ode had been in pepper county and the other in ripton caution and an instinct which senses obstacles are characteristics of gentlemen in mr vanes business  so two years passedyears liberally interspersed with expeditions into the mountains and elsewhere and nights spent in the company of tom gaylord and others during this period austen was more than once assailed by the temptation to return to the free life of pepper county mr blodgett having completely recovered now and only desiring vengeance of a corporal nature but a bargain was a bargain and austen vane stuck to his end of it although he had now begun to realize many aspects of a situation which he had not before suspected he had long foreseen however that the time was coming when a serious disagreement with his father was inevitable in addition to the difference in temperament hilary vane belonged to one generation and austen to another  it happened as do so many incidents which tend to shape a life by a seeming chance it was a tune evening and there had been a church sociable and basket picnic during the day in a grove in the town of mercer some ten miles south of ripton the grove was bounded on one side by the railroad track and merged into a thick clump of second growth and alders where there was a diagonal grade crossing the picnic was over and the people preparing to go home when they were startled by a crash followed by the screaming of brakes as a big engine flew past the grove and brought a heavy train to a halt some distance down the grade the women shrieked and dropped the dishes they were washing and the men left their horses standing and ran to the crossing and then stood for the moment helpless in horror at the scene which met their eyes the wagon of oneof their own congregation was in splinters a man a farmer of the neighbourhood lying among the alders with what seemed a mortal injury amid the lamentations and cries for some one to go to mercer village for the doctor a young man drove up rapidly and sprang out of a buggy trusting to some one to catch his horse pushed through the ring of people and bent over the wounded farmer in an instant he had whipped out a knife cut a stick from one of the alders knotted his handkerchief around the mans leg ran the stick through the knot and twisted the handkerchief until the blood ceased to flow they watched him paralyzed as the helpless in this world watch the capable and before he had finished his task the train crew and some passengers began to arrive  have you a doctor aboard charley the young man asked  no answered the conductor who had been addressed my god not one austen  back up your train said austen and stop your baggage car here and go to the grove he added to one of the picnickers and bring four or five carriage cushions and you hold this  the man beside him took the tourniquet as he was bid austen vane drew a notebook from his pocket  i want this mans name and address he said and the names and addresses of every person here quickly  he did not lift his voice but the man who had taken charge of such a situation was not to be denied they obeyed him some eagerly some reluctantly and by that time the train had backed down and the cushions had arrived they laid these on the floor of the baggage car and lifted the man on to them his name was zeb meader and he was still insensible austen vane with a peculiar set look upon his face sat beside him all the way into ripton he spoke only once and that was to tell the conductor to telegraph from avalon to have the ambulance from st marys hospital meet the train at ripton  the next day hilary vane returning from one of his periodical trips to the northern part of the state invaded his sons office  whats this they tell me about your saving a mans life he asked sinking into one of the vacant chairs and regarding austen with his twinkling eyes  i dont know what they tell you austen answered i didnt do anything but get a tourniquet on his leg and have him put on the train  the honourable hilary grunted and continued to regard his son then he cut a piece of honey dew  looks bad does it he said  well replied austen it might have been done better it was bungled in a deathtrap as cleverly conceived as that crossing with a down grade approaching it they ought to have got the horse too  the honourable hilary grunted again and inserted the honey dew he resolved to ignore the palpable challenge in this remark which was in keeping with this new and serious mien in austen  get the names of witnesses was his next question  i took particular pains to do so  hand em over to tooting what kind of man is this meagre  he is rather meagre now said austen smiling a little his names meader  is he likely to make a fuss  i think he is said austen  well said the honourable hilary we must have ham tooting hurry round and fix it up with him as soon as he can talk before one of these cormorant lawyers gets his claw in him  austen said nothing and after some desultory conversation in which he knew how to indulge when he wished to conceal the fact that he was baffled the honourable hilary departed that student of human nature mr hamilton tooting a young man of a sporting appearance and a free vocabulary made the next attempt it is a characteristic of mr tootings kind that in their efforts to be genial they often use an awkward diminutive of their friends names  hello aust said mr tooting i dropped in to get those witnesses in that meagre accident before i forget it  i think ill keep em said austen making a note out of the revised statutes  oh all right all right said mr tooting biting off a piece of his cigar going to handle the case yourself are you  i may  im just as glad to have some of em off my hands and this looks to me like a nasty one i dont like those mercer people the last farmer they ran over there raised hell  i shouldnt blame this one if he did if he ever gets well enough said austen young mr tooting paused with a lighted match halfway to his cigar and looked at austen shrewdly and then sat down on the desk very close to him  say aust it sometimes sickens a man to have to buy these fellows off what poor devils they dont get anything like what they ought to get do they wait till you see how the railroad commissionll whitewash that case it makes a man want to be independent what  this sounds like virtue ham  ive often thought too said mr tooting that a man could make more money if he didnt wear the collar  but not sleep as well perhaps said austen  say aust youre not on the level with me  i hope to reach that exalted plane some day ham  whats got into you demanded the usually clearheaded mr tooting now a little bewildered  nothing yet said austen but im thinking seriously of having a sandwich and a piece of apple pie will you come along  they crossed the square together mr tooting racking a normally fertile brain for some excuse to reopen the subject despairing of that he decided that any subject would do  that humphrey crewe up at leith is smartsmart as paint he remarked do you know him  ive seen him said austen hes a young man isnt he  and natty he knows a thing or two for a millionaire that dont have to work and he runs that place of his right up to the handle you ought to hear him talk about the tariff and national politics i was passing there the other day and he was walking around among the flowerbeds aint your name tooting he hollered i almost fell out of the buggy  what did he want asked austen curiously mr tooting winked  say those millionaires are queer and no mistake youd think a fellow that only had to cut coupons wouldnt be lookin for another job wouldnt you he made me hitch my horse and had me into his study as he called it and gave me a big glass of whiskey and soda a fellow with buttons and a striped vest brought it on tiptoe then this crewe gave me a long yellow cigar with a band on it and told me what the state neededmacadam roads farmers institutes forests and god knows what i told him all he had to do was to get permission from old man flint and he could have em  what did he say to that  he said flint was an intimate friend of his then he asked me a whole raft of questions about fellows in the neighbourhood i didnt know hed ever heard of say he wants to go from leith to the legislature  he can go for all i care said austen as he pushed open the door of the restaurant  for a few days mr meader hung between life and death but he came of a stock which had for generations thrust its roots into the crevices of granite and was not easily killed by steamengines austen vane called twice and then made an arrangement with young dr tredway one of the numerous ripton tredways whose money had founded the hospital that he was to see mr meader as soon as he was able to sustain a conversation dr tredway by the way was a bachelor and had been austens companion on many a boisterous expedition  when austen in response to the doctors telephone message stood over the iron bed in the spickandspan mens ward of st marys a wave of that intense feeling he had experienced at the accident swept over him the farmers beard was overgrown and the eyes looked up at him as from caverns of suffering below the bandage they were shrewd eyes however and proved that mr meader had possession of the five sensesnay of the six austen sat down beside the bed  dr tredway tells me you are getting along finely he said  no thanks to the railrud answered mr meader they done their best  did you hear any whistle or any bell austen asked  not a sound said mr meader they even shut off their steam on that grade  austen vane like most men who are really capable of a deep sympathy was not an adept at expressing it verbally moreover he knew enough of his fellowmen to realize that a puritan farmer would be suspicious of sympathy the man had been near to death himself was compelled to spend part of the summer his breadearning season in a hospital and yet no appeal or word of complaint had crossed his lips  mr meader said austen i came over here to tell you that in my opinion you are entitled to heavy damages from the railroad and to advise you not to accept a compromise they will send some one to you and offer you a sum far below that which you ought in justice to receive you ought to fight this case  how am i going to pay a lawyer with a mortgage on my farm demanded mr meader  im a lawyer said austen and if youll take me ill defend you without charge  aint you the son of hilary vane  yes  ive heard of him a good many times said mr meader as if to ask what man had not youre railroad aint ye  mr meader gazed long and thoughtfully into the young mans face and the suspicion gradually faded from the farmers blue eyes  i like your looks he said at last i guess you saved my life imim much obliged to you  when mr tooting arrived later in the day he found mr meader willing to listen but otherwise strangely noncommittal with native shrewdness the farmer asked him what office he came from but did not confide in mr tooting the fact that mr vanes son had volunteered to wring more money from mr vanes client than mr tooting offered him considerably bewildered that gentleman left the hospital to report the affair to the honourable hilary who at intervals during the afternoon found himself relapsing into speculation  inside of a somewhat unpromising shell mr zeb meader was a human being and no mean judge of men and motives as his convalescence progressed austen vane fell into the habit of dropping in from time to time to chat with him and gradually was rewarded by many vivid character sketches of mr meaders neighbours in mercer and its vicinity one afternoon when austen came into the ward he found at mr meaders bedside a basket of fruit which looked too expensive and tempting to have come from any dealers in ripton  a lady came with that mr meader explained i never was popular before i was run over by the cars shes ben here twice when she fetched it today i kind of thought she was up to some game and i didnt want to take it  up to some game repeated austen  well i dont know continued mr meader thoughtfully the woman here tells me she comes regular in the summer time to see sick folks but from the way she made up to me i had an idea that she wanted something but i dont know thought id ask you you see shes railrud  railroad  shes flints daughter  austen laughed  i shouldnt worry about that he said if mr flint sent his daughter with fruit to everybody his railroad injures she wouldnt have time to do anything else i doubt if mr flint ever heard of your case  mr meader considered this and calculated there was something in it  she was a nice common young lady and cussed if she didnt make me laugh she has such a funny way of talkin she wanted to know all about you  what did she want to know austen exclaimed not unnaturally  well she wanted to know about the accident and i told her how you druv up and screwed that thing around my leg and backed the train down she was a good deal took with that  i think you are inclined to make too much of it said austen  three days later as he was about to enter the ward mr meader being now the only invalid there he heard a sound which made him pause in the doorway the sound was feminine laughter of a musical quality that struck pleasantly on austens ear miss victoria flint was sated beside mr meaders bed and qualified friendship had evidently been replaced by intimacy since austens last visit for mr meader was laughing too  and now im quite sure you have missed your vocation mr meader said victoria you would have made a fortune on the stage  me a playactor exclaimed the invalid how much wages do they git  untold sums she declared if they can talk like you  he kind of thought that story funnysame as you mr meader ruminated and glanced up drat me he remarked if he aint acomin now i callated hed run acrost you sometime  victoria raised her eyes sparkling with humour and they met austens  we was just talkin about you cried mr meader cordially come right in he turned to victoria i want to make you acquainted he said with austen vane  and wont you tell him who i am mr meader said victoria  well said mr meader apologetically that was stupid of mewahnt it but i callated hed know shes the daughter of the railrud presidentthe one that was askin about you  there was an instants pause and the colour stole into victorias cheeks then she glanced at austen and bit her lipand laughed her laughter was contagious  i suppose i shall have to confess that you have inspired my curiosity mr vane she said  austens face was sunburned but it flushed a more vivid red under the tan it is needless to pretend that a man of his appearance and qualities had reached the age of thirtytwo without having listened to feminine comments of which he was the exclusive subject in this remark of victorias or rather in the manner in which she made it he recognized a difference  it is a tribute then to the histrionic talents of mr meader of which you were speaking he replied laughingly  victoria glanced at him with interest as he looked down at mr meader  and how is it today zeb he said  it aint so bad as it might bewith sech folks as her and you araound admitted mr meader id almost agree to get run over again she was askin about you and thats a fact and i didnt slander you neither but i never callated to comprehend wimmenfolks  now mr meader said victoria reprovingly but there were little creases about her eyes dont be a fraud  its true as gospel declared the invalid they always got the better of me i had one of em after me once when i was young and prosperin some  and yet you have survived triumphant she exclaimed  there wahnt none of em like you said mr meader or it might have ben different  again her eyes irresistibly sought austensas though to share with him the humour of this remarkand they laughed together her colour so sensitive rose again but less perceptibly this time then she got up  thats unfair mr meader she protested  ill leave it to austen said mr meader if it aint probable hed ought to know  in spite of a somewhat natural embarrassment austen could not but acknowledge to himself that mr meader was right with a womanly movement which he thought infinitely graceful victoria leaned over the bed  mr meader she said im beginning to think its dangerous for me to come here twice a week to see you if you talk this way and im not a bit surprised that that woman didnt get the better of you  you haint agoin he exclaimed why i callated  goodby she said quickly im glad to see that you are doing so well she raised her head and looked at austen in a curious inscrutable way goodby mr vane she said ii hope mr blodgett has recovered  before he could reply she had vanished and he was staring at the empty doorway the reference to the unfortunate mr blodgett after taking his breath away aroused in him an intense curiosity betraying as it did a certain knowledge of past events in his life in the hitherto unknown daughter of augustus interest could she have in him such a flint what question from similar sources has heightened the pulse of young men from time immemorial     chapter iv timeo danaos  the proverbial little birds that carry news and prophecies through the air were evidently responsible for an officiallooking letter which austen received a few mornings later on the letterhead was printed the united northeastern railroads and mr austen vane was informed that by direction of the president the enclosed was sent to him in an entirely complimentary sense the enclosed was a ticket of red cardboard and its face informed him that he might travel free for the rest of the year thoughtfully turning it over he read on the back the following inscriptionit is understood that this pass is accepted by its recipient as a retainer  austen stared at it and whistled then he pushed back his chair with the pass in his hand and hesitated he seized a pen and wrote a few lines dear sir i beg to return the annual pass over the northeastern railroads with which you have so kindly honoured mewhen he suddenly changed his mind again rose and made his way through the corridors to his fathers office the honourable hilary was absorbed in his daily perusal of the guardian  judge he asked is mr flint up at his place this week  the honourable hilary coughed  he arrived yesterday on the three erwhy  i wanted to go up and thank him for this his son answered holding up the red piece of cardboard mr flint is a very thoughtful man  the honourable hilary tried to look unconcerned and succeeded  sent you an annual has he eri dont know as id bother him personally austen just a pleasant note of acknowledgment  i dont flatter myself that my achievements in the law can be responsible for it said austen the favour must be due to my relationship with his eminent chief counsel  hilary vanes keen eyes rested on his son for an instant austen was more than ever an enigma to him  i guess relationship hasnt got much to do with business he replied you have ben doingerbetter than i expected  thank you judge said austen quietly i dont mind saying that i would rather have your approbation thanthis more substantial recognition of merit  the honourable hilarys business was to deal with men and by reason of his ability in so doing he had made a success in life he could judge motives more than passably well and play upon weaknesses but he left austens presence that morning vaguely uneasy with a sense of having received from his own son an initial defeat at a game of which he was a master under the excuse of looking up some precedents he locked his doors to all comers for two hours and paced his room at one moment he reproached himself for not having been frank for not having told austen roundly that this squeamishness about a pass was unworthy of a strong man of affairs yes for not having revealed to him the mysteries of railroad practice from the beginning but frankness was not an ingredient of the honourable hilarys nature and austen was not the kind of man who would accept a hint and a wink hilary vane had formless forebodings and found himself for once in his life powerless to act  the cost of living in ripton was not so high that austen vane could not afford to keep a horse and buggy the horse which he tended himself was appropriately called pepper austen had found him in the hills and he was easily the finest animal in ripton so good in fact that mr humphrey crewe who believed he had an eye for horses had peremptorily hailed austen from a motorcar and demanded the price as was mr crewes wont when he saw a thing he desired he had been somewhat surprised and not inconsiderably offended by the brevity and force of the answer which he had received  on the afternoon of the summers day in which austen had the conversation with his father just related pepper was trotting at a round clip through the soft and shady wood roads toward the town of tunbridge the word town being used in the new england sense as a piece of territory about six miles by six the fact that automobiles full of laughing people from leith hummed by occasionally made no apparent difference to pepper who knew only the master hand on the reins the reality that the wood roads were climbing great hills the horse did not seem to feel pepper knew every lane and bypath within twenty miles of ripton and exhibited such surprise as a wellbred horse may when he was slowed down at length and turned into a hard bluestone driveway under a strange granite arch with the word fairview cut in gothic letters above it and two great lamps in wroughtiron brackets at the sides it was austen who made a note of the gratings over the drains and of the acres of orderly forest in a mysterious and seemingly enchanted realm intimacy with domains was new to him and he began to experience an involuntary feeling of restraint which was new to him likewise and made him chafe in spite of himself the estate seemed to be the visible semblance of a power which troubled him  shortly after passing an avenue neatly labelled trades drive the road wound upwards through a ravine the sides of which were covered with a dense shrubbery which had the air of having always been there and yet somehow looked expensive at the top of the ravine was a sharp curve and austen drawing breath found himself swung as it were into space looking off across miles of forestcovered lowlands to an ultramarine mountain in the hazy southsawanec as if in obedience to a telepathic command of his master pepper stopped  drinking his fill of this scene austen forgot an errand which was not only disagreeable but required some fortitude for its accomplishment the son had this in common with the honourable hilaryhe hated heroics and the fact that the thing smacked of heroics was austens only deterrent and then there was a woman in this paradise these gradual insinuations into his revery at length made him turn a straight avenue of pearshaped fifteenyearold maples led to the house a massive colonial structure of wood that stretched across the shelf and he had tightened the reins and started courageously up the avenue when he perceived that it ended in a circle on which there was no sign of a hitchingpost and worse than this on the balconied uncovered porch which he would have to traverse to reach the doorway he saw the sheen and glimmer of womens gowns grouped about wicker tables and became aware that his approach was the sole object of the scrutiny of an afternoon tea party  as he reached the circle it was a slight relief to learn that pepper was the attraction no horse knew better than pepper when he was being admired and he arched his neck and lifted his feet and danced in the sheer exhilaration of it a smoothfaced redcheeked gentleman in gray flannels leaned over the balustrade and made audible comments in a penetrating voice which betrayed the fact that he was mr humphrey crewe  saw him on the street in ripton last year good hock action hasnt hethats rare in trotters around here tried to buy him feller wouldnt sell his names vanehes drivin him now  a lady of a somewhat commanding presence was beside him she was perhaps five and forty her irongray hair was dressed to perfection her figure all that parisian art could make it and she was regarding austen with extreme deliberation through the glasses which she had raised to a highbridged nose  politics is certainly your career humphrey she remarked you have such a wonderful memory for faces i dont see how he does it do you alice she demanded of a tall girl beside her who was evidently her daughter but lacked her personality  i dont know said alice  its because ive been here longer than anybody else mrs pomfret answered mr crewe not very graciously thats all hello this last to austen  hello said austen  who do you want to see inquired mr crewe with the admirable tact for which he was noted  austen looked at him for the first time  anybody who will hold my horse he answered quietly  by this time the conversation had drawn the attention of the others at the tables and one or two smiled at austens answer mrs flint with a who is it arose to repel a social intrusion she was an overdressed lady inclining to embonpoint but traces of the rose of sharon were still visible  why dont you drive round to the stables suggested mr crewe unaware of a smile  austen did not answer he was in fact looking towards the doorway and the group on the porch were surprised to see a gleam of mirthful understanding start in his eyes an answering gleam was in victorias who had at that moment by a singular coincidence come out of the house she came directly down the steps and out on the gravel and held her hand to him in the buggy and he flushed with pleasure as he grasped it  how do you do mr vane she said i am so glad you have called humphrey just push the stable button will you  mr crewe obeyed with no very good grace while the teaparty went back to their seats mrs flint supposed he had come to sell victoria the horse while mrs pomfret who had taken him in from crown to boots remarked that he looked very much like a gentleman  i came to see your father for a few momentson business austen explained  she lifted her face to his with a second searching look  ill take you to him she said  by this time a nimble groom had appeared from out o a shrubbery path and seized peppers head austen alighted and followed victoria into a great cool hallway and through two darkened rooms bewilderingly furnished and laden with the scent of flowers into a narrow passage beyond she led the way simply not speaking and her silence seemed to betoken the completeness of an understanding between them as of a long acquaintance  in a plain whitewashed room behind a plain oaken desk sat mr flinta plain man austen thought he would have known him had he seen him on the street the other things in the room were letterfiles a safe a longdistance telephone and a thin private secretary with a bend in his back mr flint looked up from his desk and his face previously bereft of illumination lighted when he saw his daughter austen liked that in him  well vic what is it now he asked  mr austen vane to see you said victoria and with a quick glance at austen she left him standing on the threshold mr flint rose his eyes were deepset in a square hard head and he appeared to be taking austen in without directly looking at him likewise one felt that mr flints handshake was not an absolute gift of his soul  how do you do mr vane i dont remember ever to have had the pleasure of seeing you although your father and i have been intimately connected for many years  so the presidents manner was hearty but not the substance it came austen thought from a rarity of meeting with men on a disinterested footing and he could not but wonder how mr flint would treat the angels in heaven if he ever got there where there were no franchises to be had would he suspect them of designs upon his hard won harp and halo austen did not dislike mr flint the mans rise his achievements his affection for his daughter he remembered but he was also well aware that mr flint had thrown upon him the onus of the first move in a game which the railroad president was used to playing every day the dragon was on his home ground and had the choice of weapons  i do not wish to bother you long said austen  no bother answered mr flint no bother to make the acquaintance of the son of my old friend hilary vane sit downsit down and while i dont believe any man should depend upon his father to launch him in the world yet it must be a great satisfaction to you mr vane to have such a father hilary vane and i have been intimately associated for many years and my admiration for him has increased with every year it is to men of his type that the prosperity the greatness of this nation is largely dueconservative upright able content to confine himself to the difficult work for which he is so eminently fitted without spectacular meddling in things in which he can have no concern therefore i welcome the opportunity to know you sir for i understand that you have settled down to follow in his footsteps and that you will make a name for yourself i know the independence of young meni was young once myself but after all mr vane experience is the great teacher and perhaps there is some little advice which an old man can give you that may be of service as your fathers son it is always at your disposal have a cigar  the thin secretary continued to flit about the room between the letterfiles and the desk austen had found it infinitely easier to shoot mr blodgett than to engage in a duel with the president of the united railroad  i smoke a pipe he said  too many young men smoke cigarsand those disgusting cigarettes said mr flint with conviction there are a lot of worthless young men in these days anyhow they come to my house and loaf and drink and smoke and talk a lot of nonsense about games and automobiles and clubs and cumber the earth generally theres a young man named crewe over at leith for instanceyou may have seen him not that hes dissipatedbut he dont do anything but talk about railroads and the stock market to make you sick and dont know any more about em than my farmer  during this diatribe austen saw his opening growing smaller and smaller if he did not make a dash for it it would soon be closed entirely  i received a letter this morning mr flint enclosing me an annual pass  did upjohn send you one mr flint cut in he ought to have done so long ago it was probably an oversight that he did not mr vane we try to extend the courtesies of the road to persons who are looked up to in their communities the son of hilary vane is at all times welcome to one  mr flint paused to light his cigar and austen summoned his resolution second by second it was becoming more and more difficult and seemingly more ungracious to return a gift so graciously given a gift of no inconsiderable intrinsic value moreover mr flint had ingeniously contrived almost to make the act in austens eyes that of a picayune upstart who was he to fling back an annual pass in the face of the president of the northeastern railroads  i had first thought of writing you a letter mr flint he said but it seemed to me that considering your relations with my father the proper thing to do was to come to you and tell you why i cannot take the pass  the thin secretary paused in his filing and remained motionless with his body bent over the drawer  why you cannot take it mr vane said the railroad president im afraid i dont understand  i appreciate thethe kindness said austen and i will try to explain he drew the red cardboard from his pocket and turned it over on the back of this is printed in small letters it is understood that this pass is accepted by the recipient as a retainer  well mr flint interrupted smiling somewhat blandly how much money do you think that pass would save an active young lawyer in a year is three hundred dollars too much three hundred dollars is not an insignificant sum to a young man on the threshold of his practice is it  austen looked at mr flint  any sum is insignificant when it restricts a lawyer from the acceptance of just causes mr flint as i understand the matter it is the custom of your railroad to send these passes to the young lawyers of the state the moment they begin to give signs of ability this past would prevent me from serving clients who might have righteous claims against your railroads andpermit me to speak franklyin my opinion the practice tends to make it difficult for poor people who have been injured to get efficient lawyers  your own father is retained by the railroad said mr flint  as their counsel answered austen i have a pride in my profession mr flint as no doubt you have in yours if i should ever acquire sufficient eminence to be sought as counsel for a railroad i should make my own terms with it i should not allow its management alone to decide upon the value of my retainer and my services in its behalf would be confined strictly to professional ones  mr flint drummed on the table  what do you mean by that he demanded  i mean that i would not engage for a fee or a pass to fight the political battles of a railroad or undertake any political manipulation in its behalf whatever  mr flint leaned forward aggressively  how long do you think a railroad would pay dividends if it did not adopt some means of defending itself from the blackmail politician of the state legislatures mr vane the railroads of which i have the honour to be president pay a heavy tag in this and other states we would pay a much heavier one if we didnt take precautions to protect ourselves but i do not intend to quarrel with you mr vane he continued quickly perceiving that austen was about to answer him nor do i wish to leave you with the impression that the northeastern railroads meddle unduly in politics  austen knew not how to answer he had not gone there to discuss this last and really great question with mr flint but he wondered whether the president actually thought him the fledgling he proclaimed austen laid his pass on mr flints desk and rose  i assure you mr flint that the spirit which prompted my visit was not a contentious one i cannot accept the pass simply because i do not wish to be retained  mr flint eyed him there was a mark of dignity of silent power on this tall scapegrace of a son of hilary vane that the railroad president had missed at firstprobably because he had looked only for the scapegrace mr flint ardently desired to treat the matter in the trifling aspect in which he believed he saw it to carry it off genially but an instinct not yet formulated told the president that he was face to face with an enemy whose potential powers were not to be despised and he bristled in spite of himself  there is no statute i know of by which a lawyer can be compelled to accept a retainer against his will mr vane he replied and overcame himself with an effort but i hope that you will permit me he added in another tone as an old friend of your fathers and as a man of some little experience in the world to remark that intolerance is a characteristic of youth i had it in the days of mr isaac d worthington whom you do not remember i am not addicted to flattery but i hope and believe you have a career before you talk to your father study the question on both sidesfrom the point of view of men who are honestly trying in the face of tremendous difficulties to protect innocent stockholders as well as to conduct a corporation in the interests of the people at large and for their general prosperity be charitable young man and judge not hastily  years before when poor sarah austen had adorned the end of his table hilary vane had raised his head after the pronouncement of grace to surprise a look in his wifes eyes which strangely threw him into a white heat of anger that look and he at intervals had beheld it afterwards was the true presentment of the soul of the woman whose body was his it was notas hilary vane thought ita contempt for the practice of thanking ones maker for daily bread but a contempt for cant of one who sees the humour in cant a masculine version of that look mr flint now beheld in the eyes of austen vane and the enraging effect on the president of the united railroads was much the same as it had been on his chief counsel who was this young man of three and thirty to agitate him so he trembled though not visibly yet took austens hand mechanically  good day mr vane he said mr freeman will help you to find your horse  the thin secretary bowed and before he reached the door into the passage mr flint had opened another at the back of the room and stepped out on a closecropped lawn flooded with afternoon sunlight in the passage austen perceived a chair and in the chair was seated patiently none other than mr brush bascompolitical duke of putnam mr bascoms little agate eyes glittered in the dim light  hello austen he said since when have you took to comin here  its a longer trip from putnam than from ripton brush said austen and passed on leaving mr bascom with a puzzled mind something very like a smile passed over mr freemans face as he led the way silently out of a side entrance and around the house the circle of the drive was empty the teaparty had goneand victoria austen assured himself that her disappearance relieved him having virtually quarrelled with her father conversation would have been awkward and yet he looked for her  they found the buggy and pepper in the paved courtyard of the stables as austen took the reins the secretary looked up at him his mild blue eyes burning with an unsuspected fire he held out his hand  i want to congratulate you he said  what for asked austen taking the hand in some embarrassment  for speaking like a man said the secretary and he turned on his heel and left him  this strange action capping as it did a stranger experience gave austen food for thought as he let pepper take his own pace down the trades road presently he got back into the main drive where it clung to a steep forestcovered side hill when his attention was distracted by the sight of a straight figure in white descending amidst the foliage ahead his instinctive action was to pull pepper down to a walk scarcely analyzing his motives then he had time before reaching the spot where their paths would cross to consider and characteristically to enjoy the unpropitious elements arrayed against a friendship with victoria flint  she halted on a flagstone of the descending path some six feet above the roadway and stood expectant the rose of sharon five and twenty years before would have been coywould have made believe to have done it by accident but the rose of sharon with all her beauty would have had no attraction for austen vane victoria had much of her mothers good looks the figure of a diana and her clothes were of a severity and correctness in keeping with her style they merely added to the sum total of the effect upon austen of course he stopped the buggy immediately beneath her and her first question left him without any breath no woman he had ever known seized the essentials as she did  what have you been doing to my father she asked  why exclaimed austen  because hes in such a bad temper said victoria you must have put him in it it cant be possible that you came all the way up here to quarrel with him nobody ever dares to quarrel with him  i didnt come up to quarrel with him said austen  whats the trouble asked victoria  the humour of this question was too much for him and he laughed victorias eyes laughed a little but there was a pucker in her forehead  wont you tell me she demanded or must i get it out of him  i am afraid said austen slowly that you must get it out of himif he hasnt forgotten it  forgotten it dear old soul cried victoria i met him just now and tried to make him look at the new guernseys and he must have been disturbed quite a good deal when hes cross as a bear to me he really oughtnt to be upset like that mr vane when he comes up here to rest i am afraid that you are rather a terrible person although you look so nice wont you tell me what you did to him  austen was nonplussed  nothing intentional he answered earnestly but it wouldnt be fair to your father if i gave you my version of a business conversation that passed between us would it  perhaps not said victoria she sat down on the flagstone with her elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand and looked at him thoughtfully he knew well enough that a wise general would have retreatedhorse foot and baggage but pepper did not stir  do you know said victoria i have an idea you came up here about zeb meader  zeb meader  yes i told my father about himhow you rescued him and how you went to see him in the hospital and what a good man he is and how poor  oh did you exclaimed austen  yes and i told him the accident wasnt zebs fault that the train didnt whistle or ring and that the crossing was a blind one  and what did he say asked austen curiously  he said that on a railroad as big as his something of the kind must happen occasionally and he told me if zeb didnt make a fuss and act foolishly he would have no cause to regret it  and did you tell zeb asked austen  yes victoria admitted but im sorry i did now  what did zeb say  victoria laughed in spite of herself and gave a more or less exact though kindly imitation of mr meaders manner  he said that wimmenfolks had better stick to the needle and the duster and not go pokin about law business that didnt concern em but the worst of it was added victoria with some distress he wont accept any more fruit isnt he silly he wont get it into his head that i give him the fruit and not my father i suspect that he actually believes my father sent me down there to tell him that  austen was silent for the true significance of this apparently obscure damage case to the northeastern railroads was beginning to dawn on him the public was not in the best of humours towards railroads there was trouble about grade crossings and mr meaders mishap and the manner of his rescue by the son of the corporation counsel had given the accident a deplorable publicity moreover if it had dawned on augustus flint that the son of hilary vane might prosecute the suit it was worth while taking a little pains with mr meader and mr austen vane certain small fires have been known to light worldwide conflagrations  what are you thinking about asked victoria it isnt at all polite to forget the person you are talking to  i havent forgotten you said austen with a smile how could hesitting under her in this manner  besides said victoria mollified you havent an answered my question  which question  she scrutinized him thoughtfully and with feminine art made the kind of an attack that rarely fails  why are you such an enigma mr vane she demanded is it because youre a lawyer or because youve been out west and seen so much of life and shot so many people  austen laughed yet he had tingling symptoms because she showed enough interest in him to pronounce him a riddle but he instantly became serious as the purport of the last charge came home to him  i suppose i am looked upon as a sort of jesse james he said as it happens i have never shot but one man and i didnt care very much for that  victoria got up and came down a step and gave him her hand he took it nor was he the first to relinquish the hold and a colour rose delicately in her face as she drew her fingers away  i didnt mean to offend you she said  you didnt offend me he replied quickly i merely wished you to know that i wasnt a brigand  victoria smiled  i really didnt think soyou are much too solemn i have to go now andyou havent told me anything  she crossed the road and began to descend the path on the other side twice he glanced back after he had started and once surprised her poised lightly among the leaves looking over her shoulder     chapter v the parting of the ways  the next time austen visited the hospital mr meader had a surprise in store for him after passing the time of day as was his custom the patient freely discussed the motives which had led him to refuse any more of victorias fruit  i haint got nothing against her he declared i tried to make that plain shes as nice and common a young lady as i ever see and i dont believe she had a thing to do with it but i suspicioned they was up to somethin when she brought them baskets and when she give me the message from old flint i was sure of it  miss flint was entirely innocent im sure said austen emphatically  if i could see old flint id tell him what i thought of him usin wimmenfolks to save em money said mr meader i knowed she wahnt that kind and then that other thing come right on top of it  what other thing  say demanded mr meader dont you know  i know nothing said austen  didnt know hilary vanes ben here  my father austen ejaculated  gittin after me pretty warm so they be want to know what my price is now but say i didnt suppose your faytherd come here without lettin you know  austen was silent the truth was that for a few moments he could not command himself sufficiently to speak  he is the chief counsel for the road he said at length i am not connected with it  i guess youre on the right track hes a pretty smooth talker your fayther just dropped in to see how i be since his son was interested talked a sight of law gibberish i didnt understand told me i didnt have much of a case said the policy of the railrud was to be liberal and wanted to know what i thought i ought to have  well said austen shortly  well said mr mender he didnt git a mite of satisfaction out of me ive seen enough of his kind of folks to know how to deal with em and i told him so i asked him what they meant by sending that slick mr tooting raound to offer me five hundred dollars i said i was willin to trust my case on that crossin to a jury  austen smiled in spite of his mingled emotions  what else did mr vane say he asked  not a great sight more said a good many folks were foolish enough to spend money and go to law when theyd done better to trust to the liberality of the railrud liberality adams widow done well to trust their liberality didnt she he wanted to know one more thing but i didnt give him any satisfaction  what was that  i couldnt tell you how he got raound to it guess he never did quite he wanted to know what lawyer was to have my case wahnt none of his affair and i callated if youd wanted him to know just yet youd have toad him  austen laid his hand on the farmers as he rose to go  zeb he said i never expect to have a more exemplary client  mr mender shot a glance at him  mebbe i spoke a mite too free about your fayther austen he said you and him seem kind of different  the judge and i understand each other answered austen  he had got as far as the door when he stopped swung on his heel and came back to the bedside  its my duty to tell you zeb that in order to hush this thing up they may offer you more than you can get from a jury in that case i should have to advise you to accept  he was aware that while he made this statement zeb meaders eyes were riveted on him and he knew that the farmer was weighing him in the balance  sell out exclaimed mr meader you advise me to sell out  austen did not get angry he understood this man and the people from which he sprang  the question is for you to decidewhether you can get more money by a settlement  money cried zeb meader i have found it pretty hard to git but theres some things i wont do for it theres a reason why they want this case hushed up the way theyve ben actin i aint lived in mercer and putnam county all my life for nothin haint i seen em run their dirty politics there under brush bascom for the last twentyfive years theres no man has an office or a pass in that county but what bascom gives it to him and bascoms the railrud tool suddenly zeb raised himself in bed hev they ben tamperin with you he demanded  yes answered austen dispassionately he had hardly heard what zeb had said his mind had been going onward yes they sent me an annual pass and i took it back  zeb meader did not speak for a few moments  i guess i was a little hasty austen he said at length  i might have known you wouldnt sell out if youre willin to take the risk you tell em ten thousand dollars wouldnt tempt me  all right zeb said austen  he left the hospital and struck out across the country towards the slopes of sawanec climbed them and stood bareheaded in the evening light gazing over the still wide valley northward to the wooded ridges where leith and fairview lay hidden he had come to the parting of the ways of life and while he did not hesitate to choose his path a vane inheritance though not dominant could not fail at such a juncture to point out the pleasantness of conformity austens affection for hilary vane was real the loneliness of the elder man appealed to the son who knew that his father loved him in his own way he dreaded the wrench there  and nature persuasive in that quarter was not to be stilled in a field more completely her own the memory and suppliance of a minute will scarce suffice one of austens temperament for a lifetime and his eyes flying with the eagle high across the valley searched the velvet folds of the ridges as they lay in infinite shades of green in the level light for the place where the enchanted realm might be just what the state of his feelings were at this time towards victoria flint is too vagueaccurately to be painted but he was certainly not ready to give way to the attraction he felt for her his sense of humour intervened if he allowed himself to dream there was a certain folly in pursuing the acquaintance all the greater now that he was choosing the path of opposition to the dragon a young woman surrounded as she was could be expected to know little of the subtleties of business and political morality let him take zeb meaders case and her loyalty would naturally be with her fatherif she thought of austen vane at all  and yet the very contradiction of her name victoria joined with flint seemed to proclaim that she did not belong to her father or to the rose of sharon austen permitted himself to dwell as he descended the mountain in the gathering darkness upon the fancy of the springing of a generation of ideals from a generation of commerce which boded well for the republic and austen vane in common with that younger and travelled generation thought largely in terms of the republic pepper county and putnam county were all one to himpieces of his native land and as such redeemable  it was long past the supper hour when he reached the house in hanover street but euphrasia who many a time in days gone by had fared forth into the woods to find sarah austen had his supper hot for him afterwards he lighted his pipe and went out into the darkness and presently perceived a black figure seated meditatively on the granite doorstep  is that you judge said austen  the honourable hilary grunted in response  ben on another wild expedition i suppose  i went up sawanec to stretch my legs a little austen answered sitting down beside his father  funny remarked the honourable hilary i never had this mania for stretchin my legs after i was grown  well said austen i like to go into the woods and climb the hills and get aired out once in a while  i heard of your gettin aired out yesterday up tunbridge way said the honourable hilary  i supposed you would hear of it answered austen  i was up there today gave mr flint your pass did you  yes  didnt see fit to mention it to me firstdid you said you were going up to thank him for it  austen considered this  you have put me in the wrong judge he replied after a little i made that remark ironically i i am afraid we cannot agree on the motive which prompted me  your conscience a little finer than your fathersis it  no said austen i dont honestly think it is ive thought a good deal in the last few years about the difference in our ways of looking at things i believe that two men who try to be honest may conscientiously differ but i also believe that certain customs have gradually grown up in railroad practice which are more or less to be deplored from the point of view of the honour of the profession i think they are not perhapsrealized even by the eminent men in the law  humph said the honourable hilary but he did not press his son for the enumeration of these customs after all the years he had disapproved of austens deeds it seemed strange indeed to be called to account by the prodigal for his own could it be that this boy whom he had so often chastised took a clearer view of practical morality than himself it was preposterous but why the uneasiness of the past few years why had he more than once during that period for the first time in his life questioned a hitherto absolute satisfaction in his position of chief counsel for the northeastern railroads why had he hesitated to initiate his son into many of the socalled duties of a railroad lawyer austen had never verbally arraigned those duties until tonight  contradictory as it may seem irritating as it was to the honourable hilary vane he experienced again the certain faint tingling of pride as when austen had given him the dispassionate account of the shooting of mr blodgett and this tingling only served to stiffen hilary vane more than ever a lifelong habit of admitting nothing and a lifelong pride made the acknowledgment of possible professional lapses for the benefit of his employer not to be thought of he therefore assumed the same attitude as had mr flint and forced the burden of explanation upon austen relying surely on the disinclination of his son to be specific and austen considering his relationship could not be expected to fathom these mental processes  see here judge he said greatly embarrassed by the real affection he felt i dont want to seem like a prig and appear to be sitting in judgment upon a man of your experience and position especially since i have the honour to be your son and have made a good deal of trouble by a not irreproachable existence since we have begun on the subject however i think i ought to tell you that i have taken the case of zeb meader against the northeastern railroads  wahnt much need of telling me was there remarked the honourable hilary dryly id have found it out as soon as anybody else  there was this need of telling you answered austen steadily although i am not in partnership with you i bear your name and inasmuch as i am to have a suit against your client it has occurred to me that you would like me to moveelsewhere  the honourable hilary was silent for a long time  want to movedo you is that it  only because my presence may embarrass you  that wahnt in the contract said the honourable hilary youve got a right to take any fool cases youve a mind to folks know pretty well im not mixed up in em  austen did not smile he could well understand his fathers animus in this matter as he looked up at the gable of his old home against the stars he did not find the next sentence any easier  and then he continued in taking a course so obviously against your wishes and judgment it occurred to mewell that i was eating at your table and sleeping in your house  to his sons astonishment hilary vane turned on him almost truculently  i thought the timed come when youd want to go off againgypsying he cried  id stay right here in ripton judge i believe my work is in this state  the honour could see through a millstone with a hole in it the effect of austens assertion on him was a declaration that the mission of the one was to tear down what the other had so laboriously built up and yet a growing dread of hilary vanes had been the loneliness of declining years in that house should austen leave it again never to return  i knew you had this meader business in mind he said i knew you had fanciful notions aboutsome things never told you i didnt want you here did i  no said austen but  would have told you if i hadnt wanted youwouldnt i  i hope so judge said austen who understood something of the feeling which underlay this brusqueness that knowledge made matters all the harder for him  it was your mothers houseyoure entitled to that anyway said the honourable hilary but what i want to know is why you didnt advise that eternal fool of a meader to accept what we offered him youll never get a county jury to give as much  i did advise him to accept it answered austen  whats the matter with him the honourable hilary demanded  well judge if you really want my opinion an honest farmer like meader is suspicious of any corporation which has such zealous and loyal retainers as ham tooting and brush bascom and austen thought with a return of the pang which had haunted him at intervals throughout the afternoon that he might almost have added to these names that of hilary vane certainly zeb meader had not spared his father  life observed the honourable hilary unconsciously using a phrase from the book of arguments is a survival of the fittest  how do you define the fittest asked austen are they the men who have the not unusual and certainly not exalted gift of getting money from their fellow creatures by the use of any and all weapons that may be at hand who believe the acquisition of wealth to be exempt from the practice of morality is mr flint your example of the fittest type to exist and survive or gladstone or wilberforce or emerson or lincoln  emerson cried the honourable hilary the name standing out in red letters before his eyes he had never read a line of the philosophers writings not even the charge to hitch your wagon to a star not in the book of arguments sarah austen had read emerson in the woods and her sons question sounded so like the unintelligible but unanswerable flashes with which the wife had on rare occasions opposed the husbands authority that hilary vane found his temper getting the best of himthe name of emerson was immutably fixed in his mind as the synonym for incomprehensible foolish habits and beliefs dont talk emerson to me he exclaimed and as for brush bascom ive known him for thirty years and hes done as much for the republican party as any man in this state  this vindication of mr bascom naturally brought to a close a conversation which had already continued too long the honourable hilary retired to rest butif austen had known itnot to sleep until the small hours of the morning  it was not until the ensuing spring that the case of mr zebulun meader against the united northeastern railroads came up for trial in bradford the countyseat of putnam county and we do not wish to appear to give it too great a weight in the annals of the state for one thing the weekly newspapers did not mention it and mr paul pardriff when urged to give an account of the proceedings in the ripton record said it was a matter of no importance and spent the afternoon writing an editorial about the domestic habits of the aztecs mr pardriff however had thought the matter of sufficient interest personally to attend the trial and for the journey he made use of a piece of green cardboard which he habitually carried in his pocket the editor of the bradford champion did not have to use his yellow cardboard yet his columns may be searched in vain for the event  not that it was such a great event one of hundreds of railroad accidents that come to court the son of hilary vane was the plaintiffs counsel and mr meader although he had not been able to work since his release from the hospital had been able to talk and the interest taken in the case by the average neglected citizen in putnam proved that the weekly newspaper is not the only disseminator of news  the railroads side of the case was presented by that genial and able practitioner of putnam county mr nathaniel billings who travelled from his home in williamstown by the exhibition of a red ticket austen vane had to pay his own way from ripton but as he handed back the mileage book the conductor leaned over and whispered something in his ear that made him smile and austen thought he would rather have that little drop of encouragement than a pass and as he left the car at bradford two grizzled and hardhanded individuals arose and wished him good luck  he needed encouragementwhat young lawyer does not on his first important case and he did not like to think of the future if he lost this but in this matter he possessed a certain selfconfidence which arose from a just and righteous anger against the forces opposing him and a knowledge of their tactics to his mind his client was not zeb meader alone but the host of victims who had been maimed and bought off because it was cheaper than to give the public a proper protection  the court room was crowded mr zeb meader pale but determined was surrounded by a knot of mercer neighbours many of whom were witnesses the agate eyes of mr brush bascom flashed from the audience and mr nat billings bustled forward to shake austens hand nat was one of those who called not infrequently upon the honourable hilary in ripton and had sat on austens little table  glad to see you austen he cried so that the people might hear and added in a confidentially lower tone we lawyers understand that these little things make no difference eh  im willing to agree to that if you are nat austen answered he looked at the lawyers fleshy face blueblack where it was shaven and at mr billings shifty eyes and mouth which its muscles could not quite keep in place mr billings also had nicked teeth but he did his best to hide these obvious disadvantages by a falstaffian bonhomiefor mr billings was growing stout  i tried it once or twice my friend when i was younger its noble but it dont pay said mr billings still confidential brush is sourlook at him but i understand how you feel im the kind of feller that speaks out and what i cant understand is why the old man let you get into it  he knew you were going to be on the other side nat and wanted to teach me a lesson i suppose it is folly to contest a case where the railroad commission has completely exonerated your client austen added thoughtfully  mr billings answer was to wink very slowly with one eye and shortly after these pleasantries were over the case was called a fragrant wind blew in at the open windows and nature outside was beginning to array herself in myriad hues of green austen studied the jury and wondered how many points of his argument he could remember but when he had got to his feet the words came to him if we should seek an emblem for king davids smooth round stone which he flung at goliath we should call it the truthfor the truth never fails to reach the mark austens opening was not long his words simple and not dramatic but he seemed to charge them with something of the same magnetic force that compelled people to read and believe uncle tons cabin and the song of the shirt spectators and jury listened intently  some twenty witnesses appeared for the plaintiff all of whom declared that they had heard neither bell nor whistle most of these witnesses had been in the grove two or three in the train two residents of the vicinity testified that they had complained to the railroad commission about that crossing and had received evasive answers to the effect that it was the duty of citizens to look out for themselves on crossexamination they declared they had no objection to grade crossings which were properly safeguarded this crossing was a deathtrap stricken out mr billings made the mistake of trying to prove that one of these farmersa cleareyed fullchested man with a deep voicehad an animus against the railroad dating from a controversy concerning the shipping of milk  i have an animus your honour said the witness quietly when the railrud is represented by the kind of politicians we have in putnam its natural i should haint it  this answer although stricken out was gleefully received  in marked contrast to the earnestness of young mr vane who then rested mr billings treated the affair from the standpoint of a man of large practice who usually has more weighty matters to attend to this was so comparatively trivial as not to be dignified by a serious mien he quoted freely from the book of arguments reminding the jury of the debt of gratitude the state owed to the northeastern railroads for doing so much for its people and if they were to eliminate all grade crossings there would be no dividends for the stockholders besides the law was that the state should pay half when a crossing was eliminated and the state could not afford it austen had suggested in his opening that it was cheaper for the railroad as well as the state to kill citizens he asked permission to inquire of the learned counsel for the defence by what authority he declared that the state could not afford to enter into a policy by which grade crossings would gradually be eliminated  why said mr billings the fact that all bills introduced to this end never get out of committee  may i ask said austen innocently who has been chairman of that particular committee in the lower house for the last five sessions  mr billings was saved the embarrassment of answering this question by a loud voice in the rear calling outbrush bascom  a roar of laughter shook the court room and all eyes were turned on brush who continued to sit unconcernedly with his legs crossed and his arm over the back of the seat the offender was put out order was restored and mr billings declared with an injured air that he failed to see why the counsel for the plaintiff saw fit to impugn mr bascom  i merely asked a question said austere far be it from me to impugn any man who has held offices in the gift of the people for the last twenty years  another gale of laughter followed this during which mr billings wriggled his mouth and gave a strong impression that such tactics and such levity were to be deplored  for the defence the engineer and fireman both swore that the bell had been rung before the crossing was reached austen merely inquired whether this was not when they had left the station at north mercer two miles away no it was nearer pressed to name the exact spot they could only conjecture but near enough to be heard on the crossing other witnessesamong them several picnickers in the groveswore that they had heard the bell one of these austen asked if he was not the member from mercer in the last legislature and mr billings no longer genial sprang to his feet with an objection  i merely wish to show your honour said austen that this witness accepted a pass from the northeastern railroads when he went to the legislature and that he has had several trip passes for himself and his family since  the objection was not sustained and mr billings noted an exception  another witness upon whose appearance the audience tittered audibly was dave skinner boss of mercer he had lived he said in the town of mercer all his life and maintained that he was within a hundred yards of the track when the accident occurred and heard the bell ring  is it not a fact said austen to this witness that mr brush bascom has a mortgage on your farm  i can show your honour austen continued when mr billings had finished his protest that this man was on his way to riverside to pay his quarterly instalment  mr bascom was not present at the afternoon session mr billings summing up was somewhat impassioned and contained more quotations from the book of arguments he regretted he said the obvious appeals to prejudice against a railroad corporation that was honestly trying to do its dutyyes and more than its duty  misjudged misused even though friendless it would continue to serve the people so noble indeed was the picture which mr billings eloquence raised up that his voice shook with emotion as he finished  in the opinion of many of the spectators austen vane had yet to learn the art of oratory he might with propriety have portrayed the suffering and loss of the poor farmer who was his client he merely quoted from the doctors testimony to the effect that mr meader would never again be able to do physical labour of the sort by which he had supported himself and ended up by calling the attention of the jury to the photographs and plans of the crossing he had obtained two days after the accident requesting them to note the facts that the public highway approaching through a dense forest and underbrush at an angle of thirtythree degrees climbed the railroad embankment at that point and a train could not be seen until the horse was actually on the track  the jury was out five minutes after the judges charge and gave mr zebulun meader a verdict of six thousand dollars and costsa popular verdict from the evident approval with which it was received in the court room quiet being restored mr billings requested somewhat vehemently that the case be transferred on the exceptions to the supreme court that the stenographer write out the evidence and that he might have three weeks in which to prepare a draft this was granted  zeb meader true to his nature was selfcontained throughout the congratulations he received but his joy was nevertheless intense  you shook em up good austen he said making his way to where his counsel stood i suspicioned youd do it but how about this here appeal  billings is merely trying to save the face of his railroad austen answered smiling he hasnt the least notion of allowing this case to come up againtake my word for it  i guess your words good said zeb and i want to tell you one thing as an old man ive been talkin to putnam county folks some and you haint lost nothin by this  how am i to get along without the friendship of brush bascom asked austen soberly  mr meader who had become used to this mild sort of humour relaxed sufficiently to laugh  brush did seem a mite disgruntled he remarked  somewhat to austens embarrassment mr menders friends were pushing forward one grizzled veteran took him by the hand and looked thoughtfully into his face  ive lived a good many years he said but i never heerd em talked up to like that youre my candidate for governor     chapter vi enter the lion  it is a fact as shakespeare has so tersely hinted that fame sometimes comes in the line of duty to be sure if austen vane had been timothy smith the mender case might not have made quite so many ripples in the pond with which this story is concerned austen did what he thought was right in the opinion of many of his fathers friends whom he met from time to time he had made a goodsized stride towards ruin and they did not hesitate to tell him somr chipman president of the ripton national bank mr greene secretary and treasurer of the hawkeye paper company who suggested with all kindness that however noble it may be it doesnt pay to tilt at windmills  not unless you wreck the windmill answered austen a new and very revolutionary point of view to mr greene who repeated it to professor brewer urging that gentleman to take austen in hand but the professor burst out laughing and put the saying into circulation  mr silas tredway whose list of directorships is too long to print also undertook to remonstrate with the son of his old friend hilary vane the young lawyer heard him respectfully the cashiers of some of these gentlemen who were younger men ventured to saywhen out of hearingthat they admired the championship of mr mender but it would never do to these likewise austen listened goodnaturedly enough and did not attempt to contradict them changing the angle of the sundial does not affect the time of day  it was not surprising that young tom gaylord when he came back from new york and heard of austens victory should have rushed to his office and congratulated him in a rough but hearty fashion even though austen had won a suit against the gaylord lumber company young tom would have congratulated him old tom was a different matter old tom hobbling along under the maples squinted at austen and held up his stick  damn you youre a lawyer aint you cried the old man  austen well used to this kind of greeting from mr gaylord replied that he didnt think himself much of one  damn it i say you are some day i may have use for you said old tom and walked on  no said young tom afterwards in explanation of this extraordinary attitude of his father it isnt principle hes had a row with the northeastern about lumber rates and swears hell live till he gets even with em  if professor brewer riptons most clearsighted citizen had made the statement that hilary vaneaway down in the bottom of his heartwas secretly proud of his son the professor would probably have lost his place on the school board the water board and the library committee the way the worldlywise professor discovered the secret was this he had gone to bradford to hear the case for he had been a dear friend of sarah austen two days later hilary vane saw the professor on his little porch and lingered mr brewer suspected why led carefully up to the subject and not being discouragedexcept by numerous gruntsgave the father an account of the proceedings by no means unfavourable to the son some people like paregoric the honourable hilary took his without undue squirming with no visible effects to austen  life in the office continued with one or two exceptions the even tenor of its way apparently so far as the honourable hilary was concerned his son had never been to bradford but the honourable brush bascom when he came on mysterious business to call on the chief counsel no longer sat on austens table this was true of other feudal lords and retainers of mr nat billings who by the way did not file his draft after all not that mr billings wasnt polite but he indulged no longer in slow winks at the expense of the honourable railroad commission  perhaps the most curious result of the meader case to be remarked in passing was upon mr hamilton tooting austen except when he fled to the hills was usually the last to leave the office mr tooting often the first but one evening mr tooting waited until the force had gone and entered austens room with his hand outstretched  put her there aust he said  austen put her there  ive been exercisin my thinker some the last few months observed mr tooting seating himself on the desk  arent you afraid of nervous prostration ham  say exclaimed mr tooting with a vexed laugh why are you always jollying me you aint any older than i am  im not as old ham i dont begin to have your knowledge of the world  come off said mr tooting who didnt know exactly how to take this compliment i came in here to have a serious talk ive been thinking it over and i dont know but what you did right  well ham if you dont know i dont know how i am to convince you  hold on dont go twistin around that wayyou make me dizzy he lowered his voice confidentially although there was no one within five walls of them i know the difference between a gold brick and a government bond anyhow i believe bucking the railroads going to pay in a year or so i got on to it as soon as you did i guess but when a fellers worn the collar as long as i have and has to live it aint easy to cut looseyou understand  i understand answered austen gravely  i thought id let you know i didnt take any too much trouble with meader last summer to get the old bird to accept a compromise  that was good of you ham  i knew what you was up to said mr tooting giving austen a friendly poke with his cigar  you showed your usual acumen mr tooting said austen as he rose to put on his coat mr tooting regarded him uneasily  youre a deep one aust he declared some day you and me must get together  mr billings desire for ultimate justice not being any stronger than austen suspected in due time mr meader got his money his counsel would have none of ita decision not at all practical and on the whole disappointing there was to be sure an influx into austens office of people who had been run over in the past and it was austens unhappy duty to point out to these that they had signed at the request of various mr tootings little slips of paper which are technically known as releases but the first hint of a really material advantage to be derived from his case against the railroad came from a wholly unexpected source in the shape of a letter in the mail one august morning     dear sir having remarked with some interest the verdict for a    client of yours against the united northeastern railroads i wish    you would call and see me at your earliest convenience     yours truly     humphrey crewe  although his curiosity was aroused austen was of two minds whether to answer this summons the truth being that mr crewe had not made on the occasions on which they had had intercourse the most favourable of impressions however it is not for the struggling lawyer to scorn any honourable brief especially from a gentleman of stocks and bonds and varied interests like mr crewe with whom contentions of magnitude are inevitably associated as he spun along behind pepper on the leith road that climbed willow brook on the afternoon he had made the appointment austen smiled to himself over his anticipations and yetbeing humanlet his fancy play  the broad acres of wedderburn stretched across many highways but the manorhouse as it had been called stood on an eminence whence one could look for miles down the yale of the blue it had once been a farmhouse but gradually the tail had begun to wag the dog and the farmhouse became like the original stone out of which the irishman made the soup difficult to find once the edifice had been on the road but the road had long ago been removed to a respectful distance and austen entered between two massive pillars built of granite blocks on a musical gravel drive  humphrey crewe was on the porch his hands in his pockets as austen drove up  hello he said in a voice probably meant to be hospitable but which had a peremptory ring dont stand on ceremony hitch your beast and come along in  having as it were superintended the securing of pepper mr crewe led the way through the house to the study pausing once or twice to point out to austen a carved ivory elephant procured at great expense in china and a piece of tapestry equally difficult of purchase the study itself was no mere lounging place of a man of pleasure but sober and formidable books were scattered through the cases turners evolution of the railroad grahams practical forestry eldridges finance while whole shelves of modern husbandry proclaimed that mr humphrey crewe was no amateur farmer there was likewise a shelf devoted to road building several to knottylooking pamphlets and half a wall of neatly labelled pigeonholes for decoration there was an oar garnished with a ribbon and several groups of college undergraduates mostly either in puffed ties or scanty attire and always prominent in these groups and always unmistakable was mr humphrey crewe himself  mr crewe was silent awhile that this formidable array of things might make the proper impression upon his visitor  it was lucky you came today vane he said at length i am due in new york tomorrow for a directors meeting and i have a conference in chicago with a board of trustees of which i am a member on the third looking at my array of pamphlets eh ive been years in collecting themever since i left college those on railroads ought especially to interest youim somewhat of a railroad man myself  i didnt know that said austen  had two or three blocks of stock in subsidiary lines that had to be looked after it was a nuisance at first said mr crewe but i didnt shirk it i made up my mind id get to the bottom of the railroad problem and i did its no use doing a thing at all unless you do it well mr crewe his hands still in his pockets faced austen smilingly now ill bet you didnt know i was a railroad man until you came in here to tell the truth it was about a railroad matter that i sent for you  mr crewe lit a cigar but he did not offer one to austen as he had to mr tooting i wanted to see what you were like he continued with refreshing frankness of course id seen you on the road but you can get more of an idea of a man by talkin to him you know  you can if hell talk said austen who was beginning to enjoy his visit  mr crewe glanced at him keenly few men are fools at all points of the compass and mr crewe was far from this  you did well in that little case you had against the northeastern i heard about it  i did my best answered austen and he smiled again  as some great man has remarked observed mr crewe it isnt what we do its how we do it take pains over the smaller cases and the larger cases will come of themselves eh  i live in hope said austen wondering how soon this larger case was going to unfold itself  let me see said mr crewe isnt your father the chief attorney in this state for the northeastern how do you happen to be on the other side  by the happy accident of obtaining a client said austen  mr crewe glanced at him again in spite of himself respect was growing in him he had expected to find a certain amount of eagerness and subserviencythough veiled here was a man of different calibre than he looked for in ripton  the fact is he declared i have a grievance against the northeastern railroads and i have made up my mind that you are the man for me  you may have reason to regret your choice austen suggested  i think not replied mr crewe promptly i believe i know a man when i see one and you inspire me with confidence this matter will have a double interest for you as i understand you are fond of horses  horses  yes mr crewe continued gaining a little heat at the word i bought the finestlookin pair you ever saw in new york this springallaround action manners conformation everything ill show em to you one of ems all right now this confounded railroad injured the other gettin him up here ive put in a claim they say they didnt my man says they did he tells me the horse was thrown violently against the sides of the car several times hes internally injured i told em id sue em and ive decided that you are the man to take the caseon conditions  austens sense of humour saved himand mr humphrey crewe had begun to interest him he rose and walked to the window and looked out for a few moments over the flower garden before he repliedon what conditions  well said mr crewe frankly i dont want to pay more than the horse is worth and its business to settle on the fee in case you win i thought  you thought said austen that i might not charge as much as the next man  well said mr crewe i knew that if you took the case youd fight it through and i want to get even with em their claim agent had the impudence to suggest that the horse had been doctored by the dealer in new york to tell me that i who have been buying horses all my life was fooled the veterinary swears the animal is ruptured im a citizen of avalon county though many people call me a summer resident ive done business here and helped improve the neighbourhood for years it will be my policy to employ home talent avalon county lawyers for instance i may say without indiscretion that i intend from now on to take even a greater interest in public affairs the trouble is in this country that men in my position do not feel their responsibilities  public spirit is a rare virtue austen remarked seeing that he was expected to say something avalon county appreciates the complimentif i may be permitted to answer for it  i want to do the right thing said mr crewe in fact i have almost made up my mind to go to the legislature this year i know it would be a sacrifice of time in a sense and all that but he paused and looked at austen  the legislature needs leavening  precisely exclaimed mr crewe and when i look around me and see the things crying to be done in this state and no lawmaker with sense and foresight enough to propose them it makes me sick now for instance he continued and rose with an evident attempt to assault the forestry shelves but austen rose too  id like to go over that with you mr crewe said he but i have to be back in ripton  how about my case his host demanded with a return to his former abruptness  what about it asked austen  are you going to take it  struggling lawyers dont refuse business  well said mr crewe thats sensible but what are you going to charge  now said austen with entire good humour when you get on that ground you are dealing no longer with one voracious unit but with a whole professiona profession you will allow me to add which in dignity is second to none in accordance with the practice of the best men in that profession i will charge you what i believe is fairnot what i think you are able and willing to pay should you dispute the bill i will not stoop to quarrel with you but try to live on bread and butter a while longer  mr crewe was silent for a moment it would not be exact to say uncomfortable for it is to be doubted whether he ever got so but he felt dimly that the relations of patron and patronized were becoming somewhat jumbled  all right said he i guess we can let it go at that hello what the deuce are those women doing here again  this irrelevant exclamation was caused by the sight through the open french windowof three ladies in the flower garden two of whom were bending over the beds the third upon whose figure austens eyes were riveted was seated on a stone bench set in a recess of pines and looking off into the yale of the blue with no great eagerness but without apology to austen mr crewe stepped out of the window and approached them and as this was as good a way as any to his horse and buggy austen followed one of the ladies straightened at their appearance scrutinized them through the glasses she held in her hand and austen immediately recognized her as the irreproachable mrs pomfret  we didnt mean to disturb you humphrey she said we knew you would be engaged in business but i told alice as we drove by i could not resist stopping for one more look at your canterbury bells i knew you wouldnt mind but you mustnt leave youraffairsnot for an instant  the word affairs was accompanied by a brief inspection of austen vane  thats all right answered mr crewe it doesnt cost anything to look at flowers thats what theyre for cost something to put em in i got that little feller ridley to lay em outi believe i told you hes just beginning hello alice  i think he did it very well humphrey said miss pomfret  passably said mr crewe i told him what i wanted and drew a rough sketch of the garden and the colour scheme  then you did it and not mr ridley i rather suspected it said mrs pomfret you have such clear and practical ideas about things humphrey  its simple enough said mr crewe deprecatingly after youve seen a few hundred gardens and get the general underlying principle  its very clever alice murmured  not at all a little application will do wonders a certain definite colour massed here another definite colour there and so forth  mr crewe spoke as though alices praise irritated him slightly he waved his hand to indicate the scheme in general and glanced at victoria on the stone bench from her austen thought seemed to emanate a silent but mirthful criticism although she continued to gaze persistently down the valley apparently unaware of their voices mr crewe looked as if he would have liked to reach her but the two ladies filled the narrow path and mrs pomfret put her fingers on his sleeve  humphrey you must explain it to us i am so interested in gardens im going to have one if electrics increase their dividend  mr crewe began with no great ardour to descant on the theory of planting and austen resolved to remain pocketed and ignored no longer he retraced his steps and made his way rapidly by another path towards victoria who turned her head at his approach and rose he acknowledged an inward agitation with the vision in his eye of the tall white figure against the pines clad with the art which in mysterious simplicity effaces itself  i was wondering she said as she gave him her hand how long it would be before you spoke to me  you gave me no chance said austen quickly  do you deserve one she asked  before he could answer mr crewes explanation of his theories had come lamely to a halt austen was aware of the renewed scrutiny of mrs pomfret and then mr crewe whom no social manacles could shackle had broken past her and made his way to them he continued to treat the ground on which austen was standing as unoccupied  hello victoria he said you dont know anything about gardens do you  i dont believe you do either was victorias surprising reply  mr crewe laughed at this pleasantry  how are you going to prove it he demanded  by comparing what youve done with freddie ridleys original plan said victoria  mr crewe was nettled  ridley has a lot to learn he retorted he had no conception of what was appropriate here  freddie was weak said victoria but he needed the money dont you know mr vane  yes said mr crewe shortly ive been talking to himon business  oh said victoria i had no means of knowing mrs pomfret i want to introduce mr vane and miss pomfret mr vane  mrs pomfret who had been hovering on the outskirts of this duel inclined her head the fraction of an inch but alice put out her hand with her sweetest manner  when did you arrive she asked  well the fact is i havent arrived yet said austen  not arrived exclaimed alice with a puzzled glance into victorias laughing eyes  perhaps humphrey will help you along victoria suggested turning to him he might be induced to give you his celebrated grievance about his horses  i have given it to him said mr crewe briefly  cheer up mr vane your fortune is made said victoria  victoria said mrs pomfret in her most imperial voice we ought to be going instantly or we shant have time to drop you at the hammonds  ill take you over in the new motor car said mr crewe with his air of conferring a special train  how much is gasoline by the gallon inquired victoria  i did a favour once for the local manager and get a special price said mr crewe  humphrey said mrs pomfret taking his hand dont forget you are coming to dinner tonight four people gave out at the last minute and there will be just alice and myself ive asked old mr fitzhugh  all right said mr crewe ill have the motor car brought around  the latter part of this remark was needless to say addressed to victoria  its awfully good of you humphrey she answered but the hammonds are on the road to ripton and i am going to ask mr vane to drive me down there behind that adorable horse of his  this announcement produced a varied effect upon those who heard it although all experienced surprise mrs pomfret in addition to an anger which she controlled only as the result of long practice was horrified and once more levelled her glasses at austen  i think victoria you had better come with us she said we shall have plenty of time if we hurry  by this time austen had recovered his breath  ill be ready in an instant he said and made brief but polite adieus to the three others  goodby said alice vaguely  let me know when anything develops said mr crewe with his back to his attorney  austen found victoria her colour heightened a little waiting for him by the driveway the pomfrets had just driven off and mr crewe was nowhere to be seen  i do not know what you will think of me for taking this for granted mr vane she said as he took his seat beside her but i couldnt resist the chance of driving behind your horse  i realized he answered smilingly that pepper was the attraction and i have more reason than ever to be grateful to him  she glanced covertly at the vane profile at the sure restraining hands on the reins which governed with so nice a touch the mettle of the horse his silence gave her time to analyze again her interest in this man which renewed itself at every meeting in the garden she had been struck by the superiority of a nature which set at naught what had been to some smaller spirits a difficult situation she recognized this quality as inborn but not knowing of sarah austen she wondered where he got it now it was the fact that he refrained from comment that pleased her most  did humphrey actually send for you to take up the injured horse case she asked  austen flushed  im afraid he did you seem to know all about it he added  know all about it every one within twenty miles of leith knows about it im sure the horse was doctored when he bought him  take care you may be called as a witness  what i want to know is why you accepted such a silly case said victoria  austen looked quizzically into her upturned face and she dropped her eyes  thats exactly what i should have asked myselfafter a while he said  she laughed with a delicious understanding of after a while  i suppose you think me frightfully forward she said in a lowered voice inviting myself to drive and asking you such a question when i scarcely know you but i just couldnt go on with mrs pomfretshe irritated me soand my front teeth are too valuable to drive with humphrey crewe  austen smiled and secretly agreed with her  i should have offered if i had dared he said  dared i didnt know that was your failing i dont believe you even thought of it  nevertheless the idea occurred to me and terrified me said austen  why she asked turning upon him suddenly why did it terrify you  i should have been presuming upon an accidental acquaintance which i had no means of knowing you wished to continue he replied staring at his horses head  and i victoria asked presumption multiplies tenfold in a woman doesnt it  a woman confers said austen  she smiled but with a light in her eyes this simple sentence seemed to reveal yet more of an inner man different from some of those with whom her life had been cast it was an american point of viewthis choosing to believe that the woman conferred after offering herself as his passenger victoria too had had a moment of terror the action had been the result of an impulse which she did not care to attempt to define she changed the subject  you have been winning laurels since i saw you last summer she said i hear incidentally you have made our friend zeb meader a rich man  as riches go in the town of mercer austen laughed as for my laurels they have not yet begun to chafe  here was a topic he would have avoided and yet he was curious to discover what her attitude would be he had antagonized her father and the fact that he was the son of hilary vane had given his antagonism prominence  i am glad you did it for zeb  i should have done it for anybodymuch as i like zeb he replied briefly  she glanced at him  it wascourageous of you she said  i have never looked upon it in that light he answered may i ask you how you heard of it  she coloured but faced the question  i heard it from my father at first and i took an intereston zeb meaders account she added hastily  austen was silent  of course she continued i felt a little like boasting of an accidental acquaintance with the man who saved zeb meaders life  austen laughed then he drew pepper down to a walk and turned to her  the power of making it more than an accidental acquaintance lies with you he said quietly  i have always had an idea that aggression was a mans prerogative victoria answered lightly and seeing that you have not appeared at fairview for something over a year i can only conclude that you do not choose to exercise it in this case  austen was in a cruel quandary  i did wish to come he answered simply butthe fact that i have had a disagreement with your father hasmade it difficult nonsense exclaimed victoria just because you have won a suit against his railroad you dont know my father mr vane he isnt the kind of man with whom that would make any difference you ought to talk it over with him he thinks you were foolish to take zeb meaders side  and you austen demanded quickly  you see im a woman said victoria and im prejudicedfor zeb meader women are always prejudicedthats our trouble it seemed to me that zeb was old and unfortunate and ought to be compensated since he is unable to work but of course i suppose i cant be expected to understand  it was true that she could not be expected to understand he might not tell her that his difference with mr flint was not a mere matter of taking a small damage suit against his railroad but a fundamental one and austen recognized that the justification of his attitude meant an arraignment of victorias father  i wish you might know my father better mr vane she went on i wish you might know him as i know him if it were possible you see i have been his constant companion all my life and i think very few people understand him as i do and realize his fine qualities he makes no attempt to show his best side to the world his life has been spent in fighting and i am afraid he is apt to meet the world on that footing he is a man of such devotion to his duty that he rarely has a day to himself and i have known him to sit up until the small hours of the morning to settle some little matter of justice i do not think i am betraying his confidence when i say that he is impressed with your ability and that he liked your manner the only time he ever talked to you he believes that you have got in some way a wrong idea of what he is trying to do why dont you come up and talk to him again  i am afraid your kindness leads you to overrate my importance austen replied with mingled feelings victorias confidence in her father made the situation all the more hopeless  im sure i dont she answered quickly ever sinceever since i first laid eyes upon you i have had a kind of belief in you  belief he echoed  yes she said belief thatthat you had a future i cant describe it she continued the colour coming into her face again one feels that way about some people without being able to put the feeling into words and have a feeling too that i should like you to be friends with my father  neither of them perhaps realized the rapidity with which accidental acquaintance had melted into intimacy austens blood ran faster but it was characteristic of him that he tried to steady himself for he was a vane he had thought of her many times during the past year but gradually the intensity of the impression had faded until it had been so unexpectedly and vividly renewed today he was not a man to lose his head and the difficulties of the situation made him pause and choose his words while he dared not so much as glance at her as she sat in the sunlight beside him  i should like to be friends with your father he answered gravelythe statement being so literally true as to have its pathetically humorous aspect  ill tell him so mr vane she said  austen turned with a seriousness that dismayed her  i must ask you as a favour not to do that he said  why she asked  in the first place he answered quietly i cannot afford to have mr flint misunderstand my motives and i ought not to mislead you he went on in periods of public controversy such as we are passing through at present sometimes mens views differ so sharply as to make intercourse impossible your father and i might not agreepolitically let us say for instance he added with evident hesitation my father and i disagree  victoria was silent and presently they came to a wire fence overgrown with virginia creeper which divided the shaded road from a wide lawn  here we are at the hammonds andthank you she said  any reply he might have made was forestalled the insistent and intolerant horn of an automobile followed now by the scream of the gears broke the stillness of the countryside and a familiar voice cried outdo you want the whole road  austen turned into the hammonds drive as the bulldog nose of a motor forged ahead and mr crewe swung in the drivers seat  hello victoria he shouted you people ought to have eartrumpets  the car swerved narrowly missed a watering fountain where the word peace was inscribed and shot down the hill  that manner said victoria as she jumped out of the buggy is a valuable political asset  does he really intend to go into politics austen asked curiously  intend is a mild word applied to humphrey she answered determined would suit him better according to him there is no game that cannot be won by dynamics get out of the way is his motto mrs pomfret will tell you how he means to cover the state with good roads next year and take a house in washington the year after she held out her hand goodbyand i am ever so much obliged to you for bringing me here  he drove away towards ripton with many things to think about with a last picture of her in his mind as she paused for an instant in the flickering shadows stroking peppers forehead     chapter vii the leopard and his spots  it is difficult to overestimate the importance of mr humphrey crewe of his value to the town of leith and to the state at large and in these pages only a poor attempt at an appreciation of him may be expected mr crewe by no means underestimated this claim upon the community and he had of late been declaring that he was no summer resident wedderburn was his home and there he paid his taxes undoubtedly they were less than city taxes  although a young man mr crewe was in all respects a model citizen and a person of many activities he had built a farmers club to which the farmers in gross ingratitude had never gone now it was a summer residence and distinctly rentable he had a standing offer to erect a library in the village of leith provided the town would furnish the ground the books and permit the name of crewe to be carved in stone over the doorway the indifference of the town pained him and he was naturally not a little grieved at the lack of proper feeling of the country people of america towards those who would better their conditions he had put a large memorial window in the chapel to his family  mr crewe had another standing offer to be one of five men to start a farming experiment stationwhich might pay dividends he was a church warden president of a society for turning over crops which he had organized a member of the state grange president of the embryo state economic league whatever that was and chairman of the local improvement boardalso a creation of his own by these tokens and others too numerous to mention it would seem that the inhabitants of leith would have jumped at the chance to make such a man one of the five hundred in their state legislature  to whitman is attributed the remark that genius is almost one hundred per cent directness but whether or not this applied to mr humphrey crewe remains to be seen dynamics more surely expressed him it would not seem to be a very difficult feat to be sure to get elected to a state legislature of five hundred which met once a year once in ten years indeed might have been more appropriate for the five hundred the town of leith with its thousand inhabitants had one representative and mr crewe had made up his mind he was to be that representative  there was needless to say great excitement in leith over mr crewes proposed venture into the unknown seas of politics i mean of course that portion of leith which recognized in mr crewe an eligible bachelor and a person of social importance for these qualities were not particularly appealing to the three hundred odd farmers whose votes were expected to send him rejoicing to the state capital  it is so rare with us for a gentleman to go into politics that we ought to do everything we can to elect him mrs pomfret went about declaring women do so much in england i wonder they dont do more here i was staying at aylestone court last year when the honourable billy aylestone was contesting the family seat with a horrid radical and i assure you my dear i got quite excited we did nothing from morning till night but electioneer for the honourable billy and kissed all the babies in the borough the mothers were so grateful now edith do tell jack instead of playing tennis and canoeing all day he ought to help its the duty of all young men to help noblesse oblige you know i cant understand victoria she really has influence with these country people but she says its all nonsense sometimes i think victoria has a common streak in herand no wonder the other day she actually drove to the hammonds in a buggy with an unknown lawyer from ripton but i told you about it tell your gardener and the people that do your haying dear and your chicken woman my chicken woman is most apathetic but do you wonder with the life they lead  mr humphrey crewe might have had with king charles the watchword thorough he sent to the town clerk for a checklist and proceeded to honour each of the two hundred republican voters with a personal visit this is a fair example of what took place in the majority of cases  out of a cloud of dust emerges an automobile which halts with protesting brakes in front of a neat farmhouse guarded by great maples persistent knocking by a chauffeur at last brings a woman to the door mrs jenney has a pleasant face and an ample figure  mr jenney live here cries mr crewe from the drivers seat  yes says mrs jenney smiling  tell him i want to see him  guess youll find him in the apple orchard  wheres that  the chauffeur takes down the bars mr jenney pricks up his ears and presentlyto his amazementperceives a leviathan approaching him careening over the ruts of his wood road not being an emotional person he continues to pick apples until he is summarily hailed then he goes leisurely towards the leviathan  are you mr jenney  callate to be says mr jenney pleasantly  im humphrey crewe  how be you says mr jenney his eyes wandering over the leviathan  how are the apples this year asks mr crewe graciously  fair to middlin says mr jenney  have you ever tasted my pippins says mr crewe a little science in cultivation helps along im going to send you a united states government pamphlet on the fruit we can raise here  mr jenney makes an awkward pause by keeping silent on the subject of the pamphlet until he shall see it  do you take much interest in politics  not a great deal answers mr jenney  thats the trouble with americans mr crewe declares they dont care who represents em or whether their governments good or bad  guess thats so replies mr jenney politely  that sort of things got to stop declares mr crewe im a candidate for the republican nomination for representative  i want to know ejaculates mr jenney pulling his beard one would never suspect that this has been one of mr jenneys chief topics of late  ill see that the interests of this town are cared for  lets see says mr jenney theres five hundred in the house aint there  its a ridiculous number says mr crewe with truth  gives everybody a chance to go says mr jenney i was thar in 78 and enjoyed it some  who are you for demanded mr crewe combating the tendency of the conversation to slip into a pocket  little early yet haint it haint made up my mind whos the candidates asks mr jenney continuing to stroke his beard  i dont know says mr crewe but i do know ive done something for this town and i hope youll take it into consideration come and see me when you go to the village ill give you a good cigar and that pamphlet and well talk matters over  never would have thought to see one of them things in my orchard says mr jenney how much do they cost much as a locomotive dont they  it would not be exact to say that after some weeks of this sort of campaigning mr crewe was discouraged for such writhe vitality with which nature had charged him that he did not know the meaning of the word he was merely puzzled as a junebug is puzzled when it bumps up against a wire windowscreen he had pledged to him his own gardener mrs pomfrets the hired men of three of his neighbours a few modest souls who habitually took off their hats to him and mr ball of the village who sold groceries to wedderburn and was a general handy man for the summer people mr ball was an agitator by temperament and a promoter by preference if you were a summer resident of importance and needed anything from a sewingmachine to a holstein heifer mr ball the grocer would accommodate you when mrs pomfrets cook became inebriate and refractory mr ball was sent for and enticed her to the station and on board of a train when the chillinghams tank overflowed mr ball found the proper valve and saved the house from being washed away and it was he who after mrs pomfret took the keenest interest in mr crewes campaign at length came one day when mr crewe pulled up in front of the grocery store and called as his custom was loudly for mr ball the fact that mr ball was waiting on customers made no difference and presently that gentleman appeared rubbing his hands together  how do you do mr crewe he said automobile going all right  whats the matter with these fellers said mr crewe havent i done enough for the town didnt i get em rural free delivery didnt i subscribe to the meetinghouse and library and dont i pay more taxes than anybody else  certain assented mr ball eagerly certain you do it did not seem to occur to him that it was unfair to make him responsible for the scurvy ingratitude of his townsmen he stepped gingerly down into the dust and climbed up on the tool box  look out said mr crewe dont scratch the varnish what is it  mr ball shifted obediently to the rubbercovered step and bent his face to his patrons ear  its railrud he said  railroad shouted mr crewe in a voice that made the grocer clutch his arm in terror dont pinch me like that railroad this town aint within ten miles of the railroad  for the love of david said mr ball dont talk so loud mr crewe  whats the railroad got to do with it mr crewe demanded  mr ball glanced around him to make sure that no one was within shouting distance  whats the railrud got to do with anything in this state inquired mr ball craftily  thats different said mr crewe shortly im a corporation man myself theyve got to defend emselves  certain i aint got anything again em mr ball agreed quickly i guess they know what theyre about by the bye mr crewe he added coming dangerously near the varnish again and drawing back you haint happened to have seen job braden have you  job braden exclaimed mr crewe job braden whats all this mystery about job braden somebody whispers that name in my ear every day if you mean that smoothfaced cuss that stutters and lives on bradens hill i called on him but he was out if you see him tell him to come up to wedderburn and ill talk with him  mr ball made a gesture to indicate a feeling divided between respect for mr crewe and despair at the hardihood of such a proposition  lord bless you sir job wouldnt go  wouldnt go  he never pays visitsfolks go to him  hed come to see me wouldnt he  iim afraid riot mr crewe job holds his comb rather high  do you mean to say this twoforacent town has a boss  silas grantley was born here said mr ballfor even the worm will turn this towns got a noble history  i dont care anything about silas grantley what i want to know is how this rascal manages to make anything out of the political pickings of a town like leith  well job aint exactly a rascal mr crewe hes got a good many of them hill farmers in a position ofof gratitude enough to control the republican caucus  do you mean he buys their votes demanded mr crewe  its like this explained mr ball if one of em falls behind in his grocery bill for example he can always get money from job job takes a mortgage but he dont often close down on m and job has been collectin credentials in avalon county for upward of forty years  collecting credentials  yes gets a man nominated to state and county conventions that cant go and goes himself with a bunch of credentials hes in a position to negotiate he was in all them railrud fights with jethro bass and now he does business with hilary vane or brush bascom when anything especials goin on youd ought to see him mr crewe  i guess i wont waste my time with any picayune boss if the united northeastern railroads has any hand in this matter declared mr crewe wind her up  this latter remark was addressed to a longsuffering chauffeur who looked like a sicilian brigand  i didnt exactly like to suggest it said mr ball rubbing his hands and raising his voice above the whir of the machine but of course i knew mr flint was an intimate friend a word to him from you  but by this mr crewe had got in his second speed and was sweeping around a corner lined with farmers teams whose animals were behaving like circus horses on his own driveway where he arrived in incredibly brief time he met his stenographer farm superintendent secretary housekeeper and general utility man mr raikes mr raikes was elderly and showed signs of needing a vacation  telephone mr flint raikes and tell him i would like an appointment at his earliest convenience on important business  mr raikes who was going for his daily stroll beside the river wheeled and made for the telephone and brought back the news that mr flint would be happy to see mr crewe the next afternoon at four oclock  this interview about which there has been so much controversy in the newspapers and denials and counterdenials from the press bureaus of both gentlementhis now historic interview began at four oclock precisely the next day at that hour mr crewe was ushered into that little room in which mr flint worked when at fairview like frederick the great and other famous captains mr flint believed in an iron bedstead regime the magnate was as usual fortified behind his oak desk the secretary with a bend in his back was in modest evidence and an elderly man of comfortable proportions with a large gold watchcharm portraying the rising sun and who gave somehow the polished impression of a marble sat near the window smoking a cigar mr crewe approached the desk with that genial and brisk manner for which he was noted and held out his hand to the railroad president  we are both business men and both punctual mr flint he said and sat down in the empty chair beside his host eyeing without particular favour him of the watchcharm whose cigar was not a very good one i wanted to have a little private conversation with you which might be of considerable interest to us both and mr crewe laid down on the desk a somewhat formidable roll of papers  i trust the presence of senator whitredge will not deter you answered mr flint he is an old friend of mine  mr crewe was on his feet again with surprising alacrity and beside the senators chair  how are you senator he said i have never had the pleasure of meeting you but i know you by reputation  the senator got to his feet they shook hands and exchanged cordial greetings and during the exchange mr crewe looked out of the window and the senators eyes were fixed on the telephone receiver on mr flints desk as neither gentleman took hold of the others fingers very hard they fell apart quickly  i am very happy to meet you mr crewe said the senator mr crewe sat down again and not being hampered by those shrinking qualities so fatal to success he went on immediatelythere is nothing which i have to say that the senator cannot hear i made the appointment with you mr flint to talk over a matter which may be of considerable importance to us both i have made up my mind to go to the legislature  mr crewe naturally expected to find visible effects of astonishment and joy on the faces of his hearers at such not inconsiderable news mr flint however looked serious enough though the senator smiled as he blew his smoke out of the window  have you seen job braden mr crewe he asked with genial jocoseness they tell me that job is still alive and kicking over in your parts  thank you senator said mr crewe that brings me to the very point i wish to emphasize everywhere in leith i am met with the remark have you seen job braden and i always answer no i havent seen mr braden and i dont intend to see him  mr whitredge laughed and blew out a ring of smoke mr flints face remained sober  now mr flint mr crewe went on you and i understand each other and were on the same side of the fence i have inherited some interests in corporations myself and i have acquired an interest in others i am a director in several i believe that it is the duty of property to protect itself and the duty of all good men in politicssuch as the senator herebow from mr whitredgeto protect property i am a practical man and i think i can convince you if you dont see it already that my determination to go to the legislature is an advantageous thing for your railroad  the advent of a reputable citizen into politics is always a good thing for the railroad mr crewe said mr flint  exactly mr crewe agreed ignoring the noncommittal quality of this remark and if you get a citizen who is a not inconsiderable property holder a gentleman and a college graduatea man who by study and predilection is qualified to bring about improved conditions in the state so much the better  so much the better said mr flint  i thought you would see it that way mr crewe continued now a man of your calibre must have studied to some extent the needs of the state and it must have struck you that certain improvements go hand in hand with the prosperity of your railroad  have a cigar mr crewe have another senator said mr flint i think that is safe as a general proposition mr crewe  to specify said mr crewe laying his hand on the roll of papers he had brought i have here bills which i have carefully drawn up and which i will leave for your consideration one is to issue bonds for ten millions to build state roads  ten millions said mr flint and the senator whistled mildly  think about it said mr crewe the perfection of the highways through the state instead of decreasing your earnings would increase them tremendously visitors by the tens of thousands would come in automobiles and remain and buy summer places the state would have its money back in taxes and business in no time at all i wonder somebody hasnt seen it beforethe stupidity of the country legislator is colossal and we want forestry laws and laws for improving the condition of the farmersall practical things they are all there mr crewe declared slapping the bundle read them mr flint if you have any suggestions to make kindly note them on the margin and i shall be glad to go over them with you  by this time the senator was in a rare posture for himhe was seated upright  as you know i am a very busy man mr crewe said the railroad president  no one appreciates that more fully than i do mr flint said mr crewe i havent many idle hours myself i think you will find the bills and my comments on them well worth your consideration from the point of view of advantage to your railroad they are typewritten and in concrete form in fact the northeastern railroads and myself must work together to our mutual advantagethat has become quite clear to me i shall have need of your help in passing the measures  im afraid i dont quite understand you mr crewe said mr flint putting down the papers  that is said mr crewe if you approve of the bills and i am confident that i shall be able to convince you  what do you want me to do asked the railroad president  well in the first place said mr crewe unabashed send word to your man braden that youve seen me and its all right  i assure you answered mr flint giving evidence for the first time of a loss of patience that neither the northeastern railroads nor myself have any more to do with this braden than you have  mr crewe being a man of the world looked incredulous  senator mr flint continued turning to mr whitredge you know as much about politics in this state as any man of my acquaintance have you ever heard of any connection between this braden and the northeastern railroads  the senator had a laugh that was particularly disarming  bless your soul no he replied you will pardon me mr crewe but you must have been listening to some farmers tale the railroad is the bugaboo in all these country romances ive seen old job braden at conventions ever since i was a lad hes a back number one of the few remaining disciples and imitators of jethro bass talks like him and acts like him in the old days when there were a lot of little railroads he and bijah bixby and a few others used to make something out of them but since the consolidation and mr flints presidency job stays at home they tell me he runs leith yet youd better go over and fix it up with him  a somewhat sarcastic smile of satisfaction was playing over mr flints face as he listened to the senators words as a matter of fact they were very nearly true as regarded job braden but mr crewe may be pardoned for thinking that mr flint was not showing him quite the confidence due from one business and corporation man to another he was by no means abashedmr crewe had too much spirit for that he merely becameas a man whose watchword is thorough willa little more combative  well read the bills anyway mr flint and ill come and go over them with you you cant fail to see my arguments and all i ask is that you throw the weight of your organization at the state capital for them when they come up  mr flint drummed on the table  the men who have held office in this state he said have always been willing to listen to any suggestion i may have thought proper to make to them this is undoubtedly because i am at the head of the property which pays the largest taxes needless to say i am chary of making suggestions but i am surprised that you should have jumped at a conclusion which is the result of a popular and unfortunately prevalent opinion that the northeastern railroads meddled in any way with the government or politics of this state i am glad of this opportunity of assuring you that we do not he continued leaning forward and holding up his hand to ward off interruption and i know that senator whitredge will bear me out in this statement too  the senator nodded gravely mr crewe who was anything but a fool and just as assertive as mr flint cut in  look here mr flint he said i know what a lobby is i havent been a director in railroads myself for nothing i have no objection to a lobby you employ counsel before the legislature dont you  we do said mr flint interrupting the best and most honourable counsel we can find in the state when necessary they appear before the legislative committees as a property holder in the state and an admirer of its beauties and as its wellwisher it will give me great pleasure to look over your bills and use whatever personal influence i may have as a citizen to forward them should they meet my approval and i am especially glad to do this as a neighbour mr crewe as a neighbour he repeated significantly  the president of the northeastern railroads rose as he spoke these words and held out his hand to mr crewe it was perhaps a coincidence that the senator rose also  all right said mr crewe ill call around again in about two weeks come and see me sometime senator thank you said the senator i shall be happy and if you are ever in your automobile near the town of ramsey stop at my little farm mr crewe i trust to be able soon to congratulate you on a step which i am sure will be but the beginning of a long and brilliant political career  thanks said mr crewe by the bye if you could see your way to drop a hint to that feller braden i should be much obliged  the senator shook his head and laughed  job is an independent cuss he said im afraid hed regard that as an unwarranted trespass on his preserves  mr crewe was ushered out by the stooping secretary mr freeman who instead of seizing mr crewes hand as he had austen vanes said not a word but mr crewe would have been interested if he could have heard mr flints first remark to the senator after the door was closed on his back it did not relate to mr crewe but to the subject under discussion which he had interrupted namely the republican candidates for the twenty senatorial districts of the state  on its way back to leith the red motor paused in front of mr balls store and that gentleman was summoned in the usual manner  do you see this braden once in a while mr crewe demanded  mr ball looked knowing  tell him i want to have a talk with him said mr crewe ive been to see mr flint and i think matters can be arranged and mind you no word about this ball  i guess i understand a thing or two said mr ball trust me to handle it  two days later as mr crewe was seated in his study his man entered and stood respectfully waiting for the time when he should look up from his book  well what is it now waters  if you please sir said the man a strange message has come over the telephone just now that you were to be in room number twelve of the ripton house tomorrow at ten oclock they wouldnt give any name sir added the dignified waters who to tell the truth was somewhat outraged nor tell where they telephoned from but it was a mans voice sir  all right said mr crewe  he spent much of the afternoon and evening debating whether or not his dignity would permit him to go but he ordered the motor at halfpast nine and at ten oclock precisely the clerk at the ripton house was bowing to him and handing him deferentially a dripping pen  wheres room number twelve said the direct mr crewe  oh said the clerk and possessing a full share of the worldly wisdom of his calling he smiled broadly i guess youll find him up there mr crewe front show the gentleman to number twelve  the hall boy knocked on the door of number twelve  ccome in said a voice come in  mr crewe entered the hall boy closed the door and he found himself face to face with a comfortable smoothfaced man seated with great placidity on a rockingchair in the centre of the room between the bed and the marbletopped table a man to whom evidently a rich abundance of thought was sufficient company for he had neither newspaper nor book he rose in a leisurely fashion and seemed the very essence of the benign as he stretched forth his hand  im mr crewe the owner of that name proclaimed accepting the hand with no exaggeration of cordiality the situation jarred on him a trifle  i know seed you on the road once or twice how be you  mr crewe sat down  i suppose you are mr braden he said  mr braden sank into the rocker and fingered a waistcoat pocket full of cigars that looked like a section of a cartridgebelt  ttry one of mine he said  i only smoke once after breakfast said mr crewe  abstemious be you never could find that it did me any hurt  this led to an awkward pause mr crewe not being a man who found profit in idle discussion he glanced at mr bradens philanthropic and beaming countenance which would have made the fortune of a bishop it was not usual for mr crewe to find it difficult to begin a conversation or to have a companion as selfsufficient as himself this man braden had all the fun apparently in sitting in a chair and looking into space that stonewall jackson had or an ordinary man in watching a performance of a trip to chinatown let it not be inferred again that mr crewe was abashed but he was puzzled  i had an engagement in ripton this morning he said to see about some business matters and after i received your telephone i thought id drop in here  didnt telephone said mr braden placidly  what said mr crewe i certainly got a telephone message  nnever telephone said mr braden  i certainly got a message from you mr crewe protested  didnt say it was from medidnt say sodid they  no said mr crewe but  told ball you wanted to have me see you didnt you  mr crewe when he had unravelled this sentence did not fancy the way it was put  i told ball i was seeing everybody in leith he answered and that i had called on you and you werent at home ball inferred that you had a somewhat singular way of seeing people  you dont understand was mr bradens somewhat enigmatic reply  i understand pretty well said mr crewe im a candidate for the republican nomination for representative from leith and i want your vote and influence you probably know what i have done for the town and that im the biggest taxpayer and an alltheyearround resident  ssome in noo yorkhaint you  well you cant expect a man in my position and with my interests to stay at home all the time i feel that i have a right to ask the town for this nomination i have some bills here which ill request you to read over and you will see that i have ideas which are of real value to the state the state needs waking upprogressive measures youre a farmer aint you  well i have ben  i can improve the condition of the farmer one hundred per cent and if my road system is followed he can get his goods to market for about a tenth of what it costs him now we have infinitely valuable forests in the state which are being wasted by lumbermen which ought to be preserved you read those bills and what i have written about them  you dont understand said mr braden drawing a little closer and waving aside the manuscript with his cigar  dont understand what  dont seem to understand repeated mr braden confidingly laying his hand on mr crewes knee candidate for representative be you  yes replied mr crewe who was beginning to resent the manner in which he deemed he was being played with i told you i was  mmade all them bills out before you was chose said mr braden  mr crewe grew red in the face  i am interested in these questions he said stiffly  little mite hasty wahnt it mr braden remarked equably but youve got plenty of time and money to fool with such things if youve a mind to them dont amount to a hill of beans in politics nobody pays any attention to that sort of fireworks down to the capital and if they was to get into committee them northeastern railroads fellersd bury em deeper than the bottom of salem pond they dont want no such things as them to pass  pardon me said mr crewe but you havent read em  i know what they be said mr braden ive ben in politics more years than youve ben livin i guess i dont want to read em he announced his benign manner unchanged  i think you have made a mistake so far as the railroad is concerned mr braden said mr crewe im a practical man myself and i dont indulge in moonshine i am a director in one or two railroads i have talked this matter over with mr flint and incidentally with senator whitredge  knowed whitredge afore you had any teeth said mr braden who did not seem to be greatly impressed know him intimate whatd you go to flint for  we have interests in common said mr crewe and i am rather a close friend of his my going to the legislature will be i think to our mutual advantage  oought to have come right to me said mr braden leaning over until his face was in close proximity to mr crewes whitredge told you to come to me didnt he  mr crewe was a little taken aback  the senator mentioned your name he admitted  he knows said i was the man to see if you was a candidate didnt he told you to talk to job braden didnt he  now mr crewe had no means of knowing whether senator whitredge had been in conference with mr braden or not  the senator mentioned your name casually in some connection said mr crewe  he knows mr braden repeated with a finality that spoke volumes for the senators judgment and he bent over into mr crewes ear with the air of conveying a mild but wellmerited reproof youd ought to come right to me in the first place i could have saved you all that unnecessary trouble of seein folks there hasnt ben a representative left the town of leith for thirty years that i haint agreed to whitredge knows that if i say you kin go you kin go you understand said mr braden with his fingers on mr crewes knee once more  five minutes later mr crewe emerged into the dazzling sun of the ripton square climbed into his automobile and turned its head towards leith strangely forgetting the main engagement which he said had brought him to town     chapter viii the trials of an honourable  it was about this time that mr humphrey crewe was transformed by one of those subtle and inexplicable changes which occur in american politics into the honourable humphrey crewe and as interesting bits of news about important people are bound to leak out it became known in leith that he had subscribed to what is known as a clipping bureau two weeks after the day he left mr bradens presence in the ripton house the principal newspapers of the country contained the startling announcement that the wellknown summer colony of leith was to be represented in the state legislature by a millionaire the republican nomination which mr crewe had secured was equivalent to an election  for a little time after that mr crewe although naturally an important and busy man scarcely had time to nod to his friends on the road  poor dear humphrey said mrs pomfret who was so used to dropping in to dinner hasnt had a moment to write me a line to thank me for the statesmans diary i bought for him in london this spring theyre in that new red leather and aylestone says he finds his so useful i dropped in at wedderburn today to see if i could be of any help and the poor man was buttonholed by two reporters who had come all the way from new york to see him i hope he wont overdo it  it was true mr crewe was to appear in the sunday supplements are our millionaires entering politics mr crewe with his usual gracious hospitality showed the reporters over the place and gave them suggestions as to the best vantagepoints in which to plant their cameras he himself was at length prevailed upon to be taken in a rough homespun suit and with a walkingstick in his hand appraising with a knowing eye a flock of his own sheep pressed a little he consented to relate something of the systematic manner in which he had gone about to secure this nomination how he had visited in person the homes of his fellowtownsmen i knew them all anyway he is quoted as saying we have had the pleasantest of relationships during the many years i have been a resident of leith  beloved of his townspeople this part of the article was headed no these were not mr crewes wordshe was too modest for that when urged to give the name of one of his townsmen who might deal with this and other embarrassing topics mr ball was mentioned beloved of his townspeople was mr balls phrase although a multimillionaire no man is more considerate of the feelings and the rights of his more humble neighbours send him to the legislature wed send him to the united states senate if we could hell land there anyway such was a random estimate mr balls the reporters gathered on their way to ripton mr crewe did not hesitate to say that the prosperity of the farmers had risen as a result of his labours at wedderburn where the most improved machinery and methods were adopted his efforts to raise the agricultural as well as the moral and intellectual tone of the community had been unceasing  then followed an intelligent abstract of the bills he was to introducethe results of a progressive and statesmanlike brain there was an account of him as a methodical and painstaking business man whose suggestions to the boards of directors of which he was a member had been invaluable the article ended with a list of the clubs to which he belonged of the societies which he had organized and of those of which he was a memberand it might have been remarked by a discerning reader that most of these societies were state affairs finally there was a pen portrait of an apollo belvidere who wore the rough garb of a farmer on the days when the press was present  mr crewes incessant trials which would have taxed a less rugged nature did not end here about five oclock one afternoon a pleasantappearing gentleman with a mellifluous voice turned up who introduced himself as ex state senator grady the senator was from newcastle that city out of the mysterious depths of which so many political stars have arisen mr crewe cancelled a longdeferred engagement with mrs pomfret and invited the senator to stay to dinner the senator hesitated explained that he was just passing through ripton and as it was a pleasant afternoon had called to pay his respects but mr crewes wellknown hospitality would accept no excuses mr crewe opened a box of cigars which he had bought especially for the taste of state senators and a particular grade of scotch whiskey  they talked politics for four hours who would be governor the senator thought asa gray would the railroad was behind him mr crewe observed knowingly the senator remarked that mr crewe was no gosling mr crewe as politicalgeniuses will asked as many questions as the emperor of germanypertinent questions about state politics senator grady was tremendously impressed with his hosts programme of bills and went over them so painstakingly that mr crewe became more and more struck with senator gradys intelligence the senator told mr crewe that just such a man as he was needed to pull the state out of the rut into which she had fallen mr crewe said that he hoped to find such enlightened men in the legislature as the senator the senator let it be known that he had read the newspaper articles and had remarked that mr crewe was close to the president of the northeastern railroads  such a man as you said the senator looking at the remainder of the scotch whiskey will have the railroad behind you sure  one more drink said mr crewe  i must go said mr grady pouring it out but that reminds me it comes over me suddenlike as i sit here that you certainly ought to be in the new encyclopeedie of the prominent men of the state but sure you have received an application  it is probable that my secretary has one said mr crewe but he hasnt called it to my attention  you must get in that book mr crewe said the senator with an intense earnestness which gave the impression of alarm after what youve told me tonight ill see to it myself that you get in it may be that ive got some of the sample pages here if i havent left them at home said mr grady fumbling in an ample inside pocket and drawing forth a bundle sure here they are aint that luck for you listen asa p gray was born on the third of august eighteen fortyseven the seventh son of a farmer see theres a space in the end they left to fill up when hes elicted governor heres another the honourable hilary vane comes from one of the oldest puritan families in the state the vanes of camden street heres another the honourable brush bascom of putnam county is the son of poor but honourable parents look at the picture of him aint that a handsome steelengravin of the gentleman  mr crewe gazed contemplatively at the proof but was too busy with his own thoughts to reflect that there was evidently not much poor or honourable about mr bascom now  whos publishing this he asked  fogarty and company sure theyre the best publishers in the state as you know mr crewe they have the state printing wasnt it fortunate i had the proofs with me tim fogarty slipped them into me pocket when i was leavin newcastle the book is goin to press the day after eliction says he john says he you know i always rely on your judgment and if you happen to think of anybody between now and then who ought to go in youll notify me says he when i read the bills tonight and saw the scope of your work it came over me in a flash that humphrey crewe was the man they left out youll get a good man to write your life and what you done for the town and state and all them societies and bills wont you twould be a thousand pities not to have it right  how much does it cost mr crewe inquired  sure i forgot to ask tim fogarty mebbe he has it here i signed one myself but i couldnt afford the steelengravin yes he slipped one in two hundred dollars for a twopage biography and three hundred for the steelengravin five hundred dollars i didnt know it was so cheap as that exclaimed the senator and everybody in the state havin to own one in selfprotection you dont happen to have a pen about you  mr crewe waved the senator towards his own desk and mr grady filled out the blank  its lucky we are that i didnt drop in after eliction and the book in press he remarked and i hope youll give him a good photograph thiss for you ill take this to tim myself and he handed the pen for mr crewe to sign with  mr crewe read over the agreement carefully as a business man should before putting his signature to it and then the senator with renewed invitations for mr crewe to call on him when he came to newcastle took his departure afterwards mr crewe remained so long in reflection that his man waters became alarmed and sought him out and interrupted his revery  the next morning mrs pomfret who was merely driving by with her daughter alice and beatrice chillingham spied mr crewe walking about among the young trees he was growing near the road and occasionally tapping them with his stout stick she poked her coachman in the back and criedhumphrey youre such an important man now that i despair of ever seeing you again what was the matter last night  a politician from newcastle answered mr crewe continuing to tap the trees and without so much as a glance at alice  well if youre as important as this before youre elected i cant think what it will be afterwards mrs pomfret lamented poor dear humphrey is so conscientious when can you come humphrey  dont know said mr crewe ill try to come tonight but i may be stopped again heres waters now  the three people in mrs pomfrets victoria were considerably impressed to see the dignified waters hurrying down the slope from the house towards them mr crewe continued to tap the trees but drew a little nearer the carriage  if you please sir said waters theres a telephone call for you from newcastle its urgent sir  who is it  they wont give their names sir  all right said mr crewe and with a grin which spoke volumes for the manner in which he was harassed he started towards the housein no great hurry however reaching the instrument and saying hello in his usually gracious manner he was greeted by a voice with a decided hibernianamerican accent  am i talkin to mr crewe  yes  mr humphrey crewe  yesyes of course you are who are you  im the president of the paradise benevolent and military association mr crewe boys that work in the mills you know continued the voice caressingly sure youve heard of us were five hundred strong and all of us good republicans as the president were to have our annual fall outing the first of october in finney grove and wed like to have you come down  the first of october said mr crewe ill consult my engagement book  wed like to have a good picture of you in our programme mr crewe we hope youll oblige us youre such an important figure in state politics now youd ought to have a full page  there was a short silence  what does it cost mr crewe demanded  sure said the caressing voice of the president whatever you like  ill send you a check for five dollars and a picture said mr crewe  the answer to this was a hearty laugh which the telephone reproduced admirably the voice now lost a little of its caressing note and partook of a harder quality  youre a splendid humorist mr crewe five dollars wouldnt pay for the plate and the paper a gentleman like you could give us twentyfive and never know it was gone you wont be wanting to stop in the legislature mr crewe and we remember our friends in newcastle  very well ill see what i can do goodby ive got an engagement said mr crewe and slammed down the telephone he seated himself in his chair and the pensive mood so characteristic we are told of statesmen came over him once more  while these and other conferences and duties too numerous to mention were absorbing mr crewe he was not too busy to bear in mind the pleasure of those around him who had not received such an abundance of the worlds blessings as he the townspeople of leith were about to bestow on him their greatest gift what could he do to show his appreciation wrestling with this knotty problem a brilliant idea occurred to himhe would have a gardenparty invite everybody in town and admit them to the sanctities of wedderburn yes even of wedderburn house that they might behold with their own eyes the carved ivory elephants and other contents of glass cabinets which reeked of the sunday afternoons of youth being a man of action mr pardriff was summoned at once from leith and asked for his lowest price on eight hundred and fifty invitations and a notice of the party in the ripton record  goin to invite democrats too demanded mr pardriff glancing at the checklist  everybody said mr crewe with unparalleled generosity i wont draw any distinction between friends and enemies theyre all neighbours  and some of em might by accident vote the republican ticket mr pardriff retorted narrowing his eyes a little  mr crewe evidently thought this a negligible suggestion for he did not reply to it but presently asked for the political news in ripton  well said mr pardriff you know they tried to get austen vane to run for state senator dont you  vane why he aint a fullfledged lawyer yet ive hired him in an unimportant case who asked him to run  young tom gaylord and a delegation  he couldnt have got it said mr crewe  i dont know said mr pardriff he might have given billings a hustle for the nomination  you supported billings i noticed said mr crewe  mr pardriff winked an eye  im not ready to walk the ties when i go to newcastle he remarked and nat aint quite bankrupt yet the gaylords continued mr pardriff who always took the cynical view of a man of the world have had some row with the northeastern over lumber shipments i understand theyre goin to buck em for a franchise in the next legislature just to make it lively the gaylords aint exactly povertystricken but they might as well try to move sawanec mountain as the northeastern  it was a fact that young tom gaylord had approached austen vane with a delegation to request him to be a candidate for the republican nomination for the state senate in his district against the railroad candidate and austens late opponent the honourable nat billings it was a fact also that austen had invited the delegation to sit down although there were only two chairs and that a wrestling match had ensued with young tom in the progress of which one chair had been broken young tom thought it was time to fight the railroad and perceived in austen the elements of a rebel leader austen had undertaken to throw young tom out of a front window which was a large oldfashioned oneand after herculean efforts had actually got him on the ledge when something in the street caught his eye and made him desist abruptly the something was the vision of a young woman in a brown linen suit seated in a runabout and driving a horse almost as handsome as pepper  when the delegation after exhausting their mental and physical powers of persuasion had at length taken their departure in disgust austen opened mechanically a letter which had very much the appearance of an advertisement and bearing a onecent stamp it announced that a gardenparty would take place at wedderburn the home of the honourable humphrey crewe at a not very distant date and the honour of the bearers presence was requested refreshments would be served and the ripton band would dispense music below in small print were minute directions where to enter where to hitch your team and where to go out  austen was at a loss to know what fairy godmother had prompted mr crewe to send him an invitation the case of the injured horse not having advanced with noticeable rapidity nevertheless the prospect of the gardenparty dawned radiantly for him above what had hitherto been a rather gloomy horizon since the afternoon he had driven victoria to the hammonds he had had daily debates with an imaginary man in his own likeness who to the detriment of his reading of law sat across his table and argued with him the imaginary man was unprincipled and had no dignity but he had such influence over austen vane that he had induced him to drive twice within sight of fairview gate when austen vane had turned round again the imaginary man was for going to call on her and letting subsequent events take care of themselves austen vane had an uncomfortable quality of reducing a matter first of all to its simplest terms he knew that mr flints views were as fixed ineradicable and unchangeable as an epitaph cut in a granite monument he felt as mr flint had that their first conversation had been but a forerunner of a strife to come between them and add to this the facts that mr flint was very rich and austen vane poor that victorias friends were not his friends and that he had grave doubts that the interest she had evinced in him sprang from any other incentive than a desire to have communication with various types of humanity his hesitation as to entering mr flints house was natural enough  it was of a piece with mr crewes good fortune of getting what he wanted that the day of the gardenparty was the best that september could do in that country which is to say that it was very beautiful a pregnant stillness enwrapped the hills a haze shot with gold dust like the filmiest of veils softened the distant purple and the blueblack shadows under the pines austen awoke from his dream in this enchanted borderland to find himself in a long line of wagons filled with people in their sunday clothesthe men in black and the young women in white with gay streamers wending their way through the rearentrance drive of wedderburn where one of mr crewes sprucest employees was taking up the invitation cards like ticketsa precaution to prevent the rowdy element from ripton coming and eating up the refreshments austen obediently tied pepper in a field as he was directed and made his way by a path through the woods towards the house where the ripton band could be heard playing the second air in the programme dont you wish youd waited  for a really able account of that memorable entertainment see the ripton record of that week for we cannot hope to vie with mr pardriff when his heart is really in his work how describe the noble figure of mr crewe as it burst upon austen when he rounded the corner of the house clad in a roughandready manner with a gladstone collar to indicate the newly acquired statesmanship and fairly radiating geniality mr crewe stood at the foot of the steps while the guests made the circuit of the driveway and they carefully avoided in obedience to a warning sign the grass circle in the centre as man and wife confronted him mr crewe greeted them in hospitable but stentorian tones that rose above the strains of dont you wish youd waited it was mr ball who introduced his townspeople to the great man who was to represent them  how are you said mr crewe with his eyes on the geraniums mr and mrs perley wright eh make yourselves at home everythings freeyoull find the refreshments on the back porchjust have an eye to the signs posted round thats all and mr and mrs perley wright overwhelmed by such a welcome would pass on into a back eddy of neighbours where they would stick staring at a sign requesting them please not to pick the flowers  cant somebody stir em up mr crewe shouted in an interval when the band had stopped to gather strength for a new effort cant somebody move em round to see the cows and whats in the house and the automobile and the horses move around the driveway please its so hot here you cant breathe some of you wanted to see what was in the house nows your chance  this graceful appeal had some temporary effect but the congestion soon returned when a man of the hour appeared a man whose genius scattered the groups and who did more to make the party a success than any single individualmr hamilton tooting in a glorious white silk necktie with purple flowers  ill handle em mr crewe he said a little brainsll start em goin come along here mr wright and ill show you the best cows this side of the hudson riverall pedigreed prize winners hello aust you take hold and get the wimmenfolks interested in the cabinets you know where they are  theres a person with some sense remarked mrs pomfret who had been at a little distance among a group of summerresident ladies and watching the affair with shining eyes ill help come edith come victoria wheres victoriaand dear mrs chillingham we american women are so deplorably lacking in this kind of experience alice take some of the women into the garden im going to interest that dear benevolent man who looks so helpless and doing his best to have a good time  the dear benevolent man chanced to be mr job braden who was standing somewhat apart with his hands in his pockets he did not move as mrs pomfret approached him holding her glasses to her eyes  how are you exclaimed that lady extending a whitegloved hand with a cordiality that astonished her friends it is so pleasant to see you here mrmr  how be you said mr braden taking her fingers in the gingerly manner he would have handled one of mr crewes priceless curios the giraffe mr barnum had once brought to ripton was not half as interesting as this immaculate and mysterious production of foreign dressmakers and french maids but he refrained from betraying it his eye rested on the lorgnette  nearsighted be you he inquireda remark so unexpected that for the moment mrs pomfret was deprived of speech  i manage to see better withwith these she gasped when we get oldyou know  you haint old said mr braden gallantly if you be he added his eye travelling up and down the parisian curves i wouldnt have suspected itnot a mite  im afraid you are given to flattery mrmr she replied hurriedly whom have i the pleasure of speaking to  job bradens my name he answered but you have the advantage of me  how demanded the thoroughly bewildered mrs pomfret  i haint heard your name he said  oh im mrs pomfreta very old friend of mr crewes whenever he has his friends with him like this i come over and help him it is so difficult for a bachelor to entertain mr braden  well said mr braden bending alarmingly near her ear theres one way out of it  whats that said mrs pomfret  git married declared mr braden  how very clever you are mr braden i wish poor dear mr crewe would get marrieda wife could take so many burdens off his shoulders you dont know mr crewe very well do you  callate toso so said mr braden  mrs pomfret was at sea again  i mean do you see him often  seen him once said mr braden gguess thats enough  youre a shrewd judge of human nature mr braden she replied tapping him on the shoulder with the lorgnette but you can have no idea how good he ishow unceasingly he works for others he is not a man who gives much expression to his feelings as no doubt you have discovered but if you knew him as i do you would realize how much affection he has for his country neighbours and how much he has their welfare at heart  loves emdoes heloves em  he is like an english gentleman in his sense of responsibility said mrs pomfret over there you know it is a part of a country gentlemans duty to improve the condition of hishis neighbours and then mr crewe is so fond of his townspeople that he couldnt resist doing this for them and she indicated with a sweep of her eyeglasses the beatitude with which they were surrounded  wahnt no occasion to said mr braden  what cried mrs pomfret who had been walking on ice for some time  this haint englandis it haint england  no she admitted but  haint england said mr braden and leaned forward until he was within a very few inches of her pearl earring hell be chose all rightddont frethell be chose  my dear mr braden ive no doubt of itmr crewes so popular she cried removing her earring abruptly from the danger zone do make yourself at home she added and retired from mr bradens company a trifle disconcerteda new experience for mrs pomfret she wondered whether all country people were like mr braden but decided after another experiment or two that he was an original more than once during the afternoon she caught sight of him beaming upon the festivities around him but she did not renew the conversation  to austen vane wandering about the grounds mr crewes party presented a sociological problem of no small interest mr crewe himself interested him and he found himself speculating how far a man would go who charged the fastnesses of the politicians with a determination not to be denied and a bank account to be reckoned with austen talked to many of the leith farmers whom he had known from boyhood thanks to his custom of roaming the hills they were for the most part honest men whose occupation in life was the first thought and they were content to leave politics to mr bradenthat being his profession to the most intelligent of these mr crewes gardenparty was merely the wanton whim of a millionaire it was an open secret to them that job braden for reasons of his own had chosen mr crewe to represent them and they were mildly amused at the efforts of mrs pomfret and her assistants to secure votes which were as certain as the suns rising on the morrow  it was some time before austen came upon the object of his searchthough scarce admitting to himself that it had an object in greeting him after inquiring about his railroad case mr crewe had indicated with a wave of his hand the general direction of the refreshments but it was not until austen had tried in all other quarters that he made his way towards the porch where the lemonade and cake and sandwiches were it was after all the most popular place though to his mind the refreshments had little to do with its popularity from the outskirts of the crowd he perceived victoria presiding over the punchbowl that held the lemonade he liked to think of her as victoria the name had no familiarity for him but seemed rather to enhance the unattainable quality of her  surrounding victoria were several cleanlooking freckled and tanned young men of undergraduate age wearing straw hats with coloured ribbons who showed every eagerness to obey and even anticipate the orders she did not hesitate to give them her eye seemed continually on the alert for those of mr crewes guests who were too bashful to come forward and discerning them she would send one of her lieutenants forward with supplies sometimes she would go herself to the older people and once perceiving a tired woman holding a baby so many brought babies being unable to leave them victoria impulsively left her post and seized the woman by the arm  do come and sit down she cried theres a chair beside me and oh what a nice baby wont you let me hold him  why yes maam said the woman looking up at victoria with grateful patient eyes and then with awe at what seemed to her the priceless embroidery on victorias waist wont he spoil your dress  bless him no said victoria poking her finger into a dimplefor he was smiling at her what if he does and forthwith she seized him in her arms and bore him to the porch amidst the laughter of those who beheld her and sat him down on her knee in front of the lemonade bowl the tired mother beside her will a little lemonade hurt him just a very very little you know  why no maam said the mother  and just a teeny bit of cake begged victoria daintily breaking off a piece while the baby gurgled and snatched for it do tell me how old he is and how many more you have  hes eleven months on the twentyseventh said the mother and ive got four more she sighed her eyes wandering back to the embroidery what between them and the housework and the butter makin it haint easy be you married  no said victoria laughing and blushing a little  youll make a good wife for somebody said the woman i hope youll get a good man  i hope so too said victoria blushing still deeper amidst the laughter but there doesnt seem to be much chance of it and good men are very scarce  i guess youre right said the mother soberly not but what my mans good enough but he dont seem to get along somehow the farms wore out and the mortgage comes around so regular  where do you live asked victoria suddenly growing serious  fitchs place taint very far from the four corners on the avalon road  and you are mrs fitch  callate to be said the mother if it aint askin too much id like to know your name  im victoria flint i live not very far from the four cornersthat is about eight miles may i come over and see you sometime  although victoria said this very simply the mothers eyes widened until one might almost have said they expressed a kind of terror  land sakes alive be you mr flints daughter i might have knowed it from the lacethat dress must have cost a fortune but i didnt think to find you so common  victoria did not smile she had heard the word common so used before and knew that it was meant for a compliment and she turned to the woman with a very expressive light in her eyes  i will come to see youthis very week she said and just then her glance seemingly drawn in a certain direction met that of a tall young man which had been fixed upon her during the whole of this scene she coloured again abruptly handed the baby back to his mother and rose  im neglecting all these people she said but do sit there and rest yourself andhave some more lemonade  she bowed to austen and smiled a little as she filled the glasses but she did not beckon him she gave no further sign of her knowledge of his presence until he stood beside herand then she looked up at him  i have been looking for you miss flint he said  i suppose a man would never think of trying the obvious places first she replied hastings dont you see that poor old woman over there she looks so thirstygive her this  the boy addressed with a glance at austen did as he was bid and she sent off a second on another errand  let me help said austen seizing the cake and being seized at the same time by an unusual and inexplicable tremor of shyness thrust it at the baby  oh he cant have anymore do you want to kill him cried victoria seizing the plate and adding mischievously i dont believe youre of very much useafter all  then its time i learned said austen heres mr jenney im sure hell have a piece  well said mr jenney the same mr jenney of the apple orchard but holding out a horny hand with unmistakable warmth how be you austen looking about him mr jenney put his hand to his mouth and added didnt expect to see you trailin on to this here kite he took a piece of cake between his thumb and forefinger and glanced bashfully at victoria  have some lemonade mr jenney do she urged  well i dont care if i do he said just a little mite he did not attempt to stop her as she filled the glass to the brim but continued to regard her with a mixture of curiosity and admiration seen you nursin the baby and makin folks at home guess you have the knack of it bettern some i could mention  this was such a palpable stroke at their host that victoria laughed and made haste to turn the subject from herself  mr vane seems to be an old friend of yours she said  why said mr jenney laying his hand on austens shoulder i callate he is austens broke in moren one of my colts afore he went west and shot that feller hes as good a judge of horseflesh as any man in this part of the state hear tom gaylord and the boys wanted him to be state senator  why didnt you accept mr vane  because i dont think the boys could have elected me answered austen laughing  hes as popular a man as there is in the county declared mr jenney he was a mite wild as a boy but sence hes sobered down and won that case against the railrud he could get any office hed a mind to hes always adoin little things for folks austen is  diddid that case against the railroad make him so popular asked victoria glancing at austens broad backfor he had made his escape with the cake  i guess it helped considerable mr jenney admitted  why asked victoria  well it was a fearless thing to doplumb against his own interests with old hilary vane austens a bright lawyer and i have heard it said he was in line for his fathers place as counsel  dodo people dislike the railroad  mr jenney rubbed his beard thoughtfully he began to wonder who this young woman was and a racial caution seized him  well he said folks has an idea the railrud runs this state to suit themselves i guess they haint far wrong ive ben to the legislature and seen some signs of it why hilary vane himself has charge of the most considerable part of the politics who be you mr jenney demanded suddenly  im victoria flint said victoria  godfrey exclaimed mr jenney you dont say so i might have known itseen you on the rud more than once but i dont know all you rich folks apart wouldnt have spoke so frank if id knowed who you was  im glad you did mr jenney she answered i wanted to know what people think  well its almighty complicated said mr jenney shaking his head i dont know by rights what to think as long as ive said what i have ill say this that the politicians is all for the railrud and i haint got a mite of use for the politicians ill vote for a feller like austen vane every time if hell run and i know other folks that will  after mr jenney had left her victoria stood motionless gazing off into the haze until she was startled by the voice of hastings weare beside her  say victoria who is that man he asked  what man  hastings nodded towards austen who with a cake basket in his hand stood chatting with a group of country people on the edge of the porch  oh that man said victoria his names austen vane and hes a lawyer in ripton  all i can say is replied hastings with a light in his face hes one id like to tie to ill bet he could whip any four men you could pick out  considering that hastings had himself proposedalthough in a very mild formmore than once to victoria this was generous  i daresay he could she agreed absently  it isnt only the way hes built persisted hastings he looks as if he were going to be somebody some day introduce me to him will you  certainly said victoria mr vane she called i want to introduce an admirer mr hastings weare  i just wanted to know you said hastings reddening and victoriai mean miss flintsaid shed introduce me  im much obliged to her said austen smiling  are you in politics asked hastings  im afraid not answered austen with a glance at victoria  youre not helping humphrey crewe are you  no said austen and added with an illuminating smile mr crewe doesnt need any help  im glad youre not exclaimed the downright hastings with palpable relief in his voice that an idol had not been shattered i think humphreys a fakir and all this sort of thing tommyrot he wouldnt get my vote by giving me lemonade and cake and letting me look at his cows if you ever run for office id like to cast it for you my father is only a summer resident but since he has gone out of business he stays here till christmas and ill be twentyone in a year  austen had ceased to smile he was looking into the boys eyes with that serious expression which men and women found irresistible  thank you mr weare he said simply  hastings was suddenly overcome with the shyness of youth he held out his hand and said im awfully glad to have met you and fled  victoria who had looked on with a curious mixture of feelings turned to austen  that was a real tribute she said is this the way you affect everybody whom you meet  they were standing almost alone the sun was nearing the western hills beyond the river and people had for some time been wending their way towards the field where the horses were tied he did not answer her question but asked one instead  will you let me drive you home  do you think you deserve to after the shameful manner in which you have behaved  im quite sure that i dont deserve to he answered still looking down at her  if you did deserve to being a woman i probably shouldnt let you said victoria flashing a look upwards as it is you may  his face lighted but she halted in the grass with her hands behind her and stared at him with a puzzled expression  im sure youre a dangerous man she declared first you take in poor little hastings and now youre trying to take me in  then i wish i were still more dangerous he laughed for apparently i havent succeeded  i want to talk to you seriously said victoria that is the only reason im permitting you to drive me home  i am devoutly thankful for the reason then he saidmy horse is tied in the field  and arent you going to say goodby to your host and hostess  hostess he repeated puzzled  hostesses she corrected herself mrs pomfret and alice i thought you had eyes in your head she added with a fleeting glance at them  is crewe engaged to miss pomfret he asked  are all men simpletons said victoria he doesnt know it yet but he is  i think id know it if i were said austen with an emphasis that made her laugh  sometimes fish dont know theyre in a net untiluntil the morning after said victoria that has a horribly dissipated soundhasnt it i know to a moral certainty that mr crewe will eventually lead miss pomfret away from the altar at present she could not refrain from adding he thinks hes in love with some one else  who  it doesnt matter she replied humphreys perfectly happy because he believes most women are in love with him and hes making up his mind in that magnificent thorough way of his whether she is worthy to be endowed with his heart and hand his cows and all his stocks and bonds he doesnt know hes going to marry alice it almost makes one a calvinist doesnt it hes predestined but perfectly happy  who is he in love with demanded austen ungrammatically  im going to say goodby to him ill meet you in the field if you dont care to come its only manners after all although the lemonades all gone and i havent had a drop  ill go along too he said  arent you afraid of mrs pomfret  not a bit  i am said victoria but i think youd better come just the same  around the corner of the house they found themmr crewe urging the departing guests to remain and not to be bashful in the future about calling  we dont always have lemonade and cake he was saying but you can be sure of a welcome just the same goodby vane glad you came did they show you through the stables did you see the mate to the horse i lost beauty isnt he stir em up and get the money i guess we wont see much of each other politically youre antirailroad i dont believe that tackll workwe cant get along without corporations you know you ought to talk to flint ill give you a letter of introduction to him i dont know what id have done without that man tooting in your fathers office hes a wasted genius in ripton what goodby youll find your wagon i guess well victoria where have you been keeping yourself ive been so busy i havent had time to look for you youre going to stay to dinner and hastings and all the people who have helped  no im not answered victoria with a glance at austen before whom this announcement was so delicately made im going home  but when am i to see you cried mr crewe as near genuine alarm as he ever got you never let me see you i was going to drive you home in the motor by moonlight  we all know that youre the most original person victoria said mrs pomfret full of whims and strange fancies she added with the only brief look at austen she had deigned to bestow on him it never pays to count on you for twentyfour hours i suppose youre off on another wild expedition  i think ive earned the right to it said victoriaive poured lemonade for humphreys constituents the whole afternoon and besides i never said id stay for dinner im going home fathers leaving for california in the morning  hed better stay at home and look after her mrs pomfret remarked when victoria was out of hearing  since mrs harry haynes ran off one can never tell what a woman will do it wouldnt surprise me a bit if victoria eloped with a handsome nobody like that of course hes after her money but he wouldnt get it not if i know augustus flint  is he handsome said mr crewe as though the idea were a new one great scott i dont believe she gives him a thought shes only going as far as the field with him she insisted on leaving her horse there instead of putting him in the stable  catch alice going as far as the field with him said mrs pomfret but ive done my duty its none of my affair  in the meantime austen and victoria had walked on some distance in silence  i have an idea with whom mr crewe is in love he said at length  so have i replied victoria promptly humphreys in love with himself all he desires in a wifeif he desires oneis an inanimate and accommodating lookingglass in whom he may see what he conceives to be his own image daily james you may take the mare home im going to drive with mr vane  she stroked peppers nose while austen undid the hitchrope from around his neck  you and i are getting to be friends arent we pepper she asked as the horse with quivering nostrils thrust his head into her hand then she sprang lightly into the buggy by austens side the manner of these acts and the generous courage with which she defied opinion appealed to him so strongly that his heart was beating faster than peppers hoofbeats on the turf of the pasture  you are very good to come with me he said gravely when they had reached the road perhaps i ought not to have asked you  why she asked with one of her direct looks  it was undoubtedly selfish he said and added more lightly i dont wish to put you into mrs pomfrets bad graces  victoria laughed  she thought it her duty to tell father the time you drove me to the hammonds she said i asked you to do it  what did he say austen inquired looking straight ahead of him  he didnt say much she answered father never does i think he knows that i am to be trusted  even with me he asked quizzically but with a deeper significance  i dont think he realizes how dangerous you are she replied avoiding the issue the last time i saw you you were actually trying to throw a fat man out of your window what a violent life you lead mr vane i hope you havent shot any more people  i saw you he said  is that the way you spend your time in office hoursthrowing people out of the windows  it was only tom gaylord  hes the man mr jenney said wanted you to be a senator isnt he she asked  you have a good memory he answered her yes thats the reason i tried to throw him out of the window  why didnt you be a senator she asked abruptly i always think of you in public life why waste your opportunities  im not at all sure that was an opportunity it was only some of toms nonsense i should have had all the politicians in the district against me  but you arent the kind of man who would care about the politicians surely if humphrey crewe can get elected by the people i should think you might  i cant afford to give gardenparties and buy lemonade said austen and they both laughed he did not think it worth while mentioning mr braden  sometimes i think you havent a particle of ambition she said i like men with ambition  i shall try to cultivate it said austen  you seem to be popular enough  most worthless people are popular because they dont tread on anybodys toes  worthless people dont take up poor peoples suits and win them she said i saw zeb meader the other day and he said you could be president of the united states  zeb meant that i was eligiblehaving been born in this country said austen but where did you see him  ii went to see him  all the way to mercer  it isnt so far in an automobile she replied as though in excuse and added still more lamely zeb and i became great friends you know in the hospital  he did not answer but wondered the more at the simplicity and kindness in one brought up as she had been which prompted her to take the trouble to see the humblest of her friends nay to take the trouble to have humble friends  the road wound along a ridge and at intervals was spread before them the full glory of the september sunsetthe mountains of the west in blueblack silhouette against the saffron sky the myriad dappled clouds the crimson fading from the still reaches of the river and the winecolour from the eastern hills both were silent under the spell but a yearning arose within him when he glanced at the sunset glow on her face would sunsets hereafter bring sadness  his thoughts ran riot as the light faded in the west hers were not revealed and the silence between them seemed gradually to grow into a pact to become a subtler and more intimate element than speech a faint tang of autumn smoke was in the air a white mist crept along the running waters a silver moon like a newstamped coin rode triumphant in the sky impatient to proclaim her glory and the shadows under the ghostlike sentinel trees in the pastures grew blacker at last victoria looked at him  you are the only man i know who doesnt insist on talking she said there are times when  when there is nothing to say he suggested  she laughed softly he tried to remember the sound of it afterwards when he rehearsed this phase of the conversation but couldnt  its because you like the hills isnt it she asked you seem such an outofdoor person and mr jenney said you were always wandering about the countryside  mr jenney also made other reflections about my youth said austen  she laughed again acquiescing in his humour secretly thankful not to find him sentimental  mr jenney said something else thatthat i wanted to ask you about she went on breathing more deeply it was about the railroad  i am afraid you have not come to an authority he replied  you said the politicians would be against you if you tried to become a state senator do you believe that the politicians are owned by the railroad  has jenney been putting such things into your head  not only mr jenney buti have heard other people say that and humphrey crewe said that you hadnt a chance politically because you had opposed the railroad and had gone against your own interests  austen was amazed at this new exhibition of courage on her part though he was sorely pressed  humphrey crewe isnt much of an authority either he said briefly  then you wont tell me said victoria oh mr vane she cried with sudden vehemence if such things are going on here im sure my father doesnt know about them this is only one state and the railroad runs through so many he cant know everything and i have heard him say that he wasnt responsible for what the politicians did in his name if they are bad why dont you go to him and tell him so im sure hed listen to you  im sure hed think me a presumptuous idiot said austen politicians are not idealists anywherethe very word has become a term of reproach undoubtedly your father desires to set things right as much as any one elseprobably more than any one  oh i know he does exclaimed victoria  if politics are not all that they should be he went on somewhat grimly with an unpleasant feeling of hypocrisy we must remember that they are nobodys fault in particular and cant be set right in an instant by any one man no matter how powerful  she turned her face to him gratefully but he did not meet her look they were on the driveway of fairview  i suppose you think me very silly for asking such questions she said  no he answered gravely but politics are so intricate a subject that they are often not understood by those who are in the midst of them i admirei think it is very fine in you to want to know  you are not one of the men who would not wish a woman to know are you  no he said no im not  the note of pain in his voice surprised and troubled her they were almost in sight of the house  i asked you to come to fairview she said assuming a lightness of tone and you never appeared i thought it was horrid of you to forget after wed been such friends  i didnt forget replied austen  then you didnt want to come  he looked into her eyes and she dropped them  you will have to be the best judge of that he said  but what am i to think she persisted  think the best of me you can he answered as they drew up on the gravel before the open door of fairview house a man was standing in the moonlight on the porch  is that you victoria  yes father  i was getting worried said mr flint coming down on the driveway  im all right she said leaping out of the buggy mr vane brought me home  how are you hilary said mr flint  im austen vane mr flint said austen  how are you said mr flint as curtly as the barest politeness allowed what was the matter with your own horse victoria  nothing she replied after an instants pause austen wondered many times whether her lips had trembled mr vane asked me to drive with him and i came wontwont you come in mr vane  no thanks said austen im afraid i have to go back to ripton  goodby and thank you she said and gave him her hand as he pressed it he thought he felt the slightest pressure in return and then she fled up the steps as he drove away he turned once to look at the great house with its shades closely drawn as it stood amidst its setting of shrubbery silent under the moon  an hour later he sat in hanover street before the supper euphrasia had saved for him but though he tried nobly his heart was not in the relation for her benefit of mr crewes gardenparty     chapter ix mr crewe assaults the capital  those portions of the biographies of great men which deal with the small beginnings of careers are always eagerly devoured and for this reason the humble entry of mr crewe into politics may be of interest great revolutions have had their origins in back cellars great builders of railroads have begun life with packs on their shoulders trudging over the wilderness which they were to traverse in after years in private cars the history of napoleon bonaparte has not a sundayschool moral but we can trace therein the results of industry after the future emperor got started industry and the motto nil desperandum lived up to and the watchword thorough and a torch of unsuspected genius and laudace toujours laudace and a man may go far in life  mr humphrey crewe possessed as may have been surmised a dash of all these gifts for a summary of his character one would not have used the phrase as a contemporary of his remarked of a shrinking violet the phrase after all would have fitted very few great men genius is sure of itself and seeks its peers  the state capital is an old and beautiful and somewhat conservative town life there has its joys and sorrows and passions its ambitions and heartburnings to be sure a most absorbing novel could be written about it and the author need not go beyond the city limits or approach the statehouse or the pelican hotel the casual visitor in that capital leaves it with a sense of peace the echo of church bells in his ear and if in winter the impression of dazzling snow comedies do not necessarily require a wide stage nor tragedies an amphitheatre for their enactment  no casual visitor for instance would have suspected from the faces or remarks of the inhabitants whom he chanced to meet that there was excitement in the capital over the prospective arrival of mr humphrey crewe for the legislative session that winter legislative sessions be it known no longer took place in the summer a great relief to mr crewe and to farmers in general who wished to be at home in haying time  the capital abounded in comfortable homes and boasted not a dwellings of larger pretensions chief among these was the duncan housestill so called although mr duncan who built it had been dead these fifteen years and his daughter and heiress janet had married an italian marquis and lived in a roman palace rehabilitated by the duncan money mr duncan it may be recalled by some readers of coniston had been a notable man in his day who had married the heiress of the state and was president of the central railroad now absorbed in the united northeastern the house was a great square of brick with a wide cornice surrounded by a shaded lawn solidly built in the fashion of the days when rich people stayed at home with a conservatory and a library that had once been mr duncans pride the marchesa cared very little about the library or about the house for that matter a great aunt and uncle spinster and bachelor were living in it that winter and they vacated for mr crewe he travelled to the capital on the legislative pass the northeastern railroads had so kindly given him and brought down his horses and his secretary and servants from leith a few days before the first of january when the session was to open and laid out his bills for the betterment of the state on that library table where mr duncan had lovingly thumbed his folios mr crewe with characteristic promptitude set his secretary to work to make a list of the persons of influence in the town preparatory to a series of dinnerparties he dropped into the office of mr ridout the counsel of the northeastern and of the winona corporation in the capital to pay his respects as a man of affairs and incidentally to leave copies of his bills for the improvement of the state mr ridout was politely interested and promised to read the bills and agreed that they ought to pass  mr crewe also examined the pelican hotel so soon to be a hive and stood between the snowbanks in the capital park contemplating the statue of the great statesman there and repeating to himself the quotation inscribed beneath the peoples government made for the people made by the people and answerable to the people and he wondered idlyfor the day was not coldhow he would look upon a pedestal with the gladstone collar and the rough woollen coat that would lend themselves so readily to reproduction in marble stranger things had happened and grateful states had been known to reward benefactors  at length comes the gala night of nightsthe last of the old yearand the assembling of the five hundred legislators and of the army that is wont to attend them the afternoon trains steaming hot are crowded to the doors the station a scene of animation and main street dazzling in snow is alive with a stream of men with eddies here and there at the curbs and in the entries what handshaking and looking over of new faces and walking round and round what sightseeing by the country members and their wives who have come to attend the inauguration of the new governor the honourable asa p gray there he is with the whiskers and the tall hat and the comfortable face which wears already a look of gubernatorial dignity and power he stands for a moment in the lobby of the pelican hotelthronged now to suffocationto shake hands genially with new friends who are led up by old friends with two fingers on the elbow the old friends crack jokes and whisper in the ear of the governortobe who presently goes upstairs accompanied by the honourable hilary vane to the bridal suite which is reserved for him and which has fireproof carpet on the floor the honourable hilary has a room next door connecting with the new governors by folding doors but this fact is not generally known to country members only old timers like bijah bixby and job braden know that the honourable hilarys room corresponds to one which in the old pelican was called the throne room number seven where jethro bass sat in the old days and watched unceasingly the groups in the street from the window  but jethro bass has been dead these twenty years and his lieutenants shorn of power an empire has arisen out of the ashes of the ancient kingdoms bijah and job are old allpowerful still in clovelly and leithinfluential still in their own estimations still kicking up their heels behind still stuttering and whispering into ears still going along by when they are talking sly but there are no guerrillas now no condottieri who can be hired the empire has a paid and standing army as an empire should the north country chiefs so powerful in the clan warfare of bygone days are generals nowchiefs of staff the captaingeneral with a minute piece of honey dew under his tongue sits in number seven a new number sevenwith electric lights and a bathroom and a brass bed tempora mutantur there is an empire and a feudal system did one but know it the clans are part of the empire and each chief is responsible for his clandid one but know it one doesnt know it  the honourable brush bascom duke of putnam member of the house has arrived unostentatiouslyas is his customand is seated in his own headquarters number ten with a bathroom number nine belongs from year to year to mr manning division superintendent of that part of the northeastern which was the old centrala thin gentleman with sidewhiskers he loves life in the capital so much that he takes his vacations there in the winterduring the sessions of the legislaturepresumably because it is gay there are other rooms higher up of important men to be sure but to enter which it is not so much of an honour the honourable bill fleming postmaster of brampton in truro ephraim prescott being long since dead and brampton a large place now has his vacation during the session in room thirtysix no bathroom and the honourable elisha jane earl of haines county in the north country and united states consul somewhere is home on his annual vacation in room fiftynine no bath senator whitredge has a room and senator green and congressmen eldridge and fairplay no baths and only temporary  the five hundred who during the next three months are to register the laws find quarters as best they can not all of them are as luxurious as mr crewe in the duncan house or the honourable brush bascom in number ten of the pelican the rent of either of which would swallow the legislative salary in no time the honourable nat billings senator from the putnam county district is comfortably installed to be sure by gradual and unexplained degrees the constitution of the state has been changed until there are only twenty senators noble five hundred steadfast twenty  a careful perusal of the biographies of great men of the dynamic type leads one to the conclusion that much of their success is due to an assiduous improvement of every opportunityand mr humphrey crewe certainly possessed this quality also he is in the pelican hotel this evening meeting the men that count mr job braden who had come down with the idea that he might be of use in introducing the new member from leith to the notables was met by this remarkyou cant introduce me to any of emthey all know who i am just point any of em out you think i ought to know and ill go up and talk to em what come up to my house after a while and smoke a cigar the duncan house you knowthe big one with the conservatory  mr crewe was rightthey all knew him the leith millionaire the summer resident was a new factor in politics and the rumours of the size of his fortune had reached a highwater mark in the pelican hotel that evening pushing through the crowd in the corridor outside the bridal suite waiting to shake hands with the new governor mr crewe gained an entrance in no time and did not hesitate to interrupt the somewhat protracted felicitations of an irish member of the newcastle delegation  how are you governor he said with the bonhomie of a man of the world im humphrey crewe from leith you got a letter from me didnt you congratulating you upon your election we didnt do badly for you up there what  how do you do mr crewe said mr gray with dignified hospitality while their fingers slid over each others im glad to welcome you here ive noticed the interest youve taken in the state and the number of ahemvery useful societies to which you belong  good said mr crewe i do what i can i just dropped in to shake your hand and to say that i hope well pull together  the governor lifted his eyebrows a little  why i hope so im sere mr crewe said he  ive looked over the policy of the state for the last twenty years in regard to public improvements and the introduction of modern methods as concerns husbandry and i find it deplorable you and i governor live in a progressive age and we cant afford not to see something done what it is my desire to do what i can to help make your administration a notable advance upon those of your predecessors  whyi greatly appreciate it mr crewe said mr gray  im sure you do ive looked over your record and i find youve had experience in state affairs and that you are a successful and conservative business man that is the type we wanteh business men youve read over the bills i sent you by registered mail  ahem said mr gray ive been a good deal occupied since election day mr crewe  read em said mr crewe and ill call in on you at the statehouse day after tomorrow at five oclock promptly well discuss em governor and if by the light of your legislative experience you have any suggestions to make i shall be glad to hear em before putting the bills in their final shape ive taken the trouble to go over them with my friend mr flintour mutual friend let us say  ive had the pleasure of meeting mr flint said mr gray iahemcant say that i know him intimately  mr crewe looked at mr gray in a manner which plainly indicated that he was not an infant  my relations with mr flint and the northeastern have been very pleasant said mr crewe i may say that i am somewhat of a practical railroad and business man myself  we need such men said mr gray why how do you do cary how are the boys up in wheeler  well goodby governor see you day after tomorrow at five precisely said mr crewe  the next official call of mr crewe was on the speakertobe mr doby of hale for such matters are cut and dried but any amount of pounding on mr dobys door number seventyfive brought no response other rural members besides mr crewe came and pounded on that door and went away again but mr job braden suddenly appeared from another part of the corridor smiling benignly and apparently not resenting the refusal of his previous offers of help  wwant the speaker he inquired  mr crewe acknowledged that he did  ed only sleeps there said mr braden guess youll find him in the railroadroom  railroad room  hilary vanes number seven mr braden took hold of the lapel of his fellowtownsmans coat callated you didnt know it all he said thats the reason i come downsos to help you some  mr crewe although he was not wont to take a second place followed mr braden down the stairs to the door next to the governors where he pushed ahead of his guide through the group about the doorwaynone of whom however were attempting to enter they stared in some surprise at mr crewe as he flung open the door without knocking and slammed it behind him in mr bradens face but the bewilderment caused by this act of those without was as nothing to the astonishment of those withinhad mr crewe but known it an oil painting of the prominent men gathered about the marbletopped table in the centre of the room with an outline key beneath it would have been an appropriate work of art to hang in the statehouse as emblematic of the statesmanship of the past twenty years the honourable hilary vane sat at one end in a padded chair mr manning the division superintendent startled out of a meditation was upright on the end of the bed mr ridout the northeasterns capital lawyer was figuring at the other end of the table the honourable brush bascom was bending over a wide sadfaced gentleman of some two hundred and fifty pounds who sat at the centre in his shirtsleeves poring over numerous sheets in front of him which were covered with names of the five hundred this gentleman was the honourable edward doby of hale who with the kind assistance of the other gentlemen abovenamed was in this secluded spot making up a list of his committees undisturbed by eager country members at mr crewes entrance mr bascom with great presence of mind laid down his hat over the principal list while mr ridout taking the hint put the revised statutes on the other there was a short silence and the speakertobe whose pencil had been knocked out of his hand recovered himself sufficiently to relight an extremely frayed cigar  not that mr crewe was in the least abashed he chose this opportunity to make a survey of the situation nodded to mr ridout and walked up to the padded armchair  how are you mr vane he said i thought id drop in to shake hands with you especially as i have business with the speaker and heard he was here but im glad to have met you for many reasons i want you to be one of the vicepresidents of the state economic leagueit wont cost you anything ridout has agreed to let his name go on  the honourable hilary not being an emotional man merely grunted as he started to rise to his feet what he was about to say was interrupted by a timid knock and there followed another brief period of silence  it aint anybody said mr bascom and crossing the room turned the key in the lock the timid knock was repeated  i suppose youre constantly interrupted here by unimportant people mr crewe remarked  well said mr vane slowly boring into mr crewe with his eye that statement isnt far out of the way  i dont believe youve ever met me mr vane im humphrey crewe we have a good friend in common in mr flint  the honourable hilarys hand passed over mr crewes lightly  glad to meet you mr crewe he said and a faint twinkle appeared in his eye job has told everybody you were coming down glad to welcome a man of your ahemstamp into politics  im a plain business man answered mr crewe modestly and although i have considerable occupation i believe that one in my position has duties to perform ive certain bills  yes yes agreed the honourable hilary do you know mr brush bascom and mr manning allow me to introduce youand general doby  how are you general said mr crewe to the speakertobe im always glad to shake the hand of a veteran indeed i have thought that a society  i earned my title said general doby somewhat sheepishly fighting on governor browns staff there were twenty of us and we were resistless werent we brush  twenty on a staff exclaimed mr crewe  oh we furnished our own uniforms and paid our own wayexcept those of us who had passes declared the general as though the memory of his military career did not give him unalloyed pleasure whats the use of state sovereignty if you cant have a glittering army to follow the governor round  mr crewe had never considered this question and he was not the man to waste time in speculation  doubtless you got a letter from me general doby he said we did what we could up our way to put you in the speakers chair  general doby creased a little in the middle to signify that he was bowing  i trust it will be in my power to reciprocate mr crewe he replied  we want to treat mr crewe right mr bascom put in  you have probably made a note of my requests mr crewe continued i should like to be on the judiciary committee for one thing although i am not a lawyer i know something of the principles of law and i understand that this and the appropriations committee are the most important i may say with truth that i should be a useful member of that as i am accustomed to sitting on financial boards as my bills are of some considerable importance and deal with practical progressive measures i have no hesitation in asking for the chairmanship of public improvementsand of course a membership in the agricultural is essential as i have bills for them gentlemen he added to the room at large i have typewritten manifolds of those bills which i shall be happy to leave hereat headquarters and suiting the action to the word he put down a packet on the table  the honourable brush bascom accompanied by mr ridout walked to the window and stood staring at the glitter of the electric light on the snow the honourable hilary gazed steadily at the table while general doby blew his nose with painful violence  ill do what i can for you certainly mr crewe he said butwhat is to become of the other four hundred and ninetynine the ways of a speaker are hard mr crewe and i have to do justice to all  well answered mr crewe of course i dont want to be unreasonable and i realize the pressure thats put upon you but when you consider the importance of the work i came down here to do  i do consider it said the speaker politely its a little early to talk about the makeup of committees i hope to be able to get at them by sunday you may be sure ill do my best for you  wed better make a note of it said mr crewe give me some paper and he was reaching around behind general doby for one of the precious sheets under mr bascoms hat when the general with great presence of mind sat on it we have it from a malicious and untrustworthy source that the northeastern railroads paid for a new one  here here cried the speaker make the memorandum here  at this critical juncture a fortunate diversion occurred a rapthree timesof no uncertain quality was heard at the door and mr brush bascom hastened to open it a voice cried outis manning here the boys are hollering for those passes and a wiry sallow gentleman burst in none other than the honourable elisha jane who was taking his consular vacation when his eyes fell upon mr crewe he halted abruptly looked a little foolish and gave a questioning glance at the honourable hilary  mountain passes lish sit down did i ever tell you that story about the slide in rickets gulch asked the honourable brush bascom but first let me make you acquainted with mr humphrey crewe of leith mr crewe has come down here with the finest lot of bills you ever saw and were all going to take hold and put em through here lish ill give you a set  read em mr jane urged mr crewe i dont claim much for em but perhaps they will help to set a few little matters righti hope so  mr jane opened the bills with deliberation and cast his eyes over the headings  ill read em this very night mr crewe he said solemnly this meeting you is a particular pleasure and i have heard in many quarters of these measures  well admitted mr crewe they may help some i have a few other matters to attend to this evening so i must say goodnight gentlemen dont let me interfere with those i mountain passes mr manning  with this parting remark which proved him to be not merely an idealist in politics but a practical man mr crewe took his leave and he was too much occupied with his own thoughts to pay any attention to the click of the key as it turned in the lock or to hear united states senator whitredge rap three times on the door after he had turned the corner or to know that presently the sliding doors into the governors bridal suitewere to open a trifle large enough for the admission of the body of the honourable asa p gray  number seven still keeps up its reputation as the seat of benevolence and great public benefactors still meet there to discuss the welfare of their fellowmen the hallowed council chamber now of an empire seat of the governorgeneral of the state the honourable hilary vane and his advisers for years a benighted people with a fond belief in their participation of republican institutions had elected the noble five hundred of the house and the stanch twenty of the senate noble five hundreds biggest legislature in the world have come and gone debated applauded fought and on occasions denounced kicked over the traces and even weptto no avail behold that political institution of man representative government there it is on the stage curtain up a sublime spectacle for all men to see and thrill over speeches about the rights of man and the forefathers in the revolution about constituents who do not constitute the high heavens allow it and smile and it is well for the atoms that they think themselves free american representatives that they do not feel the string of predestination around their ankles the senatorial twenty from their high carved seats see the strings and smile too yes and see their own strings and smile wisdom does not wish for flight the people having changed the constitution the blackbirds are reduced from four and forty to a score this is cheaperfor the people  democracy on the front of the stage before an applauding audience performers absorbed in their parts forgetting that the landlord has to be paid in money yet to be earned behind the stage the real play the absorbing interest the high stakesoccasional discreet laughter through the peephole when an actor makes an impassioned appeal to the gods democracy in front the feudal system the dukes and earls behindbut in plain clothes democracy in stars and spangles and trappings and insignia or a better figure the fates weaving the web in that mystic chamber number seven pausing now and again to smile as a new thread is put in proclamations constitutions and creeds crumble before conditions the law of dividends is the high law and the forum an open vent through which the white steam may rise heavenward and be resolved again into water  mr crewe took his seat in the popular assemblage next day although most of the five hundred gave up theirs to the ladies who had come to hear his excellency deliver his inaugural the honourable asa made a splendid figure all agreed and read his speech in a firm and manly voice a large part of it was about the people some of it about the sacred government they had inherited from their forefathers still another concerned the high character and achievements of the inhabitants within the state lines the name of abraham lincoln was mentioned and with even greater reverence and fervour the republican party which had ennobled and enriched the peopleand incidentally elected the governor there was a noble financial policy a curtailment of expense the forests should be protected roads should be built and above all corporations should be held to a strict accounting  needless to say the speech gave great satisfaction to all and many old friends left the hall exclaiming that they didnt believe asa had it in him as a matter of fact known only to the initiated asa didnt have it in him until last night before he squeezed through the crack in the folding doors from room number six to room number seven the inspiration came to him then when he was ennobled by the governorgeneral who represents the empire perpetual governorgeneral who quickens into life puppet governors of his own choosing asa has agreed for the honour of the title of governor of his state to act the part open the fairs lend his magnificent voice to those phrases which it rounds so well it is fortunate when we smoke a fine cigar from havana that we cannot look into the factory the sight would disturb us it was well for the applauding deepbreathing audience in the statehouse that first of january that they did not have a glimpse in room number seven the night before under the sheets that contained the list of the speakers committees it was well that they could not go back to ripton into the offices on the square earlier in december where mr hamilton tooting was writing the noble part of that inaugural from memoranda given him by the honourable hilary vane yes the versatile mr tooting and none other doomed forever to hide the light of his genius under a bushel the financial part was written by the governorgeneral himselfthe honourable hilary vane and when it was all finished and revised it was put into a long envelope which bore this printed address augustus p flint prest united northeastern railroads new york and came back with certain annotations on the margin which were duly incorporated into it this is the private history which must never be told of the document which on january first became as far as fame and posterity is concerned the honourable asa p graysforever and forever  mr crewe liked the inaugural and was one of the first to tell mr gray so and to express his pleasure and appreciation of the fact that his request mailed in november had been complied with that the substance of his bills had been recommended in the governors programme  he did not pause to reflect on the maxim that platforms are made to get in by and inaugurals to get started by  although annual efforts have been made by various publicspirited citizens to build a new statehouse economywith assistance from room number seven has triumphed it is the same statehouse from the gallery of which poor william wetherell witnessed the drama of the woodchuck session although there are more members now for the population of the state has increased to five hundred thousand it is well for general doby with his two hundred and fifty pounds that he is in the speakers chair five hundred seats are a good many for that hall and painful in a long session the honourable brush bascom can stretch his legs because he is fortunate enough to have a front seat upon inquiry it turns out that mr bascom has had a front seat for the last twenty yearshe has been uniformly lucky in drawing the honourable jacob botcher ten years service is equally fortunate the honourable jake is a man of large presence and a voice that sounds as if it came oracularly from the caverns of the earth he is easily heard by the members on the back seats while mr bascom is not mr ridout the capital lawyer is in the house this year and singularly enough has a front seat likewise it was mr crewes misfortune to draw number 415 in the extreme corner of the room and next the steam radiator but he was not of the metal to accept tamely such a ticketing from the hat of destiny via the clerk of the house he complained as any man of spirit would and mr utter the polite clerk is profoundly sorryand says it maybe managed curiously enough the honourable brush bascom and the honourable jacob botcher join mr crewe in his complaint and reiterate that it is an outrage that a man of such ability and deserving prominence should be among the submerged four hundred and seventy it is managed in a mysterious manner we dont pretend to fathom and behold mr crewe in the front of the forum in the seats of the mighty where he can easily be pointed out from the gallery at the head of the five hundred between those shining leaders and parliamentarians the honourables brush bascom and jake botcher  for mr crewe has not come to the legislature like the country members in the rear to acquire a smattering of parliamentary procedure by the day the speaker is presented with a gold watch at the end of the session not he not the practical business man the member of boards the chairman and president of societies he has studied the rules of the house and parliamentary law you may be sure genius does not come unprepared and is rarely caught napping after the legislature adjourned that week the following telegram was sent over the wires     augustus p flint new york     kindly use your influence with doby to secure my committee    appointments important as per my conversation with you                         humphrey crewe  nor was mr crewe idle from saturday to monday night when the committees were to be announced he sent to the state tribune office for fifty copies of that valuable paper which contained a twocolumnandahalf article on mr crewe as a legislator and financier and citizen with a summary of his bills and an argument as to how the state would benefit by their adoption an accurate list of mr crewes societies was inserted and an account of his lifes history and of those ancestors of his who had been born or lived within the state indeed the accuracy of this article as a whole did great credit to the editor of the state tribune who must have spent a tremendous amount of painstaking research upon it and the article was so good that mr crewe regretted undoubtedly for the editors sake that a request could not be appended to it such as is used upon marriage and funeral notices new york boston and philadelphia papers please copy  mr crewe thought it his duty to remedy as much as possible the unfortunate limited circulation of the article and he spent as much as a whole day making out a list of friends and acquaintances whom he thought worthy to receive a copy of the tribunemarked personal victoria flint got one and read it to her father at the breakfast table mr flint did not open his austen vane wondered why any man in his obscure and helpless position should have been honoured but honoured he was he sent his to victoria too and was surprised to find that she knew his handwriting and wrote him a letter to thank him for it a letter which provoked on his part much laughter and elements of other sensations which according to charles reade should form the ingredients of a good novel but of this matter later  mrs pomfret and alice each got one and each wrote mr crewe appropriate congratulations alices answer supervised mrs chillingham got one the honourable hilary vane got onemarked in red ink lest he should have skipped it in his daily perusal of the paper mr brush bascom got one likewise but the list of mr crewes acquaintances is too long and too broad to dwell upon further in these pages  the mondaynight session came at last that sensational hour when the speaker makes those decisions to which he is supposed to have given birth over sunday in the seclusion of his country home at hale mondaynight sessions are as a rule confined in attendance to the honourable brush bascom and mr ridout and a few other conscientious members who do not believe in cheating the state but tonight all is bustle and confusion and at least four hundred members are pushing down the aisles and squeezing past each other into the narrow seats and reading the state tribune or the ringing words of the governors inaugural which they find in the racks on the back of the seats before them speaker doby who has been apparently deep in conference with the most important members among them mr crewe to whom he has whispered that a violent snowstorm is raging in hale raps for order and after a few preliminaries hands to mr utter the clerk amidst a breathless silence the paper on which the parliamentary career of so many ambitious statesmen depends  it is not a pleasure to record the perfidy of man nor the lack of judgment which prevents him in his circumscribed lights from recognizing undoubted geniuses when he sees them perhaps it was jealousy on general dobys part and a selfish desire to occupy the centre of the stage himself but at any rate we will pass hastily over the disagreeable portions of this narrative mr crewe settled himself with his feet extended and with a complacency which he had rightly earned by leaving no stone unturned to listen he sat up a little when the appropriations committee headed by the honourable jake botcher did not contain his namebut it might have been an oversight of mr utters when the judiciary mr ridouts committee was read it began to look like malice committee after committee was revealed and the name of humphrey crewe might not have been contained in the five hundred except as the twelfth member of forestry until it appeared at the top of national affairs here was a broad enough field certainlythe trusts the tariff the gold standard the foreign possessionsand mr crewes mind began to soar in spite of himself public improvements was reached and he straightened mr beck a railroad lawyer from belfast led it mr crewe arose as any man of spirit would and walked with dignity up the aisle and out of the house this deliberate attempt to crush genius would inevitably react on itself the honourable hilary vane and mr flint should be informed of it at once     chapter x for bills may come and bills may go  a man with a sense of humour once went to the capital as a member of the five hundred from his town and he never went back again one reason for this was that he died the following year literally the doctors said from laughing too much i know that this statement will be received incredulously and disputed by those who claim that laughter is a good thing the honourable gentleman died from too much of a good thing he was overpowered by having too much to laugh at and the undiscerning thought him a fool and the empire had no need of a court jester but many of his sayings have lived nevertheless he wrote a poem said to be a plagiarism which contains the quotation at the beginning of this chapter for bills may come and bills may go but i go on forever the first person singular is supposed to relate to the united northeastern railroads it was a poor joke at best  it is needless to say that the gentleman referred to had a back seat among the submerged four hundred and seventyand that he kept it no discerning and powerful wellwishers came forward and said to him friend go up higher he sat doubled up in number and the gods gave him compensation in laughter he disturbed the solons around him who were interested in what was going on in front and trying to do their duty to their constituents by learning parliamentary procedure before the speaker got his gold watch and shed tears over it  the gentleman who laughed and died is forgotten as he deserves to be and it never occurred to anybody that he might have been a philosopher after all there is something irresistibly funny about predestination about men who are striving and learning and soberly voting upon measures with which they have as little to do as guineapigs there were certain wise and cynical atheists who did not attend the sessions at all except when they received mysterious hints to do so these were chiefly from newcastle and there were others who played poker in the statehouse cellar waiting for the word to come to them when they went up and voted prudently counting their chips before they did so and descended again the man with a sense of humour laughed at these too and at the twenty blackbirds in the senatebut not so heartily he laughed at their gravity for no gravity can equal that of gentlemen who play with stacked cards  the risible gentleman laughed at the proposed legislation about which he made the song and he likened it to a stream that rises hopefully in the mountains and takes its way singing at the prospect of reaching the ocean but presently flows into a hole in the ground to fill the forgotten caverns of the earth and is lost to the knowledge and sight of man the caverns he labelled respectively appropriations railroad judiciary and their guardians were unmistakably the honourables messrs bascom botcher and ridout the greatest cavern of all he called the senate  if you listen you can hear the music of the stream of bills as it is rising hopefully and flowing now mr crewe of leith gives notice that on tomorrow or some subsequent day he will introduce a bill entitled an act for the improvement of the state highways mr crewe of leith gives notice etc an act for the improvement of the practice of agriculture an act relating to the state indebtedness an act to increase the state forest area an act to incorporate the state economic league an act to incorporate the state childrens charities association an act in relation to abandoned farms these were some of the most important and they were duly introduced on the morrow and gravely referred by the speaker to various committees as might be expected a man whose watchword is thorough immediately got a list of those committees and lost no time in hunting up the chairmen and the various available members thereof  as a man of spirit also mr crewe wrote to mr flint protesting as to the manner in which he had been treated concerning committees in the course of a week he received a kind but necessarily brief letter from the northeasterns president to remind him that he persisted in a fallacy as a neighbour mr flint would help him to the extent of his power but the northeastern railroads could not interfere in legislative or political matters mr crewe was naturally pained by the lack of confidence of his friend it seems useless to reiterate that he was far from being a fool and no man could be in the capital a day during the session without being told of the existence of number seven no matter how little the informant might know of what might be going on there mr crewe had been fortunate enough to see the inside of that mysterious room and being a sufficiently clever man to realize the importance and necessity of government by corporations had been shocked at nothing he had seen or heard however had he had a glimpse of the speakers lists under the hopelessly crushed hat of mr bascom perhaps he might have been shocked after all  it was about this time that a touching friendship began which ought in justice to be briefly chronicled it was impossible for the honourable brush bascom and the honourable jacob botcher to have mr crewe sitting between them and not conceive a strong affection for him the honourable brush though not given to expressing his feelings betrayed some surprise at the volumes mr crewe had contributed to the stream of bills and mr botcher in a delphic whisper invited mr crewe to visit him in room fortyeight of the pelican that evening to tell the truth mr crewe returned the feeling of his companions warmly and he had even entertained the idea of asking them both to dine with him that evening  number fortyeight the honourable jakes was a freeandeasy democratic resort no three knocks and a password before you turn the key here almost before your knuckles hit the panel you heard mr botchers hearty voice shouting come in in spite of the closed transom the honourable jake being a teetotaller had no bathroom and none but his intimate friends ever looked in the third from the top bureau drawer  the proprietor of the pelican who in common with the rest of humanity had fallen a victim to the rough and honest charms and hearty good fellowship of the honourable jake always placed a large padded armchair in number fortyeight before the sessions knowing that the honourable jakes constituency would be uniformly kind to him there mr botcher was wont to sit when he was not depressing one of the tiles in the rotunda surrounded by his friends and their tobacco smoke discussing in his frank and manly fashion the public questions of the day  mr crewe thought it a little strange that whenever he entered a room in the pelican a silence should succeed the buzz of talk which he had heard through the closed transom but he very naturally attributed this to the constraint which ordinary men would be likely to feel in his presence in the mouth of one presumptuous member the word railroad was cut in two by an agate glance from the honourable brush and mr crewe noted with some surprise that the democratic leader of the house mr painter was seated on mr botchers mattress with an expression that was in singular contrast to the look of bold defiance which he had swept over the house that afternoon in announcing his opposition policy the vulgar political suggestion might have crept into a more trivial mind than mr crewes that mr painter was being put to bed the bed being very similar to that of procrustes mr botcher extracted himself from the nooks and crannies of his armchair  how are you crewe he said hospitably were all friends hereeh painter we dont carry our quarrels outside the swinging doors you know mr creweby sight of course do you know these other gentlemen crewe i didnt expect you so early  the other gentlemen said that they were happy to make the acquaintance of their fellowmember from leith and seemingly with one consent began to edge towards the door  dont go boys mr bascom protested let me finish that story  some of the boys seemed to regard this statement as humorousmore humorous indeed than the story itself and when it was finished they took their departure a trifle awkwardly led by mr painter  theyre a little mite bashful said mr botcher apologetically  how many more of those bills have you got demanded mr bascom from the steam radiator with characteristic directness  i put em all in this morning said mr crewe but i have thought since of two or three other conditions which might be benefited by legislation  well said mr bascom kindly if you have any more i was going to suggest that you distribute em round among the boys thats the way i do and most folks dont guess theyre your bills see  what harm is there in that demanded mr crewe im not ashamed of em  brush was only lookin at it from the point of view of gettin em through honest mr botcher put in in stentorian tones it doesnt do for a new member to be thought a hog about legislation  now the honourable jacob only meant this in the kindest manner as we know and to give inexperience a hint from wellintentioned experience on the other hand mr crewe had a dignity and a position to uphold he was a personality people who went too far with him were apt to be rebuked by a certain glassy quality in his eye and this now caused the honourable jake to draw back perceptibly  i see no reason why a publicspirited man should be open to such an imputation said mr crewe  certainly not certainly not said mr botcher in stentorian tones of apology i was only trying to give you a little friendly advice but i may have put it too strong brush and ii may as well be plain about it mr crewehave taken a liking to you couldnt help it sir sitting next to you as we do we take an interest in your career and we dont want you to make any mistakes aint that about it brush  thats about it said mr bascom  mr crewe was to big a man not to perceive and appreciate the sterling philanthropy which lay beneath the exteriors of his new friends who scorned to flatter him  i understand the spirit in which your advice is given gentlemen he replied magnanimously and i appreciate it we are all working for the same things and we all believe that they must be brought about in the same practical way for instance we know as practical men that the railroad pays a large tax in this state and that property must take a handa very considerable handin legislation you gentlemen as important factors in the republican organization are loyal toerthat property and perhaps for wholly desirable reasons cannot bring forward too many bills under your own names whereas i  at this point in mr crewes remarks the honourable jacob botcher was seized by an appalling coughing fit which threatened to break his armchair probably owing to the fact that he had swallowed something which he had in his mouth the wrong way mr bascom assisted by mr crewe pounded him relentlessly on the back  i read that article in the tribune about you with great interest said mr bascom when mr botchers coughing had subsided i had no idea you were soahemwell equipped for a political career but what we wanted to speak to you about was this he continued as mr crewe showed signs of breaking in those committee appointments you desired  yes said mr crewe with some pardonable heat the speaker doesnt seem to know which side his breads buttered on  what i was going to say proceeded mr bascom was that general doby is a pretty good fellow personally i happen to know that the general feels very badly that he couldnt give you what you wanted he took a shine to you that night you saw him  yes mr botcher agreed for he had quite recovered the general felt badfeels bad i should say he perceived that you were a man of ability sir  and that was just the reason said the honourable brush that he couldnt make you more useful just now  theres a good deal of jealousy my dear sir against young members of ability said mr botcher in his most oracular and impressive tones the competition amongst thoseerwho have served the party is very keen for the positions you desired i personally happen to know that the general had you on the judiciary and appropriations and that some of yourerwellwishers persuaded him to take you off for your own good  it wouldnt do for the party leaders to make you too prominent all at once said mr bascom you are bound to take an active part in what passes here the general said at all events i will give mr crewe one chairmanship by which he can make a name for himself suited to his talents and he insisted on giving you in spite of some remonstrances from your friends national affairs the general urged rightly that with your broad view and knowledge of national policy it was his duty to put you in that place whatever people might say  mr crewe listened to these explanations in some surprise and being a rational man had to confess that they weremore or less reasonable  scarcely any bills come before that committee he objected  ah replied mr bascom that is true but the chairman of that committee is generally supposed to be in line forernational honours it has not always happened in the past because the men have not proved worthy but the opportunity is always given to that chairman to make a speech upon national affairs which is listened to with the deepest interest  is that so said mr crewe he wanted to be of service as we know he was a man of ideas and the opening sentences of the speech were already occurring to him  lets go upstairs and see the general now suggested mr botcher smiling that such a happy thought should have occurred to him  why i guess we couldnt do any better mr bascom agreed  well said mr crewe im willing to hear what hes got to say anyway  taking advantage of this generous concession mr botcher hastily locked the door and led the way up the stairway to number seventyfive after a knock or two here the door opened a crack disclosing instead of general dobys cherubic countenance a sallow face with an exceedingly pointed nose the owner of these features having only mr botcher in his line of vision made what was perhaps an unguarded remark  hello jake the generals in number ninemanning sent for him about half an hour ago  it was mr botcher himself who almost closed the door on the gentlemans sharp nose and took mr crewes arm confidingly  well go up to the desk and see doby in the morninghes busy said the honourable jake  whats the matter with seeing him now mr crewe demanded i know manning hes the division superintendent isnt he  mr botcher and mr bascom exchanged glances  why yes said mr bascom yes he is hes a great friend of general dobys and their wives are great friends  intimate friends sir said the honourable jake  well said mr crewe we wont bother em but a moment  it was he who led the way now briskly the honourable brush and the honourable jake pressing closely after him it was mr crewe who without pausing to knock pushed open the door of number nine which was not quite closed and it was mr crewe who made the important discovery that the lugubrious division superintendent had a sense of humour mr manning was seated at a marbletopped table writing on a salmoncoloured card in the act of pronouncing these wordsfor mr speaker and mrs speaker and all the little speakers to new york and return  mr speaker doby standing before the marbletopped table with his hands in his pockets heard the noise behind him and turned and a mournful expression spread over his countenance  dont mind me said mr crewe waving a hand in the direction of the salmoncoloured tickets i hope you have a good time general when do you go  why exclaimed the speaker how are you mr crewe how are you its only one of mannings little jokes  thats all right general said mr crewe i havent been a director in railroads for nothing im not as green as he thinks am i mr manning  it never struck me that green was your colour mr crewe answered the division superintendent smiling a little as he tore the tickets into bits and put them in the wastebasket  well said mr crewe you neednt have torn em up on my account i travel on the pass which the northeastern gives me as a legislator and im thinking seriously of getting mr flint to send me an annual now that im in politics and have to cover the state  we thought you were a reformer mr crewe the honourable brush bascom remarked  i am a practical man said mr crewe a railroad man a business mark and as such i try to see things as they are  well said general doby who by this time had regained his usual genial air of composure im glad you said that mr crewe as these gentlemen will tell you if id had my wish id have had you on every important committee in the house  chairman of every important committee general corrected the honourable jacob botcher  yes chairman of em assented the general after a glance at mr crewes countenance to see how this statement fared but the fact is the boys are all jealous of youon the quiet i suppose you suspected something of the kind  i should have imagined there might be some little feeling mr crewe assented modestly  exactly cried the general and i had to combat that feeling when i insisted upon putting you at the head of national affairs it does not do for a new member whatever his prominence in the financial world to be pushed forward too quickly and unless i am mighty mistaken mr crewe he added with his hand on the new members shoulder you will make yourself felt without any boosting from me  i did not come here to remain idle general answered mr crewe considerably mollified  certainly not said the general and i say to some of those men keep your eye on the gentleman who is chairman of national affairs  after a little more of this desultory and pleasant talk during which recourse was had to the bathroom for several tall and thin glasses ranged on the shelf there mr crewe took his departure in a most equable frame of mind and when the door was closed and locked behind him mr manning dipped his pen in the ink once more produced from a drawer in the table the salmoncoloured tickets and glanced again at the general with a smile  for mr speaker and mrs speaker and all the little speakers to new york and return     book 2     chapter xi the hopper  it is certainly not the function of a romance to relate with the exactness of a house journal the proceedings of a legislature somebody has likened the statehouse to pioneer kentucky a dark and bloody ground over which the battles of selfish interests ebbed and flowedno place for an innocent and unselfish bystander like mr crewe who desired only to make of his state an utopia whose measures were for the public goodnot his own but if any politician were fatuous enough to believe that humphrey crewe was a man to introduce bills and calmly await their fate a man who like senator sanderson only came down to the capital when he was notified by telegram that politician was entirely mistaken  no sooner had his bills been assigned to the careful and just consideration of the committees in charge of the honourable brush bascom mr botcher and others than mr crewe desired of each a day for a hearing every member of the five hundred was provided with a copy nay nearly every member was personally appealed to to appear and speak for the measures foresters road builders and agriculturists expenses paid were sent for from other states mr ball and others came down from leith and gentlemen who for a generation had written letters to the newspapers turned up from other localities in two cases the largest committee rooms proved too small for the gathering which was the result of mr crewes energy and the legislative hall had to be lighted the state tribune gave column reports of the hearings and little editorial pushes besides and yet when all was over when it had been proved beyond a doubt that if the state would consent to spend a little money she would take the foremost rank among her forty odd sisters for progression the bills were still under consideration by those hardheaded statesmen mr bascom and mr botcher and their associates  it could not be because these gentlemen did not know the arguments and see the necessity mr crewe had had them to dinner and had spent so much time in their company presenting his caseto which they absolutely agreedthat they took to a forced seclusion the member from leith also wrote letters and telegrams and sent long typewritten arguments and documents to mr flint mr crewe although far from discouraged began to think there was something mysterious about all this seemingly unnecessary deliberation  mr crewe though of great discernment was only mortal and while he was fighting his battle singlehanded how was he to know that the gods above him were taking sides and preparing for conflict the gods do not give out their declarations of war for publication to the associated press and old tom gaylord who may be likened to mars had no intention of sending jupiter notice until he got his cohorts into line the strife because it was to be internecine was the more terrible hitherto the gaylord lumber company like the winona manufacturing company of newcastle the mills of which extended for miles along the tyne had been a faithful ally of the empire and on occasions when it was needed had borrowed the imperial army to obtain grants extensions and franchises  the fact is that old tom gaylord in the autumn previous had quarreled with mr flint about lumber rates which had been steadily rising mr flint had been polite but firm and old tom who with all his tremendous properties could ship by no other railroad than the northeastern had left the new york office in a black rage a more innocent citizen than old tom would have put his case which was without doubt a strong one before the railroad commission of the state but old tom knew well enough that the railroad commission was in reality an economy board of the northeastern system as much under mr flints orders as the conductors and brakemen old tom in consulting the map conceived an unheardof effrontery a high treason which took away the breath of his secretary and treasurer when it was pointed out to him the plan contemplated a line of railroad from the heart of the lumber regions down the south side of the valley of the pingsquit to kingston where the lumber could take to the sea in short it was a pernicious revival of an obsolete state of affairs competition and if persisted in involved nothing less than a fight to a finish with the army the lobby of the northeastern other favoured beings stood aghast when they heard of it and hastened to old tom with timely counsel but he had reached a frame of mind which they knew well he would listen to no reason and maintained stoutly that there were other lawyers in the world as able in political sagacity and lobby tactics as hilary vane the honourable galusha hammer for instance an old and independent and wary warhorse who had more than once wrung compromises out of the honourable hilary the honourable galusha hammer was sent for and was now industriously if quietly and unobtrusively at work the honourable hilary was likewise at work equally quietly and unobtrusively when the powers fall out they do not open up at once with longdistance artillery there is always a chance of a friendly settlement the news was worth a good deal for instance to mr peter pardriff brother of paul of ripton who refrained with praiseworthy selfcontrol from publishing it in the state tribune although the temptation to do so must have been great and most of the senatorial twenty saw the trouble coming and braced their backs against it but in silence the capital had seen no such war as this since the days of jethro bass  in the meantime mr crewe blissfully ignorant of this impending conflict was preparing a speech on national affairs and national issues which was to startle an unsuspecting state mrs pomfret who had received many clippings and pamphlets had written him weekly letters of a nature spurring to his ambition which incidentally contained many references to alices interest in his career and mr crewes mind when not intent upon affairs of state sometimes reverted pleasantly to thoughts of victoria flint it occurred to him that the duncan house was large enough for entertaining and that he might invite mrs pomfret to bring victoria and the inevitable alice to hear his oration for which mr speaker doby had set a day  in his desire to give other people pleasure mr crewe took the trouble to notify a great many of his friends and acquaintances as to the day of his speech in case they might wish to travel to the state capital and hear him deliver it having unexpectedly received in the mail a cheque from austen vane in settlement of the case of the injured horse austen was likewise invited  austen smiled when he opened the letter and with its businesslike contents there seemed to be wafted from it the perfume and suppliance of a september day in the vale of the blue from the window of his back office looking across the railroad tracks he could see sawanec pale in her winter garb against a pale winter sky and there arose in him the old restless desire for the woods and fields which at times was almost irresistible his thoughts at length descending from the azure above sawanec his eyes fell again on mr crewes typewritten words it may be of interest to you that i am to deliver on the 15th instant and as the chairman of the house committee on national affairs a speech upon national policies which is the result of much thought and which touches upon such material needs of our state as can be supplied by the federal government  austen had a brief fancy whimsical as it was of going to hear him mr crewe as a type absolutely new to him interested him he had followed the unusual and somewhat surprising career of the gentleman from leith with some care even to the extent of reading of mr crewes activities in the state tribunes which had been sent him were such qualifications as mr crewe possessed he wondered of a kind to sweep their possessor into high office were industry persistency and a capacity for taking advantage of a fair wind sufficient  since his return from pepper county austen vane had never been to the state capital during a session although it was common for young lawyers to have cases before the legislature it would have been difficult to say why he did not take these cases aside from the fact that they were not very remunerative on occasions gentlemen from different parts of the state and some from outside of it who had certain favours to ask at the hands of the lawmaking body had visited his back office and closed the door after them and in the course of the conversation had referred to the relationship of the young lawyer to hilary vane at such times austen would freely acknowledge the debt of gratitude he owed his father for being in the worldand refer them politely to mr hilary vane himself in most cases they had followed his advice wondering not a little at this isolated example of quixotism  during the sessions except for a day or two at week ends which were often occupied with conferences the honourable hilarys office was deserted or rather as we have seen his headquarters were removed to room number seven in the pelican hotel at the capital austen got many of the lay clients who came to see his father at such times andwithout giving an exaggerated idea of his incomeit might be said that he was beginning to have what may be called a snug practice for a lawyer of his experience in other words according to mr tooting who took an intense interest in the matter not wearing the collar had been more of a financial success for austen than that gentleman had imagined there proved to be many clients to whom the fact that young mr vane did not carry a retainer pass actually appealed these clients paid their bills but they were neither large nor influential as a rule with the notable exception of the gaylord lumber company where the matters for trial were not large if young tom gaylord had had his way austen would have been the chief counsel for the corporation  to tell the truth austen vane had a secret aversion to going to the capital during a session a feeling that such a visit would cause him unhappiness in spite of his efforts and indeed in spite of hilarys austen and his father had grown steadily apart they met in the office hallway in the house in hanover street when hilary came home to sleep and the elder mr vane was not a man to thrive on small talk his world was the battlefield from which he directed the forces of the great corporation which he served and the cherished vision of a son in whom he could confide his plans upon whose aid and counsel he could lean was gone forever hilary vane had troublesome halfhours but on the whole he had reached the conclusion that this son like sarah austen was one of those inexplicable products in which an extravagant and inscrutable nature sometimes indulged on the rare evenings when the two were at home together the honourable hilary sat under one side of the lamp with a pile of documents and newspapers and austen under the other with a book from the circulating library no public questions could be broached upon which they were not as far apart as the poles and the honourable hilary put literature in the same category as embroidery euphrasia when she paused in her bodily activity to darn their stockings used to glance at them covertly from time to time and many a silent tear of which they knew nothing fell on her needle  on the subject of his protracted weekly absences at the state capital the honourable hilary was as uncommunicative as he would have been had he retired for those periods to a barroom he often grunted and cleared his throat and glanced at his son when their talk bordered upon these absences and he was even conscious of an extreme irritation against himself as well as austen because of the instinct that bade him keep silent he told himself fiercely that he had nothing to be ashamed of nor would he have acknowledged that it was a kind of shame that bade him refrain even from circumstantial accounts of what went on in room number seven of the pelican he had an idea that austen knew and silently condemned and how extremely maddening was this feeling to the honourable hilary may well be imagined all his life long he had deemed himself morally invulnerable and now to be judged and ethically found wanting by the son of sarah austen was at times almost insupportable were the standards of a long life to be suddenly reversed by a prodigal son  to get back to austen on st valentines day of that year when to tell the truth he was seated in his office scribbling certain descriptions of nature suggested by the valentines in mr haymans stationery store the postman brought in a letter from young tom gaylord austen laughed as he read it the honourable galusha hammer is well named young tom wrote but the conviction has been gaining ground with me that a hammer is about as much use as a shovel would be at the present time it is not the proper instrument but the old man it was thus young tom was wont to designate his parent is pigheaded when he gets to fighting and wont listen to reason if he believes he can lick the northeastern with a hammer he is durned badly mistaken and i told him so i have been giving him sage advice in little dropsafter meals i tell him there is only one man in the state who has sense enough even to shake the northeastern and thats you he thinks this a pretty good joke of course i realize where your old man is planted and that you might have some natural delicacy and wish to refrain from giving him a jar but come down for an hour and let me talk to you anyway the new statesman from leith is cutting a wide swath not a day passes but his voice is heard roaring in the forum he has visited all the state institutions dined and wined the governor and his staff and all the exgovernors he can lay his hands on and he has that hardheaded and caustic journalist mr peter pardriff of the state tribune hypnotized he has some swells up at his house to hear his speech on national affairs among them old flints daughter who is a ripper to look at although i never got nearer to her than across the street as you may guess it is something of a card for crewe to have flints daughter here  austen sat for a long time after reading this letter idly watching the snowclouds gathering around sawanec then he tore up the paper on which he had been scribbling into very small bits consulted a timetable and at noon in a tumult of feelings he found himself in a back seat of the express bound for the capital  arriving at the station amidst a hurry and bustle of legislators and politicians coming and going many of whom nodded to him he stood for a minute in the whirling snow reflecting now that he was here where was he to stay the idea of spending the night at the pelican was repellent to him and he was hesitating between two more modest hostelries when he was hailed by a giant with a flowing white beard a weatherbeaten face and a clear eye that shone with a steady and kindly light it was james redbrook the member from mercer  why how be you austen he cried extending a welcome hand and when austen had told him his dilemma come right along up to my lodgings i live at the widow peasleys and theres a vacant room next to mine  austen accepted gratefully and as they trudged through the storm up the hill he inquired how legislative matters were progressing whereupon mr redbrook unburdened himself  say i just warmed up all over when i see you austen im so glad to run across an honest man we aint forgot in mercer what you did for zeb meader and how you went against your interests and i guess it aint done you any harm in the state as many as thirty or forty members have spoke to me about it and down here ive got so i just cant hold in any more  is it as bad as that mr redbrook asked austen with a serious glance at the farmers face  its so bad i dont know how to begin said the member from mercer and paused suddenly but i dont want to hurt your feelings austen seeing your father iswhere he is  go on said austen i understand  well said mr redbrook it just makes me tremble as an american citizen the railrud sends them slick cusses down here that sit in the front seats who know all this here parliamentary law and the tricks of the trade and every time any of us gets up to speak our honest minds they have us ruled out of order or get the thing laid on the table until some friday morning when there aint nobody here and send it along up to the senate they made that fat feller doby speaker and hes stuffed all the important committees so that you cant get an honest measure considered you can talk to the committees all youve a mind to and theyll just listen and never do anything theres five hundred in the house and it aint any more of a legislature than a campmeetin is what do you suppose they done last friday morning when there wahnt but twenty men at the session we had an antipass law and all these fellers were breakin it it forbid anybody riding on a pass except railroad presidents directors express messengers and persons in misfortune and they stuck in these words and others to whom passes have been granted by the proper officers aint that a disgrace to the state and those twenty senators passed it before we got back on tuesday you cant get a bill through that legislature unless you go up to the pelican and get permission of hilary  here mr redbrook stopped abruptly and glanced contritely at his companion  i didnt mean to get goin so he said but sometimes i wish this american governmentd never been started  i often feel that way myself mr redbrook said austen  i knowed you did i guess i can tell an honest man when i see one its treason to say anything against this northeastern louder than a whisper they want an electric railrud bad up in greenacre and when some of us spoke for it and tried to get the committee to report it those cheap fellers from newcastle started such a catcall we had to set down  by this time they were at the widow peasleys stamping the snow from off their boots  how general is this sentiment austen asked after he had set down his bag in the room he was to occupy  why said mr redbrook with conviction theres enough feel as i do to turn that house upside downif we only had a leader if you was only in there austen  im afraid i shouldnt be of much use austen answered theyd have given me a back seat too  the widow peasleys was a frame and gabled house of revolutionary days with a little terrace in front of it and a retaining wall built up from the sidewalk austen on the steps stood gazing across at a square mansion with a wide cornice half hidden by elms and maples and pines it was set far back from the street and a driveway entered the picketfence and swept a wide semicircle to the front door and back again before the door was a sleigh of a pattern new to him with a seat high above the backs of two longbodied deepchested horses their heads held with difficulty by a little footman with his arms above him at that moment two figures in furs emerged from the house the young woman gathered up the reins and leaped lightly to the box the man followed the little groom touched his fur helmet and scrambled aboard as the horses sprang forward to the music of the softest of bells the sleigh swept around the curve avoided by a clever turn a snowpile at the entrance the young woman raised her eyes from the horses stared at austen and bowed as for austen he grew warm as he took off his hat and he realized that his hand was actually trembling the sleigh flew on up the hill but she turned once more to look behind her and he still had his hat in his hand the snowflakes falling on his bared head then he was aware that james redbrook was gazing at him curiously  thats flints daughter aint it inquired the member from mercer didnt callate youd know her  austen flushed he felt exceedingly foolish but an answer came to him  i met her in the hospital she used to go there to see zeb meader  thats so said mr redbrook zeb told me about it and she used to come to mercer to see him after he got out she aint much like the old man i callate  i dont think she is said austen  i dont know what shes stayin with that feller crewe for the farmer remarked of all the etarnal darn idiotswhy brush bascom and that botcher and the rest of em are trailin him along and usin him for the best thing that ever came down here he sets up to be a practical man and dont know as much as some of us hayseeds in the back seats where be you goin  i was going to the pelican  well ive got a committee meetin of agriculture said mr redbrook could you be up here at mis peasleys about eight tonight  why yes austen replied if you want to see me  i do want to see you said mr redbrook significantly and waved a farewell  austen took his way slowly across the statehouse park threading among the groups between the snowbanks towards the wide facade of the pelican hotel presently he paused and then with a sudden determination crossed the park diagonally into main street walking rapidly southward and scrutinizing the buildings on either side until at length these began to grow wide apart and he spied a florists sign with a greenhouse behind it he halted again irresolutely in front of it flung open the door and entered a boxlike office filled with the heated scents of flowers a little man eyed him with an obsequious interest which he must have accorded to other young men on similar errands austen may be spared a repetition of the very painful conversation that ensued suffice it to say that after mature deliberation violets were chosen he had a notionnot analyzedthat she would prefer violets to roses the information that the flowers were for the daughter of the president of the northeastern railroads caused a visible quickening of the little florists regard an attitude which aroused a corresponding disgust and depression in austen  oh yes said the florist shes up at crewes he glanced at austen apologetically excuse me he said i ought to know you have you a card  no said austen with emphasis  and what name please  no name said the donor now heartily repenting of his rashness and slamming the glass door in a manner that made the panes rattle behind him  as he stood hesitating on the curb of the crossing he began to wish that he had not left ripton  hello austen said a voice which he recognized as the honourable brush bascoms didnt know you ever came down here in session time  what are you doing down here brush austen asked  mr bascom grinned in appreciation of this pleasantry  i came for my health he said i prefer it to florida  ive heard that it agrees with some people said austen  mr bascom grinned again  just arrived he inquired  just said austen  i thought youd get here sooner or later said mr bascom some folks try stayin away but it aint much use youll find the honourable hilary doing business at the same old stand next to the governor in number seven up there and mr bascom pointed to the wellknown window on the second floor  thanks brush said austen indifferently to tell the truth i came down to hear that promising protege of yours speak on national affairs i understand youre pushing his bills along  mr bascom with great deliberation shut one of his little eyes  so long he said come and see me when you get time  austen went slowly down the street and entered the smokeclouded lobby of the pelican he was a man to draw attention and he was stared at by many politicians there and spoken to by some before he reached the stairs mounting he found the door with the numeral and knocked the medley of voices within ceased there were sounds of rattling papers and of closing of folding doors the key turned in the lock and state senator nathaniel billings appeared in the doorway with a look of polite inquiry on his convivial face this expression when he saw austen changed to something like consternation  why hello hello said the senator come in come in the honourable hilarys here whered you come down  hello nat said austen and went in  the honourable hilary sat in his usual armchair mr botcher severely strained the tensile strength of the bedsprings mr hamilton tooting stood before the still waving portieres in front of the folding doors and mr manning the division superintendent sat pensively with his pen in his mouth before the marbletopped table from which everything had been removed but a bible two gentlemen whom austen recognized as colleagues of mr billings in the state senate stood together in a window pointing out things of interest in the street austen walked up to his father and laid a hand on his shoulder  how are you judge he said i only came into pay my respects i hope i have not disturbed anyentertainment going on here he added glancing in turn at the thoughtful occupants of the room and then at the curtains which hid the folding doors to the apartment of his excellency  why no answered the honourable hilary his customary grunt being the only indication of surprise on his part didnt know you were coming down  i didnt know it myself until this morning said austen  legislative case i suppose remarked the honourable jacob botcher in his deep voice  no merely a pleasure trip mr botcher  the honourable jacob rubbed his throat the two state senators in the window giggled and mr hamilton tooting laughed  i thought you took to the mountains in such cases sir said mr botcher  i came for intellectual pleasure this time said austen i understand that mr crewe is to deliver an epochmaking speech on the national situation tomorrow  this was too much even for the gravity of mr manning mr tooting and mr billings and his two colleagues roared though the honourable jacobs laugh was not so spontaneous  aust said mr tooting admiringly youre all right  well judge said austen patting his fathers shoulder again im glad to see you so comfortably fixed goodby and give my regards to the governor im sorry to have missed him he added glancing at the portieres that hid the folding doors  are you stopping here asked the honourable hilary  no i met mr redbrook of mercer and he took me up to his lodgings if i can do anything for you a message will reach me there  humph said the honourable hilary while the others exchanged significant glances  austen had not gone half the length of the hall when he was overtaken by mr tooting  say aust whats up between you and redbrook he asked  nothing why austen asked stopping abruptly  well i suppose you know theres an antirailroad feeling growing in that house and that redbrook has more influence with the farmers than any other man  i didnt know anything about mr redbrooks influence said austen  mr tooting looked unconvinced  say aust if anythings in the wind i wish youd let me know ill keep it quiet  i think i shall be safe in promising that ham said austen when theres anything in the wind you generally find it out first  theres trouble coming for the railroad said mr tooting i can see that and i guess you saw it before i did  they say a ships about to sink when the rats begin to leave it said austen  although austen spoke smilingly mr tooting looked pained  theres no chance for young men in that system he said  young men write the noble parts of the governors inaugurals said austen  yes said mr tooting bitterly but you never get to be governor and read em youve got to be a come on with thirty thousand dollars to be a northeastern governor and live next door to the honourable hilary in the pelican well so long aust if anythings up give me the tip thats all i ask  reflecting on the singular character of mr tooting austen sought the gaylords headquarters and found them at the furthermost end of the building from the railroad room the door was opened by young tom himself whose face became wreathed in smiles when he saw who the visitor was  its austen he cried i thought youd come down when you got that appeal of mine  austen did not admit the selfsacrifice as he shook toms hand but remembered singularly enough the closing sentences of toms letterwhich had nothing whatever to do with the gaylord bill  at this moment a commotion arose within the room and a high tremulous but singularly fierce and compelling voice was heard crying outget out get out dn you all of you and dont come back until youve got some notion of what youre agoin to do get out i say  these last words were pronounced with such extraordinary vigour that four gentlemen seemed to be physically impelled from the room three of them austen recognized as dismissed and disgruntled soldiers from the lobby army of the northeastern the fourth was the honourable galusha hammer whose mode of progress might be described as stalking and whose lips were forming the word intolerable in the corner old tom himself could be seen a wizened figure of wrath  whos that he demanded of his son another dd fool  no replied young tom its austen vane  whats he doin here old tom demanded with a profane qualification as to the region but young tom seemed to be the only being capable of serenity amongst the flames that played around him  i sent for him because hes got more sense than galusha and all the rest of em put together he said  i guess thats so old tom agreed unexpectedly but it aint sayin much bring him inbring him in and lock the door  in obedience to these summons and a pull from young tom austen entered and sat down  youve read the pingsquit bill old tom demanded  yes said austen  just because you won a suit against the northeastern and nearly killed a man out west tom seems to think you can do anything he wouldnt give me any peace until i let him send for you mr gaylord remarked testily now youre down here what have you got to propose  i didnt come here to propose anything mr gaylord said austen  what cried mr gaylord with one of his customary and forceful exclamations whatd you come down for  ive been asking myself that question ever since i came mr gaylord said austen and i havent yet arrived at any conclusion  young tom looked at his friend and laughed and mr gaylord who at first gave every indication of being about to explode with anger suddenly emitted a dry cackle  you aint a dn fool anyway he declared  im beginning to think i am said austen  then youve got sense enough to know it retorted old tom most of em havent and his glance as it fell upon the younger man was almost approving young toms was distinctly so  i told you austen was the only lawyer whod talk common sense to you he said  i havent heard much of it yet said old tom  perhaps i ought to tell you mr gaylord said austen smiling a little that i didnt come down in any legal capacity thats only one of toms jokes  then what in hl did you bring him in here for demanded old tom of his son  just for a quiet little powwow said young tom to make you laugh hes made you laugh before  i dont want to laugh said old tom pettishly nevertheless he seemed to be visibly cooling if you aint in here to make money he added to austen i dont care how long you stay  say austen said young tom do you remember the time we covered the old man with shavings at the mills in avalon and how he chased us with a twobyfour scantling  id made pulp outn you if id got you remarked mr gaylord with a reminiscent chuckle that was almost pleasant but you were always a goldurned smart boy austen and youve done well with them little suits he gazed at austen a moment with his small filmyblue eye i dont know but what you might take hold here and make it hot for those dd rascals in the northeastern after all you couldnt botch it worsen hammer has and you might do some good i said id make em dance and by gd ill do it if i have to pay that teller levering in new york and it takes the rest of my life look the situation over and come back tomorrow and tell me what you think of it  i can tell you what i think of it now mr gaylord said austen  whats that old tom demanded sharply  that youll never get the bill passed this session or next by lobbying  for the moment the elder mr gaylord was speechless but young tom gaylord clapped his hand heartily on his friends shoulder  thats the reason i wanted to get you down here austen he cried thats what ive been telling the old man all alongperhaps hell believe you  then you wont take hold said mr gaylord his voice trembling on the edge of another spasm you refuse business  i refuse that kind of business mr gaylord austen answered quietly though there was a certain note in his voice that young tom knew well and which actually averted the imminent explosion from mr gaylord whose eyes glared and watered but aside from that you must know that the republican party leaders in this state are the heads of the lobby of the northeastern railroads  i guess i know about number seven as well as you do old tom interjected  austens eye flashed  now hold on father said young tom thats no way to talk to austen  knowing number seven austen continued you probably realize that the political and business future of nearly every one of the twenty state senators depends upon the favour of the northeastern railroads  i know that the dd fools wont look at money said mr gaylord hammers tried em  i told you that before you started in young tom remarked but when you get mad you wont listen to sense and then theres the honourable asa gray who wants to represent the northeastern some day in the united states senate  the bill ought to pass shrieked old tom its a dd outrage theres no reason why i shouldnt be allowed to build a railroad if ive got the money to do it what in blazes are we comin to in this country if we cant git competition if flint stops that bill ill buy a newspaper and go to the people with the issue and throw his dd monopoly into bankruptcy  its all very well to talk about competition and monopolies and lobbies said young tom but how about the gaylord lumber company how about the time you used the lobby with flints permission this kind of virtuous talk is beautiful to listen to when you and flint get into a row  at this remark of his sons the intermittent geyser of old toms wrath spouted up again with scalding steam and in a manner utterly impossible to reproduce upon paper young tom waited patiently for the exhibition to cease which it did at length in a coughing fit of sheer exhaustion that left his father speechless if not expressionless pointing a lean and trembling finger in the direction of a valise on the floor  youll go off in a spell of that kind some day said young tom opening the valise and extracting a bottle uncorking it he pressed it to his fathers lips and with his own pockethandkerchief old tom not possessing such an article wiped the perspiration from mr gaylords brow and the drops from his shabby black coat theres no use gettin mad at austen hes dead rightyou cant lobby this thing through and you knew it before you started if you hadnt lost your temper you wouldnt have tried  well see by gd well see said the indomitable old tom when he got his breath you young men think you know a sight but you havent got the stuff in you we old tellers have where would i be if it wasnt for fightin you mark my words before this sessions ended ill scare hl out of flintsee if i dont  young tom winked at his friend  lets go down to supper he said  the dining room of the pelican hotel during a midweek of a busy session was a scene of bustle and confusion not likely to be forgotten every seat was taken and gentlemen waited their turn in the marbleflagged rotunda who had not the honour of being known to mr giles the head waiter if mr hamilton tooting were present and recognized you he would take great pleasure in pointing out the celebrities and especially that table over which the honourable hilary vane presided with the pretty redchecked waitress hovering around it at the honourable hilarys right hand was the division superintendent and at his left mr speaker dobya most convenient and congenial arrangement farther down the board were state senator nat billings mr ridout when he did not sup at home the honourables brush bascom and elisha jane and the honourable jacob botcher made a proper ballast for the foot this table was known as the railroad table and it was very difficult at any distance away from it to hear what was said except when the honourable jacob botcher made a joke next in importance and situation was the governors tablenow occupied by the honourable asa gray mr tootings description would not have stopped here  sensations are common in the pelican hotel but when austen vane walked in that evening between the gaylords father and son many a hungry guest laid down his knife and fork and stared was the younger vane known to be antirailroad to take up the gaylords war against his own father all the indications were that way and a rumour flew from table to tableleaping space as rumours willthat the gaylords had sent to ripton for austen there was but one table in the room the occupants of which appeared not to take any interest in the event or even to grasp that an event had occurred the railroad table was oblivious  after supper mr tooting found austen in the rotunda and drew him mysteriously aside  say aust the honourable hilary wants to see you tonight he whispered  did he send you with the message austen demanded  thats right said mr tooting i guess you know whats up  austen did not answer at the foot of the stairway was the tall form of hilary vane himself and austen crossed the rotunda  do you want to see me judge he asked  the honourable hilary faced about quickly  yes if youve got any spare time  ill go to your room at halfpast nine tonight if thats convenient  all right said the honourable hilary starting up the stairs  austen turned and found mr hamilton tooting at his elbow     chapter xii mr redbrooks party  the storm was over and the bare trees when the moon shone between the hurrying clouds cast lacelike shadows on the white velvet surface of the snow as austen forged his way up the hill to the widow peasleys in keeping with his promise to mr redbrook across the street he paused outside the picketfence to gaze at the yellow bars of light between the slats of the windows of the duncan house it was hard to realize that she was there within a stones throw of where he was to sleep but the strange halfstartled expression in her eyes that afternoon and the smilewhich had in it a curious quality he could not analyzewere so vivid in his consciousness as to give him pain the incident as he stood there ankledeep in the snow seemed to him another inexplicable and uselessly cruel caprice of fate  as he pictured her in the dining room behind mr crewes silver and cut glass and flowers it was undoubtedly natural that he should wonder whether she were thinking of him in the widow peasleys lamplit cottage and he smiled at the contrast after all it was the contrast between his life and hers as an american of good antecedents and education with a western experience thrown in social gulfs although awkward might be crossed in spite of opposition from ladies like the rose of sharonwho had crossed them nevertheless the life which victoria led seemingly accentuatedto a man standing behind a picketfence in the snowthe voids between  a stamping of feet in the widow peasleys vestibule awoke in him that sense of the ridiculous which was never far from the surface and he made his way thither in mingled amusement and pain what happened there is of interest but may be briefly chronicled austen was surprised on entering to find mrs peasleys parlour filled with men and a single glance at their faces in the lamplight assured him that they were of a type which he understoodcountrymen of that rugged new england stock to which he himself belonged whose sons for generations had made lawyers and statesmen and soldiers for the state and nation some were talking in low voices and others sat silent on the chairs and sofa not awkwardly or uncomfortably but with a characteristic selfpossession and repose mr redbrook towering in front of the stove came forward  here you be he said taking austens hand warmly and a little ceremoniously i asked em here to meet ye  to meet me austen repeated  wanted they should know you said mr redbrook  theyve all heard of you and what you did for zeb  austen flushed he was aware that he was undergoing a cool and critical examination by those present and that they were men who used all their faculties in making up their minds  im very glad to meet any friends of yours mr redbrook he said what i did for meader isnt worth mentioning it was an absolutely simple case  twahnt so much what ye did as how ye did it said mr redbrook its kind of rare in these days he added with the manner of commenting to himself on the circumstance to find a young lawyer with brains that wont sell em to the railrud thats what appeals to me and to some other folks i knowespecially when we take into account the situation you was in and the chances you had  austens silence under this compliment seemed to create an indefinable though favourable impression and the member from mercer permitted himself to smile  these men are all friends of mine and members of the house he said and theres more would have come if theyd had a longer notice allow me to make you acquainted with mr widgeon of hull  we kind of wanted to look you over said mr widgeon suiting the action to the word thats natural aint it  kind of size you up added mr jarley of wye raising his eyes callate youre sizable enough  wish you was in the house remarked mr adams of barren none of us is much on talk but if we had you i guess we could lay things wide open  if you was thar and give it to em as hot as you did when you was talkin for zeb them skunks in the front seats wouldnt know whether they was afoot or hossback declared mr williams of devon a town adjoining mercer  i used to think railrud govment wahnt so bad until i come to the house this time remarked a stocky member from oxford its sheer waste of money for the state to pay a legislature they might as well run things from the new york officeyou know that  we might as well wear so many northeastern uniforms with brass buttons a sinewy hill farmer from lee put in he had a lean face that did not move a muscle but a humorous gray eye that twinkled  in the meantime mr redbrook looked on with an expression of approval which was to austen distinctly pleasant but more or less mystifying  i guess you aint disappointed em much he declared when the round was ended most of em knew me well enough to understand that cattle and live stock in general includin humans is about as i represent em to be  we have some confidence in your judgment brother redbrook answered mr terry of lee and now weve looked over the goods it aint set back any i callate  this observation which seemed to meet with a general assent was to austen more mystifying than ever he laughed  gentlemen he said i feel as though some expression of thanks were due you for this kind and most unexpected reception here a sudden seriousness came into his eyes which served somehow only to enhance his charm of manner and a certain determined ring into his voice you have all referred to a condition of affairs he added about which i have thought a great deal and which i deplore as deeply as you do there is no doubt that the northeastern railroads have seized the government of this state for three main reasons to throttle competition to control our railroad commission in order that we may not get the service and safety to which we are entitledso increasing dividends and to make and maintain laws which enable them to bribe with passes to pay less taxes than they should and to manipulate political machinery  thats right said mr jarley of wye with a decided emphasis  thats the kind of talk i like to hear exclaimed mr terry  and nobodys had the gumption to fight em said mr widgeon  it looks said austen as though it must come to a fight in the end i do not think they will listen to reason i mean he added with a flash of humour that they will listen to it but not act upon it gentlemen i regret to have to say for obvious reasons something which you all know that my father is at the head of the northeastern machine which is the republican party organization  there was a silence  you went again him and we honour you for it austen said mr redbrook at length  i want to say austen continued that i have tried to look at things as mr vane sees them and that i have a good deal of sympathy for his point of view conditions as they exist are the result of an evolution for which no one man is responsible that does not alter the fact that the conditions are wrong but the railroads before they consolidated found the political boss in power and had to pay him for favours the citizen was the culprit to start with just as he is the culprit now because he does not take sufficient interest in his government to make it honest we mustnt blame the railroads too severely when they grew strong enough for substituting their own political army to avoid being blackmailed long immunity has reenforced them in the belief that they have but one duty to pay dividends i am afraid he added that they will have to be enlightened somewhat as pharaoh was enlightened  well thats sense too said mr widgeon i guess youre the man to enlighten em  moderate talk appeals to me declared mr jarley  and when that fails said mr terry hard tellin blows  dont lose track of the fact that weve got our eye on you said mr emerson of oxford who had a blacksmiths grip and came back to renew it after he had put on his overshoes he was the last to linger and when the door had closed on him austen turned to mr redbrook  now what does all this mean he demanded  it means said mr redbrook that when the time comes we want you to run for governor  austen went to the mantelpiece and stood for a long time with his back turned staring at a crayon portrait of colonel peasley in the uniform in which he had fallen at the battle of gettysburg then he swung about and seized the member from mercer by both broad shoulders  james redbrook he said until tonight i thought you were about as longheaded and sensible a man as there was in the state  so i be replied mr redbrook with a grin you ask young tom gaylord  so tom put you up to this nonsense  it aint nonsense retorted mr redbrook stoutly and tom didnt put me up to it its the best notion that ever came into my mind  austen still clinging to mr redbrooks shoulders shook his head slowly  james he said there are plenty of men who are better equipped than i for the place and in a better situation to undertake it iim much obliged to you but ill help ive got to go he added the honourable hilary wants to see me  he went into the entry and put on his overshoes and his coat while james redbrook regarded him with a curious mingling of pain and benevolence on his rugged face  i wont press you now austen he said but think on it for gods sake think on it  outside austen paused in the snow once more his brain awhirl with a strange exaltation the like of which he had never felt before although eminently human it was not the fact that honest men had asked him to be their governor which uplifted himbut that they believed him to be as honest as themselves in that hour he had tasted life as he had never yet tasted it he had lived as he might never live again not one of them he remembered suddenly had uttered a sentence of the political claptrap of which he had heard so much they had spoken from the soul not bitterly not passionately but their words had rung with the determination which had made their forefathers and his leave home toil and kindred to fight and die at bunker hill and gettysburg for a principle it had bean given him to look that eight into the heart of a nation and he was awed  as he stood there under the winter moon he gradually became conscious of music of an air that seemed the very expression of his mood his eyes irresistibly drawn towards the duncan house were caught by the fluttering of lace curtains at an open window the notes were those of a pianothough the instrument mattered littlethat with which they were charged for him set the night wind quivering it was not simple music although it had in it a grand simplicity at times it rose vibrant with inexpressible feeling and fell again into gentler yearning cadences that wrung the soul with a longing that was worldold and worldwide that reached out towards the unattainable stareand reaching became immortal thus was the end of it fainting as it drifted heavenward  then the window was closed  austen walked on whither he knew not after a certain time of which he had no cognizance he found himself under the glaring arclight that hung over main street before the pelican hotel in front of what was known as the ladies entrance he slipped in there avoiding the crowded lobby with its shifting groups and its haze of smokeplainly to be seen behind the great plates of glasswent upstairs and gained room number seven unnoticed then after the briefest moment of hesitation he knocked a voice respondedthe honourable hilarys there was but one light burning in the room and mr vane sat in his accustomed chair in the corner alone he was not reading nor was he drowsing but his head was dropped forward a little on his breast he raised it slowly at his sons entrance and regarded austen fixedly though silently  you wanted to see me judge said austen  come at last have you said mr vane  i didnt intend to be late said austen  seem to have a good deal of business on hand these days the honourable hilary remarked  austen took a step forward and stopped mr vane was preparing a piece of honey dew  if you would like to know what the business was judge i am here to tell you  the honourable hilary grunted  i aint good enough to be confided in i guess he said i wouldnt understand motives from principle  austen looked at his father for a few moments in silence tonight he seemed at a greater distance than ever before and more lonely than ever when austen had entered the room and had seen him sitting with his head bowed forward the hostility of months of misunderstanding had fallen away from the son and he had longed to fly to him as he had as a child after punishment differences in after life alas are not always to be bridged thus  judge he said slowly with an attempt to control his voice wouldnt it have been fairer to wait awhile before you made a remark like that whatever our dealings may have been i have never lied to you anything you may want to know i am here to tell you  so youre going to take up lobbying are you i had a notion you were above lobbying  austen was angered but like all men of character his face became stern under provocation and he spoke more deliberately  before we go any farther he said would you mind telling me who your informant is on this point  i guess i dont need an informant my eyesight is as good as ever said the honourable hilary  your deductions are usually more accurate if any one has told you that i am about to engage in lobbying they have lied to you  wouldnt engage in lobbying would you the honourable hilary asked with the air of making a casual inquiry  austen flushed but kept his temper  i prefer the practice of law he replied  saw you were associatin with saints his father remarked  austen bit his lip and then laughed outrightthe canonization of old tom gaylord being too much for him  now judge he said it isnt like you to draw hasty conclusions because i sat down to supper with the gaylords it isnt fair to infer that they have retained me in a legislative case  the honourable hilary did not respond to his sons humour but shifted the honey dew to the left cheek  old tom going in for reform  he may bring it about answered austen instantly becoming serious again whether hes going in for it or not  for the first time the honourable hilary raised his eyes to his sons face and shot at him a penetrating look of characteristic shrewdness but he followed in conversation the same rule as in examining a witness rarely asking a direct question except as a tactical surprise  old tom ought to have his railroad oughtnt he  so far as i can see it would be a benefit to the people of that part of the state said austen  building it for the people is he  his motive doesnt count the bill should be judged on its merits and proper measures for the safeguarding of public interests should be put into it  dont think the bill will be judged on its merits do you  no i dont replied austen and neither do you  did you tell old tom so asked mr vane after a pause did you tell old tom so when he sent for you to take hold  he didnt send for me answered austen quietly and i have no business dealings with him except small suits what i did tell him was that he would never get the bill through this session or next by lobbying  the honourable hilary never showed surprise he emitted a grunt which evinced at once impatience and amusement  why not he asked  well judge ill tell you what i told himalthough you both know its because the northeastern owns the republican party machine which is the lobby and because most of the twenty state senators are dependent upon the northeastern for future favours  did you tell tom gaylord that demanded mr vane what did he say  austen braced himself he did not find the answer easy  he said he knew about number seven as well as i did  the honourable hilary rose abruptlyperhaps in some secret agitationausten could not discern his father walked as far as the door and turned slowly and faced him but he did not speak his mouth was tightly closed almost as in pain and austen went towards him appealingly  judge he said you sent for me you have asked me questions which i felt obliged in honesty to answer god knows i dont wish to differ with you but circumstances seem always against us i will talk plainly if you will let me i try to look at things from your point of view i know that you believe that a political system should go hand in hand with the great commercial system which you are engaged in building i disagree with your beliefs but i do not think that your pursuit of them has not been sincere and justified by your conscience i suppose that you sent for me to know whether mr gaylord has employed me to lobby for his bill he has not because i refused that employment but i will tell you that in my opinion if a man of any ability whatever should get up on the floor of the house and make an argument for the pingsquit bill the sentiment against the northeastern and its political power is so great that the house would compel the committee to report the bill and pass it you probably know this already but i mention it for your own good if you do not in the hope that through you the northeastern railroads may be induced to relax their grip upon the government of this state  the honourable hilary advanced until only the marbletopped table was between himself and his son a slight noise in the adjoining room caused him to turn his head momentarily then he faced austen again  did you tell gaylord this he asked  austen made a gesture of distaste and turned away  no he said i reserved the opinion whatever it is worth for your ears alone  ive heard that kind of calculation before said the honourable hilary my experience is that they never come to much as for this nonsense about the northeastern railroads running things he added more vigorously i guess when its once in a mans head theres no getting it out the railroad employs the best lawyers it can find to look after its interests im one of em and im proud of it if i hadnt been one of em the chances are youd never be where you are that youd never have gone to college and the law school the republican party realizes that the northeastern is most vitally connected with the material interests of this state that the prosperity of the road means the prosperity of the state and the leaders of the party protect the road from vindictive assaults on it like gaylords and from scatterbrains and agitators like your friend redbrook  austen shook his head sadly as he gazed at his father he had always recognized the futility of arguments if argument on this point ever arose between them  its no use judge he said if material prosperity alone were to be considered your contention would have some weight the perpetuation of the principle of american government has to be thought of government by a railroad will lead in the end to anarchy you are courting destruction as it is  if you came in here to quote your confounded emerson the honourable hilary began but austen slipped around the table and took him by the arm and led him perforce to his chair  no judge that isnt emerson he answered its just common sense only it sounds to you like drivel im going nowunless you want to hear some more about the plots ive been getting into but i want to say this i ask you to remember that youre my father and thatim fond of you and that if you and i happen to be on opposite sides it wont make any difference as far as my feelings are concerned im always ready to tell you frankly what im doing if you wish to know goodby i suppose ill see you in ripton at the end of the week and he pressed his fathers shoulder  mr vane looked up at his son with a curious expression perhaps as when austen returned from the shooting of mr blodgett in the west there was a smattering of admiration and pride in that look and something of an affection which had long ceased in its strivings for utterance it was the unconscious tribute tooslight as was its exhibitionof the man whose life has been spent in the conquest of material things to the man who has the audacity insensate though it seem to fling these to the winds in his search after ideals  goodby austen said mr vane  austen got as far as the door cast another look back at his fatherwho was sitting motionless with head bowed as when he cameand went out so mr vane remained for a full minute after the door had closed and then he raised his head sharply and gave a piercing glance at the curtains that separated number seven from the governors room in three strides he had reached them flung them open and the folding doors behind them already parted by four inches the gas was turned low but under the chandelier was the figure of a young man struggling with an overcoat the honourable hilary did not hesitate but came forward with a swiftness that paralyzed the young man who turned upon him a face on which was meant to be written surprise and a just indignation but in reality was a mixture of impudence and pallid fright the honourable hilary towering above him and with that grip on his arm was a formidable person  listening were you ham he demanded  no cried mr tooting with a vehemence he meant for force no i wasnt listening to who  humph said the honourable hilary still retaining with one hand the grip on mr tooting s arm and with the other turning up the gas until it flared in mr tootings face what are you doing in the governors room  i left my overcoat in here this afternoon when you sent me to bring up the senator  ham said mr vane it isnt any use lying to me  i aint lying to you said mr tooting i never did i often lied for you he added and you didnt raise any objections that i remember  mr vane let go of the arm contemptuously  ive done dirty work for the northeastern for a good many years cried mr tooting seemingly gaining confidence now that he was free ive slaved for em and what have they done for me they wouldnt even back me for county solicitor when i wanted the job  turned reformer ham  i guess ive got as much right to turn reformer as some folks i know  i guess you have agreed the honourable hilary unexpectedly he seated himself on a chair and proceeded to regard mr tooting in a manner extremely disconcerting to that gentleman this quality of impenetrability of never being sure when he was angry had baffled more able opponents of hilary vane than mr hamilton tooting  goodnight ham  i want to say mr tooting began  goodnight ham said mr vane once more  mr tooting looked at him slowly buttoned up his overcoat and departed     chapter xiii the realm of pegasus  the eventful day of mr humphrey crewes speech on national affairs dawned without a cloud in the sky the snow was of a dazzling whiteness and sprinkled with diamond dust and the air of such transcendent clearness that austen could seeby leaning a little out of the widow peasleys windowthe powdered top of holdfast mountain some thirty miles away for once a glance at the mountain sufficed him and he directed his gaze through the trees at the duncan house engaging in a pleasant game of conjecture as to which was her window in such weather the heights of helicon seemed as attainable as the peak of holdfast and he had but to beckon a shining pegasus from out a sunshaft in the sky obstacles were mere specks on the snow  he forgot to close the window and dressed in a temperature which would have meant for many mortals pneumonia the events of yesterday painful and agitating as they had been had fallen away in the prospect that lay before himhe would see her today and speak with her these words like a refrain were humming in his head as honest mr redbrook talked during breakfast while austens answers may have been both intelligent and humorous mr redbrook at least gave no sign that they were not he was aware that mr redbrook was bringing arguments to bear on the matter of the meeting of the evening before but he fended these lightly while in spirit he flung a gemstudded bridle aver the neck of pegasus  and after breakfastaway from the haunts of men away from the bickerings the subjection of mean spirits material loss and gain and material passion by eight oclock the widow peasleys household being an early and orderly one he was swinging across the long hills cleaving for himself a furrowed path in the untrodden snow breathing deep as he gazed across the blue spaces from the crests bellerophon or perseus aided by immortals felt no greater sense of achievements to come than he out here on the windswept hills that rolled onward and upward to the mountains the world was his  with the same speed he returned still by untrodden paths until he reached the country road that ended in the city street some who saw him paused in their steps caught unconsciously by the rhythmic perfection of his motion ahead of him he beheld the statehouse its dial aflame in the light emblematic to him of the presence within it of a spirit which cleansed it of impurities she would be there nay when he looked at the dial from a different angle was there as he drew nearer there rose out of the void her presence beside him which he had daily tried to summon since that autumn afternoonher voice and her eyes and many of the infinite expressions of each and both sprites that they were they had failed him until today when he was to see her again  and then somehow he had threaded the groups beside the battleflags in the corridor and mounted the stairway the doorkeeper of the house looked into his face and with that rare knowledge of mankind which doorkeepers possess let him in there were many ladies on the floor such being the chivalrous custom when a debate or a speech of the importance of mr crewes was going on but austen swept them with a glance of disappointment was it possible after all that she had not come ormore agitating thoughthad gone back to new york  at this disturbing point in his reflections austen became aware that the hall was ringing with a loud and compelling voice which originated in front of the speakers desk  the honourable humphrey crewe was delivering his longheralded speech on national affairs and was arrayed for the occasion in a manner befitting the american statesman with the conventional frock coat which he wore unbuttoned but the gladstone collar and a tie gave the touch of individuality to his dress which was needed to set him aside as a marked man austen suddenly remembered with an irresistible smile that one of the reasons which he had assigned for his visit to the capital was to hear this very speech to see how mr crewe would carry off what appeared to be a somewhat difficult situation whether or not this motive had drawn othersfor the millionaires speech had not lacked advertisementit is impossible to say but there was standing room only on the floor of the house that day  the fact that mr crewe was gratified could not be wholly concealed the thing that fascinated austen vane and others who listened was the aplomb with which the speech was delivered the member from leith showed no trace of the nervousness naturally to be expected in a maiden effort but spoke with the deliberation of an old campaigner of the man of weight and influence that he was he leaned part of the time with his elbow on the clerks desk with his feet crossed again when he wished to emphasize a point he came forward and seized with both hands the back of his chair sometimes he thrust his thumb in his waistcoat pocket and turned with an appeal to mr speaker doby who was apparently too thrilled and surprised to indulge in conversation with those on the bench beside him and who made no attempt to quell handclapping and even occasional whistling again after the manner of experts mr crewe addressed himself forcibly to an individual in the audience usually a sensitive and responsive person like the honourable jacob botcher who on such occasions assumed a look of infinite wisdom and nodded his head slowly there was no doubt about it that the compelling personality of mr humphrey crewe was creating a sensation genius is sure of itself and statesmen are born not made  able and powerful as was mr crewes discourse the man and not the words had fastened the wandering attention of austen vane he did not perceive his friend of the evening before mr widgeon coming towards him up the side aisle until he felt a touch on the arm  take my seat it aint exactly a front one whispered the member from hull my wifes cousins comin on the noon train not a bad speech is it he added acts like a veteran i didnt callate he had it in him  thus aroused austen made his way towards the vacant chair and when he was seated raised his eyes to the gallery rail and mr crewe the legislative chamber and its audience ceased to exist it is quite impossibleunless one is a poetical geniusto reproduce on paper that gone and sickly sensation which is paradoxically so exquisite the psychological cause of it in this instance was primarily the sight by austen vane of his own violets on a black tailormade gown trimmed with wide braid and secondarily of an oval face framed in a black hat the subtle curves of which no living man could describe the face was turned in his direction and he felt an additional thrill when he realized that she must have been watching him as he came in for she was leaning forward with a gloved hand on the railing  he performed that act of conventionality known as a bow and she nodded her headblack hat and all the real salutation was a divine ray which passed between their eyeshers and hisover the commonplace mortals between and after that although the patient legislative clock in the corner which had marked the space of other great events such as the woodchuck session continued to tick undisturbed in this instance by the pole of the sergeantatarms time became a lost dimension for austen vane he made a few unimportant discoveries such as the fact that mrs pomfret and her daughter were seated beside victoria listening with a rapt attention and that mr crewe had begun to read statistics and that some people were gaping and others leaving he could look up at the gallery without turning his head and sometimes he caught her momentary glance and again with her chin in her hand she was watching mr crewe with a little smile creasing the corners of her eyes  a horrible thought crossed austens mindperhaps they were not his violets after all because she had smiled at him yesterday and today he had soared heavenwards on wings of his own making perhaps they were mr crewes violets had she not come to visit mr crewe to listen to his piece de resistance without knowing that he austen vane would be in the capital the idea that her interest in austen vane was possibly connected with the study of mankind had a sobering effect on him and the notion that she had another sort of interest in mr crewe seemed ridiculous enough but disturbing and supported by feats  austen had reached this phase in his reflections when he was aroused by a metallic sound which arose above the resonant tones of the orator of the day a certain vessel to the use of which according to mr dickens the satire male portion of the american nation was at one time addicteda cuspidor in plain languagehad been started by some unknown agency in the back seats rolling down the centre aisle and gathering impetus as it went bumped the louder on each successive step until it hurled itself with a clash against the clerks desk at the feet of the orator himself during its descent a titter arose which gradually swelled into a roar of laughter and austens attention was once more focused upon the member from leith but if any man had so misjudged the quality of humphrey crewe as to suppose for an instant that he could be put out of countenance by such a manoeuvre that man was mightily mistaken mr crewe paused with his forefinger on the page and fixed a glassy eye on the remote neighbourhood in the back seats where the disturbance had started  i am much obliged to the gentleman he said coldly but he has sent me an article which i never use under any conditions i would not deprive him of its convenience  whereupon it is not too much to say mr crews was accorded an ovation led by his stanch friend and admirer the honourable jacob botcher although that worthy had been known to use the article in question  mr speaker doby glanced at the faithful clock and arose majestically  i regret to say he announced that the time of the gentleman from leith is up  mr botcher rose slowly to his feet  mr speaker he began in a voice that rumbled through the crevices of the gallery i move you sir that a vote of thanks be accorded to the gentleman from leith for his exceedingly able and instructive speech on national affairs  second the motion said the honourable brush bascom instantly  and leave to print in the state tribune cried a voice from somewhere among the submerged four hundred and seventy  gentlemen of the house said mr crewe when the laughter had subsided i have given you a speech which is the result of much thought and preparation on my part i have not flaunted the starspangled banner in your faces or indulged in oratorical fireworks mine have been the words of a plain business man and i have not indulged in wild accusations or flights of imagination perhaps if i had he added there are some who would have been better pleased i thank my friends for their kind attention and approbation  nevertheless amidst somewhat of a pandemonium the vote of thanks was given and the house adjourned while mr crewes friends of whom he had spoken could be seen pressing around him and shaking him by the hand austen got to his feet his eyes again sought the gallery whence he believed he received a look of understanding from a face upon which amusement seemed plainly written she had turned to glance down at him despite the fact that mrs pomfret was urging her to leave austen started for the door and managed to reach it long before his neighbours had left the vicinity of their seats once in the corridor his eye singled her out amongst those descending the gallery stairs and he had a little thrill of pride and despair when he realized that she was the object of the scrutiny too of the men around him the women were interested likewise in mrs pomfret whose appearance although appropriate enough for a new york matinee proclaimed her as hailing from that mysterious and fabulous city of wealth this lady with her lorgnette was examining the faces about her in undisguised curiosity and at the same time talking to victoria in a voice which she took no pains to lower  i think it outrageous she was saying if some radical member had done that in parliament he would have been expelled from the house but of course in parliament they wouldnt have those horrid things to roll down the aisles poor dear humphrey the career of a gentleman in politics is a thankless one in this country i wonder at his fortitude  victorias eyes alone betokened her amusement  how do you do mr vane she said im so glad to see you again  austen said something which he felt was entirely commonplace and inadequate to express his own sentiments while alice gave him an uncertain bow and mrs pomfret turned her glasses upon him  you remember mr vane said victoria you met him at humphreys  did i answered mrs pomfret how do you do cant something be done to punish those rowdies  austen grew red  mr vane isnt a member of the house said victoria  oh exclaimed mrs pomfret something ought to be done about it in england such a thing wouldnt be allowed to drop for a minute if i lived in this state i think i should do something nobody in america seems to have the spirit even to make a protest  austen turned quietly to victoria  when are you going away he asked  tomorrow morningearlier than i like to think of i have to be in new york by tomorrow night  she flashed at him a look of approbation for his selfcontrol and then by a swift transition which he had often remarked her expression changed to one of amusement although a seriousness lurked in the depths of her eyes mrs pomfret had gone on with alice and they followed  andam i not to see you again before you go he exclaimed  he didnt stop to reason than upon the probable consequences of his act in seeking her nature which is stronger than reason was compelling him  that depends said victoria  upon whom  upon you  they were on the lower stairs by this times and there was silence between then for a few moments as they descendedprincipally because after this exalting remark austen could not trust himself to speak  will you go driving with me he asked and was immediately thunderstruck at his boldness  yes she answered simply  how soon may i come he demanded  she laughed softly but with a joyous note which was not hidden from him as they stepped out of the darkened corridor into the dazzling winter noonday  i will be ready at three oclock she said  he looked at his watch  two hours and a half he cried  if that is too early she said mischievously we can go later  too early he repeated but the rest of his protest was cut short by mr crewe  hello victoria what did you think of my speech  the destinies of the nation are settled said victoria do you know mr vane  oh yes how are you said mr crewe glad to see you and he extended a furred glove were you there  yes said austen  ill send you a copy id like to talk it over with you come on victoria ive arranged for an early lunch come on mrs pomfretget in alice  mrs pomfret still protesting against the profane interruption to mr crewes speech bent her head to enter mr crewes booby sleigh which had his crest on the panel alice was hustled in next but victoria avoided his ready assistance and got in herself mr crewe getting in beside her  au revoir she called out to austen as the door slammed the coachman gathered his horses together and off they went at a brisk trot then the little group which had been watching the performance dispersed halfway across the park austen perceived some one signaling violently to him and discovered his friend young tom gaylord  come to dinner with me said young tom and tell me whether the speech of your friend from leith will send him to congress i saw you hobnobbing with him just now whats the matter austen i havent seen that guilty expression on your face since we were at college together  whats the best liverystable in town austen asked  by george i wondered why you came down here who are you going to take out in a sleigh theres a girl in it is there  not yet tom said austen  ive often asked myself why i ever had any use for such a secretive cuss as you declared young mr gaylord but if youre really goin to get interested in girls you ought to see old flints daughter i wrote you about her why exclaimed tom wasnt she one of those that got into crewes sleigh  tom said austen where did you say that liverystable was  oh dang the liverystable answered mr gaylord i hear theres quite a sentiment for you for governor how about it you know ive always said you could be united states senator and president if youll only say the word austen well work up a movement around the state thatll be hard to beat  tom said austen laying his hand on young mr gaylords farther shoulder youre a pretty good fellow where did you say that liverystable was  ill go sleighriding with you said mr gaylord i guess the pingsquit bill can rest one afternoon  tom i dont know any man id rather take than you said austen  the unsuspecting tom was too goodnatured to be offended and shortly after dinner austen found himself in the process of being looked over by a stout gentleman named putter proprietor of putters livery who claimed to be a judge of men as well as horses austen had been through his stalls and chosen a mare  durned if you dont look like a man who can handle a horse said mr putter and as long as youre a friend of tom gaylords ill let you have her nobody drives that mare but me whats your name  vane  aint any relation to old hilary be you  im his son said austen only he doesnt boast about it  godfrey exclaimed mr putter with a broad grin i guess you kin have her aint you the man that shot a feller out west seems to me i heerd somethin about it  which one did you hear about austen asked  good lord said mr putter you didnt shoot moren one did you  it was just three oclock when austen drove into the semicircle opposite the widow peasleys rang mr crewes doorbell and leaped into the sleigh once more the mares nature being such as to make it undesirable to leave her presently mr crewes butler appeared and stood dubiously in the vestibule  will you tell miss flint that mr vane has called for her and that i cannot leave the horse  the man retired with obvious disapproval then austen heard victorias voice in the hallwaydont make a goose of yourself humphrey here she appeared the colour fresh in her cheeks her slender figure clad in a fur which even austen knew was priceless she sprang into the sleigh the butler with annoying deliberation and with the air of saying that this was an affair of which he washed his hands tucked in mr putters best robe about her feet the mare leaped forward and they were off out of the circle and flying up the hill on the hard snowtracks  whew exclaimed victoria what a relief are you staying in that dear little house she asked with a glance at the widow peasleys  yes said austen  i wish i were  he looked at her shyly he was not a man to do homage to material gods but the pomp and circumstance with which she was surrounded had had a sobering effect upon him and added to his sense of the instability and unreality of the present moment he had an almost guilty feeling of having broken an unwritten law of abducting a princess and the old duncan house had seemed to frown protestingly that such an act should have taken place under its windows if victoria had beento himan ordinary mortal in expensive furs instead of a princess he would have snapped his fingers at the pomp and circumstance these typified the comforts which in a wild and forgetful moment he might ask her to leave not that he believed she would leave them he had lived long enough to know that an interest by a woman in a manespecially a man beyond the beaten track of her observationdid not necessarily mean that she might marry him if he asked her and yetoh tantalus here she was beside him for one afternoon again his very own their two souls ringing with the harmony of whirling worlds in sunlit space he sought refuge in thin thought he strove in oblivion to drain the cup of the hour of its nectar even as he had done before generations of puritan vanes whose descendant alone had harassed poor sarah austere were in his blood and there they hung in the long gallery of time mutely but sternly forbidding when he raised his hand to the stem  in silence they reached the crest where the little city ended abruptly in view of the paradise of the silent hillshis paradise where there were no palaces or thought of palaces the wild wind of the morning was still in this realm at least a heritage from his mother seemingly untrodden by the foot of man the woman at his side was his from holdfast over the spruces to sawanec in the blue distance he was lord a domain the wealth of which could not be reckoned in the coin of midas he turned to her as they flew down the slope and she averted her face perchance perceiving in that look a possession from which a woman shrinks and her remark startlingly indicative of the accord between them lent a no less startling reality to the enchantment  this is your land isnt it she said  i sometimes feel as though it were he answered i was out here this morning when the wind was at play and he pointed with his whip at a fantastic snowdrift before i saw you  you looked as though you had come from it she answered you seemedi suppose you will think me sillybut you seemed to bring something of this with you into that hail i always think of you as out on the hills and mountains  and you he said belong here too  she drew a deep breath  i wish i did but youyou really do belong here you seem to have absorbed all the clearness of it and the strength and vigour i was watching you this morning and you were so utterly out of place in those surroundings victoria paused her colour deepening  his blood kept pace with the mares footsteps but he did not reply  what did you think of humphreys speech she asked abruptly changing the subject  i thought it a surprisingly good onewhat i heard of it he answered that wasnt much i didnt think hed do as well  humphreys clever in a great many ways victoria agreed if he didnt have such an impenetrable conceit he might go far because he learns quickly and has an industry that is simply appalling but he hasnt quite the manner for politics has he  i think i should call his manner a drawback said austen though not by any means an insurmountable one  victoria laughed  the other qualities all need to be very great she said he was furious at me for coming out this afternoon he had it all arranged to drive over to the forge and had an early lunch  and i said austen have all the more reason to be grateful to you  oh if you knew the favour you were doing me she cried bringing me out here where i can breathe i hope you dont think i dislike humphrey she went on of course if i did i shouldnt visit him you see i have known him for so long  i hadnt a notion that you disliked him said austen i am curious about his career thats one reason i came down he somehow inspires curiosity  and awe she added humphreys career has all the fascination of a runaway locomotive one watches it transfixed awaiting the inevitable crash  their eyes met and they both laughed  its no use trying to be a humbug said victoria i cant and i do like humphrey in spite of his career  and they laughed again the music of the bells ran faster and faster still keeping time to a wilder music of the sunlit hills and sky nor was it strange that her voice when she spoke did not break the spell but laid upon him a deeper sense of magic  this brings back the fairy books she said and all those wonderful and nevertobeforgotten sensations of the truant doesnt it youve been a truanthavent you  yes he laughed ive been a truant but i never quite realized the possibilities of the partuntil today  she was silent a moment and turned away her head surveying the landscape that fell away for miles beyond  when i was a child she said i used to think that by opening a door i could step into an enchanted realm like this only i could never find the door perhaps she added gayly pursuing the conceit it was because you had the key and i didnt know you in those days she gave him a swift searching look smiling whimsical yet startledso elusive that the memory of it afterwards was wont to come and go like a flash of light who are you she asked  his blood leaped but he smiled in delighted understanding of her mood sarah austen had brought just such a magic touch to an excursion and even at that moment austen found himself marvelling a little at the strange resemblance between the two  i am a plain person whose ancestors came from a village called camden street he replied camden street is there on a shelf of the hills and through the arch of its elms you can look off over the forests of the lowlands until they end in the blue reaches of the oceanif you could see far enough  if you could see far enough said victoria unconsciously repeating his words but that doesnt explain you she exclaimed you are like nobody i ever met and you have a supernatural faculty of appearing suddenly from nowhere and whisking me away like the lady in the fable out of myself and the world i live in if i become so inordinately grateful as to talk nonsense you mustnt blame me try not to think of the number of times ive seen you or when it was we first met  i believe said austen gravely it was when a mammoth beast had his cave on holdfast and the valleys were covered with cocoanutpalms  and you appeared suddenly then too and rescued me you have always been uniformly kind she said buta little intangible  a myth he suggested with neither height breadth nor thickness  you have height and breadth she answered measuring him swiftly with her eye i am not sure about the thickness perhaps what i mean to say is that you seem to be a person in the world but not of it your exits and entrances are too mysterious and then you carry me out of italthough i invite myself which is not at all proper  i came down here to see you he said and took a firmer grip on the reins i exist to that extent  thats unworthy of you she cried i dont believe youwould have known i was here unless you had caught eight of me  i should have known it he said  how  because i heard you playing i am sure it was you playing  yes it was i she answered simply but i did not know thatyou heard where were you  i suppose he replied a sane witness would have testified that i was in the streetone of those partial and material truths which are so misleading  she laughed again joyously  seriously why did you come down here she insisted i am not so absorbed in humphreys career that i cannot take an interest in yours in fact yours interests me more because it is more mysterious humphreys she added laughing is charted from day to day and announced in bulletins he is more generous to his friends thanyou  i have nothing to chart said austen except such pilgrimages as thisand these after all are unchartable your friend mr crewe on the other hand is well away on his voyage after the golden fleece i hope he is provided with a lynceus  she was silent for a long time but he was feverishly conscious of her gaze upon him and did not dare to turn his eyes to hers the look in them he beheld without the aid of physical vision and in that look was the worldold riddle of her sex typified in the image on the african desert which napoleon had tried to read and failed and while wisdom was in the look there was in it likewise the eternal questioning of a fate quite as inscrutable against which wisdom would avail nothing it was that look which for austen revealed in her in their infinite variety all women who had lived those who could resist and those who could yield and yielding all bestow a gift which left them still priceless those to whom sorrow might bring sadness and knowledge mourning and yet could rob them of no jot of sweetness and knowing this he knew that to gain her now could such a high prize be gained would be to lose her if he were anything to her realize it or not as she might it was because he found strength to resist this greatest temptation of his life yield and his guerdon was lost and he would be austen vane no longeryield and his right to act which would make him of value in her eyes as well as in his own was gone forever  well he knew what the question in her eyes meant or something of what it meant so inexplicably is the soul of woman linked to events he had pondered often on that which she had asked him when he had brought her home over the hills in the autumn twilight he remembered her words and the very inflection of her voice then you wont tell me how could he tell her he became aware that she was speaking now in an even tone  i had an odd experience this morning when i was waiting for mrs pomfret outside the statehouse she said a man was standing looking up at the statue of the patriot with a strange rapt expression on his facesuch a good faceand he was so big and honest and uncompromising i wanted to talk to him i didnt realize that i was staring at him so hard because i was trying to remember where i had seen him beforeand then i remembered suddenly that it was with you  with me austen repeated  you were standing with him in front of the little house when i save you yesterday his name was redbrook it appears that he had seen me victoria replied when i went to mercer to call on zeb meader and he asked me if i knew you  of course you denied it said austen  i couldnt very well laughed victoria because you had confessed to the acquaintance first  he merely wished to have the fact corroborated mr redbrook is a man who likes to be sure of his ground  he told me a very interesting thing about you she continued slowly with her eye upon austens profile he said that a great many men wanted you to be their candidate for governor of the statemore than you had any idea ofand that you wouldnt consent mr redbrook grew so enthusiastic that he forgot for the moment myrelationship to the railroad he is not the only person with whom i have talked who hasforgotten it or hasnt known of it  austen was silent  why wont you be a candidate she asked in a low voice if such men as that want you  i am afraid mr redbrook exaggerates he said the popular demand of which he spoke is rather mythical and i should be inclined to accuse him too of a friendly attempt to install me in your good graces  no answered victoria smiling with serious eyes i wont be put off that way mr redbrook isnt the kind of man that exaggeratesive seen enough of his type to know that and he told me about yourreception last night at the widow peasleys you wouldnt have told me she added reproachfully  he laughed  it was scarcely a subject i could have ventured he said  but i asked you she objected now tell me why did you refuse to be their candidate it wasnt because you were not likely to get elected was it  he permitted himself a glance which was a tribute of admirationa glance which she returned steadfastly  it isnt likely that i should have been elected he answered but you are rightthat is not the reason i refused  i thought not she said i did not believe you were the kind of man to refuse for that reason and you would have been elected  what makes you think so he asked curiously  i have been thinking since i saw you lastyes and i have been making inquiries i have been trying to find out thingswhich you will not tell me she paused with a little catch of her breath and went on again do you believe i came all the way up here just to hear humphrey crewe make a speech and to drive with him in a high sleigh and listen to him talk about his career when serious men of the people like mr redbrook and that nice mr jenney at leith and a lot of others who do not ordinarily care for politics are thinking and indignant i have come to the conclusion there must be a cause for it they say that the railroad governs them through disreputable politiciansand ii am beginning to believe it is true i have had some of the politicians pointed out to me in the legislature and they look like it  austen did not smile she was speaking quietly but he saw that she was breathing deeply and he knew that she possessed a courage which went far beyond that of most women and an insight into life and affairs  i am going to find out she said whether these things are true  and then he asked involuntarily  if they are true i am going to tell my father about them and ask him to investigate nobody seems to have the courage to go to him  austen did not answer he felt the implication he knew that without realizing his difficulties and carried on by a feeling long pent up she had measured him unjustly and yet he felt no resentment and no shock perhaps he might feel that later now he was filled only with a sympathy that was yet another common bond between them suppose she did find out he knew that she would not falter until she came to the end of her investigation to the revelation of mr flints code of business ethics should the revolt take place she would be satisfied with nothing less than the truth even as he austen vane had not been satisfied and he thought of the lifelong faith that would be broken thereby  they had made the circle of the hills and the sparkling lights of the city lay under them like blue diamond points in the twilight of the valley the crests behind them deepened in purple as the saffron faded in the west and a gossamer cloud of tyrian dye floated over holdfast in silence they turned for a last lingering look and in silence went down the slope into the world again and through the streets to the driveway of the duncan house it was only when they had stopped before the door that she trusted herself to speak  i ought not to have said what i did she began in a low voice i didnt realizebut i cannot understand you  you have said nothing which you need ever have cause to regret he replied he was too great for excuses too great for any sorrow save what she herself might feel as great as the silent hills from which he came  she stood for a moment on the edge of the steps her eyes lustrousyet gazing into his with a searching troubled look that haunted him for many days but her selfcommand was unshaken her power to control speech was the equal of his and this power of silence in her revealed in such instantswas her greatest fascination for austen the thing which set her apart among women which embodied for him the whole charm and mystery of her sex  goodby she said simply  goodby he said and seized her handand drove away  without ringing the bell victoria slipped into the hallfor the latch was not caughtand her first impulse was to run up the staircase to her room but she heard mrs pomfrets voice on the landing above and fled as to a refuge into the dark drawingroom where she stood for a moment motionless listening for the sound of his sleighbells as they fainted on the winters night then she seated herself to think if she could though it is difficult to think when ones heart is beating a little wildly it was victorias nature to think things out for the first time in her life she knew sorrow and it made it worse that that sorrow was indefinable she felt an accountable attraction for this man who had so strangely come into her life whose problems had suddenly become her problems but she did not connect the attraction for austen vane with her misery she recalled him as he had left her big and strong and sorrowful with a yearning look that was undisguised and while her faith in him came surging back again she could not understand  gradually she became aware of mens voices and turned with a start to perceive that the door of the library was open and that humphrey crewe and another were standing in the doorway against the light with an effort of memory she identified the other man as the mr tooting who had made himself so useful at mr crewes garden party  i told you i could make you governor mr crewe mr tooting was saying say why do you think the northeastern crowdwhy do you think hilary vane is pushing your bills down the sidings ill tell you because they know youre a man of ability and theyre afraid of you and they know youre a gentleman and cant be trusted with their deals so they just shunted you off at kodunk with a jolly about sendin you to congress if you made a hit on a national speech ive been in the business a good many years and ive seen and done some things for the northeastern that stick in my throatat this point victoria sat down again and gripped the arms of her chair i dont like to see a decent man sawbucked the way theyre teeterin you mr crewe i know what im talkin about and i tell you that ridout and jake botcher and brush bascom havent any more notion of lettin your bills out of committee than they have gaylords why because theyve got orders not to  youre making some serious charges mr tooting said mr crewe  and whats more i can prove em you know yourself that anybody who talks against the northeastern is booted down and blacklisted youve seen that havent you  i have observed said mr crewe that things do not seem to be as they should in a free government  and it makes your blood boil as an american citizen dont it it does mine said mr tooting with fine indignation i was a poor boy and had to earn my living but ive made up my mind ive worn the collar long enoughif i have to break rocks and i want to repeat what i said a little while ago he added weaving his thumb into mr crewes buttonhole i know a thing or two and ive got some brains as they know and i can make you governor of this state if youll only say the word its a cinch  victoria started to rise once more and realized that to escape she would have to cross the room directly in front of the two men she remained sitting where she was in a fearful fascination awaiting humphrey crewes answer there was a moments pause  i believe you made the remark mr tooting he said that in your opinion there is enough antirailroad sentiment in the house to pass any bill which the railroad opposes  if a leader was to get up there like you with the arguments i could put into his hands they would make the committee discharge that pingsquit bill of the gaylords and pass it  on what do you base your opinion asked mr crewe  well said mr tooting i guess im a pretty shrewd observer and have had practice enough but you know austen vane dont you  victoria held her breath  ive a slight acquaintance with him replied mr crewe ive helped him along in one or two minor legal matters he seems to be a littlewell pushing you might say  i want to tell you one thing about austen continued mr tooting although i dont stand much for old hilary id take austen vanes opinion on most things as soon as that of any man in the state if he only had some sense about himself he could be governor next timetheres a whole lot that wants him i happen to know some of em offered it to him last night  austen vane governor exclaimed mr crewe with a politely deprecating laugh  it may sound funny said mr tooting stoutly i never understood what he has about him hes never done anything but buck old hilary in that damage case and send back a retainer pass to old flint but hes got something in his makeup that gets under your belt and a good many of these old hayseedsll eat out of his hand right now well i dont want this to go any farther youre a gentlemanbut austen came down here yesterday and had the whole thing sized up by last night old hilary thought the gaylords sent for him to lobby their bill through they may have sent for him all right but he wouldnt lobby for em he could have made a pile of money out of em austen doesnt seem to care about moneyhes queer he says as long as he has a horse and a few books and a couple of sandwiches a day hes all right hilary had him up in number seven tryin to find out what he came down for and austen told him pretty straightwhat he didnt tell the gaylords either he kind of likes old hilarybecause hes his father i guessand he said there were enough men in that house to turn hilary and his crowd upside down thats how i know for certain if austen vane said it ill borrow money to bet on it declared mr tooting  you dont think young vane is going to get into the race queried mr crewe  no said mr tooting somewhat contemptuously no i tell you he hasnt got that kind of sense he never took any trouble to get ahead and i guess hes sort of sensitive about old hilary itd make a good deal of a scandal in the family with austen as an antirailroad candidate mr tooting lowered his voice to a tone that was caressingly confidential i tell you and you sleep on it a man of your brains and money cant lose its a chance in a million and when you win youve got this little state tight in your pocket and a desk in the millionaires club at washington well so long said mr tooting you think that over  you have at least put things in a new and interesting light said mr crewe i will try to decide what my duty is  your dutys pretty plain to me said mr tooting if i had money id know that the best way to use it is for the peopleaint that so  in the meantime mr crewe continued you may drop in tomorrow at three  youd better make it tomorrow night hadnt you said mr tooting significantly there aint any back way to this house  as you choose said mr crewe  they passed within a few feet of victoria who resisted an almost uncontrollable impulse to rise and confront them the words given her to use were surging in her brain and yet she withheld them why she knew not perhaps it was because after such communion as the afternoon had brought the repulsion she felt for mr tooting aided her to sit where she was she heard the outside door open and close and she saw humphrey crewe walk past her again into his library and that door closed and she was left in darkness darkness indeed for victoria who throughout her life had lived in light alone in the light she had shed and the light which she had kindled in others with a throb which was an exquisite pain she understood now the compassion in austens eyes and she saw so simply and so clearly why he had not told her that her face burned with the shame of her demand the one of all others to whom she could go in this trouble was denied her and his lips were sealed who would have spoken honestly and without prejudice she rose and went quietly out into the biting winter night and stood staring through the trees at the friendly reddened windows of the little cottage across the way with a yearning that passed her understanding out of those windows to victoria shone honesty and truth and the peace which these alone may bring     chapter xiv the descendants of horatius  so the twenty honourable members of the state senate had been dubbed by the man who had a sense of humour and a smattering of the classics because they had been put there to hold the bridge against the tarquins who would invade the dominions of the northeastern twenty picked men and true they were indeed but a better name for their body would have been the life guard of the sovereign the five hundred far below them might rage and at times revolt but the twenty in their shining armour stood undaunted above the vulnerable ground and smiled grimly at the mob the citadel was safe  the real horatius of the stirring time of which we write was that old and tried veteran the honourable brush bascom and spurius lartius might be typified by the indomitable warrior the honourable jacob botcher while the honourable samuel doby of hale speaker of the house was unquestionably herminius how the three held the bridge that year will be told in as few and as stirring words as possible a greater than porsena confronted them and well it was for them and for the empire that the body guard of the twenty stood behind them          lars porsena of clusium         by the nine gods he swore  the morning after the state tribune had printed that memorable speech on national affairsstatistics and all with an editorial which gave every evidence of mr peter pardriffs best sparklemr crewe appeared on the floor of the house with a new look in his eye which made discerning men turn and stare at him it was the look of the great when they are justly indignant when their trustnobly givenhas been betrayed washington for instance must have had just such a look on the battlefield of trenton the honourable jacob botcher pressing forward as fast as his bulk would permit and with the newspaper in his hand was met by a calm and distant manner which discomposed that statesman and froze his stout index finger to the editorial which perhaps mr crewe had not seen  mr crewe was too big for resentment but he knew how to meet people who didnt measure up to his standards yes he had seen the editorial and the weather still continued fine the honourable jacob was left behind scratching his head and presently he sought a front seat in which to think the back ones not giving him room enough the brisk cheery greeting of the honourable brush bascom fared no better but mr bascom was a philosopher and did not disturb the great when their minds were revolving on national affairs and the welfare of humanity in general mr speaker doby and mr ridout got but abstract salutations also and were correspondingly dismayed  that day and for many days thereafter mr crewe spent some timeas was entirely properamong the back seats making the acquaintance of his humbler fellow members of the submerged four hundred and seventy he had too long neglected this so he told them but his mind had been on high matters during many of his mature years he had pondered as to how the welfare of community and state could be improved and the result of that thought was embodied in the bills of which they had doubtless received copies if not down went their names in a leatherbound memorandum and they got copies in the next mails  the delight of some of the simple rustic members at this unbending of a great man may be imagined to tell the truth they had looked with little favour upon the intimacy which had sprung up between him and those tyrannical potentates messrs botcher and bascom and many who had the courage of their convictions expressed then very frankly messrs botcher and bascom were when all was said mere train despatchers of the northeastern who might some day bring on a wreck the like of which the state had never seen mr crewe was in a receptive mood indeed his nature like nebuchadnezzars seemed to have experienced some indefinable and vital change was this the mr crewe the humble rural members had pictured to themselves was this the mr crewe who at the beginning of the session had told them roundly it was their duty to vote for his bills  mr crewe was surprised he said to hear so much sentiment against the northeastern railroads yes he was a friend of mr flintsthey were neighbours in the country but if these charges had any foundation whatever they ought to be looked intothey ought to be taken up a sovereign people should not be governed by a railroad mr crewe was a business man but first of all he was a citizen as a business man he did not intend to talk vaguely but to investigate thoroughly and then if charges should be made he would make them specifically and as a citizen contend for the right  it is difficult to restrain ones pen in dealing with a hero but it is not too much to say that mr crewe impressed many of the country members favourably how indeed could he help doing so his language was moderate his poise that of a man of affairs and there was a look in his eye and a determination in his manner that boded ill for the northeastern if he should after weighing the facts decide that they ought to be flagellated his friendship with mr flint and the suspicion that he might be inclined to fancy mr flints daughter would not influence him in the least of that many of his hearers were sure not a few of them were invited to dinner at the duncan house and shown the library and the conservatory  walk right in said mr crewe you cant hurt the flowers unless you bump against the pots and if you walk straight you cant do that i brought the plants down from my own hothouse in leith those are french geraniumsvery hard to get theyre double you see and dont look like the scrawny things you see in this country yes with a goodnatured smile i guess they do cost something ill ask my secretary what i paid for that plant is that dinner waters come right in gentlemen we wont wait for ceremony  whereupon the delegation would file into the dining room in solemn silence behind the imperturbable waters with dubious glances at mr waters imperturbable understudy in green and buff and silver buttons honest red hands used to milking at five oclock in the morning and hands not so red that measured dry goods over rural counters for insistent female customers fingered in some dismay what seemed an inexplicable array of table furniture  it dont make any difference which fork you take said the goodnatured owner of this palace of luxury only i shouldnt advise you to use one for the soup you wouldnt get much of itwhat yes this house suits me very well it was built by old man duncan you know and his daughter married an italian nobleman and lives in a castle the state ought to buy the house for a governors mansion its a disgrace that our governor should have to live in the pelican hotel and especially in a room next to that of the chief counsel of the northeastern with only a curtain and a couple of folding doors between  thats right declared an upstate member the governor hadnt ought to live next to vane but as to gettin him a house like thiskind of royal aint it couldnt do justice to it on fifteen hundred a year could he costs you a little mite more to live in it dont it  it costs me something mr crewe admitted modestly but then our governors are all rich men or they couldnt afford to pay the northeastern lobby campaign expenses not that i believe in a rich man for governor gentlemen my contention is that the state should pay its governors a sufficient salary to make them independent of the northeastern a salary on which they can live as befits a chief executive  these sentiments and others of a similar tenor were usually received in silence by his rural guests but mr crewe being a broadminded man of human understanding did not set down their lack of response to surliness or suspicion of a motive but rather to the innate caution of the hill farmer and doubtless also to a natural awe of the unwonted splendour with which they were surrounded in a brief time his kindly hospitality became a byword in the capital and fabulous accounts of it were carried home at week ends to toiling wives and sons and daughters to incredulous citizens who sat on cracker boxes and found the sunday papers stale and unprofitable for weeks thereafter the geraniumsthe price of which mr crewe had forgotten to find outwere appraised at four figures and the conservatory became the hanging gardens of babylon under glass the functionary in buff and green and silver buttons and his duties furnished the subject for long and heated arguments and incidentally everybody who had a farm for sale wrote to mr crewe since the motives of every philanthropist and public benefactor are inevitably challenged by cynics there were many who asked the question what did mr crewe want it is painful even to touch upon this when we know that mr crewe was merely doing his duty as he saw it when we know that he spelled the word mentally with a capital d  there were many too who remarked that a touching friendship in the front seats formerly plainly visible to the naked eye from the back had been strainedat least mr crewe still sat with mr botcher and mr bascom but he was not a man to pretend after the fires had cooled the honourable jacob botcher with his eyes shut so tight that his honest face wore an expression of agony seemed to pray every morning for the renewal of that friendship when the chaplain begged the lord to guide the legislature into the paths of truth and the honourable brush bascom wore an air of resignation which was painful to see conversation languished and the cosey and familiar haunts of the pelican knew mr crewe no more  mr crewe never forgot of course that he was a gentleman and a certain polite intercourse existed during the sessions as a matter of fact mr bascom had many things to whisper to mr botcher and mr butcher to mr bascom and in order to facilitate this mr crewe changed seats with the honourable jacob neither was our hero a man to neglect on account of strained relations to insist upon his rights his eyes were open now and he saw men and things political as they were he knew that his bills for the emancipation of the state were prisoners in the maw of the dragon and not likely to see the light of law not a legislative day passed that he did not demand with a firmness and restraint which did him infinite credit that mr bascoms and mr butchers committees report those bills to the house either favourably or unfavourably and we must do exact justice likewise to messrs bascom and butcher they too incited perhaps thereto by mr crewes example answered courteously that the very excellent bills in question were of such weight and importance as not to be decided on lightly and that there were necessary state expenditures which had first to be passed upon mr speaker doby with all the will in the world could do nothing and on such occasions mr crewe could see mr doby bore a striking resemblance to the picture of the mockturtle in alice m wonderlanda fact which had been pointed out by miss victoria flint in truth all three of these gentlemen wore when questioned such a sorrowful and injured air as would have deceived a more experienced politician than the new member from leith the will to oblige was infinite  there was no doubt about the fact that the session was rapidly drawing to a close and likewise that the committees guided by the honourables jacob butcher and brush bascom composed of members carefully picked by that judge of mankind mr doby were wrestling day and night behind closed doors with the intellectual problems presented by the bills of the member from leith it is not to be supposed that a man of mr crewes shrewdness would rest at the word of the chairmen other members were catechized and in justice to messrs bascom and botcher it must be admitted that the assertions of these gentlemen were confirmed it appeared that the amount of thought which was being lavished upon these measures was appalling  by this time mr crewe had made some new friends as was inevitable when such a man unbent three of these friends owned by a singular chance weekly newspapers and having conceived a liking as well as an admiration for him began to say pleasant things about him in their columnswhich mr crewe always thoughtful sent to other friends of his these new and accidental newspaper friends declared weekly that measures of paramount importance were slumbering in committees and cited the measures other friends of mr crewe were so inspired by affection and awe that they actually neglected their business and spent whole days in the rural districts telling people what a fine man mr crewe was and circulating petitions for his bills and incidentally the committees of mr butcher and mr bascom were flooded with these petitions representing the spontaneous sentiment of an aggrieved populace          just then a scout came flying          all wild with haste and fear         to arms to arms sir consul          lars porsena is here         on the low hills to westward          the consul fixed his eye         and saw the swarthy storm of dust          rise fast along the sky  it will not do to push a comparison too far and mr hamilton tooting of course ought not to be made to act the part of tarquin the proud like tarquin however he had been deposedone of those fatuous acts which the wisest will commit no more could the honourable hilary well be likened to pandora for he only opened the box wide enough to allow one mischievous sprite to take wingsone mischievous sprite that was to prove a host talented and invaluable lieutenant that he was mr tooting had become an exile to explain to any audience who should make it worth his while the mysterious acts by which the puppets on the stage were moved and who moved them who for instance wrote the declamation which his excellency asa gray recited as his own mr tooting as we have seen had a remarkable business head and combined with itas austen vane remarkedthe rare instinct of the norway rat which goes down to the sea in shipswhen they are safe burrowing continually amongst the bowels of the vessel mr tooting knew the weak timbers better than the honourable hilary vanes who thought the ship as sound as the day augustus flint had launched her but we have got a long way from horatius in our imagery  little birds flutter around the capital picking up what crumbs they may one of them occasionally fed by that humanitarian the honourable jacob botcher whispered a secret that made the humanitarian knit his brows he was the scout that came flying if by a burst of imagination we can conceive the honourable jacob in this aerial actcame flying to the consul in room number seven with the news that mr hamilton tooting had been detected on two evenings slipping into the duncan house but the consulstrong man that he wasmerely laughed the honourable elisha jane did some scouting on his own account some people are so small as to be repelled by greatness to be jealous of high gifts and power and it was perhaps inevitable that a few of the humbler members whom mr crewe had entertained should betray his hospitality and misinterpret his pure motives  it was a mere coincidence perhaps that after mr janes investigation the intellectual concentration which one of the committees had bestowed on two of mr crewes bills came to an end these bills it is true carried no appropriation and were respectively the acts to incorporate the state economic league and the childrens charities association these suddenly appeared in the house one morning with favourable recommendations and mirabile dicta the end of the day saw them through the senate and signed by the governor at last mr crewe by his excellency had stamped the mark of his genius on the statute books and the honourable jacob botcher holding out an olive branch took the liberty of congratulating him  a vainer man a lighter character than humphrey crewe would have been content to have got something and let it rest at that little mr butcher or mr speaker doby with his sorrowful smile guessed the iron hand within the velvet glove of the leith statesman little they knew the man they were dealing with once aroused he would not be pacified by bribes of cheap olive branches and laurels when the proper time came he would fling down the gauntletbefore rome itself and then let horatius and his friends beware  the hour has struck at lastand the man is not wanting the french revolution found napoleon ready and our own civil war general ulysses grant of that ever memorable session but three days remained and those who had been prepared to rise in the good cause had long since despaired the pingsquit bill and all other bills that spelled liberty were still prisoners in the hands of grim jailers and thomas gaylord the elder had worn several holes in the carpet of his private room in the pelican and could often be descried from main street running up and down between the windows like a caged lion while young tom had been spied standing with his hands in his pockets smiling on the world  young tom had his own way of doing things though he little dreamed of the help heaven was to send him in this matter there was in the lower house a young man by the name of harper a lawyer from brighton who was sufficiently eccentric not to carry a pass the light of fame as the sunset gilds a weathercock on a steeple sometimes touches such men for an instant and makes them immortal the name of mr harper is remembered because it is linked with a greater one but mr harper was the first man over the wall  history chooses odd moments for her entrances it was at the end of one of those busy afternoon sessions with a full house when messrs bascom botcher and ridout had done enough of blocking and hacking and hewing to satisfy those doughty defenders of the bridge that a slight unprepossessinglooking young man with spectacles arose to make a motion the honourable jacob botcher with his books and papers under his arm was already picking his way up the aisle nodding genially to such of the faithful as he saw mr bascom was at the speakers desk and mr ridout receiving a messenger from the honourable hilary at the door the speaker not without some difficulty recognized mr harper amidst what seemed the beginning of an exodusand mr harper read his motion  men halted in the aisles and nudged other men to make them stop talking mr harpers voice was not loud and it shook a trifle with excitement but those who heard passed on the news so swiftly to those who had not that the house was sitting or standing in amazed silence by the time the motion reached the speaker who had actually risen to receive it mr doby regarded it for a few seconds and raised his eyes mournfully to mr harper himself as much as to say that he would give the young man a chance to take it back if he couldif the words had not been spoken which would bring the offender to the block in the bloom and enthusiasm of youth misguided mr harper had committed unutterable treason to the empire  the gentleman from brighton mr harper said the speaker sadly offers the following resolution and moves its adoption resolved that the committee on incorporations be instructed to report house bill number 302 entitled an act to incorporate the pingsquit railroad by eleventhirty oclock tomorrow morningthe gentleman from putnam mr bascom  the house listened and looked on entranced as though they were the spectators to a tragedy and indeed it seemed as though they were necks were craned to see mr harper he didnt look like a hero but one never can tell about these little men he had hurled defiance at the northeastern railroads and that was enough for mr redbrook and mr widgeon and their friends who prepared to rush into the fray trusting to heaven for speech and parliamentary law o for a leader now horatius is on the bridge scarce concealing his disdain for this puny opponent and lartius and herminius not taking the trouble to arm mr bascom will crush this one with the flat of his sword  mr speaker said that gentleman informally as chairman of the committee on incorporations i rise to protest against such an unheardof motion in this house the very essence of orderly procedure of effective business depends on the confidence of the house in its committees and in all of my years as a member i have never known of such a thing gentlemen of the house your committee are giving to this bill and other measures their undivided attention and will report them at the earliest practicable moment i hope that this motion will be voted down  mr bascom with a glance around to assure himself that most of the hundred members of the newcastle delegationvassals of the winona corporation and subject to the empirehad not made use of their passes and boarded as usual the six oclock train took his seat a buzz of excitement ran over the house a dozen men were on their feet including the plainly agitated mr harper himself but who is this in the lunar cockpit before the speakers desk demanding firmly to be heardso firmly that mr harper with a glance at him sits down again so firmly that mr speaker doby hypnotized by an eye makes the blunder that will eventually cost him his own head  the gentleman from leith mr crewe  as though sensing a drama the mutterings were hushed once more mr jacob botcher leaned forward and cracked his seat but none even those who had tasted of his hospitality recognized that the black knight had entered the liststhe greatest deeds of this world and the heroes of them coming unheralded out of the plain clay mr crewe was the calmest man under the roof as he saluted the speaker walked up to the clerks desk turned his back to it and leaned both elbows on it and he regarded the sea of faces with the identical selfpossession he had exhibited when he had made his famous address on national affairs he did not raise his voice at the beginning but his very presence seemed to compel silence and curiosity was at fever heat what was he going to say  gentlemen of the house said mr crewe i have listened to the gentleman from putnam with someamusement he has made the statement that he and his committee are giving to the pingsquit bill and other measuressome other measurestheir undivided attention of this i have no doubt whatever he neglected to define the species of attention he is giving themi should define it as the kindly care which the warden of a penitentiary bestows upon his charges  mr crewe was interrupted here the submerged four hundred and seventy had had time to rub their eyes and get their breath to realize that their champion had dealt mr bascom a blow to cleave his helm and a roar of mingled laughter and exultation arose in the back seats and there was more craning to see the glittering eyes of the honourable brush and the expressions of his two companionsinarms mr speaker doby beat the stone with his gavel while mr crewe continued to lean back calmly until the noise was over  gentlemen he went on i will enter at the proper time into a situationknown i believe to most of youthat brings about a condition of affairs by which the gentlemans committee or the gentleman himself with his capacious pockets does not have to account to the house for every bill assigned to him by the speaker i have taken the trouble to examine a little into the gentlemans past recordhe has been chairman of such committees for years past and i find no trace that bills inimical to certain great interests have ever been reported back by him the pingsquit bill involves the vital principle of competition i have read it with considerable care and believe it to be in itself a good measure which deserves a fair hearing i have had no conversation whatever with those who are said to be its promoters if the bill is to pass it has little enough time to get to the senate by the gentleman from putnams own statement his committee have given it its share of attention and i believe this house is entitled to know the verdict is entitled to accept or reject a report i hope the motion will prevail  he sat down amidst a storm of applause which would have turned the head of a lesser man no such personal ovation had been seen in the house for years how the speaker got order how the honourable brush bascom declared that mr crewe would be called upon to prove his statements how mr botcher regretted that a new member of such promise should go off at halfcock how mr ridout hinted that the new member might think he had an animus how mr terry of lee and mr widgeon of hull denounced in plain hill language the northeastern railroads and lauded the man of prominence who had the grit to oppose them need not be gone into mr crewe at length demanded the previous question which was carried and the motion was carried too two hundred and fifty to one hundred and fiftytwo the house adjourned  we will spare the blushes of the hero of this occasion who was threatened with suffocation by an inundation from the back seats in answer to the congratulations and queries he replied modestly that nobody else seemed to have had the sand to do it so he did it himself he regarded it as a matter of duty however unpleasant and unforeseen and if as they said he had been a pioneer education and a knowledge of railroads and the world had helped him whereupon adding tactfully that he desired the evening to himself to prepare for the battle of the morrow of which he foresaw he was to bear the burden he extricated himself from his admirers and made his way unostentatiously out of a side door into his sleigh for the man who had kindled a firethe blaze of which was to mark an epochhe was exceptionally calm not so the only visitor whom waters had instructions to admit that evening  say you hit it just right cried the visitor too exultant to take off his overcoat ive been down through the pelican and there aint been such excitement since snow and giddings had the fight for united states senator in the 80s the place is all torn up and you cant get a room there for love or money they tell me theyve been havin conferences steady in number seven since the session closed and hilary vanes sent for all the federal and state officeholders to be here in the morning and lobby botcher and jane and bascom are circulatin like hot water tellin everybody that because they wouldnt saddle the state with a debt with your bills you turned sour on em and that youre more of a corporation and railroad man than any of em theyve got their machine to working a thousand to the minute and everybody they have a slant on is going into line one of them fellers a conductor told me he had to go with em but our boys aint idle i can tell you that i was in the back of the gallery when you spoke up and i shook em off the leash right away  mr crewe leaned back from the table and thrust his hands in his pockets and smiled he was in one of his delightful moods  take off your overcoat tooting he said youll find one of my best political cigars over there in the usual place  well i guessed about right didnt i inquired mr tooting biting off one of the political cigars i gave you a pretty straight tip didnt i that young tom gaylord was goin to have somebody make that motion today but say its funny he couldnt get a better one than that feller harper if you hadnt come along theyd have smashed him to pulp ill bet the most surprised man in the state tonight next to brush bascom is young tom gaylord its a wonder he aint been up here to thank you  maybe he has been replied mr crewe i told waters to keep everybody out tonight because i want to know exactly what im going to say on the floor tomorrow i dont want em to give me trouble did you bring some of those papers with you  mr tooting fished a bundle from his overcoat pocket the papers in question of which he had a great number stored away in ripton represented the foresight on mr tootings part of years he was a young man with a praiseworthy ambition to get on in the world and during his apprenticeship in the office of the honourable hilary vane many letters and documents had passed through his hands a less industrious person would have neglected the opportunity mr tooting copied them and some which would have gone into the wastebasket he laid carefully aside bearing in mind the adage about little scraps of paperif there is one at any rate he now had a manuscript collection which was unique in its way which would have been worth much to a great many men and with characteristic generosity he was placing it at the disposal of mr crewe  mr crewe in reading them had other sensations he warmed with indignation as an american citizen that a man should sit in a mahogany office in new york and dictate the government of a free and sovereign state and he found himself in the grip of a righteous wrath when he recalled what mr flint had written to him as a neighbour it will give me the greatest pleasure to help you to the extent of my power but the northeastern railroads cannot interfere in legislative or political matters the effrontery of it was appalling where he demanded of mr tooting did the common people come in and this extremely pertinent question mr tooting was unable to answer  but the wheels of justice had begun to turn  mr tooting had not exaggerated the tumult and affright at the pelican hotel the private telephone in number seven was busy all evening while more or less prominent gentlemen were using continually the public ones in the boxes in the reading room downstairs the feudal system was showing what it could do and the word had gone out to all the holders of fiefs that the vassals should be summoned the duke of putnam had sent out a general call to the officeholders in that county theirs not to reason whybut obey and some of them late as was the hour were already travelling free towards the capital even the congressional delegation in washington had received telegrams and sent them again to federal officeholders in various parts of the state if mr crewe had chosen to listen he could have heard the tramp of armed men but he was not of the metal to be dismayed by the prospect of a great conflict he was as cool as cromwell and after mr tooting had left him to take charge once more of his own armies in the yield the genlemon from leith went to bed and slept soundly  the day of the battle dawned darkly with great flakes flying as early as seven oclock the later cohorts began to arrive and were soon as thick as bees in the pelican circulating in the lobby conferring in various rooms of which they had the numbers with occupants in bed and out a wonderful organization that feudal system which could mobilize an army overnight and each unit of it like the bee working unselfishly for the good of the whole like the bee flying straight for the object to be attained every member of the house from putnam county for instance was seen by one of these indefatigable captains and if the member had a mortgage or an ambition or a wife and family that made life a problem or a situation on the railroad or in some of the larger manufacturing establishments let him beware if he lived in lodgings in the town he stuck his head out of the window to perceive a cheery neighbour from the country on his doorstep think of a system which could do this not for putnam county alone but for all the counties in the state  the honourable hilary vane captaingeneral of the forces had had but four hours sleep and his excellency the honourable asa gray when he arose in the twilight of the morning had to step carefully to avoid the cigar butts on the floor whichlike so many empty cartridge shells were unpleasant reminders that a rebellion of no mean magnitude had arisen against the power to which he owed allegiance and by the favour of which he was attended with pomp and circumstance wherever he chose to go  long before eleven oclock the paths to the statehouse were thronged with people beside the officeholders and their friends who were in town there were many residents of the capital city in the habit of going to hear the livelier debates not that the powers of the empire had permitted debates on most subjects but there could be no harm in allowing the lower house to discuss as fiercely as they pleased dog and sheep laws and hedgehog bounties but now the oldest resident couldnt remember a case of high treason and rebellion against the northeastern such as this promised to be and the sensation took on an added flavour from the fact that the arch rebel was a figure of picturesque interest a millionaire with money enough to rent the duncan house and fill its longdisused stable with horses who was a capitalist himself and a friend of mr flints of whom it was said that he was going to marry mr flints daughter  long before eleven too the chiefs over tens and the chiefs over hundreds had gathered their men and marched them into the statehouse and mr tooting who was everywhere that morning noticed that some of these led soldiers had pieces of paper in their hands the chaplain arose to pray for guidance and the house was crowded to its capacity and the gallery filled with eager and expectant facesbut the hero of the hour had not yet arrived when at length he did walk down the aisle as unconcernedly as though he were an unknown man entering a theatre feminine whispers of there he is could plainly be heard above the buzz and simultaneous applause broke out in spots causing the speaker to rap sharply with his gavel poor mr speaker doby he looked more like the mockturtle than ever and might have exclaimed too that once he had been a real turtle only yesterday in fact before he had made the inconceivable blunder of recognizing mr humphrey crewe mr speaker doby had spent a part of the night in room number seven listening to things about himself herminius the unspeakable has given the enemy a foothold in rome  apparently unaware that he was the centre of interest mr crewe carrying a neat little bag full of papers took his seat beside the honourable jacob botcher nodding to that erstwhile friend as a man of the world should and mr botcher not to be outdone nodded back  we shall skip over the painful interval that elapsed before the bill in question was reached painful at least for every one but mr crewe who sat with his knees crossed and his arms folded the hosts were facing each other awaiting the word the rebels prayerfully watching their gallant leader and the loyal vassalswhose wavering ranks had been added to overnightwith their eyes on mr bascom and in justice to that veteran it must be said despite the knockout blow he had received that he seemed as debonair as ever         now while the three were tightening         the harness on their backs  mr speaker doby read many committee reports and at the beginning of each there was a stir of expectation that it might be the signal for battle but at length he fumbled among his papers cleared away the lump in his throat and glanced significantly at mr bascom  the committee on incorporations to whom was referred house bill number 302 entitled an act to incorporate the pingsquit railroad having considered the same report the same with the following resolution resolved that it is inexpedient to legislate brush bascom for the committee gentlemen are you ready for the question as many as are of opinion that the report of the committee should be adoptedthe gentleman from putnam mr bascom  again let us do exact justice and let us not be led by our feelings to give a prejudiced account of this struggle the honourable brush bascom skilled from youth in the use of weapons opened the combat so adroitly that more than once the followers of his noble opponent winced and trembled the bill mr bascom said would have been reported that day anywaya statement received with mingled cheers and jeers then followed a brief and somewhat intimate history of the gaylord lumber company not at all flattering to that corporation mr bascom hinted at an animus there was no more need for a railroad in the pingsquit valley than there was for a merrygoround in the cellar of the statehouse loud laughter from everybody some irreverent person crying out that a merrygoround was better than poker tables when mr bascom came to discuss the gentleman from leith and recited the names of the committees for which mr crewein his desire to be of service to the state had applied there was more laughter even amongst mr crewes friends and mr speaker doby relaxed so far as to smile sadly mr bascom laid his watch on the clerks desk and began to read the list of bills mr crewe had introduced and as this reading proceeded some of the lightminded showed a tendency to become slightly hysterical mr bascom said that he would like to see all those bills grow into lawswith certain slight changesbut that he could not conscientiously vote to saddle the people with another civil war debt it was well for the state he hinted that those committees were composed of stanch men who would do their duty in all weathers regardless of demagogues who sought to gratify inordinate ambitions  the hope of the revolutionists bore these strokes and others as mighty with complacency as though they had been so many playful taps and while the battle surged hotly around him he sat calmly listening or making occasional notes with a gold pencil born leader that he was he was biding his time mr bascoms attack was met valiantly but unskillfully from the back seats the honourable jacob botcher arose and filled the hall with extracts from the book of argumentsin which he had been coached overnight by the honourable hilary vane mr botchers tone towards his erstwhile friend was regretfula good man gone wrong through impulse and inexperience i am sir said mr bascom to the speaker sincerely sorrysincerely sorry that an individual of such ability as the member from leith should be led by the representations of political adventurers and brigands and malcontents into his present deplorable position of criticising a state which is his only by adoption the political conditions of which were as sound and as free from corporate domination sir as those of any state in the broad union loud cheers this appeal to state pride by mr botches is a master stroke and the friends of the champion of the liberties of the people are beginning some of them to be a little nervous and doubtful  following mr botches were wild and scattering speeches from the back benchesunskillful and pitiable counterstrokes where was the champion had he been tampered with overnight and persuaded of the futility of rebellion persuaded that his head would be more useful on his own neck in the councils of the nation than on exhibition to the populace from the point of a pike it looks to a calm spectator from the gallery as though the rebel forces are growing weaker and more demoralized every moment mr redbrooks speech vehement and honest helps a little people listen to an honest and forceful man however he may lack technical knowledge but the majority of the replies are mere incoherent denunciations of the northeastern railroads  on the other hand the astounding discipline amongst the legions of the empire excites the admiration and despair even of their enemies there is no random fighting here and breaking of ranks to do useless hacking a grave farmer with a beard delivers a short and temperate speech which he has by heart mildly inquiring what the state would do without the northeastern railroads and the very moderation of this query coming from a plain and hardheaded agriculturist the boss of grenville if one but knew it has a telling effect and then to cap the climax to make the attitude of the rebels even more ridiculous in the minds of thinking people mr ridout is given the floor skilled in debate when he chooses to enter it his knowledge of the law only exceeded by his knowledge of how it is to be evadedto lartius is assigned the task of following up the rout and mr crewe has ceased taking notes  when the house leader and attorney for the northeastern took his seat the victory to all appearances was won it was a victory for conservatism and established order against sensationalism and anarchymr ridout had contrived to make that clear without actually saying so it was as if the ute indians had sought to capture washington and conduct the government just as ridiculous as that the debate seemed to be exhausted and the longsuffering mr doby was inquiring for the fiftieth time if the house were ready for the question when mr crewe of leith arose and was recognized in three months he had acquired such a remarkable knowledge of the game of parliamentary tactics as to be able patiently to wait until the bolt of his opponents had been shot and a glance sufficed to revive the drooping spirits of his followers and to assure them that their leader knew what he was about  mr speaker he said i have listened with great care to the masterly defence of that corporation on which our material prosperity and civic welfare is founded laughter i have listened to the gentlemans learned discussion of the finances of that road tending to prove that it is an eleemosynary institution on a grand scale i do not wish to question unduly the intellects of those members of this house who by their votes will prove that they have been convinced by the gentlemans argument here mr crewe paused and drew a slip of paper from his pocket and surveyed the back seats but i perceive he continued that a great interest has been taken in this debateso great an interest that since yesterday numbers of gentlemen have come in from various parts of the state to listen to it laughter and astonishment gentlemen who hold federal and state offices renewed laughter and searching of the house i repeat mr speaker that i do not wish to question the intellects of my fellowmembers but i notice that many of them who are seated near the federal and state officeholders in question have in their hands slips of paper similar to this and i have reason to believe that these slips were written by somebody in room number seven of the pelican hotel tremendous commotion and craning to see whether ones neighbour has a slip the faces of the redoubtable three a study  i procured one of these slips mr crewe continued through a fellowmember who has no use for itwhose intelligence in fact is underrated by the gentlemen in number seven i will read the slip  vote yes on the question yes means that the report of the committee will be accepted and that the pingsquit bill will not pass wait for bascoms signal and destroy this paper  there was no need indeed for mr crewe to say any more than thatno need for the admirable discussion of railroad finance from an experts standpoint which followed to controvert mr ridouts misleading statements the reading of the words on the slip of paper of which he had so mysteriously got possession through mr hamilton tooting was sufficient to bring about a disorder that for a full minutemr speaker doby found it impossible to quell the gallery shook with laughter and honourable members with slips of paper in their hands were made as conspicuous as if they had been caught wearing dunces caps  it was then only with belated wisdom that mr bascom and his two noble companions gave up the fight and let the horde across the bridgetoo late as we shall see the populace led by a redoubtable leader have learned their strength it is true that the shining senatorial twenty of the bodyguard stand ready to be hacked to pieces at their posts before the pingsquit bill shall become a law and should unutterable treason take place here his excellency is prepared to be drawn and quartered rather than sign it it is the senate which in this somewhat inaccurate repetition of history hold the citadel if not the bridge and in spite of the howling mob below their windows scornfully refuse even to discuss the pingsquit bill the honourable hilary vane whose face they study at dinner time is not worried popular wrath does not continue to boil and many changes will take place in the year before the legislature meets again  this is the honourable hilarys public face but are there not private conferences in room number seven of which we can know nothingexceedingly uncomfortable conferences for horatius and his companions are there not private telegrams and letters to the president of the northeastern in new york advising him that the pingsquit bill has passed the house and that a certain mr crewe is primarily responsible and are there not querieswhich history may disclose in after yearsas to whether mr crewes abilities as a statesman have not been seriously underrated by those who should have been the first to perceive them verily pride goeth before a fall  in this modern version of ours the fathers throng about another than horatius after the session of that memorable morning publicly and privately mr crewe is being congratulated and we know enough of his character to appreciate the modesty with which the congratulations are accepted he is the same humphrey crewe that he was before he became the cornerstone of the temple success is a mere outward and visible sign of intrinsic worth in the inner man and mr crewe had never for a moment underestimated his true value  theres no use wasting time in talking about it he told the grateful members who sought to press his hands go home and organize ive got your name get your neighbours into line and keep me informed ill pay for the postagestamps im no impractical reformer and if were going to do this thing well have to do it right  they left him impressed by the force of this argument with an added respect for mr crewe and a vague feeling that they were pledged to something which made not a few of them a trifle uneasy mr redbrook was one of these  the felicitations of his newfound friend and convert mr tooting mr crewe cut short with the terseness of a born commander  never mind that he said and follow em up and get em pledged if you can  get em pledged pledged to what mr tooting evidently knew for he wasted no precious moments in asking questions  there is no time at this place to go into the feelings of mr tom gaylord the younger when he learned that his bill had passed the house he too meeting mr crewe in the square took the opportunity to express his gratitude to the member from leith  come in on friday afternoon gaylord answered mr crewe ive got several things to talk to you about your general acquaintance around the state will be useful and there must be men you know of in the lumber sections who can help us considerably  help us repeated young tom in same surprise  certainly replied mr crewe you dont think were going to drop the fight here do you weve got to put a stop in this state to political domination by a railroad and as long as there doesnt seem to be anyone else to take hold im going to your bills a good bill and well pass it next session  young tom regarded mr crewe with a frank stare  im going up to the pingsquit valley on friday he answered  then youd better come up to leith to see me as soon as you get back said mr crewe these things cant wait and have to be dealt with practically  young tom had not been the virtual head of the gaylord company for some years without gaining a little knowledge of politics and humanity the invitation to leith he valued of course but he felt that it would not do to accept it with too much ardour he was he said a very busy man  thats the trouble with most people declared mr crewe they wont take the time to bother about politics and then they complain when things dont go right now im givin my time to it when ive got other large interests to attend to  on his way back to the pelican young tom halted several times reflectively as certain points in this conversation which he seemed to have missed at the timecame back to him his gratitude to mr crewe as a public benefactor was profound of course but young toms sense of humour was peculiar and he laughed more than once out loud at nothing at all then he became grave again and went into the hotel and wrote a long letter which he addressed to mr austen vane  and now before this chapter which contains these memorable events is closed one more strange and significant fact is to be chronicled on the evening of the day which saw mr crewe triumphantly leading the insurgent forces to victory that gentleman sent his private secretary to the office of the state tribune to leave an order for fifty copies of the paper to be delivered in the morning morning came and the fifty copies and mr crewes personal copy in addition were handed to him by the faithful waters when he entered his dining room at an early hour life is full of disillusions could this be the state tribune he held in his hand the state tribune of mr peter pardriff who had stood so staunchly for mr crewe and better things who had hitherto held the words of the leith statesman in such golden estimate as to curtail advertising columns when it was necessary to print them for the public good  mr crewes eye travelled from column to column from page to page in vain by some incredible oversight on the part of mr pardriff the ringing words were not therenay the soulstirring events of that eventful day appeared on closer inspection to have been deliberately edited out the terrible indignation of the righteous arose as mr crewe read in the legislative proceedings of the day before that the pingsquit bill had been discussed by certain membersof whom he was oneand passed this was allliterally all if mr pardriff had lived in the eighteenth century he would probably have referred as casually to the boston massacre as a street fightwhich it was  profoundly disgusted with human kindas the noblest of us will be at timesmr crewe flung down the paper and actually forgot to send the fifty copies to his friends     chapter xv the disturbance of june seventh  after mr speaker doby had got his gold watch from an admiring and apparently reunited house and had wept over it the legislature adjourned this was about the first of april that sloppiest and windiest of months in a northern climate and mr crewe had intended as usual to make a little trip southward to a club of which he was a member a sense of duty instead took him to leith where he sat through the days in his study dictating letters poring over a great map of the state which he had hung on the wall and scanning long printed lists if we could stand behind him we should see that these are what are known as checklists or rosters of the voters in various towns  mr crewe also has an unusual number of visitors for this muddy weather when the snowwater is making brooks of the roads interested observersif there were anymight have remarked that his friendship with mr hamilton tooting had increased that gentleman coming up from ripton at least twice a week and aiding mr crewe to multiply his acquaintances by bringing numerous strangers to see him mr tooting as we know had abandoned the law office of the honourable hilary vane and was now engaged in travelling over the state apparently in search of health these were signs surely which the wise might have read with profit in the offices for instance of the honourable hilary vane in ripton square where seismic disturbances were registered but the movement of the needle to the honourable hilarys eye was almost imperceptible what observer however experienced would have believed that such delicate tracings could herald a volcanic eruption  throughout the month of april the needle kept up its persistent registering and the honourable hilary continued to smile the honourable jacob botcher who had made a trip to ripton and had cited that very decided earthquake shock of the pingsquit bill had been ridiculed for his pains and had gone away again comforted by communion with a strong man the honourable jacob had felt little shocks in his fief mr tooting had visited it sitting with his feet on the tables of hotel waitingrooms holding private intercourse with gentlemen who had been disappointed in office mr tooting had likewise been a sojourner in the domain of the duke of putnam but the honourable brush was not troubled and had presented mr tooting with a cigar  in spite of the strange omission of the state tribune to print his speech and to give his victory in the matter of the pingsquit bill proper recognition mr crewe was too big a man to stop his subscription to the paper conscious that he had done his duty in that matter neither praise nor blame could affect him and although he had not been mentioned since he read it assiduously every afternoon upon its arrival at leith feeling confident that mr peter pardriff who had always in private conversation proclaimed himself emphatically for reform would not eventually refuseto a prophetpublic recognition one afternoon towards the end of that month of april when the sun had made the last snowdrift into a pool mr crewe settled himself on his south porch and opened the state tribune and his heart gave a bound as his eye fell upon the following heading to the leading editorial       a worthy public servant for governor  had his reward come at last had mr peter pardriff seen the error of his way mr crewe leisurely folded back the sheet and called to his secretary who was never far distant  look here he said i guess pardriffs recovered his senses look here  the tired secretary ready with his pencil and notebook to order fifty copies responded staring over his employers shoulder it has been said of men in battle that they have been shot and have run forward some hundred feet without knowing what has happened to them and so mr crewe got five or six lines into that editorial before he realized in full the baseness of mr pardriffs treachery  these are times so ran mr pardriffs composition when the sure and steadying hand of a strong man is needed at the helm of state a man of conservative business habits of mind a man who weighs the value of traditions equally with the just demands of a new era a man with a knowledge of public affairs derived from long experience  a man who has never sought office but has held it by the will of the people and who himself is a proof that the conduct of state institutions in the past has been just and equitable one who has served with distinction upon such boards as the railroad commission the board of equalization etc etc  a stanch republican one who puts party before here the newspaper began to shake a little and mr crewe could not for the moment see whether the next word were place or principle he skipped a few lines the tribune it appeared had a scintillating idea which surely must have occurred to others in the state why not the honourable adam b hunt of edmundton for the next governor  the honourable adam b hunt of edmundton  it is a pleasure to record at this crisis that mr crewe fixed upon his secretary as steady an eye as though mr pardriffs bullet had missed its mark  get me he said coolly the state encyclopaedia of prominent men just printed fogarty and co newcastle publishers  the secretary fetched it open at the handsome and lifelike steelengraving of the honourable adam with his broad forehead and kindly twinkling eyes and the tuft of beard on his chin with his ample statesmans coat in natural creases and his white shirtfront and little black tie mr crewe gazed at this work of art long and earnestly the honourable adam b hunt did not in the least have the appearance of a bolt from the blue and then mr crewe read his biography  two things he shrewdly noted about that biography it was placed out of alphabetical order fourth in the book and it was longer than any other with one exception that of mr ridout the capital lawyer mr ridouts place was second in this invaluable volume he being preceded only by a harmless patriarch these facts were laid before mr tooting who was directed by telephone to come to leith as soon as he should arrive in ripton from his latest excursion it was nine oclock at night when that longsuffering and mudbespattered individual put in an appearance at the door of his friends study  because i didnt get on to it answered mr tooting in response to a reproach for not having registered a warningfor he was mr crewes seismograph i knew old adam was on the railroads governors bench but i hadnt any notion hed been moved up to the top of the batting list i told you right ridout was going to be their next governor if you hadnt singed him with the pingsquit bill this was done pretty slick wasnt it hilary got back from new york day before yesterday and pardriff has the editorial today say i always told you pardriff wasnt a reformer didnt i  mr crewe looked pained  i prefer to believe the best of people until i know the worst he said i did not think mr pardriff capable of ingratitude  what mr crewe meant by this remark is enigmatical  he aint replied mr tooting hes grateful for that red ticket he carries around with him when he travels and hes grateful to the honourable adam b hunt for favours to come peter pardriffs a grateful cuss allright all right  mr crewe tapped his fingers on the desk thoughtfully  the need of a reform campaign is more apparent than ever he remarked  mr tooting put his tongue in his cheek and seeing a dreamy expression on his friends face accidentally helped himself to a cigar out of the wrong box  its up to a man with a sense of duty and money to make it mr tooting agreed taking a long pull at the havana  as for the money replied mr crewe the good citizens of the state should be willing to contribute largely i have had a list of men of means prepared who will receive notices at the proper time  mr hamilton tooting spread out his feet and appeared to be studying them carefully  its funny you should have mentioned cash he said after a moments silence and its tough on you to have to be the publicspirited man to put it up at the start ive got a little memorandum here he added fumbling apologetically in his pocket it certainly costs something to move the boys around and keep em indignant  mr tooting put the paper on the edge of the desk and mr crewe without looking reached out his hand for it the pained expression returning to his face  tooting he said youve got a very flippant way of speaking of serious things it strikes me that these expenses are out of all proportion to the simplicity of the task involved it strikes meahem that you might find in some quarters at least a freer response to a movement founded on principle  thats right declared mr tooting ive thought so myself ive got mad and told em so to their faces but youve said yourself mr crewe that weve got to deal with this thing practically  certainly mr crewe interrupted he loved the word  and weve got to get workers havent we and it costs money to move em round dont it we havent got a bushel basket of passes look here and he pushed another paper at mr crewe heres ten new ones whove made up their minds that youre the finest man in the state that makes twenty  mr crewe took that paper deprecatingly but nevertheless began a fire of crossquestions on mr tooting as to the personality habits and occupations of the discerning ten in question making certain little marks of his own against each name thus it will be seen that mr crewe knew perfectly what he was aboutalthough no one else did except mr tooting who merely looked mysterious when questioned on the streets of ripton or newcastle or kingston it was generally supposed however that the gentleman from leith was going to run for the state senate and was attempting to get a following in other counties in order to push through his measures next time hence the tiny fluctuations of hilary vanes seismograph an instrument as will be shown utterly outofdate not so the motto toujours laudace geniuses continue at long intervals to be born and to live up to that motto  that seismograph of the honourable hilarys persisted in tracing only a slightly ragged line throughout the beautiful month of may in which favourable season the campaign of the honourable adam b hunt took root and flourishedapparently from the seed planted by the state tribune the ground as usual had been carefully prepared and trained gardeners raked and watered and weeded the patch it had been decreed and countersigned that the honourable adam b hunt was the flower that was to grow this year  there must be something vitally wrong with an instrument which failed to register the great earthquake shock of june the seventh  now that we have come to the point where this shock is to be recorded on these pages we begin to doubt whether our own pen will be able adequately to register it and whether the sheet is long enough and broad enough upon which to portray the relative importance of the disturbance created the trouble is that there is nothing to measure it by what other event in the history of the state produced the vexation of spirit the anger the tears the profanity the derision the laughter of fools the contempt the hope the glee the prayers the awe the dumb amazement at the superb courage of this act no for a just comparison we shall have to reach back to history and fable david and goliath theseus and the minotaur or better still cadmus and the dragon it was cadmus if we remember rightly who wasted no time whatever but actually jumped down the dragons throat and cut him up from the inside and it was cadmus likewise who afterwards sowed the dragons teeth  that wondrous clear and fresh summer morning of june the seventh will not be forgotten for many years the trees were in their early leaf in ripton square and the dark pine patches on sawanec looked from austens little office like cloud shadows against the shimmer of the tender green he sat at his table which was covered with open lawbooks and papers but his eyes were on the distant mountain and every scentladen breeze wafted in at his open window seemed the bearer of a tremulous wistful yet imperious messagecome throughout the changing seasons sawanec called to him in words of love sometimes her face was hidden by cloud and fog and yet he heard her voice sometimes her perfume as todaymade him dream sometimes when the western heavens were flooded with the golden light of the infinite she veiled herself in magic purple when to gaze at her was an exquisite agony and she became as one forbidden to man though his soul cried out to her across the spaces she was not for him she was not for him  with a sigh he turned to his lawbooks again and sat for a while staring steadfastly at a section of the act of consolidation of the northeastern railroads which he had stumbled on that morning the section if he read its meaning aright was fraught with the gravest consequences for the northeastern railroads if he read its meaning aright the northeastern railroads had been violating it persistently for many years and were liable for unknown sums in damages the discovery of it had dazed him and the consequences resulting from a successful suit under the section would be so great that he had searched diligently though in vain for some modification of it since its enactment why had not some one discovered it before this query appeared to be unanswerable until the simplethough none the less remarkablesolution came to him that perhaps no definite occasion had hitherto arisen for seeking it undoubtedly the railroads attorneys must know of its existencehis own father hilary vane having been instrumental in drawing up the act and a long period had elapsed under which the northeastern railroads had been a law unto themselves  the discovery was of grave import to austen a month before chiefly through the efforts of his friend tom who was gradually taking his fathers place in the gaylord lumber company austen had been appointed junior counsel for that corporation the honourable galusha hammer still remained the senior counsel but was now confined in his house at newcastle by an illness which made the probability of his return to active life extremely doubtful and tom had repeatedly declared that in the event of his nonrecovery austen should have mr hammers place as counsel for the gaylord lumber company it was clearly his duty to call the attention of young mr gaylord to the section and in case mr hammer did not resume his law practice it would fall upon austen himself to bring the suit his opponent in this matter would be his own father  the consequences of this culminating conflict between them the coming of which he had long dreadedalthough he had not foreseen its specific causeweighed heavily upon austen it was tom gaylord himself who abruptly aroused him from his revery by bursting in at the door  have you heard whats up he cried flinging down a newspaper before austens eyes have you seen the guardian  whats the matter now tom  matter exclaimed tom read that your friend and client the honourable humphrey crewe is out for governor  humphrey crewe for governor  on an antirailroad platform i might have known something of the kind was up when he began to associate with tooting and from the way he spoke to me in march but whod have thought hed have the cheek to come out for governor did you ever hear of such tommyrot  austen looked grave  im not sure its such tommyrot he said  not tommyrot tom ejaculated everybodys laughing when i passed the honourable hilarys door just now brush bascom and some of the old liners were there reciting parts of the proclamation and the boys down in the ripton house are having the time of their lives  austen took the guardian and there sure enough filling a leading column and in a little coarser type than the rest of the page he read            down with railroad rule       the honourable humphrey crewe of leith at the request      of twenty prominent citizens consents to become a candidate      for the republican nomination for governor       ringing letter of acceptance in which he denounces the      political power of the northeastern railroads and declares      that the state is governed from a gilded suite of offices in      new pork  the following letter evincing as it does a public opinion thoroughly aroused in all parts of the state against the present disgraceful political conditions speaks for itself the standing and character of its signers give it a status which republican voters cannot ignore  the letter followed it prayed mr crewe in the name of decency and good government to carry the standard of honest men to victory too long had a proud and sovereign state writhed under the heel of an alldevouring corporation too long had the northeastern railroads elected for their own selfish ends governors and legislatures and controlled railroad commissions the spirit of 1776 was abroad in the land it was eminently fitting that the honourable humphrey crewe of leith who had dared to fling down the gauntlet in the face of an arrogant power should be the leader of the plain people to recover the rights which had been wrested from them had he not given the highest proof that he had the peoples interests at heart he was clearly a man who did things  at this point austen looked up and smiled  tom he asked has it struck you that this is written in the same inimitable style as a part of the message of the honourable asa gray  tom slapped his knee  thats exactly what i said i he cried tooting wrote it ill swear to it  and the twenty prominent citizensdo you know any of em tom  well said tom in delighted appreciation ive heard of three of em and thats more than any man ive met can boast of ed dubois cuts my hair when i go to kingston he certainly is a prominent citizen in the fourth ward jim kendall runs the weekly newspaper in grantleyi understood it was for sale bill clements is prominent enough up at groveton he wanted a trolley franchise some years ago you remember  and didnt get it  mr crewes answer was characteristically terse and businesslike the overwhelming compliment of a request from such gentlemen must be treated in the nature of a commandand yet he had hesitated for several weeks during which period he had cast about for another more worthy of the honour then followed a somewhat technical and to the lay mind obscure recapitulation of the iniquities the northeastern was committing which proved beyond peradventure that mr crewe knew what he was talking about such phrases as rolling stock milking the roadan imposing array of facts and figures mr crewe made it plain that he was a man who did things and if it were the will of heaven that he became governor certain material benefits would as inevitably ensue as the day follows the night the list of the material benefits for which there was a crying need bore a strong resemblance to a summary of the worthy measures upon which mr crewe had spent so much time and labour in the last legislature  austen laid down the paper leaned back in his chair and thrust his hands in his pockets and with a little vertical pucker in his forehead regarded his friend  what do you think of that tom demanded now what do you think of it  i think said austen that hell scare the life out of the northeastern before he gets through with them  what exclaimed tom incredulously he had always been willing to accept austens judgment on men and affairs but this was pretty stiff what makes you think so  well people dont know mr crewe for one thing and they are beginning to have a glimmer of light upon the railroad  do you mean to say he has a chance for the nomination  i dont know it depends upon how much the voters find out about him before the convention  tom sat down rather heavily  you could have been governor he complained reproachfully by raising your hand youve got more ability than any man in the state and you sit here gazin at that mountain and lettin a darned fool millionaire walk in ahead of you  austen rose and crossed over to mr gaylords chair and his hands still in his pockets looked down thoughtfully into that gentlemans square and rugged face  tom he said theres no use discussing this delusion of yours which seems to be the only flaw in an otherwise sane character we must try to keep it from the world  tom laughed in spite of himself  im hanged if i understand you he declared but i never did you think crewe and tooting may carry off the governorship and you dont seem to care  i do care said austen briefly he went to the window and stood for a moment with his back to his friend staring across at sawanec tom had learned by long experience to respect these moods although they were to him inexplicable at length austen turned  tom he said can you come in tomorrow about this time if you cant ill go to your office if you will let me know when youll be in theres a matter of business i want to talk to you about  tom pulled out his watch  ive got to catch a train for mercer he replied but i will come in in the morning and see you  a quarter of an hour later austen went down the narrow wooden flight of stairs into the street and as he emerged from the entry almost bumped into the figure of a young man that was hurrying by he reached out and grasped the young man by the collar pulling him up so short as almost to choke him  hully gee cried the young man whose progress had been so rudely arrested great snakes a cough whatre you tryin to do oh apologetically its you aust let me go this day aint long enough for me let me go  austen kept his grip and regarded mr tooting thoughtfully  i want to speak to you ham he said better come upstairs  say aust on the dead i havent time pardriffs waitin for some copy now  just for a minute ham said austen i wont keep you long  leggo my collar then if you dont want to choke me say i dont believe you know how strong you are  i didnt know you wore a collar any more ham said austen  mr tooting grinned in appreciation of this joke  you must think youve got one of your wild west necktie parties on he gasped ill come but if you love me dont let the boys in hilarys office see me  they use the other entry answered austen indicating that mr tooting should go up firstwhich he did when they reached the office austen shut the door and stood with his back against it regarding mr tooting thoughtfully  at first mr tooting returned the look with interest swaggeraggression would be too emphatic and defiance would not do his was the air perhaps of talleyrand when he said there seems to be an inexplicable something in me that brings bad luck to governments that neglect me the air of a man who has made a brilliant coup detat all day he had worn that airsince five oclock in the morning when he had sprung from his pallet the world might now behold the stuff that was in hamilton tooting power flowed out of his right hand from an inexhaustible reservoir which he had had the sagacity to tap and men leaped into action at his touch he the once neglected had the destiny of a state in his keeping  gradually however it became for some strange reason difficult to maintain that aggressive stare upon austen vane who shook his head slowly  ham why did you do it he asked  why cried mr tooting fiercely biting back a treasonable smile why not aint he the best man in the state to make a winner hasnt he got the money and the brains and the getupandgit why its a sure thing ive been around the state and i know the sentiment weve got em licked right now what have you got against it youre on our side aust  ham said austen are you sure you have the names and addresses of those twenty prominent citizens right so that any voter may go out and find em  what are you kidding about aust retorted mr tooting biting back the smile again say you never get down to business with me you dont blame crewe for comin out do you  i dont see how mr crewe could have resisted such an overwhelming demand said austen he couldnt shirk such a duty he says so himself doesnt he  oh go on exclaimed mr tooting who was not able to repress a grin  the letter of the twenty must have been a great surprise to mr crewe he says he was astonished did the whole delegation go up to leith or only a committee  mr tootings grin had by this time spread all over his facea flood beyond his control  well theres no use puffin it on with you aust that was done pretty slick that twentyprominentcitizen business if i do say it myself but you dont know that feller crewehes a fullsize cyclone when he gets started and nothin but a range of mountains could stop him  it must be fairly exciting toride him ham  say but it just is kind of breathless though he aint very well known around the state and he was bound to runand i just couldnt let him come out without any clothes on  i quite appreciate your delicacy ham  mr tootings face took on once more a sheepish look which changed almost immediately to one of disquietude  say ill come back again some day and kid with you ive got to go austthats straight this is my busy day  wouldnt you gain some time if you left by the window austen asked  at this suggestion mr tootings expressive countenance showed genuine alarm  say you aint going to put up any wild west tricks on me are you i heard you nearly flung tom gaylord out of the one in the other room  if this were a less civilized place ham id initiate you into what is known as the bullet dance as it is i have a great mind to speed you on your way by assisting you downstairs  mr hamilton tooting became ashy pale  i havent done anything to you aust sayyou didnt he did not finish  terrified by something in austens eye which may or may not have been there at the time of the blodgett incident mr tooting fled without completing his inquiry and his imagination being great he reproduced for himself such a vivid sensation of a bullethole in his spine that he missed his footing near the bottom and measured his length in the entry such are the humiliating experiences which sometimes befall the talleyrandsbut rarely creep into their biographies  austen from the top of the stairway saw this catastrophe but did not smile he turned on his heel and made his way slowly around the corner of the passage into the other part of the building and paused at the open doorway of the honourable hilarys outer office by the street windows sat the honourable brush bascom sphinxlike absorbing wisdom and clouds of cigar smoke which emanated from the honourable nat billings  howdy austen said brush genially lookin for the honourable hilary flint got up from new york this morning and sent for him a couple of hours ago hell be back at two  have you read the pronunciamento inquired mr billings say austen knowin your sentiments i wonder you werent one of the twenty prominent citizens  all you antirailroad fellers ought to get together mr bascom suggested youve got us terrified since your friend from leith turned the light of publicity on us this morning i hear ham tootings been in and made you an offer  news travels fast in ripton  austen kicked him downstairs said jimmy towle the office boy who had made a breathless entrance during the conversation and felt it to be the psychological moment to give vent to the news with which he was bursting  is that straight mr billings demanded he wished he had done it himself is that straight he repeated but austen had gone  of course its straight said jimmy towle vigorously a shrewd observer of human nature he had little respect for senator billings ned johnson saw him pick himself up at the foot of austens stairway  the honourable brushs agate eyes caught the light and he addressed mr billings in a voice which by dint of long training only carried a few feet  theres the man the northeasterns got to look out for he said the humphrey crewes dont count but if austen vane ever gets started therell be trouble old man flints got some such idea as that too i overheard him givin it to old hilary once up at fairview and hilary said he couldnt control him i guess nobody else can control him i wish id seen him kick ham downstairs  id like to kick him downstairs said mr billings savagely biting off another cigar  i guess you hadnt better try it nat said mr bascom  meanwhile austen had returned to his own office and shut the door his luncheon hour came and went and still he sat by the open window gazing out across the teeming plain and up the green valley whence the blue came singing from the highlands in spirit he followed the water to leith and beyond where it swung in a wide circle and hurried between wondrous hills like those in the backgrounds of the old italians hills of closecropped pastures dotted with shapely sentinel oaks and maples which cast sharp rounded shadows on the slopes at noonday with thin fantastic elms on the gentle skylines and forests massed here and theresilent impenetrable hills from a storybook of a land of mystery the river coursed between them on its rocky bed flinging its myriad gems to the sun this was the vale of the blue and she had touched it with meaning for him and gone  he drew from his coat a worn pocketbook and from the pocketbook a letter it was dated in new york in february and though he knew it by heart he found a strange solace in the pain which it gave him to reread it he stared at the monogram on the paper which seemed so emblematic of her for he had often reflected that her thingseven such minute insignia as thisbelonged to her she impressed them not only with her taste but with her character the entwined letters y f of the design were not he thought of a meaningless frivolous daintiness but stood for something then he read the note again it was only a note     my dear mr vane i have come back to find my mother ill and i am    taking her to france we are sailing unexpectedly tomorrow    there being a difficulty about a passage later i cannot refrain    from sending you a line before i go to tell you that i did you an    injustice you will no doubt think it strange that i should write    to you but i shall be troubled until it is off my mind i am    ashamed to have been so stupid i think i know now why you would    not consent to be a candidate and i respect you for it                      sincerely your friend                      victoria flint  what did she know what had she found out had she seen her father and talked to him that was scarcely possible since her mother had been ill and she had left at once austen had asked himself these questions many times and was no nearer the solution he had heard nothing of her since and he told himself that perhaps it was better after all that she was still away to know that she was at fairview and not to be able to see her were torture indeed  the note was formal enough and at times he pretended to be glad that it was how could it be otherwise and why should he interpret her interest in him in other terms than those in which it was written she had a warm heartthat he knew and he felt for her sake that he had no right to wish for more than the note expressed after several unsuccessful attempts he had answered it in a line i thank you and i understand     chapter xvi the book of arguments is opened  the honourable hilary vane returned that day from fairview in no very equable frame of mind it is not for us to be present at the councils on the palatine when the book of arguments is opened and those fitting the occasion are chosen and sent out to the faithful who own printingpresses and free passes the honourable hilary vane bore away from the residence of his emperor a great many memoranda in an envelope and he must have sighed as he drove through the leafy roads for mr hamilton tooting with his fertile mind and active body a year ago and mr tooting would have seized these memoranda of majesty and covered their margins with new suggestions mr tooting on occasions had even made additions to the book of arguments itselfadditions which had been used in new york and other states with telling effect against mr crewes there mr tooting knew by heart the time of going to press of every country newspaper which had passes in exchange for advertising it was two oclock when the honourable hilary reached his office and by three all the edicts would have gone forth and the grapeshot and canister would have been on their way to demolish the arrogance of this petty lord of leith  tootings a dangerous man vane you oughtnt to have let him go mr flint had said i dont care a snap of my finger for the other fellow  how mr tootings ears would have burned and how his blood would have sung with pride to have heard himself called dangerous by the president of the northeastern  he who during all the valuable years of his services had never had a sign that that potentate was cognizant of his humble existence  the honourable brush bascom as we know was a clever man and although it had never been given him to improve on the book of arguments he had ideas of his own on reading mr crewes defiance that morning he had with characteristic promptitude and a desire to be useful taken the first train out of putnam for ripton to range himself by the side of the honourable hilary in the hour of need the feudal system anticipates and mr bascom did not wait for a telegram  on the arrival of the chief counsel from fairview other captains had put in an appearance but mr bascom alone was summoned by a nod into the private office what passed between them seems too sacred to write about the honourable hilary would take one of the slips from the packet and give it to mr bascom  if that were recommended editorially to the hull mercury it might serve to clear away certain misconceptions in that section  certain mr bascom would reply  it has been thought wise the honourable hilary continued to send an annual to the groveton news roberts his name is suppose you recommend to mr roberts that an editorial on this subject would be timely  slip number two mr bascom marks it roberts subject what would the state do without the railroad  and grenville being a prohibition centre you might get this worked up for the advertiser there  mr bascoms agate eyes are full of light as he takes slip number three subject mr humphrey crewe has the beststocked wine cellar in the state and champagne every night for dinner slip number four taken direct from the second chapter of the book of arguments mr crewe is a reformer because he has been disappointed in his inordinate ambitions etc slip number five mr crewe is a summer resident with a house in new york etc etc  slip number six book of arguments paragraph chapter humphrey crewe defamer of our state assigned among others to the ripton record  paul pardriff went up to leith today said mr bascom  go to see him replied the honourable hilary ive been thinking for some time that the advertising in the ripton record deserves an additional annual  mr bascom having been despatched on this business and having voluntarily assumed control of the empire bureau of publication the chief counsel transacted other necessary legal business with state senator billings and other gentlemen who were waiting at three oclock word was sent in that mr austen vane was outside and wished to speak with his father as soon as the latter was at leisure whereupon the honourable hilary shooed out the minor clients leaned back in his chair and commanded that his son be admitted  judge said austen as he closed the door behind him i dont want to bother you  the honourable hilary regarded his son for a moment fixedly out of his little eyes  humph he said  austen looked down at his father the honourable hilarys expression was not one which would have aroused in the ordinary man who beheld him a feeling of sympathy or compassion it was the impenetrable look with which he had faced his opponents for many years but austen felt compassion  perhaps id better come in another timewhen you are less busy he suggested  who said i was busy inquired the honourable hilary  austen smiled a little sadly one would have thought by that smile that the son was the older and wiser of the two  i didnt mean to cast any reflection on your habitual industry judge he said  humph exclaimed mr vane ive got more to do than sit in the window and read poetry if thats what you mean  you never learned how to enjoy life did you judge he said i dont believe you ever really had a good time own up  ive had sterner things to think about ive had to earn my livingand give you a good time  i appreciate it said austen  humph sometimes i think you dont show it a great deal the honourable hilary answered  i show it as far as i can judge said his son i cant help the way i was made  i try to take account of that said the honourable hilary  austen laughed  ill drop in tomorrow morning he said  but the honourable hilary pointed to a chair on the other side of the desk  sit down todays as good as tomorrow he remarked with sententious significance characteristically throwing the burden of explanation on the visitor  austen found the opening unexpectedly difficult he felt that this was a crisis in their relations and that it had come at an unfortunate hour  judge he said trying to control the feeling that threatened to creep into his voice we have jogged along for some years pretty peaceably and i hope you wont misunderstand what im going to say  the honourable hilary grunted  it was at your request that i went into the law i have learned to like that profession i have stuck to it as well as my wandering bohemian nature will permit and while i do not expect you necessarily to feel any pride in such progress as i have made i have hopedthat you might feel an interest  the honourable hilary grunted again  i suppose i am by nature a freelance austen continued you were good enough to acknowledge the force of my argument when i told you it would be best for me to strike out for myself and i suppose it was inevitable such being the case and you the chief counsel for the northeastern railroads that i should at some time or another be called upon to bring suits against your client it would have been better perhaps if i had not started to practise in this state i did so from what i believe was a desire common to both of us toto live together  the honourable hilary reached for his honey dew but he did not speak  to live together austen repeated i want to say that if i had gone away i believe i should always have regretted the fact he paused and took from his pocket a slip of paper i made up my mind from the start that i would always be frank with you in spite of my desire to amass riches there are some suits against the northeastern which i havesomewhat quixoticallyrefused here is a section of the act which permitted the consolidation of the northeastern railroads you are no doubt aware of its existence  the honourable hilary took the slip of paper in his hand and stared at it the rates for fares and freights existing at the time of the passage of this act shall mot be increased on the roads leased or united under it what his sensations were when he read it no man might have read in his face but his hand trembled a little and along silence ensued before he gave it back to his son with the simple commentwell  i do not wish to be understood to ask your legal opinion although you probably know that lumber rates have been steadily raised and if a suit under that section were successful the gaylord lumber company could recover a very large sum of money from the northeastern railroads said austen having discovered the section i believe it to be my duty to call it to the attention of the gaylords what i wish to know is whether my taking the case would cause you any personal inconvenience or distress if so i will refuse it  no answered the honourable hilary it wont bring suit much use itll be do you expect they can recover under that section  i think it is worth trying said austen  why didnt somebody try it before asked the honourable hilary  see here judge i wish youd let me out of an argument about it suit is going to be brought whether i bring it or another man if you would prefer for any reason that i shouldnt bring iti wont id much rather resign as counsel for the gaylordsand i am prepared to do so  bring suit answered the honourable hilary quickly bring suit by all means and nows your time this seems to be a popular season for attacking the property which is the foundation of the states prosperity book of arguments chapter 3  in spite of himself austen smiled again long habit had accustomed hilary vane to put business considerations before family ties and this habit had been the secret of his particular success and now rather than admit by the least sign the importance of his sons discovery of the statute which he had had in mind for many years and to which he had more than once by the way called mr flints attention the honourable hilary deliberately belittled the matter as part and parcel of the political tactics against the northeastern  sears caused by differences of opinion are soon healed words count for nothing and it is the soul that attracts or repels mr vane was not analytical he had been through a harassing day and he was unaware that it was not austens opposition but austens smile which set the torch to his anger once shortly after his marriage when he had come home in wrath after a protracted quarrel with mr tredway over the orthodoxy of the new minister in the middle of his indignant recital of mr tredways unwarranted attitude sarah austen had smiled the smile had had in it to be sure nothing of conscious superiority but it had been utterly inexplicable to hilary vane he had known for the first time what it was to feel murder in the heart and if he had not rushed out of the room he was sure he would have strangled her after all the hilary vanes of this world cannot reasonably be expected to perceive the humour in their endeavours  now the sons smile seemed the reincarnation of the mothers that smile was in itself a refutation of motive on austens part which no words could have made more emphatic it had in it unconsciously too compassion for and understanding of the honourable hilarys mood and limitations out of the corner of his mental visionwithout grasping itthe honourable hilary perceived this vaguely it was the smile in which a parent privately indulges when a child kicks his toy locomotive because its mechanism is broken it was the smile of one who unforgetful of the scheme of the firmament and the spinning planets will not be moved to anger by him who sees but the four sides of a pit  hilary vane grew red around the eyesa danger signal of the old days  take the suit he said if you dont ill make it known all over the state that you started it ill tell mr flint tomorrow take it do you hear me you ask me if i have any pride in you i answer yes id like to see what you can do ive done what i could for you and now i wash my hands of you goruin yourself if you want to youve always been headed that way and theres no use trying to stop you you dont seem to have any notion of decency or order or any idea of the principle on which this government was based attack property destroy it so much the better for you and your kind join the humphrey crewesyou belong with em give those of us who stand for order and decency as much trouble as you can brand us as rascals trying to enrich ourselves with politics and proclaim yourselves saints nobly striving to get back the rights of the people if you dont bring that suit i tell you ill give you the credit for itand i mean what i say  austen got to his feet his own expression curiously enough had not changed to one of anger his face had set but his eyes held the look that seemed still to express compassion and what he felt was a sorrow that went to the depths of his nature what he had so long fearedwhat he knew they had both fearedhad come at last  goodby judge he said  hilary vane stared at him dumbly his anger had not cooled his eyes still flamed but he suddenly found himself bereft of speech austen put his hand on his fathers shoulder and looked down silently into his face but hilary was stiff as in a rigour expressionless save for the defiant red in his eye  i dont think you meant all that judge and i dont intend to hold it against you  still hilary stared his lips in the tight line which was the emblem of his character his body rigid he saw his son turn and walk to the door and turn again with his handle on the knob and hilary did not move the door closed and still he sat there motionless expressionless  austen was hailed by those in the outer office but he walked through them as though the place were empty rumours sprang up behind him of which he was unconscious the longexpected quarrel had come austen had joined the motley ranks of the rebels under mr crewe only the office boy jimmy towle interrupted the jokes that were flying by repeating with dogged vehemence i tell you it aint so austen kicked ham downstairs ned johnson saw him nor was it on account of this particular deed that austen was a hero in jimmys eyes  austen finding himself in the square looked at his watch it was four oclock he made his way under the maples to the house in hanover street halted for a moment contemplatively before the familiar classic pillars of its porch took a key from his pocket and unprecedented action entered by the front door climbing to the attic he found two valisesone of which he had brought back from pepper countyand took them to his own room they held with a little crowding most of his possessions including a photograph of sarah austen which he left on the bureau to the last once or twice he paused in his packing to gaze at the face striving to fathom the fleeting quality of her glance which the photograph had so strangely caught in that glance nature had stamped her enigmafor sarah austen was a child of nature hers was the gentle look of wild thingsbut it was more it was the understanding ofthe unwritten law of creation the law by which the flowers grow and wither the law by which the animal springs upon its prey and unerring seeks its mate the law of the song of the waters and the song of the morning stars the law that permits evil and pain and dumb incomprehensible suffering the law that floods at sunset the mountain lands with colour and the soul with light and the law that rends the branches in the blue storm of what avail was anger against it or the puny rage of man hilary vane not recognizing it had spent his force upon it like a hawk against a mountain wall but austen looked at his mothers face and understood in it was not the wisdom of creeds and cities but the unworldly wisdom which comprehends and condones  his packing finished with one last glance at the room austen went downstairs with his valises and laid them on the doorstep then he went to the stable and harnessed pepper putting into the buggy his stable blanket and halter and currycomb and driving around to the front of the house hitched the horse at the stone post and packed the valises in the back of the buggy after that he walked slowly to the back of the house and looked in at the kitchen window euphrasia her thin arms bare to the elbow was bending over a washtub he spoke her name and as she lifted her head a light came into her face which seemed to make her young again she dried her hands hastily on her apron as she drew towards him he sprang through the window and patted her on the backhis usual salutation and as she raised her eyes to his those ordinarily sharp eyes of euphrasias they shone with an admiration she had accorded to no other human being since he had come into the world terms of endearment she had characteristically never used she threw her soul into the sounding of his name  off to the hills austen i saw you aharnessing of pepper  phrasie he said still patting her im going to the country for a while  to the country she repeated  to stay on a farm for a sort of vacation  her face brightened  goin to take a real vacation be you  he laughed  oh i dont have to work very hard phrasie you know i get out a good deal i just thoughti just thought id like tosleep in the countryfor a while  well answered euphrasia i guess if youve took the notion youve got to go it was that way with your mother before you ive seen her leave the house on a bright sabbath half an hour before meetin to be gone the whole day and hilary and all the ministers in town couldnt stop her  ill drop in once in a while to see you phrasie ill be at jabe jenneys  jabes is not more than three or four miles from flints place euphrasia remarked  ive thought of that said austen  youd thought of it  austen coloured  the distance is nothing he said quickly with pepper  and youll come and see me asked euphrasia  if youll do something for me he said  i always do what you want austen you know im not able to refuse you  he laid his hands on her shoulders  youll promise he asked  ill promise said euphrasia solemnly  he was silent for a moment looking down at her  i want you to promise to stay here and take care of the judge  fright crept into her eyes but his own were smiling reassuring  take care of him she cried the very mention of hilary raising the pitch of her voice i guess ill have to havent i took care of him nigh on forty years and small thanks and recompense i get for it except when youre here ive wore out my life takin care of him more gently what do you mean by makin me promise such a thing austen  well said austen slowly the judge is worried now things are not going as smoothly with him as usual  money demanded euphrasia he aint lost money has he  a light began to dance in austens eyes in spite of the weight within him  now phrasie he said lifting her chin a little you know you dont care any more about money than i do  lord help me she exclaimed lord help me if i didnt and as long as you dont care for it and no sense can be knocked into your head about it i hope youll marry somebody that does know the value of it if hilary was to lose what he has now before it comes rightly to you hed ought to be put in jail  austen laughed and shook his head  phrasie the lord did you a grave injustice when he didnt make you a man but i suppose hell give you a recompense hereafter no i believe i am safe in saying that the judges securities are still secure not that i really knowor care shakes of the head from euphrasia poor old judge worse things than finance are troubling him now  not a woman cried euphrasia horrorstricken at the very thought he hasnt took it into his head after all these years  no said austen laughing no no its not quite as bad as that but its pretty bad  in heavens name what is it she demanded reformers said austen  reformers she repeated what might they be  well answered austen you might call them a new kind of caterpillaronly they feed on corporations instead of trees  euphrasia shook her head vigorously  go long she exclaimed when you talk like that i never can follow you austen if hilary has any worries i guess he brought em on himself i never knew him to fail  ambitious and designing persons are making trouble for his railroad  well i never took much stock in that railroad said euphrasia with emphasis i never was on it but an engine gave out and the cars was jammed and it wasnt less than an hour late and then theyre eternally smashin folks or runnin em down you served em right when you made em pay that meader man six thousand dollars and i told hilary so she paused and stared at austen fixedly as a thought came into her head you aint leavin him because of this trouble are you austen  phrasie he said ii dont want to quarrel with him now i think it would be easy to quarrel with him  you mean him quarrel with you returned euphrasia id like to see him if he did it wouldnt take me long to pack up and leave  thats just it i dont want that to happen and ive had a longing to go out and pay a little visit to jabe up in the hills and drive his colts for him you see he said ive got a kind of affection for the judge  euphrasia looked at him and her lips trembled  he dont deserve it she declared but i suppose hes your father  he cant get out of that said austen  id like to see him try it said euphrasia come in soon austen she whispered come in soon  she stood on the lawn and watched him as he drove away and he waved goodby to her over the hood of the buggy when he was out of sight she lifted her head gave her eyes a vigorous brush with her checked apron and went back to her washing  it was not until euphrasia had supper on the table that hilary vane came home and she glanced at him sharply as he took his usual seat it is a curious fact that it is possible for two persons to live together for more than a third of a century and at the end of that time understand each other little better than at the beginning the sole bond between euphrasia and hilary was that of sarah austen and her son euphrasia never knew when hilary was tired or when he was cold or hungry or cross although she provided for all these emergencies her service to him was unflagging but he had never been under the slightest delusion that it was not an inheritance from his wife there must have been some affection between mr vane and his housekeeper hidden away in the strong boxes of both but up to the present this was only a theorynot quite as probable as that about the inhabitants of mars  he ate his supper tonight with his usual appetite which had always been sparing and he would have eaten the same amount if the northeastern railroads had been going into the hands of a receiver the next day often he did not exchange a word with euphrasia between homecoming and bedgoing and this was apparently to be one of these occasions after supper he went as usual to sit on the steps of his porch and to cut his piece of honey dew which never varied a milligram nine oclock struck and euphrasia who had shut up the back of the house was on her way to bed with her lamp in her hand when she came face to face with him in the narrow passageway  wheres austen he asked  euphrasia halted the lamp shook but she raised it to the level of his eyes  dont you know she demanded  no he said with unparalleled humility  she put down the lamp on the little table that stood beside her  he didnt tell you he was agoin  no said hilary  then how did you know he wasnt just buggyridin she said  hilary vane was mute  youve ben to his room she exclaimed youve seen his things are gone  he confessed it by his silence then with amazing swiftness and vigour for one of her age euphrasia seized him by the arms and shook him  what have you done to him she cried what have you done to him you sent him off youve never understood himyouve never behaved like a father to him you aint worthy to have him she flung herself away and stood facing hilary at a little distance what a fool i was what a fool i might have known it and i promised him  promised him hilary repeated the shaking the vehemence and anger of euphrasia seemed to have had no effect whatever on the main trend of his thoughts  where has he gone  you can find out for yourself she retorted bitterly i wish on your account it was to china he came here this afternoon as gentle as ever and packed up his things and said he was goin away because you was worried worried she exclaimed scornfully his worry and his trouble dont countbut yours and he made me promise to stay with you if it wasnt for him she cried picking up the lamp id leave you this very night  she swept past him and up the narrow stairway to her bedroom     chapter xvii busy days at wedderburn  there is no blast so powerful so withering as the blast of ridicule only the strongest men can withstand it only reformers who are such in deed and not alone in name can snap their fingers at it and liken it to the crackling of thorns under a pot confucius and martin luther must have been ridiculed mr crewe reflected and although he did not have time to assure himself on these historical points the thought stayed him sixty odd weekly newspapers filled with arguments from the book attacked him all at once and if by chance he should have missed the best part of this flattering personal attention the editorials which contained the most spice were copied at the end of the week into the columns of his erstwhile friend the state tribune now the organ of that mysterious personality the honourable adam b hunt et tu brute  moreover mr peter pardriff had something of his own to say some gentlemen of prominence not among the twenty signers of the new declaration of independence had been interviewed by the tribune reporter on the subject of mr crewes candidacy here are some of the answers duly tabulated  negligiblecongressman fairplay  one less vote for the honourable adam b huntthe honourable jacob botcher  a monumental farceexgovernor broadbent  who is mr crewesenator whitredge ah ha senator this want shall be supplied at least  i have been very busy i do not know what candidates are in the fieldmr augustus p flint president of the northeastern railroads the unkindest cut of all  i have heard that a mr crewe is a candidate but i do not know much about him they tell me he is a summer resident at leiththe honourable hilary vane  a millionaires freaknot to be taken seriouslystate senator nathaniel billings  the state tribune itself seemed to be especially interested in the past careers of the twenty signers who composed this dauntless band whose members had arisen with remarkable unanimity and martyrs zeal in such widely scattered parts of the state had each been simultaneously inspired with the same high thought andmore amazing stillwith the idea of the same peerless leader the tribune modestly ventured the theory that mr crewe had appeared to each of the twenty in a dream with a flaming sword pointing to the steam of the dragons breath or perhaps a star had led each of the twenty to leith this likening of mr hn tg to a star caused much merriment among that gentlemans former friends and acquaintances the tribune could not account for this phenomenon by any natural laws and was forced to believe that the thing was a miraclein which case it behooved the northeastern railroads to read the handwriting on the wall unlessunless the twenty did not exist unless the whole thing were a joke the tribune remembered a time when a signed statement purporting to come from a certain mrs amanda p pillow of 22 blair street newcastle had appeared to the effect that three bottles of rands peach nectar had cured her of dropsy on investigation there was no blair street and mrs amanda p pillow was as yet unborn the one sure thing about the statement was that rands peach nectar could be had in large or small quantities as desired and the tribune was prepared to state on its own authority that a mr humphrey crewe did exist and might reluctantly consent to take the nomination for the governorship in industry and zeal he was said to resemble the celebrated and lamented mr rand of the peach nectar  ingratitude merely injures those who are capable of it although it sometimes produces sadness in great souls what were mr crewes feelings when he read this drivel when he perused the extracts from the book of arguments which appeared with astonishing unanimity too in sixty odd weekly newspapers of the statean assortment of arguments for each county  brush bascoms doin that work now said mr tooting contemptuously and hes doin it with a shovel look here hes got the same squib in three towns within a dozen miles of each other the one beginning political conditions in this state are as clean as those of any state in the union and the united northeastern railroads is a corporation which is fortunately above calumny a summer resident who to satisfy his lust for office is rolling to defame  yes interrupted mr crewe never mind reading any more of that rot  its botched said mr tooting whose artistic soul was jarred id have put that in avalon county and weave and marshall i know men that take all three of those papers in putnam  no need of balloonists to see what the enemy is about when we have a mr tooting  theyre stung he cried as he ran rapidly through the bundle of papersmr crewe having subscribed with characteristic generosity to the entire press of the state flint gave em out all this stuff about the railroad bein a sacred institution youve got em on the run right now mr crewe youll notice that democrats and republicans theyve dropped everybody else that theyve all been sicked on to you theyre scared  i came to that conclusion some time ago replied mr crewe who was sorting over his letters  and look there exclaimed mr tooting tearing out a paragraph theres the best campaign material weve had yet say ill bet flint taken that doddering idiots pass away for writing that  mr crewe took the extract and read       a summer resident of leith who is said to be a millionaire      many times over and who had a somewhat farcical career as a      legislator last winter has announced himself as a candidate      for the republican nomination on a platform attacking the      northeastern railroads mr humphrey crewe declares that the      northeastern railroads govern us what if they do every      soberminded citizen will agree that they give us a pretty      good government more power to them  mr crewe permitted himself to smile  they are playing into our hands sure enough what  this is an example of the spirit in which the ridicule and abuse was met  it was senator whitredgeonly last autumn so pleased to meet mr crewe at mr flintswho asked the hypocritical question who is humphrey crewe a biography in pamphlet form illustratedsend your name and address is being prepared by the invaluable mr tooting who only sleeps six hours these days we shall see it presently when it emerges from that busy hive at wedderburn  wedderburn was a hive sure enough not having a balloon ourselves it is difficult to see all that is going on there but there can be no mistake except by the honourable hilarys seismograph that it has become the centre of extraordinary activity the outside world has paused to draw breath at the spectacle and members of the metropolitan press are filling the rooms of the ripton house and adding to the prosperity of its liverystable mr crewe is a difficult man to see these daysthere are so many visitors at wedderburn and the representatives of the metropolitan press hitch their horses and stroll around the grounds or sit on the porch and converse with gentlemen from various counties of the state who as the tribune would put it have been led by a star to leith  on the occasion of one of these gatherings when mr crewe had been inaccessible for four hours mrs pomfret drove up in a victoria with her daughter alice  im sure i dont know when were going to see poor dear humphrey again said mrs pomfret examining the group on the porch through her goldmounted lenses these awful people are always here when i come i wonder if they sleep here in the hammocks and lounging chairs alice we must be very polite to themso much depends on it  im always polite mother answered alice except when you tell me not to be the trouble is i never know myself  the victoria stopped in front of the door and the irreproachable waters advanced across the porch  waters said mrs pomfret i suppose mr crewe is too busy to come out  im afraid so madam replied waters theres a line of gentlemen waitin here he eyed them with no uncertain disapproval and ive positive orders not to disturb him madam  i quite understand at a time like this said mrs pomfret and added for the benefit of her audience when mr crewe has been publicspirited and unselfish enough to undertake such a gigantic task tell him miss pomfret and i call from time to time because we are so interested and that the whole of leith wishes him success  ill tell him madam said waters  but mrs pomfret did not give the signal for her coachman to drive on she looked instead at the patient gathering  good morning gentlemen she said  mother whispered alice what are you going to do  the gentlemen rose  im mrs pomfret she said as though that simple announcement were quite sufficientas it was for the metropolitan press not a man of them who had not seen mrs pomfrets important movements on both sides of the water chronicled i take the liberty of speaking to you as we all seem to be united in a common cause how is the campaign looking  some of the gentlemen shifted their cigars from one hand to the other and grinned sheepishly  i am so interested continued mrs pomfret it is so unusual in america for a gentleman to be willing to undertake such a thing to subject himself to low criticism and to have his pure motives questioned mr crewe has rare couragei have always said so and we are all going to put our shoulder to the wheel and help him all we can  there was one clever man there who was quick to see his opportunity and seize it for his newspaper  and are you going to help mr crewe in his campaign mrs pomfret  most assuredly answered mrs pomfret women in this country could do so much if they only would you know she added in her most winning manner you know that a woman can often get a vote when a man cant  and you andother ladies will go around to the public meetings  why not my friend if mr crewe has no objection and i can conceive of none  you would have an organization of society ladies to help mr crewe  thats rather a crude way of putting it answered mrs pomfret with her glasses raised judicially women in what you call i society are i am glad to say taking an increasing interest in politics they are beginning to realize that it is a duty  thank you said the reporter and now would you mind if i took a photograph of you in your carriage  oh mother protested alice you wont let him do that  be quiet alice lady aylestone and the duchess are photographed in every conceivable pose for political purposes wymans just drive around to the other side of the circle  the article appeared next day and gave as may be imagined a tremendous impetus to mr crewes cause a new era in american politics society to take a hand in the gubernatorial campaign of millionaire humphrey crewe noted social leader mrs patterson pomfret declares it a duty and saga that english women have the right idea and a photograph of mrs patterson pomfret herself in her victoria occupied a generous portion of the front page  whats all this rubbish about mrs pomfret was mr crewes grateful comment when he saw it i spent two valuable hours with that reporter givin him material and statistics and i cant find that hes used a word of it  never you mind about that mr tooting replied the more advertising you get the better and this shows that the right people are behind you mrs pomfrets a smart woman all right she knows her job and heres more advertising he continued shoving another sheet across the desk a fine likeness of you in caricature labelled ajax defying the lightning whos ajax there was an italian a street contractor with that nameor something like itin newcastle a couple of years agoin the eighth ward  in these days when false rumours fly apace to the injury of innocent men it is well to get at the truth if possible it is not true that mr paul pardriff of the ripton record has been to wedderburn mr pardriff was getting into a buggy to gosomewherewhen he chanced to meet the honourable brush bascom and the buggy was sent back to the liverystable mr tooting had been to see mr pardriff before the worldquaking announcement of june 7th and had found mr pardriff a reformer who did not believe that the railroad should run the state but the editor of the ripton record was a man after emersons own heart a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little mindsand mr pardriff did not go to wedderburn he went off on an excursion up the state instead for he had been working too hard and he returned as many men do from their travels a conservative he listened coldly to mr tootings impassioned pleas for cleaner politics until mr tooting revealed the fact that his pockets were full of copy it seems that a biography was to be printeda biography which would undoubtedly be in great demand the biography of a public benefactor illustrated with original photographs and views in the country mr tooting and mr pardriff both being men of the world some exceeding plain talk ensued between them and when two such minds unite a way out is sure to be found one can be both a conservative and a radicalif one is clever there were other columns in mr pardriffs paper besides editorial columns editorial columns mr pardriff said were sacred to his convictions certain thumbworn schedules were referred to paul pardriff ripton agreed to be the publisher of the biography  the next edition of the record was an example of what mr emerson meant three columns contained extracts of absorbing interest from the forthcoming biography and on another page an editorial the honourable humphrey crewe of leith is an estimable gentleman and a good citizen whose public endeavours have been of great benefit to the community a citizen of avalon county the record regrets that it cannot support his candidacy for the republican gubernatorial nomination we are not among those who seek to impugn motives and while giving mr crewe every credit that his charges against the northeastern railroads are made in good faith we beg to differ from him that corporation is an institution which has stood the test of time and enriches every year the state treasury by a large sum in taxes its management is in safe conservative hands no one will deny mr crewes zeal for the states welfare but it must be borne in mind that he is a newcomer in politics and that conditions seen from the surface are sometimes deceptive we predict for mr crewe a long and useful career but we do not think that at this time and on this platform he will obtain the governorship  moral courage is what the age needs had been mr crewes true and sententious remark when he read this editorial but bearing in mind a biblical adage he did not blame mr tooting for his diplomacy send in the next man  mr tooting opened the study door and glanced over the publicspirited citizens awaiting on the porch the pleasure of their leader  come along caldwell said mr tooting he wants your report from kingston get a hustle on  mr caldwell made his report received many brief and businesslike suggestions and retired impressed whereupon mr crewe commanded mr tooting to order his automobilean occasional and rapid spin over the country roads being the only diversion the candidate permitted himself wishing to be alone with his thoughts he did not take mr tooting with him on these excursions  and by the way said mr crewe as he seized the steering wheel a few moments later just drop a line to austen vane will you and tell him i want to see him up here within a day or two make an appointment it has occurred to me that he might be very useful  mr tooting stood on the driveway watching the cloud of dust settle on the road below then he indulged in a long and peculiarly significant whistle through his teeth rolled his eyes heavenward and went into the house he remembered austens remark about riding a cyclone  mr crewe took the tunbridge road on his excursion of the day before he had met mrs pomfret who had held up her hand and he had protestingly brought the car to a stop  your horses dont frighten he had said  no but i wanted to speak to you humphrey mrs pomfret had replied you are becoming so important that nobody ever has a glimpse of you i wanted to tell you what an interest we take in this splendid thing you are doing  well said mr crewe it was a plain duty and nobody else seemed willing to undertake it  mrs pomfrets eyes had flashed  men of that type are scarce she answered but youll win youre the kind of man that wins  oh yes ill win said mr crewe  youre so magnificently sure of yourself cried mrs pomfret alice is taking such an interest every day she asks when is humphrey going to make his first speech youll let us know in time wont you  did you put all that nonsense in the new york flare asked mr crewe  oh humphrey i hope you liked it cried mrs pomfret dont make the mistake of despising what women can do they elected the honourable billy aylestonehe said so himself im getting all the women interested  whove you been calling on now he inquired  mrs pomfret hesitated  ive been up at fairview to see about mrs flint she isnt much better  is victoria home mr crewe demanded with undisguised interest  poor dear girl said mrs pomfret of course i wouldnt have mentioned the subject to her but she wanted to know all about it it naturally makes an awkward situation between you and her doesnt it  oh victorias levelheaded enough mr crewe had answered i guess she knows something about old flint and his methods by this time at any rate it wont make any difference with me he added magnanimously and threw in his clutch he had encircled fairview in his drive that day and was curiously enough headed in that direction now slow to make up his mind in some things as every eligible man must be he was now coming rapidly to the notion that he might eventually decide upon victoria as the most fitting mate for one in his position still there was no hurry as for going to fairview house that might be awkward besides being open to misconstruction by his constituents mr crewe reflected as he rushed up the hills that he had missed victoria since she had been abroadand a man so continually occupied as he did not have time to miss many people mr crewe made up his mind he would encircle fairview every day until he ran across her  the goddess of fortune sometimes blesses the persistent even before they begin to persistperhaps from sheer weariness at the remembrance of previous importuning victoria on a brandnew and somewhat sensitive fiveyearold was coming out of the stone archway when mr crewe without any signal this time threw on his brakes an exhibition of horsemanship followed on victorias part which mr crewe beheld with admiration the fiveyearold swung about like a weathercock in a gust of wind assuming an upright position like the unicorn in the british coat of arms victoria cut him and he came down on all fours and danced into the wire fence that encircled the fairview domain whereupon he got another stinging reminder that there was some one on his back  bravo cried mr crewe leaning on the steering wheel and watching the performance with delight never he thought had victoria been more appealing strangely enough he had not remembered that she was quite so handsome or that her colour was so vivid or that her body was so straight and long and supple he liked the way in which she gave it to that horse and he made up his mind that she would grace any position however high presently the horse made a leap into the road in front of the motor and stood trembling ready to bolt  for heavens sake humphrey she cried shut off your power dont sit there like an idiotdo you think im doing this for pleasure  mr crewe goodnaturedly turned off his switch and the motor with a dying sigh was silent he even liked the notion of being commanded to do a thing there was a relish about it that was new the other women of his acquaintance addressed him more deferentially  get hold of the bridle he said to the chauffeur youve got no business to have an animal like that was his remark to victoria  dont touch him she said to the man who was approaching with a true machinists fear of a highspirited horse youve got no business to have a motor like that if you cant handle it any better than you do  you managed him all right ill say that for you said mr crewe  no thanks to you she replied now that the horse was comparatively quiet she sat and regarded mr crewe with an amusement which was gradually getting the better of her anger a few moments since and she wished with great intensity that she had been using the whip on his shoulders instead now that she had time to gather up the threads of the situation the irresistibly comic aspect of it grew upon her and little creases came into the corners of her eyeswhich mr crewe admired she recalledwith indignation to be surethe conversation she had overheard in the dining room of the duncan house but her indignation was particularly directed on that occasion towards mr tooting here was humphrey crewe sitting talking to her in the roadhumphrey crewe whose candidacy for the governorship impugned her fathers management of the northeastern railroadsand she was unable to take the matter seriously there must be something wrong with her she thought  so youre home again mr crewe observed his eyes still bearing witness to the indubitable fact i shouldnt have known itive been so busy  is the legislature still in session victoria soberly inquired  you are a little behind the timesaint you said mr crewe in surprise how long have you been home hasnt anybody told you whats going on  i only came up ten days ago she answered and im afraid ive been something of a recluse what is going on  well he declared i should have thought youd heard it anyway ill send you up a few newspapers when i get back im a candidate for the governorship  victoria bit her lip and leaned over to brush a fly from the neck of her horse  you are getting on rapidly humphrey she said do you think youve gotany chance  any chance he repeated with some pardonable force im sure to be nominated theres an overwhelming sentiment among the voters of this state for decent politics it didnt take me long to find that out the only wonder is that somebody hasnt seen it before  perhaps she answered giving him a steady look perhaps somebody has  one of mr crewes greatest elements of strength was his imperviousness to this kind of a remark  if anybodys seen it he replied they havent the courage of their convictions such were the workings of mr crewes mind that he had already forgotten that first talk with mr hamilton tooting not that i want to take too much credit on myself he added with becoming modesty i have had some experience in the world and it was natural that i should get a fresh view are you coming down to leith in a few days  i may said victoria  telephone me said mr crewe and if i can get off i will id like to talk to you you have more sense than most women i know  you overwhelm me humphrey compliments sound strangely on your lips  when i say a thing i mean it mr crewe declared i dont pay compliments id make it a point to take a little time off to talk to you you see so many men are interested in this thing from various parts of the state and we are so busy organizing that it absorbs most of my day  i couldnt think of encroaching victoria protested  thats all rightyou can be a great help ive got confidence in your judgment by the way he asked suddenly you havent seen your friend austen vane since you got back have you  why do you call him my friend said victoria mr crew perceived that the exercise had heightened her colour and the transition appealed to his sense of beauty  perhaps i put it a little strongly he replied you seemed to take an interest in him for some reason i suppose its because you like new types  i like mr vane very muchand for himself she said quietly but i havent seen him since i came back nor do i think i am likely to see him what made you ask about him  well he seems to be a man of some local standing and he ought to be in this campaign if you happen to see him you might mention the subject to him ive sent for him to come up and see me  mr vane doesnt seem to me to be a person one can send for like that victoria remarked judicially as to advising him as to what course he should take politicallythat would even be straining my friendship for you humphrey on reflection she added smiling there may appear to you reasons why i should not care to meddle withpolitics just now  i cant see it said mr crewe youve got a mind of your own and youve never been afraid to use it so far as i know if you should see that vane man just give him a notion of what im trying to do  what are you trying to do inquired victoria sweetly  im trying to clean up this state politically said mr crewe and im going to do it when you come down to leith ill tell you about it and ill send you the newspapers today dont be in a hurry he cried addressing over his shoulder two farmers in a wagon who had driven up a few moments before and who were apparently anxious to pass wind her up adolphe  the chauffeur standing by the crank started the engine instantly and the gears screamed as mr crewe threw in his low speed the fiveyearold whirled and bolted down the road at a pace which would have seemed to challenge a racing car and the girl in the saddle bending to the motion of the horse was seen to raise her hand in warning  better stay whar you be shouted one of the farmers dont go to follerin her the hoes is runnin away  mr crewe steered his car into the fairview entrance and backed into the road again facing the other way he had decided to go home  that lady can take care of herself he said and started off towards leith wondering how it was that mr flint had not confided his recent political troubles to his daughter  that hoss is ugly sure enough said the farmer who had spoken before  victoria flew on down the narrow road after twenty strides she did not attempt to disguise from herself the fact that the fiveyearold was in a frenzy of fear and running away victoria had been run away with before and having some knowledge of the animal she rode she did not waste her strength by pulling on the curb but sought rather to quiet him with her voice which had no effect whatever he was beyond appeal his head was down and his ears trembling backwards and straining for a sound of the terror that pursued him the road ran through the forest and victoria reflected that the grade on the whole was downward to the east tunbridge station where the road crossed the track and took to the hills beyond once among them she would be safehe might run as far as he pleased but could she pass the station she held a firm rein and tried to keep her mind clear  suddenly at a slight bend of the road the corner of the little red building came in sight some hundreds of yards ahead and on the side where it stood in the clearing was a white mass which victoria recognized as a pile of lumber she saw several men on the top of the pile standing motionless she heard one of them shout the horse swerved and she felt herself flung violently to the left  her first thought after striking was one of selfcongratulation that her safety stirrup and habit had behaved properly before she could rise a man was leaning over herand in the instant she had the impression that he was a friend other people had had this impression of him on first acquaintancehis size his genial brickred face and his honest blue eyes all doubtless contributing  are you hurt miss flint he asked  not in the least she replied springing to her feet to prove the contrary whats become of my horse  two of the men have gone after him he said staring at her with undisguised but honest admiration whereupon he became suddenly embarrassed and pulled out a handkerchief the size of a table napkin let me dust you off  thank you said victoria laughing and beginning the process herself her new acquaintance plied the handkerchief his face a brighter brickred than ever  thank god there wasnt a freight on the siding he remarked so fervently that victoria stole a glance at him the dusting process continued  there she exclaimed at last adjusting her stock and shaking her skirt im ever so much obliged it was very foolish in me to tumble off wasnt it  it was the only thing you could have done he declared i had a good view of it and he flung you like a bean out of a shooter thats a powerful horse i guess youre the kind that likes to take risks  victoria laughed at his expressive phrase and crossed the road and sat down on the edge of the lumber pile in the shade  there seems to be nothing to do but wait she said and to thank you again will you tell me your name  im tom gaylord he replied  her colour always so near the surface rose a little as she regarded him so this was austen vanes particular friend whom he had tried to put out of his window a herculean task victoria thought from toms appearance tom sat down within a few feet of her  ive seen you a good many times miss flint he remarked applying the handkerchief to his face  and ive seen youonce mr gaylord some mischievous impulse prompted her to answer perhaps the impulse was more deepseated after all  where demanded tom promptly  you were engaged said victoria in a struggle in a window on ripton square it looked for a time she continued as if you were going to be dropped on the roof of the porch  tom gazed at her in confusion and surprise  you seem to be fond too of dangerous exercise she observed  do you mean to say you remembered me from that he exclaimed oh you know austen vane dont you  does mr vane acknowledge the acquaintance victoria inquired  its funny but you remind me of austen said tom grinning you seem to have the same queer way of saying things that he has here he was conscious of another fit of embarrassment i hope you dont mind what i say miss flint  not at all said victoria she turned and looked across the track  i suppose they are having a lot of trouble in catching my horse she remarked  theyll get him tom assured her one of those men is my manager he always gets what he starts out for what were we talking about oh austen vane you see ive known him ever since i was a shaver and i think the world of him if he asked me to go to south america and get him a zebra tomorrow i believe id do it  that is real devotion said victoria the more she saw of young tom the better she liked him although his conversation was apt to be slightly embarrassing  weve been through a lot of rows together tom continued warming to his subject in school and college you see austens the kind of man who doesnt care what anybody thinks if he takes it into his head to do a thing it was a great piece of luck for me that he shot that fellow out west or he wouldnt be here now you heard about that didnt you  yes said victoria i believe i did  and yet said tom although im as good a friend as he has i never quite got under his skin theres some things i wouldnt talk to him about ive learned that i never told him for instance that i saw him out in a sleigh with you at the capital  oh said victoria and she added is he ashamed of it  its not that replied tom hastily but i guess if hed wanted me to know about it hed have told me  victoria had begun to realize that in the few minutes which had elapsed since she had found herself on the roadside gazing up into young toms eyes she had somehow become quite intimate with him  i fancy he would have told you all there was to tell about itif the matter had occurred to him again she said with the air of finally dismissing a subject already too prolonged but tom knew nothing of the shades and conventions of the art of conversation  hes never told me he knew you at all he exclaimed staring at victoria apparently some of the aspects of this now significant omission on austens part were beginning to dawn on tom  it wasnt worth mentioning said victoria briefly seeking for a pretext to change the subject  i dont believe that said tom you cant expect me to sit here and look at you and believe that how long has he known you  i saw him once or twice last summer at leith said victoria now wavering between laughter and exasperation she had got herself into a quandary indeed when she had to parry the appalling frankness of such inquiries  the more you see of him the more youll admire him ill prophesy said tom if hed been content to travel along the easy road as most fellows are he would have been counsel for the northeastern instead of that here tom halted abruptly and turned scarlet i forgot he said im always putting my foot in it with ladies  he was so painfully confused that victoria felt herself suffering with him and longed to comfort him  please go on mr gaylord she said i am very much interested in my neighbours here and i know that a great many of them think that the railroad meddles in politics ive tried to find out what they think but it is so difficult for a woman to understand if matters are wrong im sure my father will right them when he knows the situation he has so much to attend to she paused tom was still mopping his forehead you may say anything you like to me and i shall not take offence  toms admiration of her was heightened by this attitude  austen wouldnt join mr crewe in his little game anyway he said when ham tooting crewes manager came to him he kicked him downstairs  victoria burst out laughing  i constantly hear of these ferocious deeds which mr vane commits she said and yet he seems exceptionally goodnatured and mildmannered  thats straighthe kicked him downstairs served tooting right too  there does seem to have been an element of justice in it victoria remarked  you havent seen austen since he left his father mr gaylord inquired  left him wherehas he gone  gone up to live with jabe jenney if austen cared anything about money he never would have broken with the old man who has some little put away  why did he leave his father asked victoria not taking the trouble now to conceal her interest  well said tom you know they never did get along it hasnt been austens faulthes tried after he came back from the west he stayed here to please old hilary when he might have gone to new york and made a fortune at the law with his brains but after austen saw the kind of law the old man practised he wouldnt stand for it and got an office of his own  victorias eyes grew serious  what kind of law does hilary vane practise she asked  tom hesitated and began to mop his forehead again  please dont mind me victoria pleaded  well all right said tom ill tell you the truth or die for it but i dont want to make youunhappy  you will do me a kindness mr gaylord she said by telling me what you believe to be true  there was a note in her voice which young tom did not understand afterwards when he reflected about the matter he wondered if she were unhappy  i dont want to blame hilary too much he answered i know austen dont hilarys grown up with that way of doing things and in the old days there was no other way hilary is the chief counsel for the northeastern and he runs the republican organization in this state for their benefit but austen made up his mind that there was no reason why he should grow up that way he says that a lawyer should keep to his profession and not become a lobbyist in the interest of his clients he lived with the old man until the other day because he has a real soft spot for him austen put up with a good deal and then hilary turned loose on him and said a lot of things he couldnt stand austen didnt answer but went up and packed his bags and made hilarys housekeeper promise to stay with him or shed have left too they say hilarys sorry now hes fond of austen but he cant get along with him  dodo you know what they quarreled about asked victoria in a low voice  this spring said tom the gaylord lumber company made austen junior counsel he ran across a law the other day that nobody else seems to have had sense enough to discover by which we can sue the railroad for excessive freight rates it means a lot of money he went right in to hilary and showed him the section told him that suit was going to be brought and offered to resign hilary flew off the trackand said if he didnt bring suit hed publish it all over the state that austen started it galusha hammer our senior counsel is sick and i dont think hell ever get well that makes austen senior counsel but he persuaded old tom my father not to bring this suit until after the political campaign until mr crewe gets through with his fireworks hilary doesnt know that  i see said victoria  down the hill on the far side of the track she perceived the two men approaching with a horse then she remembered the fact that she had been thrown and that it was her horse she rose to her feet  im ever so much obliged to you mr gaylord she said you have done me a great favour bytelling me these things and thanks for letting them catch the horse im afraid ive put you to a lot of bother  not at all said tom not at all he was studying her face its expression troubled and moved him strangely for he was not an analytical person i didnt mean to tell you those things when i began he apologized but you wanted to hear them  i wanted to hear them repeated victoria she held out her hand to him  youre not going to ride home he exclaimed ill take you up in my buggyits in the station shed  she smiled turned and questioned and thanked the men examined the girths and bridle and stroked the fiveyearold on the neck he was wet from mane to fetlocks  i dont think hell care to run much farther she said if youll pull him over to the lumber pile mr gaylord ill mount him  they performed her bidding in silence each paying her a tribute in his thoughts as for the fiveyearold he was quiet enough by this time when she was in the saddle she held out her hand once more to tom  i hope we shall meet soon again she said and smiling back at him started on her way towards fairview  tom stood for a moment looking after her while the two men indulged in surprised comments  andrews said young mr gaylord just fetch my buggy and follow her until she gets into the gate     chapter xviii a spirit in the woods  empires crack before they crumble and the first cracks seem easily mendedeven as they have been mended before a revolt in gaul or britain or thrace is little to be minded and a prophet in judea less and yet into him who sits in the seat of power a premonition of something impending gradually creepsa premonition which he will not acknowledge will not define yesterday by the pointing of a finger he created a province today he dares not but consoles himself by saying he does not wish to point no antagonist worthy of his steel has openly defied him worthy of recognition by the opposition of a legion but the sense of security has been subtly and indefinably shaken  by the strange telepathy which defies language to the honourable hilary vane governor of the province some such unacknowledged forebodings have likewise been communicated a week after his conversation with austen on the return of his emperor from a trip to new york the honourable hilary was summoned again to the foot of the throne and his thoughts as he climbed the ridges towards fairview were not in harmony with the carols of the birds in the depths of the forest and the joy of the bright june weather loneliness he had felt before and to its ills he had applied the antidote of labour the burden that sat upon his spirit today was not mere loneliness to the truth of this his soul attested but hilary vane had never listened to the promptings of his soul he would have been shocked if you had told him this did he not confess with his eyes shut his sins every sunday did he not publicly acknowledge his soul  austen vane had once remarked that if some keen american lawyer would really put his mind to the evasion of the ten commandments the high heavens themselves might be cheated this saying would have shocked the honourable hilary inexpressibly he had never been employed by a syndicate to draw up papers to avoid these mandates he revered them as he revered the law which he spelled with a capital he spelled the word soul with a capital likewise and certainly no higher recognition could be desired than this never in the honourable hilarys long laborious and preeminently model existence had he realized that happiness is harmony it would not be true to assert that on this wonderful june day a glimmering of this truth dawned upon him such a statement would be open to the charge of exaggeration and his frame of mind was pessimistic but he had got so far as to ask himself the questioncui bono and repeated it several times on his drive until a verse of scripture came unbidden to his lips for what hate man of all his labour and of the vexation of his heart wherein he hath laboured under the sun and there is one event unto all austens saying that he had never learned how to enjoy life he remembered too what had austen meant by that  hitherto hilary vane had never failed of selfjustification in any event which had befallen him and while this consciousness of the rectitude of his own attitude had not made him happier there had been a certain grim pleasure in it to the fact that he had ruined by sheer overrighteousness the last years of the sunny life of sarah austen he had been obliviousuntil today the strange retrospective mood which had come over him this afternoon led his thoughts into strange paths and he found himself wondering if after all it had not been in his power to make her happier her dryadlike face with its sweet elusive smile seemed to peer at him now wistfully out of the forest and suddenly a new and startling thought rose up within himafter six and thirty years perhaps she had belonged in the forest perhaps because he had sought to cage her she had pined and died the thought gave hilary unwonted pain and he strove to put it away from him but memories such as these once aroused are not easily set at rest and he bent his head as he recalled with a new and significant pathos those hopeless and pitiful flights into the wilds she loved  now austen had gone was there a law behind these actions of mother and son which he had persisted in denouncing as vagaries austen was a man a man hilary could not but see who had the respect of his fellows whose judgment and talents were becoming recognized was it possible that he hilary vane could have been one of those referred to by the preacher during the week which had passed since austens departure the house in hanover street had been haunted for hilary the going of his son had not left a mere voidthat would have been pain enough ghosts were there ghosts which he could but dimly feel and see and more than once in the long evenings he had taken to the streets to avoid them  in that week hilarys fear of meeting his son in the street or in the passages of the building had been equalled by a yearning to see him every morning at the hour austen was wont to drive pepper to the ripton house stables across the square hilary had contrived to be standing near his windowsa little back and out of sight andstranger stillhe had turned from these glimpses to the reports of the honourable brush bascom and his associates with a distaste he had never felt before  with some such thoughts as these hilary vane turned into the last straight stretch of the avenue that led to fairview house with its red and white awnings gleaming in the morning sun on the lawn against a white and purple mass of lilacs and the darker background of pines a straight and infinitely graceful figure in white caught his eye and held it he recognized victoria she wore a simple summer gown the soft outline of its flounces mingling subtly with the white clusters behind her she turned her head at the sound of the wheels and looked at him the distance was not too great for a bow but hilary did not bow something in her face deterred him from this actsomething which he himself did not understand or define he sought to pronounce the incident negligible what was the girl or her look to him and yet he found himself strangely thinking he had read in her eyes a trace of the riddle which had been relentlessly pursuing him there was an odd relation in her look to that of sarah austen during the long years he had been coming to fairview even before the new house was built when victoria was in pinafores he had never understood her when she was a child he had vaguely recognized in her a spirit antagonistic to his own and her sayings had had a disconcerting ring and now this simple glance of hers had troubled himonly more definitely  it was a new experience for the honourable hilary to go into a business meeting with his faculties astray absently he rang the stable bell surrendered his horse and followed a footman to the retired part of the house occupied by the railroad president entering the oakbound sanctum he crossed it and took a seat by the window merely nodding to mr flint who was dictating a letter mr flint took his time about the letter but when it was finished he dismissed the stenographer with an impatient and powerful wave of the handas though brushing the man bodily out of the room remaining motionless until the door had closed mr flint turned abruptly and fixed his eyes on the contemplative figure of his chief counsel  well he said  well flint answered the honourable hilary  well said mr flint that bridge over maple river has got loosened up so by the freshet that we have to keep freight cars on it to hold it down and somebody is trying to make trouble by writing a public letter to the railroad commission and calling attention to the headon collision at barkers station  well replied the honourable hilary again that wont have any influence on the railroad commission  no said mr flint but it all goes to increase this confounded public sentiment thats in the air like smallpox another jackass pretends to have kept a table of the through trains on the sumsic division and says theyve averaged fortyfive minutes late at edmundton he says the through express made the run faster thirty years ago  i guess thats so said the honourable hilary i was counsel for that road then i read that letter he says there isnt an engine on the division that could pull his hat off up grade  neither of the two gentlemen appeared to deem this statement humorous  what these incendiaries dont understand said mr flint is that we have to pay dividends  its because they dont get em replied mr vane sententiously  the track slid into the water at glendale continued mr flint i suppose theyll tell us we ought to rock ballast that line youll see the railroad commission and give em a sketch of a report  i had a talk with young yesterday said mr vane his eyes on the stretch of lawn and forest framed by the window for the sake of the ignorant it may be well to add that the honourable orrin young was the chairman of the commission  and now said mr flint not that this crewe business amounts to that here the railroad president snapped his fingers with the intensity of a small pistol shot but whats he been doing  political advertising said the honourable hilary  plenty of it i guess mr flint remarked acidly thats one thing tooting cant teach him hes a naturalborn genius at it  tooting can helpeven at that answered mr vane ironically theyve got a sketch of socalled northeastern methods in forty weekly newspapers this week with a picture of that public benefactor and martyr humphrey crewe heres a sample of it  mr flint waved the sample away  youve made a list of the newspapers that printed it mr flint demanded had he lived in another age he might have added have the malefactors burned alive in my garden  brush has seen some of em said mr vane no doubt referring to the editors and i had some of em come to ripton theyve got a lot to say about the freedom of the press and their right to take political advertising crewes matter is in the form of a despatch and most of em pointed out at the top of the editorial columns that their papers are not responsible for despatches in the news columns six of em are out and out for crewe and those fellows are honest enough  take away their passes and advertising said mr flint off with their heads said the queen of hearts  i wouldnt do that if i were you flint they might make capital out of it i think youll find that five of em have sent their passes back anyway  freeman will give you some new ideas from the book of arguments although mr flint did not say so which have occurred to me might be distributed for editorial purposes next week and by the way what have you done about that brilliant mr coombes of the johnstown ray who says the northeastern railroads give us a pretty good government  the honourable hilary shook his head  too much zeal he observed i guess he wont do it again  for a while after that they talked of strictly legal matters which the chief counsel produced in order out of his bag but when these were finally disposed of mr flint led the conversation back to the honourable humphrey crewe who stood harmlessto be surelike a bull on the track which it might be unwise to run over  he doesnt amount to a soap bubble in a gale mr flint declared contemptuously sometimes i think we made a great mistake to notice him  we havent noticed him said mr vane the newspapers have  mr flint brushed this distinction aside  that he said irritably and letting tooting go  the honourable hilarys eyes began to grow red in former days mr flint had not often questioned his judgment  theres one thing more i wanted to mention to you said the chief counsel in past years i have frequently drawn your attention to that section of the act of consolidation which declares that rates and fares existing at the time of its passage shall not be increased  well said mr flint impatiently well what of it  only this replied the honourable hilary you disregarded my advice and the rates on many things are higher than they were  upon my word vane said mr flint i wish youd chosen some other day to croak what do you want me to do put all the rates back because this upstart politician crewe is making a noise whos going to dig up that section  somebody has dug it up said mr vane  this was the last straw  speak out man he cried what are you leading up to  just this answered the honourable hilary that the gaylord lumber company are going to bring suit under that section  mr flint rose thrust his hands in his pockets and paced the room twice  have they got a case he demanded  it looks a little that way tome said mr vane im not prepared to give a definite opinion as yet  mr flint measured the room twice again  did that old fool hammer stumble on to this  hammers sick said mr vane they say hes got brights disease my son discovered that section  there was a certain ring of pride in the honourable hilarys voice and a lifting of the head as he pronounced the words my son which did not escape mr flint the railroad president walked slowly to the arm of the chair in which his chief counsel was seated and stood looking down at him but the honourable hilary appeared unconscious of what was impending  your son exclaimed mr flint so your son the son of the man who has been my legal adviser and confidant and friend for thirty years is going to join the crewel and tootings in their assaults on established decency and order hes out for cheap political preferment too is he by thunder i thought that he had some such thing in his mind when he came in here and threw his pass in my face and took that meader suit i dont mind telling you that hes the man ive been afraid of all along hes got a head on himi saw that at the start i trusted to you to control him and this is how you do it  it was characteristic of the honourable hilary when confronting an angry man to grow cooler as the others temper increased  i dont want to control him he said  i guess you couldnt retorted mr flint  thats a better way of putting it replied the honourable hilary i couldnt  the chief counsel for the northeastern railroads got up and went to the window where he stood for some time with his back turned to the president then hilary vane faced about  mr flint he began in his peculiar deep and resonant voice youve said some things today that i wont forget i want to tell you first of all that i admire my son  i thought so mr flint interrupted  and more than that the honourable hilary continued i prophesy that the time will come when youll admire him austen vane never did an underhanded thing in his lifeor committed a mean action hes ben wild but hes always told me the truth ive done him injustice a good many times but i wont stand up and listen to another man do him injustice here he paused and picked up his bag im going down to ripton to write out my resignation as counsel for your roads and as soon as you can find another man to act i shall consider it accepted  it is difficult to put down on paper the sensations of the president of the northeastern railroads as he listened to these words from a man with whom he had been in business relations for over a quarter of a century a man upon whose judgment he had always relied implicitly who had been a strong fortress in time of trouble such sentences had an incendiary blasphemous ring on hilary vanes lipsat first it was as if the sky had fallen and the northeastern had been wiped out of existence  mr flints feelings were in a sense akin to those of a traveller by sea who wakens out of a sound sleep in his cabin with peculiar and unpleasant sensations which he gradually discovers are due to cold water and he realizes that the boat on which he is travelling is sinking  the honourable hilary with his bag was halfway to the door when mr flint crossed the room in three strides and seized him by the arm  hold on vane he said speaking with some difficulty imim a little upset this morning and my temper got the best of me you and i have been good friends for too many years for us to part this way sit down a minute for gods sake and lets cool off i didnt intend to say what i did i apologize  mr flint dropped his counsels arm and pulled out a handkerchief and mopped his face sit down hilary he said  the honourable hilarys tight lips trembled only three or four times in their long friendship had the president made use of his first name  you wouldnt leave me in the lurch now hilary mr flint continued when all this nonsense is in the air think of the effect such an announcement would have everybody knows and respects you and we cant do without your advice and counsel but i wont put it on that ground id never forgive myself as long as i lived if i lost one of my oldest and most valued personal friends in this way  the honourable hilary looked at mr flint and sat down he began to cut a piece of honey dew but his hand shook it was difficult as we know for him to give expression to his feelings  all right he said  half an hour later victoria from under the awning of the little balcony in front of her mothers sitting room saw her father come out bareheaded into the sun and escort the honourable hilary vane to his buggy this was an unwonted proceeding  victoria loved to sit in that balcony a book lying neglected in her lap listening to the summer sounds the tinkle of distant cattle bells the bass note of a hurrying bee the strangely compelling song of the hermitthrush which made her breathe quickly the summer wind stirring wantonly was prodigal with perfumes gathered from the pines and the sweet june clover in the fields and the banks of flowers in the distance across the gentle foreground of the hills sawanec beckoneddid victoria but raise her eyesto a land of enchantment  the appearance of her father and hilary had broken her reverie and a new thought like a pain had clutched her the buggy rolled slowly down the drive and mr flint staring after it a moment went in the house after a few minutes he emerged again an old felt hat on his head which he was wont to wear in the country and a stick in his hand without raising his eyes he started slowly across the lawn and to victoria leaning forward intently over the balcony rail there seemed an unwonted lack of purpose in his movements usually he struck out briskly in the direction of the pastures where his prize guernseys were feeding stopping on the way to pick up the manager of his farm there are signs unknown to men which women read and victoria felt her heart beating as she turned and entered the sitting room through the french window a trained nurse was softly closing the door of the bedroom on the right  mrs flint is asleep she said  i am going out for a little while miss oliver victoria answered and the nurse returned a gentle smile of understanding  victoria descending the stairs hastily pinned on a hat which she kept in the coat closet and hurried across the lawn in the direction mr flint had taken reaching the pine grove thinned by a famous landscape architect she paused involuntarily to wonder again at the ultramarine of sawanec through the upright columns of the trunks under the high canopy of boughs the grove was on a plateau which was cut on the side nearest the mountain by the line of a gray stone wall under which the land fell away sharply mr flint was seated on a bench his hands clasped across his stick and as she came softly over the carpet of the needles he did not hear her until she stood beside him  you didnt tell me that you were going for a walk she said reproachfully  he started and dropped his stick she stooped quickly picked it up for him and settled herself at his side  ii didnt expect to go victoria he answered  you see she said its useless to try to slip away i saw you from the balcony  hows your mother feeling he asked  shes asleep she seems better to me since shes come back to fairview  mr flint stared at the mountain with unseeing eyes  father said victoria dont you think you ought to stay up here at least a week and rest i think so  no he said no theres a directors meeting of a trust company tomorrow which i have to attend im not tired  victoria shook her head smiling at him with serious eyes  i dont believe you know when you are tired she declared i cant see the good of all these directors meetings why dont you retire and live the rest of your life in peace youve gotmoney enough and even if you havent she added with the little quiver of earnestness that sometimes came into her voice we could sell this big house and go back to the farmhouse to live we used to be so happy there  he turned abruptly and fixed upon her a steadfast searching stare that held nevertheless a strange tenderness in it  you dont care for all this do you victoria he demanded waving his stick to indicate the domain of fairview  she laughed gently and raised her eyes to the green roof of the needles  if we could only keep the pine grove she sighed do you remember what good times we had in the farmhouse when you and i used to go off for whole days together  yes said mr flint yes  we dont do that any more said victoria its only a little drive and a walk now and then and they seem to be growingscarcer  mr flint moved uneasily and made an attempt to clear his voice  i know it he said and further speech seemingly failed him victoria had the greater courage of the two  why dont we she asked  ive often thought of it he replied still seeking his words with difficulty i find myself with more to do every year victoria instead of less  then why dont you give it up  why he asked why sometimes i wish with my whole soul i could give it up ive always said that you had more sense than most women but even you could not understand  i could understand said victoria  he threw at her another glancea ring in her words proclaimed their truth in spite of his determined doubt in her eyeshad he but known itwas a wisdom that exceeded his  you dont realize what youre saying he exclaimed i cant leave the helm  isnt it she said rather the power that is so hard to relinquish  the feelings of augustus flint when he heard this question were of a complex nature it was the second time that day he had been shockedthe first being when hilary vane had unexpectedly defended his son the word victoria had used power had touched him on the quick what had she meant by it had she been his wife and not his daughter he would have flown into a rage augustus flint was not a man given to the psychological amusement of selfexamination he had never analyzed his motives he had had little to do with women except victoria the rose of sharon knew him as the fountainhead from which authority and money flowed but victoria since her childhood had been his refuge from care and in the haven of her companionship he had lost himself for brief moments of his life she was the one being he really loved with whom he consulted on such affairs of importance as he felt to be within her scope and provincethe cattle the men on the place outside of the household the wisdom of buying the baker farm bequests to charities paintings the library and recently he had left to her judgment the european baths and the kind of treatment which her mother had required victoria had consulted with the physicians in paris and had made these decisions herself from a child she had never shown a disposition to evade responsibility  to his intimate business friends mr flint was in the habit of speaking of her as his righthand man but she was circumscribed by her sexor rather by mr flints idea of her sexand it never occurred to him that she could enter into the larger problems of his life for this reason he had never asked himself whether such a state of affairs would be desirable in reality it was her sympathy he craved and such an interpretation of himself as he chose to present to her  so her question was a shock he suddenly beheld his daughter transformed a new personality who had been thinking and thinking along paths which he had never cared to travel  the power he repeated what do you mean by that victoria  she sat for a moment on the end of the bench gazing at him with a questioning searching look which he found disconcerting what had happened to his daughter he little guessed the tumult in her breast she herself could not fully understand the strange turn the conversation had taken towards the gateway of the vital things  it is natural for men to love power isnt it  i suppose so said mr flint uneasily i dont know what youre driving at victoria  you control the lives and fortunes of a great many people  thats just it answered mr flint with a dash at this opening my responsibilities are tremendous i cant relinquish them  there is noyounger man to take your place not that i mean you are old father she continued but you have worked very hard all your life and deserve a holiday the rest of it  i dont know of any younger man said mr flint i dont mean to say im the only person in the world who can safeguard the stockholders interests in the northeastern but i know the road and its problems i dont understand this from you victoria it doesnt sound like you and as for letting go the helm now he added with a short laugh tinged with bitterness id be posted all over the country as a coward  why asked victoria in the same quiet way  why because a lot of discontented and disappointed people who have made failures of their lives are trying to give me as much trouble as they can  are you sure they are all disappointed and discontented father she said  what exclaimed mr flint you ask me that question you my own daughter about people who are trying to make me out a rascal  i dont think they are trying to make you out a rascalat least most of them are not said victoria i dont think thewhat you might call the personal aspect enters in with the honest ones  mr flint was inexpressibly amazed he drew a long breath  who are the honest ones he cried do you mean to say that you my own daughter are defending these charlatans  listen father said victoria i didnt mean to worry you i didnt mean to bring up that subject today comelets go for a walk and see the new barn  but mr flint remained firmly planted on the bench  then you did intend to bring up the subjectsome day he asked  yes said victoria she sat down again i have often wanted to hearyour side of it  whose side have you heard demanded mr flint  a crimson flush crept into her cheek but her father was too disturbed to notice it  you know she said gently i go about the country a good deal and i hear people talkingfarmers and labourers and people in the country stores who dont know that im your daughter  what do they say asked mr flint leaning forward eagerly and aggressively  victoria hesitated turning over the matter in her mind  you understand i am merely repeating what they say  yes yes he interrupted i want to know how far this thing has gone among them  well continued victoria looking at him bravely as nearly as i can remember their argument it is this that the northeastern railroads control the politics of the state for their own benefit that you appoint the governors and those that go to the legislature and thathilary vane gets them elected they say that he manages a political machinethats the right word isnt itfor you and that no laws can be passed of which you do not approve and they say that the politicians whom hilary vane commands and the men whom they put into office are all beholden to the railroad and are of a sort which good citizens cannot support they say that the railroad has destroyed the peoples government  mr flint for the moment forgetting or ignoring the charges glanced at her in astonishment the arraignment betrayed an amount of thought on the subject which he had not suspected  upon my word victoria he said you ought to take the stump for humphrey crewe  she reached out with a womanly gesture and laid her hand upon his  i am only telling youwhat i hear she said  wont you explain to me the way you look at it these people dont all seem to be dishonest men or charlatans some of them i know are honest and her colour rose again  then they are dupes and fools mr flint declared vehemently i dont know how to explain it to you the subject is too vast too farreaching one must have had some business experience to grasp it i dont mean to say youre not intelligent but im at a loss where to begin with you looked at from their limited point of view it would seem as if they had a case i dont mean your friend humphrey creweits anything to get office with him why he came up here and begged me  i wasnt thinking of humphrey crewe said victoria mr flint gave an ejaculation of distaste  hes no more of a reformer than i am and now weve got that wild son of hilary vanesthe son of one of my oldest friends and associatesmaking trouble hes bitten with this thing too and hes got some brains in his head why exclaimed mr flint stopping abruptly and facing his daughter you know him hes the one who drove you home that evening from crewes party  i remember victoria faltered drawing her hand away  i wasnt very civil to him that night but ive always been on the lookout for him i sent him a pass once and he came up here and gave me as insolent a talking to as i ever had in my life  how well victoria recalled that first visit and how she had wondered about the cause of it so her father and austen vane had quarrelled from the first  im sure he didnt mean to be insolent she said in a low voice he isnt at all that sort  i dont know what sort he is except that he isnt my sort mr flint retorted intent upon the subject which had kindled his anger earlier in the day i dont pretend to understand him he could probably have been counsel for the road if he had behaved decently instead he starts in with suits against us hes hit upon something now  the president of the northeastern dug savagely into the ground with his stick and suddenly perceived that his daughter had her face turned away from his towards the mountain  well i wont bore you with that  she turned with a look in her eyes that bewildered him  youre notboring me she said  i didnt intend to go into all that he explained more calmly but the last few days have been trying weve got to expect the wind to blow from all directions  victoria smiled at him faintly  i have told you she said that what you need is a trip abroad perhaps some day you will remember it  maybe ill go in the autumn he answered smiling back at her these little flurries dont amount to anything more than mosquitobitesonly mosquitoes are irritating you and i understand each other victoria and now listen ill give you the broad view of this subject the view ive got to take and ive lived in the world and seen more of it than some folks who think they know it all i am virtually the trustee for thousands of stockholders many of whom are widows and orphans these people are innocent they rely on my ability and my honesty for their incomes few men who have not had experience in railroad management know onetenth of the difficulties and obstructions encountered by a railroad president who strives to do his duty by the road my business is to run the northeastern as economically as is consistent with good service and safety and to give the stockholders the best return for their money i am the stewardand so long as i am the steward he exclaimed im going to do what i think is right taking into consideration all the difficulties that confront me  he got up and took a turn or two on the pineneedles victoria regarded him in silence he appeared to her at that moment the embodiment of the power he represented force seemed to emanate from him and she understood more clearly than ever how from a poor boy on an obscure farm in truro he had risen to his present height  i dont say the service is what it should be he went on but give me timegive me time with all this prosperity in the country we cant handle the freight we havent got cars enough tracks enough engines enough i wont go into that with you but i do expect you to understand this that politicians are politicians they have always been corrupt as long as i have known them and in my opinion they always will be the northeastern is the largest property holder in the state pays the biggest tax and has the most at stake the politicians could ruin us in a single session of the legislatureand whats more they would do it wed have to be paying blackmail all the time to prevent measures that would compel us to go out of business this is a fact and not a theory what little influence i exert politically i have to maintain in order to protect the property of my stockholders from annihilation it isnt to be supposed he concluded that im going to see the state turned over to a man like humphrey crewe i wish to heaven that this and every other state had a george washington for governor and a majority of robert morrises in the legislature if they exist in these days the people wont elect emthats all the kind of man the people will elect if you let em alone isa man who brings in a bill and comes to you privately and wants you to buy him off  oh father victoria cried i cant believe that of the people i see about here they seem so kind and honest and highprincipled  mr flint gave a short laugh  theyre dupes i tell you theyre at the mercy of any political schemer who thinks it worth his while to fool em take leith for instance theres a man over there who has controlled every office in that town for twentyfive years or more he buys and sells votes and credentials like cattle his name is job braden  why said victoria i saw him at humphrey crewes gardenparty  i guess you did said mr flint and i guess humphrey crewe saw him before he went  victoria was silent the recollection of the talk between mr tooting and mr crewe running through her mind and mr tootings saying that he had done dirty things for the northeastern she felt that this was something she could not tell her father nor could she answer his argument with what tom gaylord had said she could not indeed answer mr flints argument at all the subject as he had declared being too vast for her and moreover as she well knew mr flint was a man whom other men could not easily answer he bore them down even as he had borne her down involuntarily her mind turned to austen and she wondered what he had said she wondered how he would have answered her fatherwhether he could have answered him and she knew not what to think could it be right in a position of power and responsibility to acknowledge evil and deal with it as evil that was in effect the gist of mr flints contention she did not know she had never strangely enough she thought sought before to analyze the ethical side of her fathers character one aspect of him she had shared with her mother that he was a tower of defence and strength and that his name alone had often been sufficient to get difficult things done  was he right in this and were his opponents charlatans or dupes or idealists who could never be effective mr crewe wanted an office tom gaylord had a suit against the road and austen vane was going to bring that suit what did she really know of austen vane but her soul cried out treason at this and she found herself repeating with intensity i believe in him i believe in him she would have given worlds to have been able to stand up before her father and tell him that austen would not bring the suit at this time that austen had not allowed his name to be mentioned for office in this connection and had spurned mr crewes advances but she had not seen austen since february  what was his side of it he had never told her and she respected his motivesyet what was his side fresh from the inevitably deep impressions which her fathers personality had stamped upon her she wondered if austen could cope with the argument before which she had been so helpless  the fact that she made of each of these two men the embodiment of a different and opposed idea did not occur to victoria until that afternoon unconsciously each had impersonated the combatants in a struggle which was going on in her own breast her father himself instinctively had chosen austen vane for his antagonist without knowing that she had an interest in him would mr flint ever know or would the time come when she would be forced to take a side the blood mounted to her temples as she put the question from her     chapter xix mr jabe jenney entertains  mr flint had dropped the subject with his last remark nor had victoria attempted to pursue it bewildered and not a little depressed a new experience for her she had tried to hide her feelings he too was harassed and tired and she had drawn him away from the bench and through the pine woods to the pastures to look at his cattle and the model barn he was building for them at halfpast three in her runabout she had driven him to the east tunbridge station where he had taken the train for new york he had waved her a goodby from the platform and smiled and for a long time as she drove through the silent roads his words and his manner remained as vivid as though he were still by her side he was a man who had fought and conquered and who fought on for the sheer love of it  it was a blue day in the hill country at noon the clouds had crowned sawaneca sure sign of rain the rain had come and gone a june downpour and the overcast sky lent victoria fancied to the countryside a new atmosphere the hills did not look the same it was the kind of a day when certain finished country places are at their bestor rather seem best to express their meaning a day for an event a day set strangely apart with an indefinable distinction victoria recalled such days in her youth when weddings or gardenparties had brought canopies into service or news had arrived to upset the routine of the household raindrops silvered the pines and the light winds shook them down on the road in a musical shower  victoria was troubled as she drove over a question which had recurred to her many times since her talk that morning had she been hypocritical in not telling her father that she had seen more of austen vane than she had implied by her silence for many years victoria had chosen her own companions when the custom had begun her mother had made a protest which mr flint had answered with a laugh he thought victorias judgment better than his wifes ever since that time the rose of sharon had taken the attitude of having washed her hands of responsibility for a course which must inevitably lead to ruin she discussed some of victorias acquaintances with mrs pomfret and other intimates and mrs pomfret had lost no time in telling mrs flint about her daughters sleighride at the state capital with a young man from ripton who seemed to be seeing entirely too much of victoria mrs pomfret had marked certain danger signs and as a conscientious woman was obliged to speak of them mrs pomfret did not wish to see victoria make a mesalliance  my dear fanny mrs flint had cried lifting herself from the lace pillows what do you expect me to do especially when i have nervous prostration ive tried to do my duty by victoriagoodness knowsto bring her upamong the sons and daughters of the people who are my friends they tell me that she has temperamentwhatever that may be im sure i never found out except that the best thing to do with people who have it is to let them alone and pray for them when we go abroad i like the ritz and claridges and that new hotel in rome i see my friends there victoria if you please likes the little hotels in the narrow streets where you see nobody and where you are most uncomfortable miss oliver its time for those seven drops as i was saying victorias enigmatical hopeless although a french comtesse who wouldnt look at anybody at the baths this spring became wild about her and a certain type of elderly english peer always wants to marry her i suppose i do look pale today victoria loves art and really knows something about it she adores to potter around those queer places abroad where you see strange english and germans and americans with red books in their hands what am i to do about this young man of whom you speakwhatever his name is i suppose victoria will marry himit would be just like her but what can i do fanny i cant manage her and its no use going to her father he would only laugh augustus actually told me once there was no such thing as social position in this country  american men of affairs mrs pomfret judicially replied are too busy to consider position they make it my dear as a byproduct mrs pomfret smiled and mentally noted this aptly technical witticism for use again  i suppose they do assented the rose of sharon and their daughters sometimes squander it just as their sons squander their money  im not at all sure that victoria is going to squander it was mrs pomfrets comforting remark she is too much of a personage and she has great wealth behind her i wish alice were more like her in some ways alice is so helpless she has to be prodded and prompted continually i cant leave her for a moment and when she is married im going into a sanatorium for six months  i hear said mrs flint that humphrey crewe is quite epris  poor dear humphrey exclaimed mrs pomfret he can think of nothing else but politics  but we are not to take up again as yet the deeds of the crafty ulysses in order to relate an important conversation between mrs pomfret and the rose of sharon we have gone back a week in this history and have left victoriaabsorbed in her thoughtsdriving over a wood road of many puddles that led to the four corners near avalon the road climbed the songladen valley of a brook redolent now with scents of which the rain had robbed the fern but at length victoria reached an upland where the young corn was springing from the black furrows that followed the contours of the hillsides where the bigeyed cattle lay under the heavy maples and oaks or gazed at her across the fences  victoria drew up in front of an unpainted farmhouse straggling beside the road a farmhouse which began with the dignity of fluted pilasters and ended in a tumbledown open shed filled with a rusty sleigh and a hundred nondescript articlessome of which seemed to be moving intently studying this phenomenon from her runabout she finally discovered that the moving objects were children one of whom a little girl came out and stared at her  how do you do mary said victoria isnt your name mary  the child nodded  i remember you she said youre the rich lady mother met at the party that got father a job  victoria smiled and such was the potency of the smile that the child joined in it  wheres brother asked victoria he must be quite grown up since we gave him lemonade  mary pointed to the woodshed  o dear exclaimed victoria leaping out of the runabout and hitching her horse arent you afraid some of those sharp iron things will fall on him she herself rescued brother from what seemed untimely and certain death and set him down in safety in the middle of the grass plot he looked up at her with the air of one whose dignity has been irretrievably injured and she laughed as she reached down and pulled his nose then his face too became wreathed in smiles  mary how old are you  seven maam  and im five marys sister chimed in  i want you to promise me said victoria that you wont let brother play in that shed and the very next time i come ill bring you both the nicest thing i can think of  mary began to dance  well promise well promise she cried for both and at this juncture mrs fitch who had run from the washtub to get into her sunday waist came out of the door  so you haint forgot me she exclaimed i was almost afeard youd forgot me  ive been away said victoria gently taking the womans hand and sitting down on the doorstep  dont set there said mrs fitch come into the parlour youll dirty your dressmary this last in admonition  let her stay where she is said victoria putting her arm around the child the dress washes and its so nice outside  you rich folks certainly do have strange notions declared mrs fitch fingering the flounce on victorias skirt which formed the subject of conversation for the next few minutes  how are you getting on victoria asked at length  a look of pain came into the womans eyes  youve ben so good to us and done so much gettin eben a job on your fathers place that i dont feel as if i ought to lie to you he done it againon saturday night first time in three months the manager up at fairview dont know it eben was all right monday  im sorry said victoria simply was it bad  it might have ben young mr vane is stayin up at jabe jenneysyou know the first house as you turn off the hill road mr vane heard some way what youd done for us and he saw eben in ripton saturday night and made him get into his buggy and come home i guess he had a time with eben mr vane he came around here on sunday and gave him as stiff a talkin to as he ever got i guess he told eben hed ought to be ashamed of himself goin back on folks who was tryin to help him pay his mortgage and ill say this for eben he was downright ashamed he told mr vane he could lick him if he caught him drunk again and mr vane said he would my what a pretty colour youve got today  victoria rose im going to send you down some washing she said  mrs fitch insisted upon untying the horse while victoria renewed her promises to the children  there were two ways of going back to fairviewa long and a short wayand the long way led by jabe jenneys farm victoria came to the fork in the road pausedand took the long way several times after this she pulled her horse down to a walk and was apparently on the point of turning around again a disinterested observer in a farm wagon whom she passed thought that she had missed her road the first house after you turn off the hill road mrs fitch had said she could still of course keep on the hill road but that would take her to weymouth and she would never get home  it is useless to go into the reasons for this act of victorias she did not know them herself the nearer victoria got to mr jenneys the more she wished herself back at the forks suppose mrs fitch told him of her visit perhaps she could pass the jenneys unnoticed the chances of this indeed seemed highly favourable and it was characteristic of her sex that she began to pray fervently to this end then she turned off the hill road feeling as though she had but to look back to see the smoke of the burning bridges  victoria remembered the farm now for mr jabe jenney being a person of importance in the town of leith had a house commensurate with his estate the house was not large but its dignity was akin to mr jenneys position it was painted a spotless white and not a shingle or a nail was out of place before it stood the great trees planted by mr jenneys ancestors which victoria and other people had often paused on their drives to admire and on the hillside was a little oldfashioned flower garden lilacs clustered about the smallpaned windows and a bittersweet clung to the roof and pillars of the porch these details of the place which she had never before known as mr jenneys flashed into victorias mind before she caught sight of the great trees themselves looming against the sombre blueblack of the sky the wind rising fitfully stirred the leaves with a sound like falling waters and a great drop fell upon her cheek victoria raised her eyes in alarm and across the open spaces toward the hills which piled higher and higher yet against the sky was a white veil of rain she touched with her whip the shoulder of her horse recalling a farm a quarter of a mile beyondshe must not be caught here  more drops followed and the great trees seemed to reach out to her a protecting shelter she spoke to the horse beyond the farmhouse on the other side of the road was a group of gray slateshingled barns and here two figures confronted her one was that of the comfortable middleaged mr jenney himself standing on the threshold of the barn and laughing heartily and crying hang on to him thats rightget him by the nose  the person thus addressed had led a young horse to water at the spring which bubbled out of a sugarkettle hard by and the horse quivering had barely touched his nostrils to the water when he reared backward jerking the halterrope taut then followed with bewildering rapidity a series of manoeuvres on the part of the horse to get away and on the part of the person to prevent this and inasmuch as the struggle took place in the middle of the road victoria had to stop by the time the person had got the horse by the noseshutting off his windthe rain was coming down in earnest  drive right in cried mr jenney hospitably youll get wet look out austen theres a lady comin why its miss flint  victoria knew that her face must be on fire she felt austen vanes quick glance upon her but she did not dare look to the right or left as she drove into the barn there seemed no excuse for any other course  how be you said mr jenney kind of lucky you happened along here wahnt it youd have been soaked before you got to harriss how be you i aint seen you since that highfalutin party up to crewes  its very kind of you to let me come in mr jenney  but i have a raincoat and a boot andi really ought to be going on  here victoria produced the raincoat from under the seat the garment was a dark blue and mr jenney felt of its gossamer weight with a goodnatured contempt  that wouldnt be any more good than so much cheesecloth he declared nodding in the direction of the white sheet of the storm would it austen  she turned her head slowly and met austens eyes fortunate that the barn was darkened that he might not see how deep the colour mantling in her temples his head was bare and she had never really marked before the superb setting of it on his shoulders for he wore a gray flannel shirt open at the neck revealing a bronzed throat his sinewy armsweatherburned toowere bare above the elbows  explanations of her presence sprang to her lips but she put them from her as subterfuges unworthy of him she would not attempt to deceive him in the least she had wished to see him againnor did she analyze her motives once more beside him the feeling of confidence of belief in him rose within her and swept all else awayburned in a swift consuming flame the doubts of absence he took her hand but she withdrew it quickly  this is a fortunate accident he said fortunate at least for me  perhaps mr jenney will not agree with you she retorted  but mr jenney was hitching the horse and throwing a blanket over him suddenly before they realized it the farmer had vanished into the storm and this unexplained desertion of their host gave rise to an awkward silence between them which each for a while strove vainly to break in the great moments of life trivialities become dwarfed and ludicrous and the burden of such occasions is on the woman  so youve taken to farming she said isnt it about haying time  he laughed  we begin next week and youyouve come back in season for it i hope that your mother is better  yes replied victoria simply the baths helped her but im glad to get backi like my own country so much betterand especially this part of it she added i can bear to be away from new york in the winter but not from fairview in the summer  at this instant mr jenney appeared at the barn door bearing a huge green umbrella  come over to the housemis jenney is expectin you he said  victoria hesitated to refuse would be ungracious moreover she could risk no misinterpretation of her acts and she accepted mrs jenney met her on the doorstep and conducted her into that sanctum reserved for occasions the parlour with its bible its flat oldfashioned piano its samplers its crayon portrait of mr and mrs jenney after their honeymoon with its aroma that suggested sundays and best manners mrs jenney with incredible rapidity for her figure was not what it had been at the time of the crayon portrait had got into a black dress over which she wore a spotless apron she sat in the parlour with her guest until mr jenney reappeared with shining face and damp hair  youll excuse me my dear said mrs jenney but the suppers on the stove and i have to run out now and then  mr jenney was entertaining he had the shrewd humorous outlook upon life characteristic of the best type of new england farmer and victoria got along with him famously his comments upon his neighbours were kindly but incisive except when the question of spirituous liquors occurred to him austen vane he thought the world of and dwelt upon this subject a little longer than victoria under the circumstances would have wished  he comes out here just like it was home said mr jenney and helps with the horses and cows the same as if he wasnt gettin to be one of the greatest lawyers in the state  o dear mr jenney said victoria glancing out of the window ill really have to go home im sure it wont stop raining for hours but i shall be perfectly dry in my raincoatno matter how much you may despise it  youre not agoing to do anything of the kind cried mrs jenney from the doorway suppers all ready and youre going to walk right in  oh i really have to go victoria exclaimed  now i know it aint as grand as youd get at home said mr jenney it aint what wed give you miss victoriathats only simple home fareits what youd give us its the honour of having you he addedand victoria thought that no courtier could have worded an invitation better she would not be missed at fairview her mother was inaccessible at this hour and the servants would think of her as dining at leith the picture of the great lonely house of the ceremonious dinner which awaited her single presence gave her an irresistible longing to sit down with these simple kindly souls austen was the only obstacle he too had changed his clothes and now appeared smiling at her behind mrs jenney the look of prospective disappointment in the good womans face decided victoria  ill stay with pleasure she said  mr jenney pronounced grace victoria sat across the table from austen and several times the consciousness of his grave look upon her as she talked heightened the colour in her cheek he said but little during the meal victoria heard how well mrs jenneys oldest son was doing in springfield and how the unmarried daughter was teaching now in the west asked about europe that land of perpetual mystery to the native american the girl spoke so simply and vividly of some of the wonders she had seen that she held the older people entranced long after the meal was finished but at length she observed with a start the gathering darkness in the momentary happiness of this experience she had been forgetful  i will drive home with you if youll allow me said austen  oh no i really dont need an escort mr vane im so used to driving about at night i never think of it she answered  of course hell drive home with you dear said mrs jenney and jabe youll hitch up and go and fetch austen back  certain mr jenney agreed  the rain had ceased and the indistinct outline of the trees and fences betrayed the fact that the clouds were already thinning under the moon austen had lighted the side lamps of the runabout revealing the shining pools on the road as they drove alongfor the first few minutes in silence  it was very good of you to stay he said you do not know how much pleasure you have given them  her feminine appreciation responded to the tact of this remark it was so distinctly what he should have said  how delicate she thought must be his understanding of her that he should have spoken so  i was glad to stay she answered in a low voice ienjoyed it too  they have very little in their lives he said and added with a characteristic touch i do not mean to say that your coming would not be an event in any household  she laughed with him softly at this sally  not to speak of the visit you are making them she replied  oh im one of the family he said i come and go jabes is my country house when i cant stand the city any longer  she saw that he did not intend to tell her why he had left ripton on this occasion there fell another silence they were like prisoners and each strove to explore the bounds of their captivity each sought a lawful ground of communication victoria suddenly rememberedwith an access of indignationher fathers words i do not know what sort he is but he is not my sort a while ago and she had blamed herself vehemently for coming to jabe jenneys and now the act had suddenly become sanctified in her sight she did not analyze her feeling for austen but she was consumed with a fierce desire that justice should be done him he was honourablehonourable she found herself repeating under her breath no man or woman could look into his face take his hand sit by his side without feeling that he was as dependable as the stars in their courses and her father should know this must be made to know it this man was to be distinguished from opportunists and selfseekers from fanatics who strike at random his chief possession was a priceless onea conscience  as for austen it sufficed him for the moment that he had been lifted by another seeming caprice of fortune to a seat of torture the agony whereof was exquisite an hour and only the ceaseless pricking memory of it would abide the barriers had risen higher since he had seen her last but still he might look into her face and know the radiance of her presence could he only trust himself to guard his tongue but the heart on such occasions will cheat language of its meaning  what have you been doing since i saw you last she asked it seems that you still continue to lead a life of violence  sometimes i wish i did he answered with a laugh the humdrum existence of getting practice enough to keep a horse is not the most exciting in the world to what particular deed of violence do you refer  the last achievement which is in every ones mouth that of assisting mr tooting downstairs  i have been defamed austen laughed he fell down i believe but as i have a somewhat evil reputation and as he came out of my entry people draw their own conclusions i cant imagine who told you that story  never mind she answered you see i have certain sources of information about you  he tingled over this and puzzled over it so long that she laughed  does that surprise you she asked i fail to see why i should be expected to lose all interest in my friendseven if they appear to have lost interest in me  oh dont say that he cried so sharply that she wished her words unsaid you cant mean it you dont know  she trembled at the vigorous passion he put into the words  no i dont mean it she said gently  the wind had made a rent in the sheet of the clouds and through it burst the moon in her full glory flooding field and pasture and the black stretches of pine forest at their feet below them the land fell away and fell again to the distant broadening valley to where a mist of white vapour hid the course of the blue and beyond the hills rose again tier upon tier to the shadowy outline of sawanec herself against the hurrying clouds and the lightwashed sky victoria gazing at the scene drew a deep breath and turned and looked at him in the quick way which he remembered so well  sometimes she said it is so beautiful that it hurts to look at it you love itdo you ever feel that way  yes he said but his answer was more than the monosyllable i can see that mountain from my window and it seriously interferes with my work i really ought to move into another building  there was a little catch in her laugh  and i watch it she continued i watch it from the pine grove by the hour sometimes it smiles and sometimes it is sad and sometimes it is far far away so remote and mysterious that i wonder if it is ever to come back and smile again  have you ever seen the sunrise from its peak said austen  no oh how i should love to see it she exclaimed  yes you would like to see it he answered simply he would like to take her there to climb with her hand in his the wellknown paths in the darkness to reach the summit in the rosyfingered dawn to see her stand on the granite at his side in the full glory of the red light and to show her a world which she was henceforth to share with him  some such image some such vision of his figure on the rock may have been in her mind as she turned her face again toward the mountain  you are cold he said reaching for the mackintosh in the back of the trap  no she said but she stopped the horse and acquiesced by slipping her arms into the coat and he felt upon his hand the caress of a stray wisp of hair at her neck under a spell of thought and feeling seemingly laid by the magic of the night neither spoke for a space and then victoria summoned her forces and turned to him again her tone bespoke the subtle intimacy that always sprang up between them despite bars and conventions  i was sure you would understand why i wrote you from new york she said although i hesitated a long time before doing so it was very stupid of me not to realize the scruples which made you refuse to be a candidate for the governorship and i wanted toto apologize  it wasnt necessary said austen buti valued the note the words seemed so absurdly inadequate to express his appreciation of the treasure which he carried with him at that moment in his pocket but really he added smiling at her in the moonlight i must protest against your belief that i could have been an effective candidate i have roamed about the state and i have made some very good friends here and there among the hill farmers like mr jenney mr redbrook is one of these but it would have been absurd of me even to think of a candidacy founded on personal friendships i assure you he added smiling there was no self denial in my refusal  she gave him an appraising glance which he found at once enchanting and disconcerting  you are one of those people i think who do not know their own value if i were a man and such men as mr redbrook and mr jenney knew me and believed sufficiently in me and in my integrity of purpose to ask me to be their candidate here she hesitated an instant and i believed that the cause were a good one i should not have felt justified in refusing that is what i meant i have always thought of you as a man of force and a man of action but i did not seethe obstacle in your way  she hesitated once more and added with a courage which did not fail of its direct appeal i did not realize that you would be publicly opposing your father and i did not realize that you would not care to criticisemine  on the last word she faltered and glanced at his profile  had she gone too far  i felt that you would understand he answered he could not trust himself to speak further how much did she know and how much was she capable of grasping  his reticence served only to fortify her trustto elevate it it was impossible for her not to feel something of that which was in him and crying for utterance she was a woman and if this one action had been but the holding of her coat she would have known a man who could keep silent under these conditions must indeed be a rock of might and honour and she felt sure now with a surging of joy that the light she had seen shining from it was the beacon of truth a question trembled on her lipsthe question for which she had long been gathering strength whatever the outcome of this communion she felt that there must be absolute truth between them  i want to ask you something mr vanei have been wanting to for a long time  she saw the muscles of his jaw tightena manner he had when earnest or determinedand she wondered in agitation whether he divined what she was going to say he turned his face slowly to hers and his eyes were troubled  yes he said  you have always spared my feelings she went on nownow i am asking for the truthas you see it do the northeastern railroads wrongfully govern this state for their own ends  austen too as he thought over it afterwards in the night was surprised at her concise phrasing suggestive as it was of much reflection but at the moment although he had been prepared for and had braced himself against something of this nature he was nevertheless overcome by the absolute and fearless directness of her speech  that is a question he answered which you will have to ask your father  i have asked him she said in a low voice i want to know whatyou believe  you have asked him he repeated in astonishment  yes you mustnt think that in asking you i am unfair to him in any wayor that i doubt his sincerity we have been her voice caught a little the closest friends ever since i was a child she paused but i want to know what you believe  the fact that she emphasized the last pronoun sent another thrill through him did it then make any difference to her what he believed did she mean to differentiate him from out of the multitude he had to steady himself before he answeredi have sometimes thought that my own view might not be broad enough  she turned to him again  why are you evading she asked i am sure it is not because you have not settled convictions and i have asked youa favour  you have done me an honour he answered and faced her suddenly you must see he cried with a power and passion in his voice that startled and thrilled her in turn you must see that its because i wish to be fair that i hesitate i would tell youanything i do not agree with my own fatherwe have beenapartfor years because of this and i donot agree with mr flint i am sure that they both are wrong but i cannot help seeing their point of view these practices are the result of an evolution of an evolution of their time they were forced to cope with conditions in the way they did or go to the wall they make the mistake of believing that the practices are still necessary today  oh she exclaimed a great hope rising within her at these words oh and you believe they are not his explanation seemed so simple so inspiring and above and beyond that he was sure conviction rang in every word had he not she remembered staked his career by disagreeing with his father yes and he had been slow to condemn he had seen their side it was they who condemned him he must have justicehe should have it  i believe such practices are not necessary now he said firmly a new generation has comea generation more jealous of its political rights and not so willing to be rid of them by farming them out a change has taken place even in the older men like mr jenney and mr redbrook who simply did not think about these questions ten years ago men of this type who could be leaders are ready to assume their responsibilities are ready to deal fairly with railroads and citizens alike this is a matter of belief i believe itmr flint and my father do not they see the politicians and i see the people i belong to one generation and they to another with the convictions they have added to the fact that they are in a position of heavy responsibility toward the owners of their property they cannot be blamed for hesitating to try any experiments  and the practices arebad victoria asked  they are entirely subversive of the principles of american government to say the least replied austen grimly he was thinking of the pass which mr flint had sent him and of the kind of men mr flint employed to make the practices effective  they descended into the darkness of a deep valley scored out between the hills by one of the rushing tributaries of the blue the moon fell down behind the opposite ridge and the road ran through a deep forest he no longer saw the shades of meaning in her face but in the blackness of erebus he could have sensed her presence at his side speech though of this strange kind of which neither felt the strangeness had come and gone between them and now silence spoke as eloquently twice or thrice their eyes met through the gloomand there was light at length she spoke with the impulsiveness in her voice that he found so appealing  you must see my fatheryou must talk to him he doesnt know how fair you are  to austen the inference was obvious that mr flint had conceived for him a special animosity which he must have mentioned to victoria and this inference opened the way to a wide speculation in which he was at once elated and depressed why had he been so singled out and had victoria defended him once before he remembered that she had told him he must see mr flint they had gained the ridge now and the moon had risen again for them striking black shadows from the maples on the granitecropped pastures a little farther on was a road which might have been called the rear entrance to fairview  what was he to say  i am afraid mr flint has other things to do than to see me he answered if he wished to see me he would say so  would you go to see him if he were to ask you said victoria  yes he replied but that is not likely to happen indeed you are giving my opinion entirely too much importance in your fathers eyes he added with an attempt to carry it off lightly there is no more reason why he should care to discuss the subject with me than with any other citizen of the state of my age who thinks as i do  oh yes there is said victoria he regards you as a person whose opinion has some weight i am sure of that he thinks of you as a person of convictionsand he has heard things about you you talked to him once she went on astonished at her own boldness and made him angry why dont you talk to him again she cried seeing that austen was silent i am sure that what you said about the change of public opinion in the state would appeal to him and oh dont quarrel with him you have a faculty of differing with people without quarrelling with them my father has so many cares and he tries so hard to do right as he sees it you must remember that he was a poor farmers son and that he began to work at fourteen in brampton running errands for a country printer he never had any advantages except those he made for himself and he had to fight his way in a hard school against men who were not always honourable it is no wonder that he sometimes takesa material view of things but he is reasonable and willing to listen to what other men have to say if he is not antagonized  i understand said austen who thought mr flint blest in his advocate indeed victorias simple reference to her fathers origin had touched him deeply i understand but i cannot go to him there is every reason why i cannot he added and she knew that he was speaking with difficulty as under great emotion  but if he should send for you she asked she felt his look fixed upon her with a strange intensity and her heart leaped as she dropped her eyes  if mr flint should send for me he answered slowly i would comeand gladly but it must be of his own free will  victoria repeated the words over to herself it must be of his own free will waiting until she should be alone to seek their full interpretation she turned and looked across the lawn at fairview house shining in the light in another minute they had drawn up before the open door  wont you come inand wait for mr jenney she asked  he gazed down into her face searchingly and took her hand  good night he said mr jenney is not far behind i thinki think i should like the walk     chapter xx mr crewe an appreciation 1  it is given to some rare mortalswith whom fame precedes grey hairs or baldness to read while still on the rising tide of their efforts that portion of their lives which has already been inscribed on the scroll of historyor something like it mr crewe in kilts at five and prophetic picture with a train of cars whichso the family tradition runswas afterwards demolished mr crewe at fourteen in delicate health this picture was taken abroad with a longsuffering tutor who could speak feelingly if he would of embryo geniuses even at this early period humphrey crewes thirst for knowledge was insatiable he cared little the biography tells us for galleries and churches and ruins but his comments upon foreign methods of doing business were astonishingly precocious he recommended to amazed clerks in provincial banks the use of cheques ridiculed to speechless stationmasters the sideentrance railway carriage with its want of room and the size of the goods trucks he is said to have been the first to suggest that sodawater fountains might be run at a large profit in london  in college in addition to keeping up his classical courses he found time to make an exhaustive study of the railroads of the united states embodying these ideas in a pamphlet published shortly after graduation this pamphlet is now unfortunately very rare but the anonymous biographer managed to get one and quote from it if mr crewes suggestions had been carried out seventyfive per cent of the railroad accidents might have been eliminated thorough was his watchword even then and even at that period he foresaw with the prophecy of genius the days of singletrack congestion  his efforts to improve leith and the state in general to ameliorate the condition of his neighbours were fittingly and delicately dwelt upon a desire to take upon himself the burden of citizenship ledas we knowto further selfdenial he felt called upon to go to the legislatureand this is what he sawmr crewe is quoted here at length in an admirable concise and hairraising statement given in an interview to his biographer but we have been with him and know what he saw it is for lack of space reluctantly omitted  and now we are to take up where the biography left off to relate in a chapter if possible one of the most remarkable campaigns in the history of this country a certain reformer of whose acquaintance the honest chronicler boasts a reformer who got elected found on his first visit to the headquarters he had hiredtwo citizens under the influence of liquor and a little girl with a skip rope such are the beginnings that try mens souls  the window of every independent shopkeeper in ripton contained a largesized picture of the leith statesman his determined chin slightly thrust down into the gladstone collar underneath were the words i will put an end to graft and railroad rule i am a candidate of the people opening rally of the peoples campaign at the opera house at 8 pm july 10th the hon humphrey crewe of leith will tell the citizens of ripton how their state is governed  father said victoria as she read this announcement three columns wide in the ripton record as they sat at breakfast together do you mind my going i can get hastings weare to take me  not at all said mr flint who had returned from new york in a better frame of mind i should like a trustworthy account of that meeting only he added i should advise you to go early victoria in order to get a seat  you dont object to my listening to criticism of you  not by humphrey crewe laughed mr flint  early suppers instead of dinners were the rule at leith on the evening of the historic day and the candidate himself in his red leviathan was not inconsiderably annoyed on the way to ripton by innumerable carryalls and traps filled with brightly gowned recruits of that organization of mrs pomfrets which beatrice chillingham had nicknamed the ladies auxiliary in vain mr crewe tooted his horn the sound of it was drowned by the gay talk and laughter in the carryalls and shrieks ensued when the leviathan cut by with only six inches to spare and the candidate turned and addressed the drivers in language more forceful than polite and told the ladies they acted as if they were going to a punchandjudy show  poor dear humphrey said mrs pomfret is so much in earnest i wouldnt give a snap for a man without a temper  poor dear humphrey said beatrice chillingham in an undertone to her neighbour is exceedingly rude and ungrateful thats what i think  the occupants of one vehicle heard the horn and sought the top of a grassy mound to let the leviathan go by and the leviathan with characteristic contrariness stopped  hello said mr crewe with a pull at his cap i intended to be on the lookout for you  that is very thoughtful humphrey considering how many things you have to be on the lookout for this evening victoria replied  thats all right was mr crewes gracious reply i knew youd be sufficiently broadminded to come and i hope you wont take offence at certain remarks i think it my duty to make  dont let my presence affect you she answered smiling i have come prepared for anything  ill tell tooting to give you a good seat he called back as he started onward  hastings weare looked up at her with laughterbrimming eyes  victoria youre a wonder he remarked say do you remember that tall fellow we met at humphreys party austen vane  yes  i saw him on the street in ripton the other day and he came right up and spoke to me he hadnt forgotten my name now hed be my notion of a candidate he makes you feel as if your presence in the world meant something to him  i think he does feel that way replied victoria  i dont blame him if he feels that way about you said hastings who made love openly  hastings she answered when you get a little older you will learn to confine yourself to your own opinions  when i do he retorted audaciously they never make you blush like that  its probably because you have never learned to be original she replied but hastings had been set to thinking  mrs pomfret with her foresight and her talent for management had given the ladies auxiliary notice that they were not to go farther forward than the twelfth row she herself with some especially favoured ones occupied a box which was the nearest thing to being on the stage one unforeseen result of mrs pomfrets arrangement was that the first eleven rows were vacant with the exception of one old man and five or six schoolboys such is the courage of humanity in general on the arrival of the candidate instead of a surging crowd lining the sidewalk he found only a fringe of the curious whose usual post of observation was the railroad station standing silently on the curb within mr tootings duties as an usher had not been onerous he met mr crewe in the vestibule and drew him into the private office  the railroads fixed em said the manager indignantly but sotto voce ive found that out hilary vane had the word passed around town that if they came somethin would fall on em the tredways and all the people who own factories served notice on their men that if they paid any attention to this meeting theyd lose their job but say the people are watchin you just the same  how many people are in there mr crewe demanded  twentyseven when i came out said mr tooting with commendable accuracy but it wants fifteen minutes to eight  and who asked mr crewe is to introduce me  an expression of indignation spread over mr tootings face  there aint a man in riptons got sand enough he exclaimed sol gridley was agoin to but he went to new york on the noon train i guess its a pleasure trip mr tooting hinted darkly  why said mr crewe hes the fellow  exactly mr tooting replied and he did get a lot of em travelling about but sol has got to work on the quiet you understand he feels he cant come out right away  and how about amos ricketts wheres he  amos said mr tooting regretfully was taken very sudden about five oclock one of his spells come on and he sent me word to the ripton house he had his speech all made up and it was a good one too he was going to tell folks pretty straight how the railroad beat him for mayor  mr crewe made a gesture of disgust  ill introduce myself he said they all know me anyhow  say said mr tooting laying a hand on his candidates arm you couldnt do any better ive bin for that all along  hold on said mr crewe listening a lot of people are coming in now  what mr crewe had heard however was the arrival of the ladies auxiliaryfive and thirty strong from leith but stay who are these coming more ladiesladies in groups of two and three and five ladies of ripton whose husbands for some unexplained reason have stayed at home and mr tooting as he watched them with mingled feelings became a womans suffragist on the spot he dived into the private office once more where he found mr crewe seated with his legs crossed calmly reading a last winters playbill note for a more complete biography  well tooting he said i thought theyd begin to come  theyre mostly women mr tooting informed him  women  hold on said mr tooting who had the true showmans instinct cant you see that folks are curious theyre afraid to come emselves and theyre sendin their wives and daughters if you get the women tonight theyll go home and club the men into line  eight strokes boomed out from the tower of the neighbouring town hall and an expectant flutter spread over the audiencea flatter which disseminated faint odours of sachet and other mysterious substances in which feminine apparel is said to the laid away the stage was empty save for a table which held a pitcher of water and a glass  its a pretty good imitation of a matinee hastings weare remarked i wonder whom the front seats are reserved for say victoria theres your friend mr vane in the corner hes looking over here  he has a perfect right to look where he chooses said victoria she wondered whether he would come over and sit next to her if she turned around and decided instantly that he wouldnt presently when she thought hastings was off his guard she did turn to meet as she expected austens glance fixed upon her their greeting was the signal of two people with a mutual understanding he did not rise and although she acknowledged to herself a feeling of disappointment she gave him credit for a nice comprehension of the situation beside him was his friend tom gaylord who presented to her a very puzzled face and then if there had been a band it would have been time to play see the conquering hero comes  why wasnt there a band no such mistake mr tooting vowed should be made at the next rally  it was mrs pomfret who led the applause from her box as the candidate walked modestly up the side aisle and presently appeared alone on the stage the flutter of excitement was renewed and this time it might almost be called a flutter of apprehension but we who have heard mr crewe speak are in no alarm for our candidate he takes a glass of iced water he arranges with the utmost sangfroid his notes on the desk and adjusts the reading light then he steps forward and surveys the scattered groups  ladies a titter ran through the audiencea titter which started somewhere in the near neighbourhood of mr hastings weareand rose instantly to several hysterical peals of feminine laughter mrs pomfret outraged sweeps the frivolous offenders with her lorgnette mr crewe with his arm resting on the readingdesk merely raises the palm of his hand to a perpendicular reproofand gentlemen at this point the audience is thoroughly cowed ladies and gentlemen and fellow citizens i thank you for the honour you have done me in coming here to listen to the opening speech of my campaign tonight it is a campaign for decency and good government and i know that the common people of the stateof whom i have the honour to be onedemand these things i cannot say as much for the socalled prominent citizens said mr crewe glancing about him not one of your prominent citizens in ripton would venture to offend the powers that be by consenting to introduce me tonight or dared come into this theatre and take seats within thirty feet of this platform here mr crewe let his eyes rest significantly on the eleven empty rows while his hearers squirmed in terrified silence at this audacity even the ripton women knew that this was high treason beneath the walls of the citadel and many of them glanced furtively at the strangely composed daughter of augustus p flint  i will show you that i can stand on my own feet mr crewe continued i will introduce myself i am humphrey crewe of leith and i claim to have added something to the welfare and prosperity of this state and i intend to add more before i have finished  at this point as might have been expected spontaneous applause broke forth originating in the righthand stage box here was a daring defiance indeed a courage of such a high order that it completely carried away the ladies and drew reluctant plaudits from the male element give it to em humphrey said one of those who happened to be sitting next to miss flint and who received a very severe pinch in the arm in consequence  i thank the gentleman answered mr crewe and i propose tohandclapping and sachet i propose to show that you spend something like two hundred thousand dollars a year to elect legislators and send em to the capital when the real government of your state is in a room in the pelican hotel known as the railroad room and the real governor is a citizen of your town the honourable hilary vane who sits there and acts for his master mr augustus p flint of new york and i propose to prove to you that before the honourable adam b hunt appeared as that which has come to be known as the regular candidate mr flint sent for him to go to new york and exacted certain promises from him not that it was necessary but the northeastern railroads never take any chances laughter the honourable adam b hunt is what they call a safe man meaning by that a man who will do what mr flint wants him to do while i am not safe because i have dared to defy them in your name and will do what the people want me to do clapping and cheers from a gentleman in the darkness afterwards identified as mr tooting now my friends are you going to continue to allow a citizen of new york to nominate your governors and do you intend tamely to give the honourable adam b hunt your votes  they aint got any votes said a voicenot that of mr hastings weare for it came from the depths of the gallery  the hand that rocks the cradle sways the world answered mr crewe and there was no doubt about the sincerity of the applause this time  the campaign of the honourable humphrey crewe of leith said the state tribune next day was inaugurated at the opera house in ripton last night before an enthusiastic audience consisting of mr austen vane mr thomas gaylord jr mr hamilton tooting two reporters and seventyfour ladies who cheered the speaker to the echo about half of these ladies were summer residents of leith in charge of the wellknown social leader mrs patterson pomfretan organized league which it is understood will follow the candidate about the state in the english fashion kissing the babies and teaching the mothers hygienic cooking and how to ondule the hair  after speaking for an hour and a half the honourable humphrey crewe declared that he would be glad to meet any of the audience who wished to shake his hand and it was mrs pomfret who reached him first  dont be discouraged humphreyyou are magnificent she whispered  discouraged echoed mr crewe you cant kill an idea and well see whos right and whos wrong before i get through with em  what a noble spirit mrs pomfret exclaimed aside to mrs chillingham then she added in a louder tone ladies if you will kindly tell me your names i shall be happy to introduce you to the candidate well victoria i didnt expect to see you here  why not said victoria humphrey accept my congratulations  did you like it asked mr crewe i thought it was a pretty good speech myself theres nothing like telling the truth you know and by the way i hope to see you in a day or two before i start for kingston telephone me when you come down to leith  the congratulations bestowed on the candidate by the daughter of the president of the northeastern railroads quite took the breath out of the spectators who witnessed the incident and gave rise to the wildest conjectures and the admiration of mr hastings weare was unbounded  youve got the most magnificent nerve i ever saw victoria he exclaimed as they made their way towards the door  you forget humphrey she replied  hastings looked at her and chuckled in fact he chuckled all the way home in the vestibule they met mr austen vane and mr thomas gaylord the latter coming forward with a certain palpable embarrassment all through the evening tom had been trying to account for her presence at the meeting until austen had begged him to keep his speculations to himself she cant be engaged to him mr gaylord had exclaimed more than once under his breath why not austen had answered theres a good deal about him to admire because shes got more sense said tom doggedly hence he was at a loss for words when she greeted him  well mr gaylord she said you see no bones were broken after all but i appreciated your precaution in sending the buggy behind me although it wasnt necessary  i felt somewhat responsible replied tom and words failed him heres austen vane he added indicating by a nod of the head the obvious presence of that gentleman youll excuse me theres a man here i want to see  whats the matter with mr gaylord victoria asked he seems soqueer  they were standing apart alone hastings weare having gone to the stables for the runabout  mr gaylord imagines he doesnt get along with the opposite sex austen replied with just a shade of constraint  nonsense exclaimed victoria we got along perfectly the other day when he rescued me from the bushes whats the matter with him  austen laughed and their eyes met  i think he is rather surprised to see you here he said  and you returned victoria arent you equally out of place  he did not care to go into an explanation of toms suspicion in regard to mr crewe  my curiosity was too much for me he replied smiling  so was mine she replied and suddenly demanded what did you think of humphreys speech  their eyes met and despite the attempted seriousness of her tone they joined in an irresistible and spontaneous laughter they were again on that plane of mutual understanding and intimacy for which neither could account  i have no criticism to make of mr crewe as an orator at least he said  then she grew serious again and regarded him steadfastly  andwhat he said she asked  austen wondered again at the courage she had displayed all he had been able to think of in the theatre while listening to mr crewes words of denunciation of the northeastern railroads had been of the effect they might have on victorias feelings and from time to time he had glanced anxiously at her profile and now looking into her face questioning trustfulhe could not even attempt to evade he was silent  i shouldnt have asked you that she said one reason i came was becausebecause i wanted to hear the worst you were too considerate to tell meall  he looked mutely into her eyes and a great desire arose in him to be able to carry her away from it all many times within the past year when the troubles and complications of his life had weighed upon him his thoughts had turned to that western country limited only by the bright horizons where the sun rose and set if he could only take her there or into his own hills where no man might follow them it was a primeval longing and being a woman and the object of it she saw its essential meaning in his face for a brief moment they stood as completely alone as on the crest of sawanec  good night she said in a low voice  he did not trust himself to speak at once but went down the steps with her to the curb where hastings weare was waiting in the runabout  i was just telling miss flint said that young gentleman that you would have been my candidate  austens face relaxed  thank you mr weare he said simply and to victoria good night  at the corner when she turned she saw him still standing on the edge of the sidewalk his tall figure thrown into bold relief by the light which flooded from the entrance the account of the ripton meeting substantially as it appeared in the state tribune was by a singular coincidence copied at once into sixtyodd weekly newspapers and must have caused endless merriment throughout the state congressman fairplays prophecy of negligible was an exaggeration and one gentleman who had rashly predicted that mr crewe would get twenty delegates out of a thousand hid himself for shame on the whole the monumental farce forecast seemed best to fit the situation a conference was held at leith between the candidate mr tooting and the honourable timothy watling of newcastle who was preparing the nominating speech although the convention was more than two months distant mr watling was skilled in rounded periods of oratory and in other things political and both he and mr tooting reiterated their opinion that there was no particle of doubt about mr crewes nomination  but well have to fight fire with fire mr tooting declared it was probably an accident that he happened to kick at this instant mr watling under cover of the table mr watling was an old and valued friend  gentlemen said mr crewe i havent the slightest doubt of my nomination either i do not hesitate to say however that the expenses of this campaign at this early stage seem to me out of all proportion let me see what you have there  the honourable timothy wading had produced a typewritten list containing some eighty towns and wards each followed by a name and the number of the delegates therefromand figures  theyd all be enthusiastic crewe menif they could be seen by the right party declared mr tooting  mr crewe ran his eye over the list  whom would you suggest to see em he asked coldly  theres only one party i know of that has much influence over em mr tooting replied with a genial but deferential indication of his friend  at this point mr crewes secretary left the room on an errand and the three statesmen went into executive session in politics as in charity it is a good rule not to let ones right hand know what the left hand doeth half an hour later the three emerged into the sunlight mr tooting and mr watling smoking large cigars  youve got a great layout here mr crewe mr watling remarked it must have stood you in a little money eh yes ill get mileage books and youll hear from me every day or two  and now we are come to the infinitely difficult task of relating in a whirlwind manner the story of a whirlwind campaigna campaign that was to make the oldest resident sit up and take notice in the space of four short weeks a miracle had begun to show itself first there was the kingston meeting with the candidate his thumb in his watchpocket seated in an open carriage beside mr hamilton tootinga carriage draped with a sheet on which was painted down with railroad ring rule  the carriage was preceded by the kingston brass band producing throbbing martial melodies and followed we are not going to believe the state tribune any longer by a jostling and cheering crowd the band halts before the gar hall the candidate alights with a bow of acknowledgment and goes to the private office until the musicians are seated in front of the platform when he enters to renewed cheering and the tune of see the conquering hero comes  an honest historian must admit that there were two accounts of this meeting both agree that mr crewe introduced himself and poured a withering sarcasm on the heads of kingstons prominent citizens one account which the illnatured declared to be in mr tootings style and which appeared in slightly larger type than that of the other columns in the kingston and local papers stated that the hall was crowded to suffocation and that the candidate was accorded an ovation which lasted for fully five minutes  mr crewes speech was printedin this slightly larger type woe to the honourable adam b hunt who had gone to new york to see whether he could be governor why didnt he come out on the platform because he couldnt safe candidates couldnt talk his subservient and fawning reports on accidents while chairman of the railroad commission were ruthlessly quoted amid cheers and laughter what kind of railroad service was kingston getting compared to what it should have compared indeed to what it had twenty years ago an informal reception was held afterwards  more meetings followed at the rate of four a week in county after county at the end of fifteen days a selectman whose name will go down in history voluntarily mounted the platform and introduced the honourable humphrey crewe to the audience not to be sure as the saviour of the state and from that day onward mr crewe did not lack for a sponsor on the other hand the sponsors became more pronounced and at harwich a freethinking district a whole board of selectmen and five prominent citizens sat gravely beside the candidate in the town hall  1 paul pardriff ripton sent post free on application to voters and others     book 3     chapter xxi st giles of the blameless life  the burden of the valley of vision woe to the honourable adam b hunt where is he all this time on the porch of his home in edmundton smoking cigars little heeding the rising of the waters receiving visits from the honourables brush bascom nat billings and jacob botcher and signing cheques to the order of these gentlemen for necessary expenses be it known that the honourable adam was a man of substance in this worlds goods to quote from mr crewes speech at hull the northeastern railroads conferthey do not pay except in passes of late years their books may be searched in vain for evidence of the use of political funds the man upon whom they choose to confer your governorship is always able to pay the pipers purposely put in the plural  have the pipers warned the honourable adam of the rising tide against him have they asked him to gird up his loins and hire halls and smite the upstart hip and thigh they have warned him yes that the expenses may be a little greater than ordinary but it is not for him to talk or to bestir himself in any unseemly manner for the prize which he was to have was in the nature of a gift in vain did mr crewe cry out to him four times a week for his political beliefs for a statement of what he would do if he were elected governor the honourable adams dignified answer was that he had always been a good republican and would die one following a timehonoured custom he refused to say anything but it was rumoured that he believed in the gold standard  it is august and there is rejoicing inleith there is no doubt now that the campaign of the people progresses no need any more for the true accounts of the meetings in large print although these are still continued the reform rallies resemble matinees no longer and two real reporters accompany mr crewe on his tours nay the campaign of education has already borne fruit which the candidate did not hesitate to mention in his talks edmundton has more trains kingston has more trains and more cars no need now to stand up for twenty miles on a hot day and more cars are building and more engines likewise some rates have been lowered and editors who declare that the northeastern gives the state a pretty good government have like the guinea pigs long been suppressed  in these days were many councils at fairview and in the offices of the honourable hilary vane at ripton councils behind closed doors from which the councillors emerged with smiling faces that men might not know the misgivings in their hearts councils nevertheless out of which leaked rumours of dissension and recrimination conditions hitherto unheard of one post ran to meet another and one messenger ran to meet another and it was even reportedthough on doubtful authorityafter the rally in his town the honourable jacob botcher had made the remark that under certain conditions he might become a reformer  none of these upsetting rumours however were allowed by mr bascom and other gentlemen close to the honourable adam b hunt to reach that candidate who continued to smoke in tranquillity on the porch of his home until the fifteenth day of august at eight oclock that morning the postman brought him a letter marked personal the handwriting on which he recognized as belonging to the honourable hilary vane for some reason as he read the sensations of the honourable adam were disquieting the contents of the letter to say the least were peculiar tomorrow at noon precisely i shall be driving along the broad brook road by the abandoned millthree miles towards edmundton from hull i hope you will find it convenient to be there  these were the strange words the honourable hilary had written and the honourable adam knew that it was an order at that very instant mr hunt had been reading in the guardian the account of an overflow meeting in newcastle by his opponent in which mr crewe had made some particularly choice remarks about him and had been cheered to the echo the honourable adam put the paper down and walked up the street to talk to mr burrows the postmaster whom with the aid of congressman fairplay he had had appointed at edmundton the two racked their brains for three hours and postmaster burrows who was the fortunate possessor of a pass offered to go down to ripton in the interest of his liege lord and see what was up the honourable adam however decided that he could wait for twentyfour hours  the morning of the sixteenth dawned clear as beautiful a summers day for a drive as any man could wish but the spirit of the honourable adam did not respond to the weather and he had certain vague forebodings as his horse jogged toward hull although these did not take such a definite shape as to make him feel a premonitory pull of his coattails the ruined mill beside the rushing stream was a picturesque spot and the figure of the honourable hilary vane seated on the old millstone in the green and gold shadows of a beech gave an interesting touch of life to the landscape the honourable adam drew up and eyed his friend and associate of many years before addressing him  how are you hilary  hitch your horse said mr vane  the honourable adam was some time in picking out a convenient tree then he lighted a cigar and approached mr vane and at length let himself down cautiously on the millstone sitting on his porch had not improved mr hunts figure  this is kind of mysterious aint it hilary he remarked with a tug at his goatee  i dont know but what it is admitted mr vane who did not look as though the coming episode were to give him unqualified joy  fine weather remarked the honourable adam with a brave attempt at geniality  the paper predicts rain tomorrow said the honourable hilary  you dont smoke do you asked the honourable adam  no said the honourable hilary  a silence except for the music of the brook over the broken dam  pretty place said the honourable adam i kissed my wife here oncebefore i was married  this remark although of interest the honourable hilary evidently thought did not require an answer  adam said mr vane presently how much money have you spent so far  well said mr hunt it has been sort of costly but brush and the boys tell me the times are uncommon and i guess they are if that crazy cuss crewe hadnt broken loose it would have been different not that im uneasy about him but all this talk of his and newspaper advertising had to be counteracted some why he has a couple of columns a week right here in the edmundton courier the papers are bleedin him to death certain  how much have you spent asked the honourable hilary  the honourable adam screwed up his face and pulled his goatee thoughtfully  what are you trying to get at hilary he inquired sending for me to meet you out here in the woods in this curious way if you wanted to see me why didnt you get me to go down to ripton or come up and sit on my porch youve been there before  times said the honourable hilary repeating perhaps unconsciously mr hunts words are uncommon this man crewes making more headway than you think the people dont know him and hes struck a popular note its the fashion to be down on railroads these days  ive taken that into account replied mr hunt  its unlucky and it comes high i dont think hes got a show for the nomination but my danders up and ill beat him if i have to mortgage my house  the honourable hilary grunted and ruminated  how much did you say youd spent adam  if you think im not free enough ill loosen up a little more said the honourable adam  how free have you been said the honourable hilary  for some reason the question put in this form was productive of results  i cant say to a dollar but ive got all the amounts down in a book i guess somewhere in the neighbourhood of nine thousand would cover it  mr vane grunted again  would you take a cheque adam he inquired  what for cried the honourable adam  for the amount youve spent said the honourable hilary sententiously  the honourable adam began to breathe with apparent difficulty and his face grew purple but mr vane did not appear to notice these alarming symptoms then the candidate turned about as on a pivot seized mr vane by the knee and looked into his face  did you come up here with orders for me to get out he demanded with some pardonable violence by thunder i didnt think that of my old friend hilary vane you ought to have known me better and flint ought to have known me better there aint a mite of use of our staying here another second and you can go right back and tell flint what i said flint knows ive been waiting to be governor for eight years and each year its been just a year ahead you ask him what he said to me when he sent for me to go to new york i thought he was a man of his word and he promised me that i should be governor this year  the honourable hilary gave no indication of being moved by this righteous outburst  you can be governor next year when this reform nonsense has blown over he said you cant be this year even if you stay in the race  why not the honourable adam asked pugnaciously  your record wont stand itnot just now said mr vane slowly  my record is just as good as yours or any mans said the honourable adam  i never run for office answered mr vane  havent i spent the days of my active life in the service of that roadand is this my reward havent i done what flint wanted always  thats just the trouble said the honourable hilary too many folks know it if were going to win this time weve got to have a man whos never had any northeastern connections  who have you picked demanded the honourable adam with alarming calmness  we havent picked anybody yet said mr vane but the man who goes in will give you a cheque for what youve spent and you can be governor next time  well if this isnt the ddest coldestblooded proposition ever made i want to know cried the honourable adam will flint put up a bond of one hundred thousand dollars that ill be nominated and elected next year this is the clearest case of going back on an old friend i ever saw if this is the way you fellows get scared because a sham reformer gets up and hollers against the road then i want to serve notice on you that im not made of that kind of stuff when i go into a fight i go in to stay and you cant pull me out by the coattails in favour of a saint whos never done a lick of work for the road you tell flint that  all right adam said hilary  some note in hilarys voice as he made this brief answer suddenly sobered the honourable adam and sent a cold chill down his spine he had had many dealings with mr vane and he had always been as putty in the chief counsels hands this simple acquiescence did more to convince the honourable adam that his chances of nomination were in real danger than a long and forceful summary of the situation could have accomplished but like many weak men the honourable adam had a stubborn streak and a fatuous idea that opposition and indignation were signs of strength  ive made sacrifices for the road before and effaced myself but by thunder this is too much  corporations like republics are proverbially ungrateful the honourable hilary might have voiced this sentiment but refrained  mr flints a good friend of yours adam he wanted me to say that hed always taken care of you and always would so far as in his power if you cant be landed this time its common sense for you to get out and waitisnt it well see that you get a cheque to cover what youve put out  the humour in this financial sacrifice of mr flints which the unknown new candidate was to make with a cheque struck neither the honourable adam nor the honourable hilary the transaction if effected would resemble that of the shrine to the virgin built by a grateful marquis of mantuawhich a jew paid for  the honourable adam got to his feet  you can tell flint he said that if he will sign a bond of one hundred thousand dollars to elect me next time ill get out thats my last word  all right adam replied mr vane rising also  mr hunt stared at the honourable hilary thoughtfully and although the gubernatorial candidate was not an observant man he was suddenly struck by the fact that the chief counsel was growing old  i wont hold this against you hilary he said  politics said the honourable hilary are business matters  ill show flint that it would have been good business to stick to me said the honourable adam when he gets panicky and spends all his money on new equipment and service its time for me to drop him you can tell him so from me  hadnt you better write him said the honourable hilary  the rumour of the entry of mr giles henderson of kingston into the gubernatorial contest preceded by ten days or so the actual event it is difficult for the historian to unravel the precise circumstances which led to this candidacy conservative citizens throughout the state it was understood had become greatly concerned over the trend political affairs were taking the radical doctrines of one candidatepropounded for very obvious reasonsthey turned from in disgust on the other hand it was evident that an underlying feeling existed in certain sections that any candidate who was said to have had more or less connection with the northeastern railroads was undesirable at the present time this was not to be taken as a reflection on the northeastern which had been the chief source of the states prosperity but merely as an acknowledgment that a public opinion undoubtedly existed and ought to be taken into consideration by the men who controlled the republican party  this was the gist of leading articles which appeared simultaneously in several newspapers apparently before the happy thought of bringing forward mr giles henderson had occurred to anybody he was mentioned first and most properly by the editor of the kingston pilot and the article with comments upon it ran like wildfire through the press of the stateappearing even in those sheets which maintained editorially that they were for the honourable adam b hunt first and last and all the time whereupon mr giles henderson began to receive visits from the solid mennot politicians of the various cities and counties for instance mr silas tredway of ripton made such a pilgrimage and as a citizen who had voted in 1860 for abraham lincoln showing mr tredway himself to have been a radical once appealed to mr henderson to save the state  at first mr henderson would give no ear to these appeals but shook his head pessimistically he was not a politicianso much the better we dont want a politician he was a plain business man exactly what is needed a conservative levelheaded business man wholly lacking in those sensational qualities which are a stench in the nostrils of good citizens mr giles henderson admitted that the time had come when a man of these qualities was neededbut he was not the man mr tredway was the manso he told mr tredway mr gates of brampton was the manso he assured mr gates mr henderson had no desire to meddle in politics his life was a happy and a full one but was it not mr hendersons duty cincinnatus left the plough and mr henderson should leave the ledger at the call of his countrymen  mr giles henderson was mildmannered and blueeyed with a scanty beard that was turning white he was a deacon of the church a member of the school board president of the kingston national bank the main business of his life had been in coal which incidentally had had to be transported over the northeastern railroads and coal rates for some reason were cheaper from kingston than from many points out of the state the distances of which were nearer mr henderson had been able to sell his coal at a lower price than any other large dealer in the eastern part of the state mr henderson was the holder of a large amount of stock in the northeastern inherited from his father facts of no special significance and not printed in the weekly newspapers mr henderson lived in a gloomy gothic house on high street ate three very plain meals a day and drank iced water he had been a good husband and a good father and had always voted the republican ticket he believed in the gold standard a high tariff and eternal damnation at last his resistance was overcome and he consented to allow his name to be used  it was used with a vengeance spontaneous praise of mr giles henderson bubbled up all over the state and editors who were for the honourable adam b hunt suddenly developed a second choice no man within the borders of the commonwealth had so many good qualities as the new candidate and it must have been slightly annoying to one of that gentlemans shrinking nature to read daily on coming down to breakfast a list of virtues attributed to him as long as a rate schedule how he must have longed for the record of one wicked deed to make him human  who will pick a flaw in the character of the honourable giles henderson let that man now stand forth  the news of the probable advent of mr giles henderson on the field as well as the tidings of his actual consent to be a candidate were not slow in reaching leith andmr crewes bureau of information being in perfect working orderthe dastardly attempt on the honourable adam b hunts coattails was known there more wonders to relate the honourable adam b hunt had become a reformer he had made a statement at last in which he declared with vigour that no machine or ring was behind him he stood on his own merits invited the minutest inspection of his record declared that he was an advocate of good government and if elected would be the servant of no man and of no corporation  thriceblessed state in which there were now three reform candidates for governor  all of these happenings went to indicate confusion in the enemys camp and corresponding elation in mr crewes woe to the reputation for political sagacity of the gentleman who had used the words negligible and monumental farce the tide was turning and the candidate from leith redoubled his efforts had he been confounded by the advent of the honourable giles not at all mr crewe was not given to satire his methods as we know were direct hence the real author of the following passage in his speech before an overflow meeting in the state capital remains unknown  my friends mr crewe had said i have been waiting for the time when st giles of the blameless life would be pushed forward apparently as the only hope of our socalled solid citizens prolonged laughter and audible repetitions of mr hendersons nickname which was to stick i will tell you by whose desire st giles became a candidate and whose bidding he will do if he becomes governor as blindly and obediently as the honourable adam b hunt ever did shouts of flint and the northeastern i see you know who sent the solid citizens to see mr henderson flint this is a clever trickexactly what i should have done if id been running their campaignonly they didnt do it early enough they picked mr giles henderson for two reasons because he lives in kingston which is antirailroad and supported the gaylord bill and because he never in his life committed any positive action good or badand he never will and they made another mistakethe honourable adam b hunt wouldnt back out laughter and cheers     chapter xxii in which euphrasia takes a hand  austen had not forgotten his promise to euphrasia and he had gone to hanover street many times since his sojourn at mr jabe jenneys usually these visits had taken place in the middle of the day when euphrasia with gentle but determined insistence had made him sit down before some morsel which she had prepared against his coming and which he had not the heart to refuse in answer to his inquiries about hilary she would toss her head and reply disdainfully that he was as comfortable as he should be for euphrasia had her own strict ideas of justice and to her mind hilarys suffering was deserved that suffering was all the more terrible because it was silent but euphrasia was a stern woman to know that he missed austen to feel that hilary was being justly punished for his treatment of her idol for his callous neglect and lack of realization of the blessings of his lifethese were euphrasias grim compensations  at times even she had experienced a strange rejoicing that she had promised austen to remain with his father for thus it had been given her to be the daily witness of a retribution for which she had longed during many years nor did she strive to hide her feelings their intercourse never voluminous had shrunk to the barest necessities for the use of speech but hilary ever since the night of his sons departure had read in the face of his housekeeper a knowledge of his suffering an exultation a thousand times more maddening than the little reproaches of language would have been he avoided her more than ever and must many times have regretted bitterly the fact that he had betrayed himself to her as for euphrasia she had no notion of disclosing hilarys torture to his son she was determined that the victory when it came should be austens and the surrender hilarys  he manages to eat his meals and gets along as common she would reply he only thinks of himself and that railroad  but austen read between the lines  poor old judge he would answer its because hes made that way phrasie he cant help it any more than i can help flinging lawbooks on the floor and running off to the country to have a good time you know as well as i do that he hasnt had much joy out of life that hed like to be different only he doesnt know how  i cant see that it takes much knowledge to treat a wife and son like human beings euphrasia retorted thats only common humanity for a man that goes to meetin twice a week youd have thought hed have learned something by this time out of the new testament hes prayed enough in his life goodness knows  now euphrasias ordinarily sharp eyes were sharpened an hundred fold by affection and of late at odd moments during his visits austen had surprised them fixed on him with a penetration that troubled him  you dont seem to fancy the tarts as much as you used to she would remark time was when youd eat three and four at a sittin  phrasie one of your persistent fallacies is that im still a boy  you aint yourself said euphrasia ignoring this pleasantry and you aint been yourself for some months ive seen it i havent brought you up for nothing if hes troubling you dont you worry a mite he aint worth it he eats better than you do  im not worrying much about that austen answered smiling the judge and i will patch it up before longim sure hes worried now over these people who are making trouble for his railroad  i wish railroads had never been invented cried euphrasia it seems to me they bring nothing but trouble my mother used to get along pretty well in a stagecoach  one evening in september when the summer days were rapidly growing shorter and the mists rose earlier in the valley of the blue austen who had stayed late at the office preparing a case ate his supper at the ripton house as he sat in the big dining room which was almost empty the sense of loneliness which he had experienced so often of late came over him and he thought of euphrasia his father he knew had gone to kingston for the night and so he drove up hanover street and hitched pepper to the stone post before the door euphrasia according to an invariable custom would be knitting in the kitchen at this hour and at the sight of him in the window she dropped her work with a little joyful cry  i was just thinking of you she said in a low voice of tenderness which many people would not have recognized as euphrasias as though her thoughts of him were the errant ones of odd moments im so glad you come its lonesome here of evenings austen  he entered silently and sat down beside her in a windsor chair which had belonged to some remote austen of bygone days  you dont have as good things to eat up at mis jenneys as i give you she remarked not that you appear to care much for eatables any more austen are you feeling poorly  i can dig more potatoes in a day than any other man in ripton he declared  youd ought to get married said euphrasia abruptly ive told you that before but you never seem to pay any attention to what i say  why havent you tried it phrasie he retorted  he was not prepared for what followed euphrasia did not answer at once but presently her knitting dropped to her lap and she sat staring at the old clock on the kitchen shelf  he never asked me she said simply  austen was silent the answer seemed to recall with infinite pathos euphrasias longlost youth and he had not thought of youth as a quality which could ever have pertained to her she must have been young once and fresh and full of hope for herself she must have known long ago something of what he now felt something of the joy and pain something of the inexpressible never ceasing yearning for the fulfilment of a desire that dwarfed all others euphrasia had been denied that fulfilment and hewould he too be denied it  out of euphrasias eyes as she gazed at the mantelshelf shone the light of undying fires withinfires which at a touch could blaze forth after endless years transforming the wrinkled face softening the sterner lines of character and suddenly there was a new bond between the two so used are the young to the acceptance of the sacrifice of the old that they lose sight of that sacrifice but austen saw now in a flash the years of euphrasias selfdenial the years of memories the years of regrets for that which might have been  phrasie he said laying a hand on hers which rested on the arm of the chair i was only joking you know  i know i know euphrasia answered hastily and turned and looked into his face searchingly her eyes were undimmed and the light was still in them which revealed a soul of which he had had no previous knowledge  i know you was dear i never told that to a living being except your mother hes dead nowhe never knew but i told heri couldnt help it she had a way of drawing things out of you and you just couldnt resist ill never forget that day she came in here and looked at me and took my handsame as you have it now she wasnt married then ill never forget the sound of her voice as she said euphrasia tell me about it here euphrasias own voice trembled i told her just as im telling youbecause i couldnt help it folks had to tell her things  she turned her hand and clasped his tightly with her own thin fingers  and oh austen she cried i want so that you should be happy she was so unhappy it doesnt seem right that you should be too  i shall be phrasie he said you mustnt worry about that  for a while the only sound in the room was the ticking of the old clock with the quaint coloured picture on its panel and then with a movement which strangely was an acute reminder of a way victoria had euphrasia turned and searched his face once more  youre not happy she said  he could not put this asidenor did he wish to her own confidence had been so simple so fine so sure of his sympathy that he felt it would be unworthy to equivocate the confessions of the selfreliant are sacred things yes and there had been times when he had longed to unburden himself but he had had no intimate on this plane and despite the great sympathy between themthat euphrasia might understand had never occurred to him she had read his secret  in that instant euphrasia with the instinct which love lends to her sex had gone farther indignation seized herand the blame fell upon the woman austens words unconsciously were an answer to her thoughts  it isnt anybodys fault but my own he said  euphrasias lips were tightly closed long ago the idol of her youth had faded into the substance of which dreams are madeto be recalled by dreams alone another worship had filled her heart and austen vane had becomefor herthe fulness and the very meaning of life itself one to be admired of all men to be desired of all women visions of austens courtship had at times risen in her mind although euphrasia would not have called it a courtship when the time came austen would confer and so sure of his judgment was euphrasia that she was prepared to take the recipient of the priceless gift into her arms and now was it possible that a woman lived who would even hesitate curiosity seized euphrasia with the intensity of a passion who was this woman when and where had he seen her ripton could not have produced herfor it was characteristic of euphrasia that no girl of her acquaintance was worthy to be raised to such a height austens wife would be an unknown of ideal appearance and attainments hence indignation rocked euphrasia and doubts swayed her in this alone she had been an idealist but she might have known that good men were a prey to the unworthy of the opposite sex  she glanced at austens face and he smiled at her gently as though he divined something of her thoughts  if it isnt your fault that youre not happy then the matters easily mended she said  he shook his head at her as though in reproof  was yourseasily mended he asked  euphrasia was silent a moment  he never knew she repeated in a low voice  well phrasie it looks very much as if we were in the same boat he said  euphrasias heart gave a bound  then you havent spoke she cried i knew you hadnt ii was a womanbut sometimes ive thought id ought to have given him some sign youre a man austen thank god for it youre a man if a man loves a woman hes only got to tell her so  it isnt as simple as that he answered  euphrasia gave him a startled glance  she aint married she exclaimed  no he said and laughed in spite of himself  euphrasia breathed again for sarah austen had had a morality of her own and on occasions had given expression to extreme views  shes not playin with you was euphrasias next question and her tone boded ill to any young person who would indulge in these tactics with austen  he shook his head again and smiled at her vehemence  no shes not playing with meshe isnt that kind id like to tell you but i canti cant it was only because you guessed that i said anything about it he disengaged his hand and rose and patted her on the cheek i suppose i had to tell somebody he said and you seemed somehow to be the right person phrasie  euphrasia rose abruptly and looked up intently into his face he thought it strange afterwards as he drove along the dark roads that she had not answered him  even though the matter were on the knees of the gods euphrasia would have taken it thence if she could nor did austen know that she shared with him that night his waking hours  the next morning mr thomas gaylord the younger was making his way towards the office of the gaylord lumber company conveniently situated on willow street near the railroad young tom was in a particularly jovial frame of mind despite the fact that he had arrived in ripton on the night express as early as five oclock in the morning he had been touring the state ostensibly on lumber business but young tom had a large and varied personal as well as commercial acquaintance and he had the inestimable happiness of being regarded as an honest man while his rough and genial qualities made him beloved for these reasons and others of a more material nature suggestions from mr thomas gaylord were apt to be well receivedand tom had been making suggestions  early as he was at his officethe officeboy was sprinkling the flooryoung tom had a visitor who was earlier still pausing in the doorway mr gaylord beheld with astonishment a prim elderly lady in a stiff black dress sitting upright on the edge of a capacious oak chair which seemed itself rather discomfited by what it containedfor its hospitality had hitherto been extended to visitors of a very different sort  well upon my soul cried young tom if it isnt euphrasia  yes its me said euphrasia ive been to market and i had a notion to see you before i went home  mr gaylord took the officeboy lightly by the collar of his coat and lifted him sprinkling can and all out of the doorway and closed the door then he drew his revolving chair close to euphrasia and sat down they were old friends and more than once in a youth far from model tom had experienced certain physical reproof at her hands for which he bore no illwill there was anxiety on his face as he askedthere hasnt been any accident has there euphrasia  no she said  no new row inquired tom  no said euphrasia she was a direct person as we know but true descendants of the puritans believe in the decency of preliminaries and here was certainly an affair not to be plunged into euphrasia was a spinster in the strictest sense of that formidable and highly descriptive term and she intended ultimately to discuss with tom a subject of which she was supposed by tradition to be wholly ignorant the mere mention of which still brought warmth to her cheeks such a delicate matter should surely be led up to delicately in the meanwhile tom was mystified  well im mighty glad to see you anyhow he said heartily it was fond of you to call euphrasia i cant offer you a cigar  i should think not said euphrasia  tom reddened he still retained for her some of his youthful awe  i cant do the honours of hospitality as id wish to he went on i cant give you anything like the pies you used to give me  you stole most of em said euphrasia  i guess thats so said young tom laughing but ill never taste pies like em again as long as i live do you know euphrasia there were two reasons why those were the best pies i ever ate  what were they she asked apparently unmoved  first said tom because you made em and second because they were stolen  truly young tom had a way with women had he only been aware of it  i never took much stock in stolen things said euphrasia  its because you never were tempted with such pie as that replied the audacious mr gaylord  youre gettin almighty stout said euphrasia  as we see her this morning could she indeed ever have had a love affair  i dont have to use my legs as much as i once did said tom and this remark brought to an end the first phase of this conversationbrought to an end apparently all conversation whatsoever tom racked his brain for a new topic opened his rolltop desk drummed on it looked up at the ceiling and whistled softly and then turned and faced again the imperturbable euphrasia  euphrasia he said youre not exactly a politician i believe  well said euphrasia ive ben maligned a good many times but nobody ever went that far  mr gaylord shook with laughter  then i guess theres no harm in confiding political secrets to you he said ive been around the state some this week talking to people i know and i believe if your austen wasnt so obstinate we could make him governor  obstinate ejaculated euphrasia  yes said tom with a twinkle in his eye obstinate he doesnt seem to want something that most men would give their souls for  and why should he dirty himself with politics she demanded in the years ive lived with hilary vane ive seen enough of politicians goodness knows i never want to see another  if austen was governor wed change some of that but mind euphrasia this is a secret said tom raising a warning finger if austen hears about it now the jigs up  euphrasia considered and thawed a little  they dont often have governors that young do they she asked  no said tom forcibly they dont and so far as i know they havent had such a governor for years as austen would make but he wont push himself you know euphrasia i have always believed that he will be president some day  euphrasia received this somewhat startling prediction complacently she had no doubt of its accuracy but the enunciation of it raised young tom in her estimation and incidentally brought her nearer her topic  austen aint himself lately she remarked  i knew that he didnt get along with hilary said tom sympathetically beginning to realize now that euphrasia had come to talk about her idol  its hilary doesnt get along with him she retorted indignantly hes responsiblenot austen of all the narrow pigheaded selfish men the lord ever created hilary vanes the worst its hilary drove him out of his mothers house to live with strangers its austen that comes around to inquire for his fatherhilary never has a word to say about austen a trace of colour actually rose under euphrasias sallow skin and she cast her eyes downward youve known him a good while havent you tom  all my life said tom mystified again all my life and i think more of him than of anybody else in the world  i calculated as much she said thats why i came she hesitated artful euphrasia we will let the ingenuous mr gaylord be the first to mention this delicate matter if possible goodness knows it aint hilary i came to talk about i had a notion that youd know if anything else was troubling austen  why said tom there cant be any business troubles outside of those hilarys mixed up in austen doesnt spend any money to speak of except what he gives away and hes practically chief counsel for our company  euphrasia was silent a moment  i suppose theres nothing else that could bother him she remarked she had never held tom gaylords powers of comprehension in high estimation and the estimate had not risen during this visit but she had undervalued him even tom could rise to an inspirationwhen the sources of all other inspirations were eliminated  why he exclaimed with a masculine lack of delicacy he may be in love  thats struck you has it said euphrasia  but tom appeared to be thinking he was in truth engaged in collecting his cumulative evidence austens sleighride at the capital which he had discovered his talk with victoria after her fall when she had betrayed an interest in austen which tom had thought entirely natural and finally victorias appearance at mr crewes rally in ripton young mr gaylord had not had a great deal of experience in affairs of the heart and he was himself aware that his diagnosis in such a matter would not carry much weight he had conceived a tremendous admiration for victoria which had been shaken a little by the suspicion that she might be intending to marry mr crewe tom gaylord saw no reason why austen vane should not marry mr flints daughter if he choseor any other mans daughter partaking in this respect somewhat of euphrasias view as for austen himself tom had seen no symptoms but then he reflected he would not be likely to see any however he perceived the object now of euphrasias visit and began to take the liveliest interest in it  so you think austens in love he demanded  euphrasia sat up straighter if anything  i didnt say anything of the kind she returned  he wouldnt tell me you know said tom i can only guess at it  and thelady said euphrasia craftily  im up a tree there too all i know is that he took her sleighriding one afternoon at the capital and wouldnt tell me who he was going to take and then she fell off her horse down at east tunbridge station  fell off her horse echoed euphrasia an accident comparable in her mind to falling off a roof what manner of young woman was this who fell off horses  she wasnt hurt tom continued and she rode the beast home he was a wild one i can tell you and shes got pluck thats the first time i ever met her although i had often seen her and thought she was a stunner to look at she talked as if she took an interest in austen  an exact portrayal of euphrasias feelings at this description of the object of austens affections is almost impossible a young woman who was a stunner who rode wild horses and fell off them and rode them again was beyond the pale not only of euphrasias experience but of her imagination likewise and this hoyden had talked as though she took an interest in austen euphrasia was speechless  the next time i saw her said tom was when she came down here to listen to humphrey crewes attacks on the railroad i thought that was a sort of a queer thing for flints daughter to do but austen didnt seem to look at it that way he talked to her after the show was over  at this point euphrasia could contain herself no longer and in her excitement she slipped off the edge of the chair and on to her feet  flints daughter she cried augustus p flints daughter  tom looked at her in amazement  didnt you know who it was he stammered but euphrasia was not listening  ive seen her she was saying ive seen her ridin through ripton in that little red wagon drivin herself with a coachman perched up beside her flints daughter euphrasia became speechless once more the complications opened up being too vast for intelligent comment euphrasia however grasped some of the problems which austen had had to face moreover she had learned what she had come for and the obvious thing to do now was to go home and reflect so without further ceremony she walked to the door and opened it and turned again with her hand on the knob look here tom gaylord she said if you tell austen i was here ill never forgive you i dont believe youve got any more sense than to do it  and with these words she took her departure ere the amazed mr gaylord had time to show her out half an hour elapsed before he opened his letters  when she arrived home in hanover street it was nine oclockan hour well on in the day for euphrasia unlocking the kitchen door she gave a glance at the stove to assure herself that it had not been misbehaving and went into the passage on her way upstairs to take off her gown before sitting down to reflect upon the astonishing thing she had heard habit had so crystallized in euphrasia that no news however amazing could have shaken it but in the passage she paused an unwonted or rather untimely sound reached her ears a sound which came from the front of the houseand at nine oclock in the morning had austen been at home euphrasia would have thought nothing of it in her remembrance hilary vane whether he returned from a journey or not had never been inside the house at that hour on a weekday and unlike the gentleman in la vie de boheme euphrasia did not have to be reminded of the sabbath  perhaps austen had returned or perhaps it was a burglar euphrasia undaunted ran through the darkened front hall to where the graceful banister ended in a curve at the foot of the stairs and there on the bottom step sat a man with his head in his hands euphrasia shrieked he looked up and she saw that it was hilary vane she would have shrieked anyway  what in the worlds the matter with you she cried  ii stumbled coming down the stairs he said  but what are you doing at home in the middle of the morning she demanded  he did not answer her the subdued light which crept under the porch and came in through the fan shaped window over the door fell on his face  are you sick said euphrasia in all her life she had never seen him look like that  he shook his head but did not attempt to rise a hilary vane without vigour  no he said no i just came up here from the train toget somethin id left in my room  a likely story said euphrasia youve never done that in thirty years youre sick and im agoing for the doctor  she put her hand to his forehead but he thrust it away and got to his feet although in the effort he compressed his lips and winced  you stay where you are he said i tell you im not sick and im going down to the square let the doctors alonei havent got any use for em  he walked to the door opened it and went out and slammed it in her face by the time she had got it open againa crackhe had reached the sidewalk and was apparently in full possession of his powers and faculties     chapter xxiii a fallingout in high places  although one of the most exciting political battles ever fought is fast coming to its climax and a now jubilant mr crewe is contesting every foot of ground in the state with the determination and pertinacity which make him a marked man although the convention wherein his fate will be decided is now but a few days distant and everything has been done to secure a victory which mortal man can do let us follow hilary vane to fairview not that hilary has been idle the book of arguments is exhausted and the chiefs and the captains have been to ripton and received their final orders but more than one has gone back to his fief with the vision of a changed hilary who has puzzled them rumours have been in the air that the harmony between the source of power and the distribution of power is not as complete as it once was certainly hilary vane is not the man he wasalthough this must not even be whispered senator whitredge had toldbut never mind that in the old days an order was an order there were no rebels then in the old days there was no wavering and rescinding and if the chief counsel told you with brevity to do a thing you went and did it straightway with the knowledge that it was the best thing to do hilary vane had aged suddenly and it occurred for the first time to many that in this utilitarian world old blood must be superseded by young blood  two days before the convention immediately after taking dinner at the ripton house with mr nat billings hilary vane in response to a summons drove up to fairview one driving behind him would have observed that the honourable hilarys horse took his own gaits and that the reins most of the time drooped listlessly on his quarters a september stillness was in the air a september purple clothed the distant hills but to hilary the glories of the day were as things nonexistent even the groom at fairview who took his horse glanced back at him with a peculiar expression as he stood for a moment on the steps with a hesitancy the man had never before remarked  in the meantime mr flint with a pile of letters in a special basket on the edge of his desk was awaiting his counsel the president of the northeastern was pacing his room as was his wont when his activities were for a moment curbed or when he had something on his mind and every few moments he would glance towards his mantel at the clock which was set to railroad time in past days he had never known hilary vane to be a moment late to an appointment the door was open and five and twenty minutes had passed the hour before he saw the lawyer in the doorway mr flint was a man of such preoccupation of mind that he was not likely to be struck by any change there might have been in his counsels appearance  its halfpast three he said  hilary entered and sat down beside the window  you mean that im late he replied  ive got some engineers coming here in less than an hour said mr flint  ill be gone in less than an hour said hilary  well said mr flint lets get down to hardtack ive got to be frank with you vane and tell you plainly that this political business is all at sixes and sevens  it isnt necessary to tell me that said hilary  what do you mean  i mean that i know it  to put it mildly the president of the northeastern continued its the worst mixedup campaign i ever knew here we are with the convention only two days off and we dont know where we stand how many delegates weve got or whether this upstart at leith is going to be nominated over our heads heres adam hunt with his back up declaring hes a reformer and all his section of the state behind him now if that could have been handled otherwise  who told hunt to go in hilary inquired  things were different then said mr flint vigorously hunt had been promised the governorship for a long time and when ridout became out of the question  why did ridout become out of the question asked hilary  mr flint made a gesture of impatience  on account of that foolishness in the legislature of course  that foolishness in the legislature as you call it represented a sentiment all over the state said hilary and if id been you i wouldnt have let hunt in this year but you didnt ask my opinion you asked me when you begged me to get adam out and i predicted that he wouldnt get out  mr flint took a turn up and down the room  im sorry i didnt send for him to go to new york he said well anyway the campaigns been muddled thats certainwhoever muddled it and the president looked at his counsel as though he at least had no doubts on this point but hilary appeared unaware of the implication and made no reply  i cant find out what bascom and botcher are doing mr flint went on i dont get any reportsthey havent been here perhaps you know theyve had trip passes enough to move the whole population of putnam county fairplay says theyre gettin delegates for adam hunt instead of giles henderson and whitredge says that jake botcher is talking reform  i guess botcher and bascom know their business said mr vane if mr flint had been a less concentrated man he might have observed that the honourable hilary had not cut a piece of honey dew this afternoon  what is their business asked mr flinta little irrelevantly for him  what you and i taught em said mr vane  mr flint considered this a moment and decided to let it pass he looked at the honourable hilary more closely however  whats the matter with you vane youre not sick are you  no  mr flint took another turn  now the question is what are we going to do if youve got any plan i want to hear it  mr vane was silent  suppose crewe goes into the convention with enough delegates to lock it up so that none of the three has a majority  i guess hell do that said mr vane he fumbled in his pocket and drew out a typewritten list it must be explained that the caucuses or primaries had been held in the various towns of the state at odd dates and that the delegates pledged for the different candidates had been published in the newspapers from time to timealthough very much in accordance with the desires of their individual newspapers mr crewes delegates necessarily had been announced by what is known as political advertising mr flint took the honourable hilarys list ran his eye over it and whistled  you mean he claims three hundred and fifty out of the thousand  no said hilary he claims six hundred hell have three hundred and fifty  in spite of the book of arguments mr crewe was to have three hundred it was incredible preposterous mr flint looked at his counsel once more and wondered whether he could be mentally failing  fairplay only gives him two hundred  fairplay only gave him ten in the beginning said hilary  you come here two days before the convention and tell me crewe has three hundred and fifty mr flint exclaimed as though hilary vane were personally responsible for mr crewes delegates a very different tone from that of other times when conventions were mere ratifications of imperial decrees do you realize what it means if we lose control thousands and thousands of dollars in improvementsrolling stock better service new bridges and eliminations of grade crossings and theyll raise our tax rate to the average which means thousands more a new railroad commission that we cant talk to and lower dividendslower dividends do you understand that means trouble with the directors the stockholders and calls for explanations and what explanations can i make which can be printed in a public report  you were always pretty good at em flint said hilary  this remark as was perhaps natural did not improve the temper of the president of the northeastern  if you think i like this political business any better than you do youre mightily mistaken he replied and now i want to hear what plan youve got for the convention suppose theres a deadlock as you say there will be how are you going to handle it can you get a deal through between giles henderson and adam hunt with all my other work ive had to go into this myself hunt hasnt got a chance bascom and botcher are egging him on and making him believe he has when hunt gets into the convention and begins to fall off youve got to talk to him vane and his delegates have all got to be seen at the pelican the night before and understand that theyre to swing to henderson after two ballots youve got to keep your hand on the throttle in the convention you understand and i dont need to impress upon you how grave are the consequences if this man crewe gets in with public sentiment behind him and a reactionary lower house youve got to keep your hand on the throttle  thats part of my business isnt it hilary asked without turning his head  mr flint did not answer but his eye rested again on his counsels face  im that kind of a lawyer hilary continued apparently more to himself than to his companion you pay me for that sort of thing more than for the work i do in the courts isnt that so flint  mr flint was baffled two qualities which were very dear to him he designated as sane and safe and he had hitherto regarded his counsel as the sanest and safest of men this remark made him wonder seriously whether the lawyers mind were not giving away and if so to whom was he to turn at this eleventh hour no man in the state knew the ins and outs of conventions as did hilary vane and in the rare times when there had been crises he had sat quietly in the little room off the platform as at the keyboard of an organ and the delegates had responded to his touch hilary vane had named the presidents of conventions and the committees and by pulling out stops could get such resolutions as he wishedor as mr flint wished but now  suddenly a suspicion invaded mr flints train of thought he repeated hilarys words over to himself im that kind of a lawyer and another individuality arose before the president of the northeastern instincts are curious things on the day some years before when austen vane had brought his pass into this very room and laid it down on his desk mr flint had recognized a man with whom he would have to deala stronger man than hilary since then he had seen austens hand in various disturbing matters and now it was as if he heard austen speaking im that kind of a lawyer not hilary vane but hilary vanes son was responsible for hilary vanes conditionthis recognition came to mr flint in a flash austen had somehow accomplished the incredible feat of making hilary vane ashamedand when such men as hilary are ashamed their usefulness is over mr flint had seen the thing happen with a certain kind of financiers one day aggressive combative and the next broken querulous men let a man cease to believe in what he is doing and he loses force  the president of the northeastern used a locomotive as long as possible but when it ceased to be able to haul a train upgrade he sent it to the scrapheap mr flint was far from being a bad man but he worshipped power and his motto was the survival of the fittest he did not yet feel pity for hilaryfor he was angry only contemptcontempt that one who had been a power should come to this to draw a somewhat farfetched parallel a captain kidd or a caesar borgia with a conscience would never have been heard of mr flint did not call it a consciencehe had a harder name for it he had to send hilary thus vitiated into the convention to conduct the most important battle since the founding of the empire and austen vane was responsible  mr flint had to control himself in spite of his feelings he saw that he must do so and yet he could not resist saying i get a good many rumours here they tell me that there may be another candidate in the fielda dark horse  who asked hilary  there was a meeting in the room of a man named redbrook during the legislature to push this candidate said mr flint eyeing his counsel significantly and now young gaylord has been going quietly around the state in his interest  suddenly the listless figure of hilary vane straightened and the old look which had commanded the respect and obedience of men returned to his eye  you mean my son he demanded  yes said mr flint they tell me that when the time comes your son will be a candidate on a platform opposed to our interests  then said hilary they tell you a damned lie  hilary vane had not sworn for a quarter of a century and yet it is to be doubted if he ever spoke more nobly he put his hands on the arms of his chair and lifted himself to his feet where he stood for a moment a tell figure to be remembered mr flint remembered it for many years hilary vanes long coat was open and seemed in itself to express this strange and newfound vigour in its flowing lines his head was thrown back and a look on his face which mr flint had never seen there he drew from an inner pocket a long envelope and his hand trembled though with seeming eagerness as he held it out to mr flint  here he said  whats this asked mr flint he evinced no desire to take it but hilary pressed it on him  my resignation as counsel for your road  the president of the northeastern bewildered by this sudden transformation stared at the envelope  what nowtoday he said  no answered hilary read it youll see it takes effect the day after the state convention im not much use any more youve done your best to bring that home to me and youll need a new man to dothe kind of work ive been doing for you for twentyfive years but you cant get a new man in a day and i said id stay with you and i keep my word ill go to the convention ill do my best for you as i always have but i dont like it and after that im through after that i become a lawyerlawyer do you understand  a lawyer mr flint repeated  yes a lawyer ever since last june when i came up here ive realized what i was a brush bascom with a better education and more brains but a brush bascomwith the brains prostituted while things were going along smoothly i didnt knowyou never attempted to talk to me this way before do you remember how you took hold of me that day and begged me to stay i do and i stayed why because i was a friend of yours association with you for twentyfive years had got under my skin and i thought it had got under yours hilary let his hand fall today youve given me a notion of what friendship is youve given me a chance to estimate myself on a new basis and im much obliged to you for that i havent got many years left but im glad to have found out what my life has been worth before i die  he buttoned up his coat slowly glaring at mr flint the while with a courage and a defiance that were superb and he had picked up his hat before mr flint found his tongue  you dont mean that vane he cried my god think what youve said  hilary pointed at the desk with a shaking finger  if that were a scaffold and a rope were around my neck id say it over again and i thank god ive had a chance to say it to you he paused cleared his throat and continued in a voice that all at once had become unemotional and natural ive three tin boxes of the private papers you wanted i didnt think of em today but ill bring em up to you myself on thursday  mr flint reflected afterwards that what made him helpless must have been the sudden change in hilarys manner to the commonplace the president of the northeastern stood where he was holding the envelope in his hand apparently without the power to move or speak he watched the tall form of his chief counsel go through the doorway and something told him that that exit was coincident with the end of an era  the end of an era of fraud of selfdeception of conditions that violated every sacred principle of free government which men had shed blood to obtain     chapter xxiv an adventure of victorias  mrs pomfret was a proud woman for she had at last obtained the consent of the lion to attend a lunch party she would have liked a dinner much better but beggars are not choosers and she seized eagerly on the lunch the two days before the convention mr crewe was to spend at leith having continual conferences of course receiving delegations and discussing with prominent citizens certain offices which would be in his gift when he became governor also there was mr watlings nominating speech to be gone over carefully and mr crewes own speech of acceptance to be composed he had it in his mind and he had decided that it should have two qualities it should be brief and forceful  gratitude however is one of the noblest qualities of man and a statesman should not fail to reward his faithful workers and adherents as one of the chiefest of these mrs pomfret was entitled to high consideration hence the candidate had consented to have a lunch given in his honour naming the day and the hour and mrs pomfret believing that a prospective governor should possess some of the perquisites of royalty in a rash moment submitted for his approval a list of guests this included two distinguished foreigners who were staying at the leith inn an englishman and an austrian and an elderly lady of very considerable social importance who was on a visit to mrs pomfret  mr crewe had graciously sanctioned the list but took the liberty of suggesting as an addition to it the name of miss victoria flint explaining over the telephone to mrs pomfret that he had scarcely seen victoria all summer and that he wanted particularly to see her mrs pomfret declared that she had only left out victoria because her presence might be awkward for both of them but mr crewe waved this aside as a trivial and feminine objection so victoria was invited and another young man to balance the table  mrs pomfret as may have been surmised was a woman of taste and her villa at leith though small had added considerably to her reputation for this quality patterson pomfret had been a gentleman with red cheeks and an income who incidentally had been satisfied with both he had never tried to add to the income which was large enough to pay the dues of the clubs the lists of which he thought worthy to include his name large enough to pay hotel bills in london and paris and at the baths and to free the servants at country houses large enough to clothe his wife and himself and to teach alice the three essentials of music french and deportment if that man is notable who has mastered one thing well patterson pomfret was a notable man he had mastered the possibilities of his income and never in any year had he gone beyond it by so much as a sole d vin blanc or a pair of red silk stockings when he died he left a worthy financial successor in his wife  mrs pomfret knowing the income after an exhaustive search decided upon leith as the place to build her villa it must be credited to her foresight that when she built she saw the future possibilities of the place the proper people had started it and it must be credited to her genius that she added to these possibilities of leith by bringing to it such families as she thought worthy to live in the neighbourhoodfamilies which incidentally increased the value of the land her villa had a decided french look and was so amazingly trim and neat and generally shipshape as to be fitfor only the daintiest and most discriminating feminine occupation the house was small and its metamorphosis from a plain wooden farmhouse had been an achievement that excited general admiration porches had been added and a coat of spotless white relieved by an orange striping so original that many envied but none dared to copy it the striping went around the white chimneys along the cornice under the windows and on the railings of the porch there were window boxes gay with geraniums and abundant awnings striped white and red to match the flowers a high formal hemlock hedge hid the house from the road through which entered a bluestone drive that cut the closecropped lawn and made a circle to the doorway under the great maples on the lawn were a teatable rugs and wicker chairs and the house itself was furnished by a variety of things of a design not to be bought in the united states of america desks photograph frames writingsets clocks paperknives flower baskets magazine racks cigarette boxes and dozens of other articles for the duplicates of which one might have searched fifth avenue in vain  mr crewe was a little late important matters he said had detained him at the last moment and he particularly enjoined mrs pomfrets butler to listen carefully for the telephone and twice during lunch it was announced that mr crewe was wanted at first he was preoccupied and answered absently across the table the questions of the englishman and the austrian about american politics and talked to the lady of social prominence on his right not at all nor to mrs pomfretwho excused him being a lady of discerning qualities however the hostess remarked that mr crewes eyes wandered more than once to the far end of the oval table where victoria sat and even mrs pomfret could not deny the attraction victoria wore a filmy gown of mauve that infinitely became her and a shadowy hat which in the semidarkness of the dining room was a wondrous setting for her shapely head twice she caught mr crewes look upon her and returned it amusedly from under her lashesand once he could have sworn that she winked perceptibly what fires she kindled in his deep nature it is impossible to say  she had kindled other fires at her side the tall young englishman had lost interest in american politics had turned his back upon poor alice pomfret and had forgotten the world in general not so the austrian who was on the other side of alice and who could not see victoria mr crewe by his manner and appearance had impressed him as a person of importance and he wanted to know more besides he wished to improve his english and alice had been told to speak french to him by a lucky chance after several blind attempts he awakened the interest of the personality  i hear you are what they call reform in america  this was not the question that opened the gates  i dont care much for the word answered mr crewe shortly i prefer the word progressive  discourse on the word progressive by the austrian almost a monologue but he was far from being discouraged  and mrs pomfret tells me they play many detestable tricks on youyes  tricks exclaimed mr crewe the memory of many recent ones being fresh in his mind i should say so do you know what a caucus is  caucuscaucus it brings something to my head ah i have seen a picture of it in some english book a very funny pictureit is in fun yes  a picture said mr crewe impossible  but no said the austrian earnestly with one finger to his temples it is a funny picture i know i cannot recall but the word caucus i remember that is a droll word  perhaps baron said victoria who had been resisting an almost uncontrollable desire to laugh you have been reading alice in wonderland  the englishman beatrice chillingham and some others among whom were not mr crewe and mrs pomfret gave way to an extremely pardonable mirth in which the goodnatured baron joined  ach he cried it is so i have seen it in alice in wonderland here the puzzled expression returned to his face but they are birds are they not  men whose minds are on serious things are impatient of levity and mr crewe looked at the baron  no he said they are not birds  this reply was the signal for more laughter  a thousand pardons exclaimed the baron it is i who am so ignorant you will excuse meyes  mr crewe was mollified the baron was a foreigner he had been the object of laughter and mr crewes chivalrous spirit resented it  what we call a caucus in the towns of this state he said is a meeting of citizens of one party to determine who their candidates shall be a caucus is a primary there is a very loose primary law in this state purposely kept loose by the politicians of the northeastern railroads in order that they may play such tricks on decent men as they have been playing on me  at this mention of the northeastern railroads the lady on mr crewes right and some other guests gave startled glances at victoria they observed with surprise that she seemed quite unmoved  ill tell you one or two of the things those railroad lobbyists have done said mr crewe his indignation rising with the subject and still addressing the baron they are afraid to let the people into the caucuses because they know ill get the delegates nearly everywhere i speak to the people i get the delegates the railroad politicians send word to the town rings to hold snap caucuses when they hear im coming into a town to speak and the local politicians give out notices only a day before and only to the voters they want in the caucus in hull the other day out of a population of two thousand twenty men elected four delegates for the railroad candidate  it is corruption cried the baron who had no idea who victoria was and a very slim notion of what mr crewe was talking about  corruption said mr crewe what can you expect when a railroad owns a state the other day in britain where they elect fourteen delegates the editor of a weekly newspaper printed false ballots with two of my men at the top and one at the bottom and eleven railroad men in the middle fortunately some person with sense discovered the fraud before it was too late  you dont tell me said the baron  and every state and federal officeholder has been distributing passes for the last three weeks  pass repeated the baron you mean they fight with the fistso to distribute a passso and the baron struck out at an imaginary enemy it is the american language i have read it in the prizefight i am told to read the prizefight and the baseball game  mr crewe thought it obviously useless to continue this conversation  the railroad said the baron he is the modern machiavelli  i say mr rangely the englishman remarked to victoria this is a bit rough on you you know  oh im used to it she laughed  mr crewe said mrs pomfret to the table at large deserves tremendous credit for the fight he has made almost singlehanded our greatest need in this country is what you have in england mr rangelygentlemen in politics our country gentlemen like mr crewe are now going to assume their proper duties and responsibilities she laid her napkin on the table and glanced at alice as she continued humphrey i shall have to appoint you as usual the man of the house will you take the gentlemen into the library  another privilege of celebrity is to throw away ones cigar and walk out of the smoking room if one is bored mr crewe was in a sense the host he indicated with a wave of his hand the cigars and cigarettes which mrs pomfret had provided and stood in a thoughtful manner before the empty fireplace with his hands in his pockets replying in brief sentences to the questions of mr chillingham and the others to tell the truth mr crewe was bringing to bear all of his extraordinary concentration of mind upon a problem with which he had been occupied for some years past he was not a man as we know to take the important steps of life in a hurry although like the truly great he was capable of making up his mind in a very brief period when it was necessary to strike he had now after weighing the question with the consideration which its gravity demanded finally decided upon definite action whereupon he walked out of the library leaving the other guests to comment as they would or not comment at all for all he cared like all masterful men he went direct to the thing he wanted  the ladies were having coffee under the maples by the teatable at some little distance from the group beatrice chillingham was walking with victoria and it was evident that victoria found miss chillinghams remarks amusing these were the only two in the party who did not observe mr crewes approach mrs pomfret when she saw the direction which he was taking lost the thread of her conversation and the lady who was visiting her wore a significant expression  victoria said mr crewe lets go around to the other side of the house and look at the view  victoria started and turned to him from miss chillingham with the fun still sparkling in her eyes it was perhaps as well for mr crewe that he had not overheard their conversation but this might have applied to any man  are you sure you can spare the time she asked  mr crewe looked at his watchprobably from habit  i made it a point to leave the smoking room early he replied  were flatteredarent we beatrice  miss chillingham had a turnedup nose and a face which was apt to be slightly freckled at this time of year for she contemned vanity and veils for fear of doing her an injustice it must be added that she was not at all badlooking quite the contrary all that can be noted in this brief space is that beatrice chillingham was herself some people declared that she was possessed of the seven devils of her sex which mr stockton wrote about  im flattered she said and walked off towards the teatable with a glance in which victoria read many meanings mr crewe paid no attention either to words look or departure  i want to talk to you he said  youve made that very plain at least answered victoria why did you pretend it was the view  some conventionalities have to be observed i suppose he said lets go around there it is a good view  dont you think this is a littlemarked asked victoria surveying him with her hands behind her back  i cant help it if it is said mr crewe every hour is valuable to me and ive got to take my chances when i get em for some reason you havent been down at leith much this summer why didnt you telephone me as i asked you  because ive suddenly grown dignified i suppose she said and then of course i hesitated to intrude upon such a person of importance as you have become humphrey  ive always got time to see you he replied i always shall have but i appreciate your delicacy that sort of thing counts with a man more than most women know  then i am repaid said victoria for exercising selfcontrol  i find it always pays declared mr crewe and he glanced at her with distinct approval they were skirting the house and presently came out upon a tiny terrace where young ridley had made a miniature italian garden when the electric dividends had increased and from which there was a vista of the shallows of the blue here was a stone gardenseat which mrs pomfret had brought from italy and over which she had quarrelled with the customs authorities mr crewe with a wave of his hand signified his pleasure that they should sit and cleared his throat  its just as well perhaps he began that we havent had the chance to see each other earlier when a man starts out upon an undertaking of the gravest importance wherein he stakes his reputation an undertaking for which he is ridiculed and reviled he likes to have his judgment justified he likes to be vindicated especially in the eyes ofpeople whom he cares about personally i never had any doubt that i should be the next governor because i knew in the beginning that i had estimated public sentiment correctly the man who succeeds in this world is the man who has sagacity enough to gauge public sentiment ahead of time and the courage to act on his beliefs victoria looked at him steadily he was very calm and he had one knee crossed over the other  and the sagacity she added to choose his lieutenants in the fight  exactly said mr crewe i have always declared victoria that you had a natural aptitude for affairs  i have heard my father say she continued still maintaining her steady glance that hamilton tooting is one of the shrewdest politicians he has ever known isnt mr tooting one of your righthand men  he could hardly be called that mr crewe replied in fact i havent any what you might call righthand men the large problems i have had to decide for myself as for tooting hes well enough in his way he understands the tricks of the politicianshes played em i guess hes uneducated hes merely a worker you see he went on one great reason why ive been so successful is because ive been practical ive taken materials as ive found them  i see answered victoria turning her head and gazing over the terrace at the sparkling reaches of the river she remembered the close of that wintry afternoon in mr crewes house at the capital and she was quite willing to do him exact justice and to believe that he had forgotten itwhich indeed was the case  i want to say he continued that although i have known andahemadmired you for many years victoria what has struck me most forcibly in your favour has been your openmindednessespecially on the great political questions this summer i have no idea how much you know about them but one would naturally have expected you on account of your father to be prejudiced sometime when i have more leisure i shall go into them fully with you and in the meantime ill have my secretary send you the complete list of my speeches up to date and i know you will read them carefully  you are very kind humphrey she said  absorbed in the presentation of his subject which chanced to be himself mr crewe did not observe that her lips were parted and that there were little creases around her eyes  and sometime said mr crewe when all this has blown over a little i shall have a talk with your father he undoubtedly understands that there is scarcely any question of my election he probably realizes too that he has been in thewrong and that railroad domination must ceasehe has already made several concessions as you know i wish you would tell him from me that when i am governor i shall make it a point to discuss the whole matter with him and that he will find in me no foe of corporations justice is what i stand for temperamentally i am too conservative i am too much of a business man to tamper with vested interests  i will tell him humphrey said victoria  mr crewe coughed and looked at his watch once more and now having made that clear he said and having only a quarter of an hour before i have to leave to keep an appointment i am going to take up another subject and i ask you to believe it is not done lightly or without due consideration but as the result of some years of thought  victoria turned to him seriouslyand yet the creases were still around her eyes  i can well believe it humphrey she answered buthave you time  yes he said i have learned the value of minutes  but not of hours perhaps she replied  that said mr crewe indulgently is a womans point of view a man cannot dally through life and your kind of woman has no use for a man who dallies first i will give you my idea of a woman  i am all attention said victoria  well said mr crewe putting the tops of his fingers together she should excel as a housewife i havent any use for your socalled intellectual woman of course what i mean by a housewife is something a little less bourgeoise she should be able to conduct an establishment with the neatness and despatch and economy of a wellrun hotel she should be able to seat a table instantly and accurately giving to the prominent guests the prestige they deserve nor have i any sympathy with the notion that makes a married woman a law unto herself she enters voluntarily into an agreement whereby she puts herself under the control of her husband his interests his career his  comfort suggested victoria  yes his comfortall that comes first and his establishment is conducted primarily and his guests selected in the interests of his fortunes of course that goes without saying of a man in high place in public life but he must choose for his wife a woman who is equal to all these thingsto my mind her highest achievementwho makes the most of the position he gives her presides at his table and entertainments and reaches such people as for any reason he is unable to reach i have taken the pains to point out these things in a general way for obvious reasons my greatest desire is to be fair  what asked victoria with her eyes on the river what are the wages  mr crewe laughed incidentally he thought her profile very fine  i do not believe in flattery he said but i think i should add to the qualifications personality and a sense of humour i am quite sure i could never live with a womanwho didnt have a sense of humour  i should think it would be a little difficult said victoria to get a woman with the qualifications you enumerate and a sense of humour thrown in  infinitely difficult declared mr crewe with more ardour than he had yet shown i have waited a good many years victoria  and yet she said you have been happy you have a perpetual source of enjoyment denied to some people  what is that he asked it is natural for a man to like to hear the points of his character discussed by a discerning woman  yourself said victoria suddenly looking him full in the face you are complete humphrey as it is you are happily married already besides she added laughing a little the qualities you have mentionedwith the exception of the sense of humourare not those of a wife but of a business partner of the opposite sex what you really want is a business partner with something like a fifth interest and whose name shall not appear in the agreement  mr crewe laughed again nevertheless he was a little puzzled over this remark  i am not sentimental he began  you certainly are not she said  you have a way he replied with a shade of reproof in his voice you have a way at times of treating serious things with a little less gravity than they deserve i am still a young man but i have seen a good deal of life and i know myself pretty well it is necessary to treat matrimony from a practical as well as a sentimental point of view there wouldnt be half the unhappiness and divorces if people took time to do this instead of rushing off and getting married immediately and of course it is especially important for a man in my position to study every aspect of the problem before he takes a step  by this time a deep and absorbing interest in a new aspect of mr crewes character had taken possession of victoria  and you believe that by taking thought you can get the kind of a wife you want she asked  certainly he replied does that strike you as strange  a little said victoria suppose she added gently suppose that the kind of wife youd want wouldnt want you  mr crewe laughed again  that is a contingency which a strong man does not take into consideration he answered strong men get what they want but upon my word victoria you have a delicious way of putting things in your presence i quite forget the problems and perplexities which beset me that he said with delicate meaning that is another quality i should desire in a woman  it is one fortunately that isnt marketable she said and its the only quality youve mentioned thats worth anything  a womans valuation said mr crewe  if it made you forget your own affairs it would be priceless  look here victoria cried mr crewe uncrossing his knees jokings all very well but i havent time for it today and im in a serious mood ive told you what i want and now that ive got to go in a few minutes ill come to the point i dont suppose a man could pay a woman a higher compliment than to say that his proposal was the result of some years of thought and study  here victoria laughed outright but grew serious again at once  unless he proposed to her the day he met her that would be a real compliment  the man said mr crewe impatiently would be a fool  or else a person of extreme discernment said victoria and love is lenient with fools by the way humphrey it has just occurred to me that theres one quality which some people think necessary in a wife which you didnt mention  whats that  love said victoria  love of course he agreed i took that for granted  i supposed you did said victoria meekly  well now to come to the point he began again  but she interrupted him by glancing at the watch on her gown and rising  whats the matter he asked with some annoyance  the fifteen minutes are up she announced i cannot take the responsibility of detaining you  we will put in tantalizing as another attractive quality he laughed i absolve you of all responsibility sit down  i believe you mentioned obedience she answered and sat down again at the end of the bench resting her chin on her gloved hand and looking at him by this time her glances seemed to have gained a visibly disturbing effect he moved a little nearer to her took off his hat which he had hitherto neglected to do and thrust his hands abruptly into his pocketsas much as to say that he would not be responsible for their movements if they were less free  hang it all victoria he exclaimed im a practical man and i try to look at this which is one of the serious things in life in a practical way  one of the serious things she repeated as though to herself  yes he said certainly  i merely asked to be sure of the weight you gave it go on  in a practical way as i was saying long ago i suspected that you had most of those qualities  im overwhelmed humphrey she cried with her eyes dancing butdo you think i could cultivate the rest  oh well said mr crewe i put it that way because no woman is perfect and i dislike superlatives  i should think superlatives would be very hard to live with she reflected butdreadful thoughtsuppose i should lack an essential  whatfor instance  lovefor instance but then you did not put it first it was i who mentioned it and you who took it for granted  affection seems to be a more sensible term for it he said affection is the lasting and sensible thing you mentioned a partnership a word that singularly fits into my notion of marriage i want to be honest with you and understate my feelings on that subject  victoria who had been regarding him with a curious look that puzzled him laughed again  i have been hoping you havent exaggerated them she replied  theyre stronger than you think he declared i never felt this way in my life before what i meant to say was that i never understood running away with a woman  that does not surprise me said victoria  i shouldnt know where to run to he proclaimed  perhaps the woman would if you got a clever one at any rate it wouldnt matter one place is as good as another some go to niagara and some to coney island and others to venice personally i should have no particular preference  no preference he exclaimed  i could be happy in central park she declared  fortunately said mr crewe you will never be called upon to make the trial  victoria was silent her thoughts for the moment had flown elsewhere but mr crewe did not appear to notice this he fell back into the rounded hollow of the bench and it occurred to him that he had never quite realized that profile and what an ornament she would be to his table  i think humphrey she said that we should be going back  one moment and ill have finished he cried ive no doubt you are prepared for what i am going to say i have purposely led up to it in order that there might be no misunderstanding in short i have never seen another woman with personal characteristics so well suited for my life and i want you to marry me victoria i can offer you the position of the wife of a man with a public careerfor which you are so well fitted  victoria shook her head slowly and smiled at him  i couldnt fill the position she said  perhaps he replied smiling back at her perhaps i am the best judge of that  and you thought she asked slowly that i was that kind of a woman  i know it to be a practical certainty said mr crewe  practical certainties said victoria are not always truths if i should sign a contract which i suppose as a business man you would want to live up to the letter of your specificationseven then i could not do it i should make life a torture for you humphrey you see i am honest with you toomuch as your offer dazzles me and she shook her head again  that exclaimed mr crewe impatiently is sheer nonsense i want you and i mean to have you  there came a look into her eyes which mr crewe did not see because her face was turned from him  i could be happy she said for days and weeks and years in a but on the side of sawanec i could be happy in a farmhouse where i had to do all the work i am not the model housewife which your imagination depicts humphrey i could live in two rooms and eat at an italian restaurantwith the right man and i am afraid the wrong one would wake up one day and discover that i had gone i am sorry to disillusionize you but i dont care a fig for balls and gardenparties and salons it would be much more fun to run away from them to the queer places of the earthwith the right man and i should have to possess one essential to put up withgreatness and what you call a public career  and what is that essential he asked  love said victoria he heard the word but faintly for her face was still turned away from him youve offered me the things that are attainable by taking thought by perseverance by pertinacity by the outwitting of your fellowmen by the stacking of coins and i wantthe unattainable the divine gift which is bestowed which cannot be acquired if it could be acquired humphrey she added looking at him i am sure you would acquire itif you thought it worth while  i dont understand you he saidand looked it  no said victoria i was afraid you wouldnt and moreover you never would there is no use in my trying to make myself any clearer and youll have to keep your appointment i hesitate to contradict you but i am not the kind of woman you want that is one reason i cannot marry you and the other is that i do not love you  you cant be in love with any one else he cried  that does seem rather preposterous ill admit she answered but if i were it wouldnt make any difference  you wont marry me he said getting to his feet there was incredulity in his voice and a certain amount of bewilderment the thing was indeed incredible  no said victoria i wont  and he had only to look into her face to see that it was so hitherto nil desperandum had been a good working motto but something told him it was useless in this case he thrust on his hat and pulled out his watch  well he said that settles it i mustsay i cant see your point of viewbut that settles it i must say too that your refusal is something of a shock after what i had been led to expect after the past few years  the person you are in love with led you to expect it humphrey and that person isyourself you are in love temporarily with your own ideal of me  and your refusal comes at an unfortunate tune for me he continued not heeding her words when i have an affair on my hands of such magnitude which requires concentrated thought but im not a man to cry and ill make the best of it  if i thought it were more than a temporary disappointment i should be sorry for you said victoria i remember that you felt something like this when mr rutter wouldnt sell you his land the lady you really want she added pointing with her parasol at the house is in there waiting for you  mr crewe did not reply to this prophecy but followed victoria around the house to the group on the lawn where he bade his hostess a somewhat preoccupied farewell and bowed distantly to the guests  he has so much on his mind said mrs pomfret and oh i quite forgothumphrey she cried calling after him humphrey  yes he said turning before he reached his automobile what is it  alice and i are going to the convention you know and i meant to tell you that there would be ten in the partybut i didnt have a chance here mrs pomfret glanced at victoria who had been joined at once by the tall englishman can you get tickets for ten  mr crewe made a memorandum  yes he said ill get the ticketsbut i dont see what you want to go for     chapter xxv more adventurer  victoria had not of course confided in beatrice chillingham what had occurred in the garden although that lady had exhibited the liveliest interest and had had her suspicions after mr crewes departure mr rangely the tall young englishman had renewed his attentions assiduously although during the interval in the garden he had found miss chillingham a person of discernment  shes not going to marry that chap is she miss chillingham he had asked  no said beatrice you have my word for it she isnt  as she was leaving mrs pomfret had taken victorias hand and drawn her aside and looked into her face with a meaning smile  my dear she exclaimed he particularly asked that you be invited  who said victoria  humphrey he stipulated that you should be here  then im very much obliged to him said victoria for ive enjoyed myself immensely i like your englishman so much  do you said mrs pomfret searching victorias face while her own brightened hes heir to one of the really good titles and he has an income of his own i couldnt put him up here in this tiny box because i have mrs fronde we are going to take him to the conventionand if youd care to go victoria  victoria laughed  it isnt as serious as that she said and im afraid i cant go to the conventioni have some things to do in the neighbourhood  mrs pomfret looked wise  hes a most attractive man with the best prospects it would be a splendid match for you victoria  mrs pomfret replied victoria wavering between amusement and a desire to be serious i havent the slightest intention of making what you call a match and there was in her words a ring of truth not to be mistaken  mrs pomfret kissed her  one never can tell what may happen she said think of him victoria and your dear motherperhaps you will know some day what the responsibility is of seeing a daughter well placed in life  victoria coloured and withdrew her hand  i fear that time is a long way off mrs pomfret she replied  i think so much of victoria mrs pomfret declared a moment later to her guest shes like my own daughter but at times shes so hopelessly unconventional why i believe rangelys actually going home with her  he asked her to drop him at the inn said mrs fronde hes head over heels in love already  it would be such a relief to dear rose sighed mrs pomfret  i like the girl replied mrs fronde dryly she has individuality and knows her own mind whoever she marries will have something to him  i devoutly hope so said mrs pomfret  it was quite true that mr arthur rangely had asked victoria to drop him at the inn but when they reached it he made another request  do you mind if i go a bit farther miss flint he suggested id rather like the walk back  victoria laughed  do come she said  he admired the country but he looked at victoria and asked a hundred exceedingly frank questions about leith about mrs pomfret whom he had met at his uncles seat in devonshire and about mr crewe and the railroads in politics many of these victoria parried and she came rapidly to the conclusion that mr arthur rangely was a more astute person thanto a casual observer he would seem  he showed no inclination to fix the limits of his walk and made no protest as she drove under the stone archway at the entrance of fairview victoria was amused and interested and she decided that she liked mr rangely  will you come up for tea she asked ill send you home  he accepted with alacrity they had reached the first turn when their attention was caught by the sight of a buggy ahead of them and facing towards them the horse with the reins hanging loosely over the shafts had strayed to the side of the driveway and was contentedly eating the shrubbery that lined it inside the vehicle hunched up in the corner of the seat was a man who presented an appearance of helplessness which struck them both with a sobering effect  is the fellow drunk said mr rangely  victorias answer was a little cry which startled him and drew his look to her she had touched her horse with the whip and her eyes had widened in real alarm  its hilary vane she exclaimed ii wonder what can have happened  she handed the reins to mr rangely and sprang out and flew to hilarys side  mr vane she cried whats the matter are you ill  she had never seen him look so to her he had always been as one on whom pity would be wasted as one who long ago had established his credit with the universe to his own satisfaction but now suddenly intense pity welled up within her and even in that moment she wondered if it could be because he was austens father his hands were at his sides his head was fallen forward a little and his face was white but his eyes frightened her most instead of the old semidefiant expression which she remembered from childhood they had in them a dumb suffering that went to her heart he looked at her tried to straighten up and fell back again  nnothings the matter he said nothing a little spell ill be all right in a moment  victoria did not lose an instant but climbed into the buggy at his side and gathered up the reins and drew the fallen laprobe over his knees  im going to take you back to fairview she said and well telephone for a doctor  but she had underrated the amount of will left in him he did not move though indeed if he had seized the reins from her hands he could have given her no greater effect of surprise life came back into the eyes at the summons and dominance into the voice although he breathed heavily  no youre not he said no youre not im going to riptondo you understand ill be all right in a minute and ill take the lines  victoria when she got over her astonishment at this reflected quickly she glanced at him and the light of his expression was already fading there was some reason why he did not wish to go back to fairview and common sense told her that agitation was not good for him besides they would have to telephone to ripton for a physician and it was quicker to drive there quicker to drive in her own runabout did she dare to try to move him into it she made up her mind  please follow on behind with that trap she called out to rangely im going to ripton  he nodded understandingly admiringly and victoria started hilarys horse out of the bushes towards the entrance way from time to time she let her eyes rest upon him anxiously  are you comfortable she asked  yes he said yes im all right ill be able to drive in a minute  but the minutes passed and he made no attempt to take the reins victoria had drawn the whalebone whip from its socket and was urging on the horse as fast as humanity would permit and the while she was aware that hilarys look was fixed upon herin fact never left her once or twice in spite of her anxiety to get him home victoria blushed faintly as she wondered what he was thinking about  and all the while she asked herself what it was that had brought him to this condition victoria knew sufficient of life and had visited hospitals enough to understand that mental causes were generally responsible for such breakdownshilary had had a shock she remembered how in her childhood he had been the object of her particular animosity how she used to put out her tongue at him and imitate his manner and how he had never made the slightest attempt to conciliate her most people of this sort are sensitive to the instincts of children but hilary had not been she rememberedhow long ago it seemed nowthe day she had given him in deviltry the clipping about austen shooting mr blodgett  the hilary vane who sat beside her today was not the same man it was unaccountable but he was not nor could this changed estimate of him be attributed to her regard for austen for she recalled a day only a few months sincein junewhen he had come up to fairview and she was standing on the lawn and she had looked at him without recognition she had not then been able to bring herself to bow to him to her childhood distaste had been added the deeper resentment of austens wrongs her early instincts about hilary had been vindicated for he had treated his son abominably and driven austen from his mothers home to misunderstand and maltreat austen vane of all people austen whose consideration for his father had been what it had could it be that hilary felt remorse could it be that he loved austen in some peculiar manner all his own  victoria knew nowso strangelythat the man beside her was capable of love and she had never felt that way about hilary vane and her mind was confused and her heart was troubled and wrung insight flashed upon her of the terrible loneliness of a life surrounded by outstretched loving arms to which one could not fly scenes from a famous classic she had read with a favourite teacher at school came to her and she knew that she was the witness of a retribution of a suffering beyond conception of a soul prepared for sufferingnot physical suffering but of that torture which is the meaning of hell  however there was physical suffering it came and went and at such moments she saw the traces of it in the tightening of his lips and longed with womanly intuition to alleviate it she had not spokenalthough she could have cried aloud she knew not what to say and then suddenly she reached out and touched his hand nor could she have accounted for the action  are you in much pain she asked  she felt him tremble  no he said its only a spellive had em before ii can drive in a few minutes  and do you think she asked that i would allow you to go the rest of the way alone  i guess i ought to thank you for comin with me he said  victoria looked at him and smiled and it was an illuminating smile for her as well as for hilary suddenly by that strange power of sympathy which the unselfish possess she understood the man understood austens patience with him and affection for him suddenly she had pierced the hard layers of the outer shell and had heard the imprisoned spirit crying with a small persistent voicea spirit stifled for many years and starvedand yet it lived and struggled still  yes and that spirit itself must have felt her own reaching out to itwho can say and how it must have striven again for utterance  it was good of you to come he said  it was only common humanity she answered touching the horse  common humanity he repeated youd have done it for anybody along the road would you  at this remark so characteristic of hilary victoria hesitated she understood it now and yet she hesitated to give him an answer that was hypocritical  i have known you all my life mr vane and you are a very old friend of my fathers  old he repeated yes thats it im ready for the scrapheapbetter have let me lie victoria  victoria started a new surmise had occurred to her upon which she did not like to dwell  you have worked too hard mr vaneyou need a rest and i have been telling father that too you both need a rest  he shook his head  ill never get it he said stopping work wont give it to me  she pondered on these words as she guided the horse over a crossing and all that austen had said to her all that she had been thinking of for a year past helped her to grasp their meaning but she wondered still more at the communion which all at once had been established between hilary vane and herself and why he was saying these things to her it was all so unreal and inexplicable  i can imagine that people who have worked hard all their lives must feel that way she answered though her voice was not as steady as she could have wished youyou have so much to live for  her colour rose she was thinking of austenand she knew that hilary vane knew that she was thinking of austen moreover she had suddenly grasped the fact that the gentle but persistently strong influence of the sons character had brought about the change in the father hilary vanes lips closed again as in pain and she divined the reason  victoria knew the house in hanover street with its classic porch with its certain air of distinction and stability and long before she had known it as the austen residence she remembered wondering who lived in it the house had individuality and looked at from the front almost perfect proportions consciouslyit bespoke the gentility of its builders now she drew up before it and called to mr rangely who was abreast to tie his horse and ring the bell hilary was already feeling with his foot for the step of the buggy  im all right he insisted i can manage now but victoria seized his arm with a firm detaining hand  please waitmr vane she pleaded  but the feeling of shame at his helplessness was strong  its over now ii can walk im much obliged to you victoriamuch obliged  fortunately hilarys horse showed no inclination to go any farthereven to the stable and victoria held on to his arm he ceased to protest and mr rangely quickly tied the other horse and came to victorias aid supported by the young englishman hilary climbed the stone steps and reached the porch declaring all the while that he needed no assistance and could walk alone victoria rang the bell and after an interval the door was opened by euphrasia cotton  euphrasia stood upright with her hand on the knob and her eyes flashed over the group and rested fixedly on the daughter of mr flint  mr vane was not very well victoria explained and we came home with him  im all right said hilary once more and to prove it he steppednot very steadilyacross the threshold into the hall and sat down on a chair which had had its place at the foot of the stairs from time immemorial euphrasia stood still  i think said victoria that mr vane had better see a doctor have you a telephone  no we havent said euphrasia  victoria turned to mr rangely who had been a deeply interested spectator to this scene  a little way down the street on the other side dr tredway lives you will see his sign  and if he isnt in go to the hospital its only a few doors farther on  ill wait said victoria simply when he had gone my father will wish to know about mr vane  hold on said hilary i havent any use for a doctori wont see one i know what the trouble is and im all right  victoria became awarefor the first time that hilary vanes housekeeper had not moved that euphrasia cotton was still staring at her in a most disconcerting manner and was paying no attention whatever to hilary  come in and set down she said and seeing victoria glance at hilarys horse she added oh hell stand there till doomsday  victoria thinking that the situation would be less awkward accepted the invitation and euphrasia shut the door the hall owing to the fact that the shutters of the windows by the stairs were always closed was in semidarkness victoria longed to let in the light to take this strange driedup housekeeper and shake her into some semblance of natural feeling and this was austens home it was to this house made gloomy by these people that he had returned every night infinitely depressed she felt that she must take some action or cry aloud  mr vane she said laying a hand upon his shoulder i think you ought at least to lie down for a little while isnt there a sofa inin the parlour she asked euphrasia  you cant get him to do anything euphrasia replied with decision hell die some day for want of a little common sense i shouldnt wonder if he was took on soon  oh cried victoria she could think of no words to answer this remark  it wouldnt surprise me euphrasia continued he fell down the stairs here not long ago and went right on about his business hes never paid any attention to anybody and i guess its a mite late to expect him to begin now wont you set down  there was another chair against the low wainscoting and victoria drew it over beside hilary and sat down in it he did not seem to notice the action and euphrasia continued to stand standing seemed to be the natural posture of this remarkable woman victoria thoughta posture of vigilance of defiance a clock of one of the austen grandfathers stood obscurely at the back of the hall and the measured swing of its pendulum was all that broke the silence this was austens home it seemed impossible for her to realize that he could be the product of this environmentuntil a portrait on the opposite wall above the stairs came out of the gloom and caught her eye like the glow of light at first becoming aware of it with a start she thought it a likeness of austen himself then she saw that the hair was longer and more wavy than his and fell down a little over the velvet collar of a coat with a wide lapel and brass buttons and that the original of this portrait had worn a stock the face had not quite the strength of austens she thought but a wondrous sweetness and intellect shone from it like an expression she had seen on his face the chin rested on the hand an intellectual handand the portrait brought to her mind that of a young english statesman she had seen in the national gallery in london  thats channing austenhe was minister to spain  victoria started it was euphrasia who was speaking and unmistakable pride was in her voice  fortunately for victoria who would not in the least have known what to reply steps were heard on the porch and euphrasia opened the door mr rangely had returned  heres the doctor miss flint he said and ill wait for you outside  victoria rose as young dr tredway came forward they were old friends and the doctor it may be recalled had been chiefly responsible for the preservation of the life of mr zebulun meader  i have sent for you doctor she said against instructions and on my own responsibility mr vane is ill although he refuses to admit it  dr tredway had a respect for victoria and her opinions and he knew hilary he opened the door a little wider and looked critically at mr vane  its nothing but a spell hilary insisted ive had em before i suppose its natural that they should scare the womenfolks some  what kind of a spell was it mr vane asked the doctor  it isnt worth talking about said hilary you might as well pick up that case of yours and go home again im going down to the square in a little while  you see euphrasia put in hes made up his mind to kill himself  perhaps said the doctor smiling a little mr vane wouldnt object to miss flint telling me what happened  victoria glanced at the doctor and hesitated her sympathy for hilary her new understanding of him urged her onand yet never in her life had she been made to feel so distinctly an intruder here was the doctor with his case here was this extraordinary housekeeper apparently ready to let hilary walk to the square if he wished and to shut the door on their backs and here was hilary himself who threatened at any moment to make his word good and depart from their midst only the fact that she was convinced that hilary was in real danger made her relate in a few brief words what had occurred and when she had finished mr vane made no comment whatever  dr tredway turned to hilary  i am going to take a mean advantage of you mr vane he said and sit here awhile and talk to you would you object to waiting a little while miss flint i have something to say to you he added significantly and this meeting will save me a trip to fairview  certainly ill wait she said  you can come along with me said euphrasia if youve a notion to  victoria was of two minds whether to accept this invitation she had an intense desire to get outside but this was counterbalanced by a sudden curiosity to see more of this strange woman who loved but one person in the world tom gaylord had told victoria that she followed euphrasia to the back of the hall  theres the parlour said euphrasia its never ben used since mrs vane diedbut there it is  oh said victoria with a glance into the shadowy depths of the room please dont open it for me cant we go she added with an inspiration cant we go intothe kitchen she knew it was euphrasias place  well said euphrasia i shouldnt have thought youd care much about kitchens and she led the way onward through the little passage to the room where she had spent most of her days it was flooded with level yellow rays of light that seemed to be searching the corners in vain for dust victoria paused in the doorway  im afraid you do me an injustice she said i like some kitchens  you dont look as if you knew much about em was euphrasias answer with victoria once again in the light euphrasia scrutinized her with appalling frankness taking in every detail of her costume and at length raising her eyes to the girls face victoria coloured on her visits about the countryside she had met women of euphrasias type before and had long ago ceased to be dismayed by their manner but her instinct detected in euphrasia a hostility for which she could not account  in that simple but exquisite gown which so subtly suited her the creation of which had aroused the artist in a celebrated parisian dressmaker victoria was indeed a strange visitant in that kitchen she took a seat by the window and an involuntary exclamation of pleasure escaped her as her eyes fell upon the little oldfashioned flower garden beneath it the act and the exclamation for the moment disarmed euphrasia  they were sarah austensmrs vanes she explained just as she planted them the year she died ive always kept em just so  mrs vane must have loved flowers said victoria  loved em they were everything to herand the wild flowers too she used to wander off and spend whole days in the country and come back after sunset with her arms full  it was nature she loved said victoria in a low voice  that was itnature said euphrasia she loved all nature there wasnt a living creeping thing that wasnt her friend ive seen birds eat out of her hand in that window where youre settin and shed say to me phrasie keep still theyd love you too if they only knew you but theyre afraid youll scrub em if you get hold of them the way you used to scrub me  victoria smiledbut it was a smile that had tears in it euphrasia cotton was standing in the shaft of sunlight at the other window staring at the little garden  yes she used to say funny things like that to make you laugh when you were all ready to cry there wasnt many folks understood her she knew every path and hilltop within miles of here and every brook and spring and she used to talk about that mountain just as if it was alive  victoria caught her breath  yes continued euphrasia the mountain was alive for her hes angry today phrasie thats because you lost your temper and scolded hilary its a queer thing but there have been hundreds of times since when he needed scoldin bad and ive looked at the mountain and held my tongue it was just as if i saw her with that halfwhimsical halfreproachful expression in her eyes holding up her finger at me and there were other mornings when shed say the mountains lonesome today he wants me and i vow id look at the mountain and it would seem lonesome that sounds like nonsense dont it euphrasia demanded with a sudden sharpness  no said victoria it seems very real to me  the simplicity the very ring of truth and above all the absolute lack of selfconsciousness in the girls answer sustained the spell  shed go when the mountain called her it didnt make any difference whether it was rainingrain never appeared to do her any hurt nothin natural ever did her any hurt when she was a little child flittin about like a wild creature and shed come in drenched to the skin it was all i could do to catch her and change her clothes shed laugh at me were meant to be wet once in a while phrasie shed say thats what the rains for to wet us it washes some of the wickedness out of us it was the unnatural things that hurt herthe unkind words and makin her act against her nature phrasie she said once i cant pray in the meetinghouse with my eyes shuti cant i cant i seem to know what theyre all wishing for when they prayfor more riches and more comfort and more security and more importance and god is such a long way off i cant feel him and the pew hurts my back she used to read me some out of a book of poetry and one verse i got by hearti guess her prayers were like that  do youremember the verse asked victoria  euphrasia went to a little shelf in the corner of the kitchen and produced a book which she opened and handed to victoria  theres the verse she said read it aloud i guess youre better at that than i am  and victoria read       higher still and higher       from the earth thou springest      like a cloud of fire       the blue deep thou wingest      and singing still dost soar and soaring ever singest  victoria let fall the volume on her lap  theres another verse in that book she liked said euphrasia but it always was sad to me  victoria took the book and read again       weary wind who wanderest       like the worlds rejected guest      hast thou still some secret nest       on the tree or billow  euphrasia laid the volume tenderly on the shelf and turned and faced victoria  she was unhappy like that before she died she exclaimed and added with a fling of her head towards the front of the house he killed her  oh no cried victoria involuntarily rising to her feet oh no im sure he didnt mean to he didnt understand her  he killed her euphrasia repeated why didnt he understand her she was just as simple as a child and just as trusting and just as loving he made her unhappy and now hes driven her son out of her house and made him unhappy hes all of her i have left and i wont see him unhappy  victoria summoned her courage  dont you think she asked bravely that mr austen vane ought to be told that his father isin this condition  no said euphrasia determinedly hilary will have to send for him this time itll be austens victory  but hasnt he hada victory victoria persisted earnestly isnt thisvictory enough  what do you mean euphrasia cried sharply  i mean she answered in a low voice i mean that mr vanes son is responsible for his condition today ohnot consciously so but the cause of this trouble is mentalcant you see it the cause of this trouble is remorse cant you see that it has eaten into his soul do you wish a greater victory than this or a sadder one hilary vane will not ask for his sonbecause he cannot he has no more power to send that message than a man shipwrecked on an island he can only give signals of distressthat some may heed would she have waited for such a victory as you demand and does austen vane desire it dont you think that he would come to his father if he knew and have you any right to keep the news from him have you any right to decide what their vengeance shall be  euphrasia had stood mute as she listened to these words which she had so little expected but her eyes flashed and her breath came quickly never had she been so spoken to never had any living soul come between her and her cherished object the breaking of the heart of hilary vane nor indeed had that object ever been so plainly set forth as victoria had set it forth and this woman who dared to do this had herself brought unhappiness to austen euphrasia had almost forgotten that such had been the strange harmony of their communion  have you the right to tell austen she demanded  have i victoria repeated and then as the full meaning of the question came to her the colour flooded into her face and she would have fled if she could bud euphrasias words came in a torrent  youve made him unhappy as well as hilary he loves youbut he wouldnt speak of it to you oh no he didnt tell me who it was but i never rested till i found out he never would have told me about it at all or anybody else but that i guessed it i saw he was unhappy and i calculated it wasnt hilary alone made him so one night he came in here and i knew all at oncesomehowthere was a woman to blame and i asked him and he couldnt lie to me he said it wasnt anybodys fault but his ownhe wouldnt say any more than that except that he hadnt spoken to her i always expected the time was coming when there would bea woman and i never thought the woman lived that hed love who wouldnt love him i cant see how any woman could help lovin him  and then i found out it was that railroad it came between sarah austen and her happiness and now its come between austen and his perhaps you dont love him cried euphrasia perhaps youre too rich and high and mighty perhaps youre agoing to marry that fine young man who came with you in the buggy since i heard who you was i havent had a happy hour let me tell you theres no better blood in the land than the austen blood i wont mention the vanes if youve led him on if youve deceived him i hope you may be unhappy as sarah austen was  dont pleaded victoria dont please dont and she seized euphrasia by the arms as though seeking by physical force to stop the intolerable flow of words oh you dont know me you cant understand me if you say that how can you be so cruel  in another moment she had gone leaving euphrasia standing in the middle of the floor staring after her through the doorway     chapter xxvi the focus of wrath  victoria after leaving euphrasia made her way around the house towards mr rangely who was waiting in the runabout her one desire for the moment being to escape before she had reached the sidewalk under the trees dr tredway had interrupted her  miss flint he called out i wanted to say a word to you before you went  yes she said stopping and turning to him  he paused a moment before speaking as he looked into her face  i dont wonder this has upset you a little he said a reaction always comes afterwardseven with the strongest of us  i am all right she replied unconsciously repeating hilarys words how is mr vane  you have done a splendid thing said the doctor gravely and he continued after a moment it is mr vane i wanted to speak to you about he is an intimate friend i believe of your fathers as well as mr flints righthand man inin a business way in this state mr vane himself will not listen to reason i have told him plainly that if he does not drop all business at once the chances are ten to one that he will forfeit his life very shortly i understand that there is aa convention to be held at the capital the day after tomorrow and that it is mr vanes firm intention to attend it i take the liberty of suggesting that you lay these facts before your father as mr flint probably has more influence with hilary vane than any other man however he added seeing victoria hesitate if there is any reason why you should not care to speak to mr flint  oh no said victoria ill speak to him certainly i was going to ask youhave you thought of mr austen vane he might be able to do something  of course said the doctor after a moment it is an open secret that austen and his father havehave in short never agreed they are not now on speaking terms  dont you think asked victoria summoning her courage that austen vane ought to be told  yes the doctor repeated decidedly i am sure of it everybody who knows austen vane as i do has the greatest admiration for him you probably remember him in that meader casehe isnt a man one would be likely to forgetand i know that this quarrel with his father isnt of austens seeking  oughtnt he to be toldat once said victoria  yes said the doctor time is valuable and we cant predict what hilary will do at any rate austen ought to knowbut the trouble is hes at jenneys farm i met him on the way out there just before your friend the englishman caught me and unfortunately i have a case which i cannot neglect but i can send word to him  i know where jenneys farm is said victoria ill drive home that way  well exclaimed dr tredway heartily thats good of you somebody who knows hilarys situation ought to see him and i can think of no better messenger than you  and he helped her into the runabout  young mr rangely being a gentleman he refrained from asking victoria questions on the drive out of ripton and expressed the greatest willingness to accompany her on this errand and to see her home afterwards he had been deeply impressed but he felt instinctively that after such a serious occurrence this was not the time to continue to give hints of his admiration he had heard in england that many american women whom he would be likely to meet socially were superficial and pleasureloving and arthur rangely came of a family which had long been cited as a vindication of a government by aristocracya family which had never shirked responsibilities it is not too much to say that he had pictured victoria among his future tenantry she had appealed to him first as a woman but the incident of the afternoon had revealed her to him as it were under fire  they spoke quietly of places they both had visited of people whom they knew in common until they came to the hillsthe very threshold of paradise on that september evening those hills never failed to move victoria and they were garnished this evening in no earthly coloursroselighted on the billowy western pasture slopes and pearl in the deep clefts of the streams and the lordly form of sawanec shrouded in indigo against a flame of orange and orange fainted by the subtlest of colour changes to azure in which swam so confidently a silver evening star  in silence they drew up before mr jenneys ancestral trees and through the deepening shadows beneath these the windows of the farmhouse glowed with welcoming light at victorias bidding mr rangely knocked to ask for austen vane and austen himself answered the summons he held a book in his hand and as rangely spoke she saw austens look turn quickly to her and met it through the gathering gloom between them in an instant he was at her side looking up questioningly into her face and the telltale blood leaped into hers what must he think of her for coming again she could not speak of her errand too quickly  mr vane i came to leave a message  yes he said and glanced at the broadshouldered wellgroomed figure of mr rangely who was standing at a discreet distance  your father has had an attack of some kindplease dont be alarmed he seems to be recovered nowand i thought and dr tredway thought you ought to know about it the doctor could not leave ripton and i offered to come and tell you  an attack he repeated  yes hilary and she related simply how she had found hilary at fairview and how she had driven him home but during the whole of her recital she could not rid herself of the apprehension that he was thinking her interference unwarranted her coming an indelicate repetition of the other visit as he stood there listening in the gathering dusk she could not tell from his face what he thought his expression when serious had a determined combative almost grim note in it which came from a habit he had of closing his jaw tightly and his eyes were like troubled skies through which there trembled an occasional flash of light  victoria had never felt his force so strongly as now and never had he seemed more distant at timesshe had thoughtshe had had glimpses of his soul tonight he was inscrutable and never had she realized the power which she had known he must possess of making himself so and to her her pride forbade her recalling at that moment the confidences which had passed between them and which now seemed to have been so impossible he was serious because he was listening to serious newsshe told herself but it was more than this he had shut himself up he was impenetrable shame seized her yes and anger and shame again at the remembrance of her talk with euphrasiaand anger once more could he think that she would make advances to tempt his honour and risk his good opinion and her own  confidence is like a lutestring giving forth sweet sounds in its perfection there are none so discordant as when it snaps  victoria scarcely heard austens acknowledgments of her kindness so perfunctory did they seem so unlike the man she had known and her own protestations that she had done nothing to merit his thanks were to her quite as unreal she introduced him to the englishman  mr rangely has been good enough to come with me she said  ive never seen anybody act with more presence of mind than miss flint rangely declared as he shook austens hand she did just the right thing without wasting any time whatever  im sure of it said austen cordially enough but to victorias keener ear other tones which she had heard at other times were lacking nor could she clever as she was see the palpable reason standing before her  i say said rangely as they drove away he strikes me as a remarkably sound chap miss flint there is something unusual about him something clean cut  ive heard other people say so victoria replied for the first time since she had known him praise of austen was painful to her what was this curious attraction that roused the interest of all who came in contact with him the doctor had it mr redbrook jabe jenneyeven hamilton tooting she remembered and he attracted women as well as menit must be so certainly her own interest in hima man beyond the radius of her sphereand their encounters had been strange enough and must she go on all her life hearing praises of him of one thing she was surewho was notthat austen vane had a future he was the type of man which is inevitably impelled into places of trust  manly men as a rule do not understand women they humour them blindly seek to comfort themif they weepwith caresses laugh with them if they have leisure and respect their curious and unaccountable moods by keeping out of the way such a husband was arthur rangely destined to make a man who had seen any number of women and understood noneas wondrous mechanisms he had merely acquired the faculty of appraisal although this does not mean that he was incapable of falling in love  mr rangely could not account for the sudden access of gayety in victorias manner as they drove to fairview through the darkness nor did he try he took what the gods sent him and was thankful when he reached fairview he was asked to dinner as he could not possibly get back to the inn in time mr flint had gone to sumner with the engineers leaving orders to be met at the east tunbridge station at ten and mrs flint still convalescent had dined in her sitting room victoria sat opposite her guest in the big dining room and mr rangely pronounced the occasion decidedly jolly he had he proclaimed with the exception of mr vanes deplorable accident never spent a better day in his life  victoria wondered at her own spirits which were feverish as she listened to transatlantic gossip about girls she had known who had married mr rangelys friends and stories of westminster and south africa and certain experiences of mr rangelys at other places than leith on the american continent which he had grown sufficiently confidential to relate at times lifting her eyes to him as he sat smoking after dinner on the other side of the library fire she almost doubted his existence he had come into her life at one oclock that dayit seemed an eternity since and a subconscious voice heard but not heeded told her that in the awakening from this curious dream he would be associated in her memory with tragedy just as a tune or a book or a game of cards reminds one of painful periods of ones existence tomorrow theepisode would be a nightmare tonight her one desire was to prolong it  and poor mr rangely little imagined the part he was playingas little as he deserved it reluctant to leave propriety impelled him to ask for a trap at ten and it was half past before he finally made his exit from the room with a promise to pay his respects soonvery soon  victoria stood before the fire listening to the sound of the wheels gradually growing fainter and her mind refused to work hanover street mr jenneys farmhouse were unrealities too ten minutes laterif she had marked the intervalcame the sound of wheels again this time growing louder then she heard a voice in the hall her fathers voice  towers who was that  a young gentleman sir who drove home with miss victoria i didnt get his name sir  has miss victoria retired  shes in the library sir here are some telegrams mr flint  victoria heard her father tearing open the telegrams and walking towards the library with slow steps as he read them she did not stir from her place before the fire she saw him enter and with a characteristic movement which had become almost habitual of late crush the telegrams in front of him with both hands  well victoria he said  well father  it was characteristic of him too that he should momentarily drop the conversation unravel the ball of telegrams read one crush them once morea process that seemed to give him relief he glanced at his daughtershe had not moved whatever mr flints original character may have been in his longforgotten youth on the windswept hill farm in truro his methods of attack lacked directness now perhaps a long business and political experience were responsible for this trait  your mother didnt come down to dinner i suppose  no said victoria  simpson tells me the young bull got loose and cut himself badly he says its the fault of the eben fitch you got me to hire  i dont believe it was ebens faultsimpson doesnt like him victoria replied  simpson tells me fitch drinks  let a man get a bad name said victoria and simpson will take care that he doesnt lose it the unexpected necessity of defending one of her proteges aroused her ive made it a point to see eben every day for the last three months and he hasnt touched a drop hes one of the best workers we have on the place  ive got too much on my mind to put up with that kind of thing said mr flint and i wont be worried here on the place i can get capable men to tend cattle at least i have to put up with political rascals who rob and deceive me as soon as my back is turned i have to put up with inefficiency and senility but i wont have it at home  fitch will be transferred to the gardener if you think best she said  it suddenly occurred to victoria in the light of a new discovery that in the past her fathers irritability had not extended to her and this discovery she knew ought to have some significance but she felt unaccountably indifferent to it mr flint walked to a window at the far end of the room and flung apart the tightly closed curtains before it  i never can get used to this newfangled way of shutting everything up tight he declared when i lived in centre street i used to read with the curtains up every night and nobody ever shot me he stood looking out at the starlight for awhile and turned and faced her again  i havent seen much of you this summer victoria he remarked  im sorry father you know i always like to walk with you every day you are here he had aroused her sufficiently to have a distinct sense that this was not the time to refer to the warning she had given him that he was working too hard but he was evidently bent on putting this construction on her answer  several times i have asked for you and you have been away he said  if you had only let me know i should have made it a point to be at home  how can i tell when these idiots will give me any rest he asked he crushed the telegrams again and came down the room and stopped in front of her perhaps there has been a particular reason why you have not been at home as much as usual  a particular reason she repeated in genuine surprise  yes he said i have been hearing things which to put it mildly have astonished me  hearing things  yes he exclaimed i may be busy i may be harassed by tricksters and bunglers but i am not too busy not to care something about my daughters doings i expect them to deceive me victoria but i pinned my faith somewhere i pinned it on you on you do you understand  she raised her head for the first time and looked at him with her lips quivering but she did not speak  ever since you were a child you have been everything to me all i had to fly to i was always sure of one genuine disinterested loveand that was yours i was always sure of hearing the truth from your lips  father she cried  he seemed not to hear the agonized appeal in her voice although he spoke in his usual tones augustus flint was in fact beside himself  and now he said and now i learn that you have been holding clandestine meetings with a man who is my enemy with a man who has done me more harm than any other single individual with a man whom i will not have in my housedo you understand i can only say that before tonight i gave him credit for having the decency not to enter it not to sit down at my table  victoria turned away from him and seized the high oak shelf of the mantel with both hands he saw her shoulders rising and falling as her breath came deeply spasmodicallylike sobbing but she was not sobbing as she turned again and looked into his face fear was in her eye and the high courage to look fear and courage she seemed to be looking at another man at a man who was not her father and mr flint despite his anger vaguely interpreting her meaning was taken aback he had never seen anybody with such a look and the unexpected quiet quality of her voice intensified his strange sensation  a mr rangely an englishman who is staying at the leith inn was here to dinner tonight he has never been here before  austen vane wasnt here tonight  mr vane has never been in this house to my knowledge but once and you knew more about that meeting than i do  and still victoria spoke quietly inexplicably so to mr flintand to herself it seemed to her that some other than she were answering with her voice and that she alone felt it was all a part of the nightmare all unreal and this was not her father nevertheless she suffered now not from anger alone nor sorrow nor shame for him and for herself nor disgust nor a sense of injustice nor crueltybut all of these played upon a heart responsive to each with a different pain  and mr flint halted for the moment by her look and manner yet goaded on by a fiend of provocation which had for months been gathering strength and which now mastered him completely persisted he knew not what he did or said  and you havent seen him today i suppose he cried  yes i have seen him today  ah you have i thought as much where did you meet him today  victoria turned half away from him raised a hand to the mantelshelf again and lifted a foot to the low brass fender as she looked down into the fire the movement was not part of a desire to evade him as he fancied in his anger but rather one of profound indifference of profound wearinessthe sunless deeps of sorrow and he thought her capable of deceiving him he had been her constant companion from childhood and knew only the visible semblance of her face her form her smile her sex was the sex of subterfuge  i went to the place where he is living and asked for him she said and he came out and spoke to me  you he repeated incredulously there was surely no subterfuge in her tone but an unreal unbelievable note which his senses seized and to which he clung you my daughter  yes she answered i your daughter i suppose you think i am shameless it is truei am  mr flint was utterly baffled he was at sea he had got beyond the range of his experience defence denial tears he could have understood and coped with he crushed the telegrams into a tighter ball sought for a footing and found a precarious one  and all this has been going on without my knowledge when you knew my sentiments towards the man  yes she said i do not know what you include in that remark but i have seen him many times as many times perhaps as you have heard about  he wheeled and walked over to a cabinet between two of the great windows and stood there examining a collection of fans which his wife had bought at a famous sale in paris had he suddenly been asked the question he could not have said whether they were fans or beetles and it occurred to victoria as her eyes rested on his back that she ought to be sorry for himbut wasnt somehow perhaps she would be tomorrow mr flint looked at the fans and an obscure glimmering of the truth came to him that instead of administering a severe rebuke to the daughter he believed he had known all his life he was engaged in a contest with the soul of a woman he had never known and the more she confessed the more she apparently yielded the more impotent he seemed the tighter the demon gripped him obstacles embarrassments disappointments he had met early in his life and he had taken them as they came there had followed a long period when his word had been law and now as age came on and he was meeting with obstacles again he had lost the magic gift of sweeping them aside the growing certainty that he was becoming powerless haunted him night and day unbelievably strange however it was that the rays of his anger by some subconscious process had hovered from the first about the son of hilary vane and were now by the trend of event after event firmly focussed there  he left the cabinet abruptly and came back to victoria  she was standing in the same position  you have spared me something he said he has apparently undermined me with my own daughter he has evidently given you an opinion of me which is his i think i can understand why you have not spoken of thesemeetings  it is an inference that i expected said victoria then she lifted her head and looked at him and again he could not read her expression for a light burned in her eyes that made them impenetrable to hima light that seemed pitilessly to search out and reveal the dark places and the weak places within him which he himself had not known were there could there be another standard by which men and women were measured and judged  mr flint snapped his fingers and turned and began to pace the room  its all pretty clear he said theres no use going into it any farther you believe with the rest of them that im a criminal and deserve the penitentiary i dont care a straw about the others he cried snapping his fingers again and i suppose if id had any sense i might have expected it from you too victoriathough you are my daughter  he was aware that her eyes followed him  how many times have you spoken with austen vane she asked  once he exclaimed that was enough once  and he gave you the impression she continued slowly that he was deceitful and dishonourable and a coward a man who would say things behind your back that he dared not say to your face who desired reward for himself at any price and in any manner a man who would enter your house and seek out your daughter and secretly assail your character  mr flint stopped in the middle of the floor  and you tell me he has not done these things  suppose i did tell you so said victoria would you believe me i have no reason to think that you would i am your daughter i have been your most intimate companion and i had the right to think that you should have formed some estimate of my character suppose i told you that austen vane has avoided me that he would not utter a word against you or in favour of himself suppose i told you that i your daughter thought there might be two sides to the political question that is agitating you and wished in fairness to hear the other side as i intended to tell you when you were less busy suppose i told you that austen vane was the soul of honour that he saw your side and presented it as ably as you have presented it that he had refrained in many matters which might have been of advantage to himalthough i did not hear of them from himon account of his father would you believe me  and suppose i told you cried mr flintso firmly fastened on him was the long habit of years of talking another down suppose i told you that this was the most astute and the craftiest course he could take ive always credited him with brains suppose i told you that he was intriguing now as he has been all along to obtain the nomination for the governorship would you believe me  no answered victoria quietly  mr flint went to the lamp unrolled the ball of telegrams seized one and crossed the room quickly and held it out to her his hand shook a little  read that he said  she read it estimate that more than half of delegates from this section pledged to henderson will go to austen vane when signal is given in convention am told on credible authority same is true of other sections including many of hunts men and crewes this is the result of quiet but persistent political work i spoke about billings  she handed the telegram back to her father in silence do you believe it now he demanded exultantly  who is the man whose name is signed to that message she asked  mr flint eyed her narrowly  what difference does that make he demanded  none said victoria but a vision of mr billings rose before her he had been pointed out to her as the man who had opposed austen in the meader suit if the bishop of the diocese signed it i would not believe that austen vane had anything to do with the matter  ah you defend him cried mr flint i thought soi thought so i take off my hat to him he is a cleverer man even than i his own father whom he has ruined comes up here and defends him  does hilary vane defend him victoria asked curiously  yes said mr flint beside himself incredible as it may seem he does i have austen vane to thank for still another favourhe is responsible for hilarys condition today he has broken him downhe has made him an imbecile the convention is scarcely thirtysix hours off and hilary is about as fit to handle it asas eben fitch hilary who never failed me in his life  victoria did not speak for a moment and then she reached out her hand quickly and laid it on his that still held the telegram a lounge stood on one side of the fireplace and she drew him gently to it and he sat down at her side his acquiescence to her was a second nature and he was once more bewildered his anger now seemed to have had no effect upon her whatever  i waited up to tell you about hilary vane father she said gently he has had a stroke which i am afraid is serious  a stroke cried mr flint why didnt you tell me how do you know  victoria related how she had found hilary coming away from fairview and what she had done and the word dr tredway had sent  good god cried mr flint he wont be able to go to the convention and he rose and pressed the electric button towers he said when the butler appeared is mr freeman still in my room tell him to telephone to ripton at once and find out how mr hilary vane is theyll have to send a messenger that accounts for it he went on rather to himself than to victoria and he began to pace the room once more he looked like a sick man when he was here and who have we got to put in his place not a soul  he paced awhile in silence he appeared to have forgotten victoria  poor hilary he said again poor hilary ill go down there the first thing in the morning  another silence and then mr freeman the secretary entered  i telephoned to dr tredways mr flint i thought that would be quickest mr vane has left home they dont know where hes gone  left home its impossible and he glanced at victoria who had risen to her feet there must be some mistake  no sir first i got the doctor who said that mr vane was goneat the risk of his life and then i talked to mr austen vane himself who was there consulting with the doctor it appears that mr hilary vane had left home by eight oclock when mr austen vane got there  hilarys gone out of his head exclaimed mr flint this thing has unhinged him here take these telegrams no wait a minute ill go out there call up billings and see if you can get senator whitredge  he started out of the room halted and turned his head and hesitated  father said victoria i dont think hilary vane is out of his mind  you dont he said quickly why  by some unaccountable change in the atmosphere of which mr flint was unconscious his normal relation to his daughter had been suddenly reestablished he was giving ear as usual to her judgment  did hilary vane tell you he would go to the convention she asked  yes in spite of himself he had given the word an apologetic inflection  then he has gone already she said i think if you will telephone a little later to the state capital you will find that he is in his room at the pelican hotel  by thunder victoria he ejaculated you may be right it would be like him     chapter xxvii the arena and the dust  alas that the great genius who described the battle of waterloo is not alive today and on this side of the atlantic for a subject worthy of his pen is at handnothing less than that convention of conventions at which the honourable humphrey crewe of leith is one of the candidates one of the candidates indeed will it not be known as long as there are pensions and a governor and a statehouse and a seal and state sovereignty and a staff as the crewe convention how charge after charge was made during the long hot day and into the night how the delegates were carried out limp and speechless and starved and wet through and carried in to vote againwill all be told in time but let us begin at the beginning which is the day before  but look it is afternoon and the candidates are arriving at the pelican the honourable adam b hunt is the first and walks up the hill from the station escorted by such prominent figures as the honourables brush bascom and jacob botcher and surrounded by enthusiastic supporters who wear buttons with the image of their leadergoatee and alland the singularly prophetic superscription to the last ditch only veterans and experts like mr bascom and mr botcher can recognize the last ditch when they see it  another stir in the streetoccasioned by the appearance of the honourable giles hendersonof the blameless life utter a syllable against him if you can these words should be inscribed on his buttons if he had anybut he has none they seem to be unuttered on the tongues of the gentlemen who escort the honourable giles united states senator greene and the honourable elisha jane who has obtained leave of absence from his consular post to attend the conventionand incidentally to help prepare for it  but who and what is this the warlike blast of a siren horn is heard the crowd in the lobby rushes to the doors people upstairs fly to the windows and the honourable adam b hunt leans out and nearly falls out but is rescued by division superintendent manning of the northeastern railroads who has stepped in from number seven to give a little private tug of a persuasive nature to the honourable adams coattails a red leviathan comes screaming down main street with a white trail of dust behind it smothering the occupants of vehicles which have barely succeeded in getting out of the way and makes a spectacular finish before the pelican by sliding the last fifty feet on locked rear wheels  a group in the street raises a cheer it is the peoples champion dust coat gauntlets goggles cannot hide him and if they did some one would recognize that voice familiar now and endeared to many and so suited to commandget that baggage off and dont waste any time jump out watlingthat handle turns the other way well tooting are the headquarters ready what was the matter that i couldnt get you on the telephone to the crowd dont push in and scratch the paint hes going to back out in a minute and somebodyll get hurt  mr hamilton tooting colonel hamilton tooting that is to beit being an open secret that he is destined for the staff is standing hatless on the sidewalk ready to receive the great man the crowd in the rotunda makes a lane and mr crewe glancing neither to the right nor left walks upstairs and scarce is he installed in the bridal suite surrounded by his faithful workers for reform than that amazing reception begins mr hamilton tooting looking the very soul of hospitality stands by the doorway with an open box of cigars in his left hand pressing them upon the visitors with his right reform contrary to the preconceived opinion of many is not made of icicles nor answers with a stone a request for bread as the hours run on the visitors grow more and more numerous and after supper the room is packed to suffocation and a long line is waiting in the corridor marshalled and kept in good humour by able lieutenants while mr crewe is dimly to be perceived through clouds of incense burning in his honourand incidentally at his expensewith a welcoming smile and an appropriate word for each caller whose waistcoat pockets when they emerge resemble cartridgebelts of cigars  more cigars were hastily sent for and more there are to be but a thousand delegates to the convention and at least two thousand men have already passed through the roomand those who dont smoke have friends it is well that mr crewe has stuck to his conservative habit of not squeezing hands too hard  isnt that mr putter who keeps a liverystable here inquired mr crewe about nine oclockour candidate having a piercing eye of his own mr putters coat being brushed back has revealed six cigars  why yesyes says mr watling  is he a delegate mr crewe demanded  why i guess he must be says mr watling  but mr putter is not a delegate  youve stood up and made a grand fight mr crewe says another gentleman a little later with a bland smooth shaven face and strong teeth to clinch mr crewes cigars i wish i was fixed so as i could vote for you  mr crewe looks at him narrowly  you look very much like a travelling man from new york who tried to sell me farm machinery he answers  where are you from  you aint exactly what they call a tyro are you says the blandfaced man but i guess youve missed the mark this shot well so long  hold on says mr crewe watling will talk to you  and as the gentleman follows mr wailing through the press a pamphlet drops from his pocket to the floor it is marked catalogue of the raines farm implement company mr watling picks it up and hands it to the gentleman who winks again  tim he says where can we sit down how much are you getting out of this brush and jake botcher are bidding high downstairs and the quotation on delegates has gone up ten points in ten minutes its mighty good of you to remember old friends tim even if theyre not delegates  meanwhile mr crewe is graciously receiving others who are crowding to him  how are you mr giddings how are the cows i carry some stock thatll make you sit upi believe i told you when i was down your way of course mine cost a little money but thats one of my hobbies come and see em some day theres a good hotel in ripton and ill have you met there and drive you back  thus with a genial and kindly remark to each he passes from one to the other and when the members of the press come to him for his estimate of the outcome on the morrow he treats them with the same courtly consideration  estimate cries mr crewe where have your eyes been tonight my friends have you seen the people coming into these headquarters have you seen em pouring into any other headquarters all the state and federal officeholders in the country couldnt stop me now estimate ill be nominated on the first ballot  they wrote it down  thank you mr crewe they said thats the kind of talk we like to hear  and dont forget said mr crewe to mention this reception in the accounts  mr tooting who makes it a point from time to time to reconnoitre saunters halfway downstairs and surveys the crowded rotunda from the landing through the blue medium produced by the burning of many cigars mostly mr crewes he takes note of the burly form of mr thomas gaylord beside that of mr redbrook and other rural figures he takes note of a quiet corner with a ring of chairs surrounded by scouts and outposts although it requires a trained eye such as mr tootings to recognize them as suchfor they wear no uniforms they are in truth minor captains of the feudal system and their present duties consist as mr tooting sees clearly in preventing the innocent and inquisitive from unprofitable speech with the honourable jacob botcher who sits in the inner angle conversing cordially with those who are singled out for this honour still other scouts conduct some of the gentlemen who have talked with mr botcher up the stairs to a mysterious room on the second floor mr tooting discovers that the room is occupied by the honourable brush bascom mr tooting learns with indignation that certain of these guests of mr bascoms are delegates pledged to mr crewe whereupon he rushes back to the bridal suite to report to his chief the cigars are giving out again and the rush has slackened and he detaches the peoples champion from the line and draws him to the inner room  brush bascoms conducting a bourse on the second floor and is running the price up right along cried the honest and indignant mr tooting hes stringin adam hunt all right they say hes got adam to cough up six thousand extra since five oclock but the question isaint he stringin us he paid six hundred for a block of ten not quarter of an hour agoand nine of em were our delegates  it must be remembered that these are mr tootings words and mr crewe evidently treated them as the product of that gentlemans vivid imagination translated they meant that the honourable adam b hunt has no chance for the nomination but that the crafty messrs botcher and bascom are inducing him to think that he hasby making a supreme effort the supreme effort is represented by six thousand dollars  are you going to lie down under that mr tooting demanded forgetting himself in his zeal for reform and mr crewe but mr tooting in some alarm perceived the eye of his chief growing virtuous and glassy  i guess i know when im strung as you call it mr tooting he replied severely this cigar bill alone is enough to support a large family for several months  and with this merited reproof he turned on his heel and went back to his admirers without leaving mr tooting aghast but still resourceful ten minutes later that gentleman was engaged in a private conversation with his colleague the honourable timothy wading  hes up on his hind legs at last said mr tooting it looks as if he was catching on  mr wading evidently grasped these mysterious words for he looked grave  he thinks hes got the nomination cinched dont he  thats the worst of it cried mr tooting  ill see what i can do said the honourable tim hes always talking about thorough let him do it thorough and mr watling winked  thorough repeated mr tooting delightedly  thats itcolonel said mr watling have you ordered your uniform yet ham  mr tooting plainly appreciated this joke for he grinned  i guess you wont starve if you dont get that commissionership tim he retorted  and i guess returned mr watling that you wont go naked if you dont have a uniform  victorias surmise was true at ten oclock at night two days before the convention a tall figure had appeared in the empty rotunda of the pelican startling the clerk out of a doze he rubbed his eyes and stared recognized hilary vane and yet failed to recognize him it was an extraordinary occasion indeed which would cause mr mcavoy to lose his aplomb to neglect to seize the pen and dip it with a flourish into the ink and extend its handle towards the important guest to omit a few fitting words of welcome it was hilary who got the pen first and wrote his name in silence and by this time mr mcavoy had recovered his presence of mind sufficiently to wield the blotter  we didnt expect you tonight mr vane he said in a voice that sounded strange to him but weve kept number seven as usual front  the old mans seen his day i guess mr mcavoy remarked as he studied the register with a lone reporter this crewe must have got in on em hard from what they tell me and adam hunt has his dander up  the next morning at ten oclock while the workmen were still tacking down the fireproof carpets in headquarters upstairs and before even the advance guard of the armies had begun to arrive the eye of the clerk was caught by a tall young man rapidly approaching the desk  is mr hilary vane here  hes in number seven said mr mcavoy who was cudgelling his brains give me your card and ill send it up  ill go up said the caller turning on his heel and suiting the action to the word leaving mr mcavoy to make active but futile inquiries among the few travelling men and reporters seated about  well if you fellers dont know him i give up said the clerk irritably but he looks as if he ought to be somebody he knows his business anyway  in the meantime mr vanes caller had reached the first floor he hesitated just a moment before knocking at the door of number seven and the honourable hilarys voice responded the door opened  hilary was seated as usual beside the marbletopped table which was covered with newspapers and memoranda in the room were mr ridout the capital lawyer and mr manning the division superintendent there was an instant of surprised silence on the part of the three but the honourable hilary was the only one who remained expressionless  if you dont mind gentlemen said the visitor i should like to talk to my father for a few minutes  why certainly austen mr ridout replied with an attempt at heartiness further words seemed to fail him and he left the room somewhat awkwardly followed by mr manning but the honourable hilary appeared to take no notice of this proceeding  judge said austen when the door had closed behind them i wont keep you long i didnt come down here to plead with you to abandon what you believe to be your duty because i know that would be useless i have had a talk with dr tredway he added gently and i realize that you are risking your life if i could take you back to ripton i would but i know that i cannot i see your point of view and if i were in your place i should do the same thing i only wanted to tell you this austens voice caught a little ifanything should happen i shall be at mrs peasleys on maple street opposite the duncan house he laid his hand for an instant in the old familiar way on hilarys shoulder and looked down into the older mans face it may have been that hilarys lips trembled a little iill see you later judge when its all over good luck to you  he turned slowly went to the door and opened it gave one glance at the motionless figure in the chair and went out he did not hear the voice that called his name for the door had shut  mr ridout and mr manning were talking together in low tones at the head of the stairs it was the lawyer who accosted austen  the old gentleman dont seem to be quite himself austen dont seem well you ought to hold him in he cant work as hard as he used to  i think youll find mr ridout answered austen deliberately that hell perform whats required of him with his usual efficiency  mr ridout followed austens figure with his eyes until he was hidden by a turn of the stairs then he whistled  i cant make that fellow out he exclaimed never could all i know is that if hilary vane pulls us through this mess in the shape hes in itll be a miracle  his mind seems sound enough todaybut hes lost his grip i tell you i dont wonder flints beside himself heres adam hunt with both feet in the trough and no more chance of the nomination than i have and bascom and botcher teasing him on and hes got enough votes with crewe to lock up that convention for a dark horse and whos the dark horse  mr manning who was a silent man pointed with his thumb in the direction austen had taken  hilary vanes own son said mr ridout voicing the gesture they tell me that tom gaylords done some pretty slick work now i leave it to you manning if that isnt a mess  at this moment the conversation was interrupted by the appearance on the stairway of the impressive form of united states senator whitredge followed by a hall boy carrying the senatorial gripsack the senators face wore a look of concern which could not possibly be misinterpreted  hows hilary were his first words  mr ridout and mr manning glanced at each other  hes in number seven youd better take a look at him senator  the senator drew breath directed that his grip be put in the room where he was to repose that night produced an amber cigarholder from a case and a cigar from his waistcoat pocket  i thought id better come down early he said things arent going just as they should and thats the truth in fact he added significantly tapping his pocket ive got a letter from mr flint to hilary which i may have to use you understand me  i guessed as much said mr ridout  ahem i saw young vane going out of the hotel just now the senator remarked i am told on pretty good authority that under certain circumstances which i must confess seem not unlikely at present he may be a candidate for the nomination the fact that he is in town tends to make the circumstance more probable  hes just been in to see hilary said mr ridout  you dont tell me said the senator pausing as he lighted his cigar i was under the impression that they were not on speaking terms  theyve evidently got together now that said mr ridout i wonder how old hilary would feel about it we couldnt do much with austen vane if he was governorthats a sure thing  the senator pondered a moment  its been badly managed he muttered theres no doubt of that hunt must be got out of the way when bascom and botcher come tell them i want to see them in my room not in number seven  and with this impressive command received with nods of understanding senator whitredge advanced slowly towards number seven knocked and entered be it known that mr flint with characteristic caution had not confided even to the senator that the honourable hilary had had a stroke  ah vane he said in his most affable tones how are you  the honourable hilary who was looking over some papers shot at him a glance from under his shaggy eyebrows  came in here to find outdidnt you whitredge he replied  what said the senator taken aback and for once at a loss for words  the honourable hilary rose and stood straighter than usual and looked the senator in the eye  whats your diagnosis he asked superannuatedunfit for dutyunable to cope with the situation ready to be superseded is that about it  to say that senator whitredge was startled and uncomfortable would be to put his case mildly he had never before seen mr vane in this mood  haha he laughed the years are coming over us a little arent they but i guess it isnt quite time for the youngsters to step in yet  no whitredge said mr vane slowly without taking his eye from the senators and it wont be until this convention is over do you understand  thats the first good news ive heard this morning said the senator with the uneasy feeling that in some miraculous way the honourable hilary had read the superseding orders from highest authority through his pocket  you may take it as good news or bad news as you please but its a fact and now i want you to tell ridout that i wish to see him again and to bring in doby who is to be chairman of the convention  certainly assented the senator with alacrity as he started for the door then he turned im glad to see youre all right vane he added id heard that you were a little under the weathera bilious attack on account of the heatthats all i meant he did not wait for an answer nor would he have got one and he found mr ridout in the hall  well said the lawyer expectantly and looking with some curiosity at the senators face  well said mr whitredge with marked impatience he wants to see you right away  all day long hilary vane held conference in number seven and at six oclock sent a request that the honourable adam visit him the honourable adam would not come and the fact leaked outthrough the honourable adam  hes mad clean through reported the honourable elisha jane to whose tact and diplomacy the mission had been confided he said he would teach flint a lesson hed show him he couldnt throw away a man as useful and efficient as hed been like a sucked orange  humph a sucked orange thats what he said is it a sucked orange hilary repeated  thats what he said declared mr jane and remembered afterwards how hilary had been struck by the simile  at ten oclock at night at the very height of the tumult senator whitredge had received an interrogatory telegram from fairview and had called a private conference in which hilary was not included in a back room on the second floor where the conflicting bands of mr crewe and mr hunt could not be heard which mr manning and mr jane and state senator billings and mr ridout attended query the honourable hilary had quarrelled with mr flint that was an open secret did not mr vane think himself justified from his own point of view in taking a singular revenge in not overexerting himself to pull the honourable adam out thereby leaving the field open for his son austen vane with whom he was apparently reconciled not that mr flint had hinted of such a thing he had in the telegram merely urged the senator himself to see mr hunt and to make one more attempt to restrain the loyalty to that candidate of messrs bascom and botcher  the senator made the attempt and failed signally  it was halfpast midnight by the shining face of the clock on the tower of the statehouse and hope flamed high in the bosom of the honourable adam b hunt a tribute to the bellowslike skill of messrs bascom and botcher the bands in the street had blown themselves out the delegates were at last seeking rest the hall boys in the corridors were turning down the lights and the honourable adam in a complacent and even jubilant frame of mind had put on his carpet slippers and taken off his coat when there came a knock at his door he was not a little amazed and embarrassed upon opening it to see the honourable hilary but these feelings gave place almost immediately to a sense of triumph gone were the days when he had to report to number seven number seven in the person of hilary who was number seven had been forced to come to him  well upon my soul he exclaimed heartily come in hilary  he turned up the jets of the chandelier and gazed at his friend and was silent  have a seat hilary he said pushing up an armchair  mr vane sat down mr hunt took a seat opposite and waited for his visitor to speak he himself seemed to find no words  adam said mr vane at length weve known each other for a good many years  thats so hilary thats so mr hunt eagerly assented what was coming  and whatever harm ive done in my life hilary continued ive always tried to keep my word i told you when we met up there by the mill this summer that if mr flint had consulted me about your candidacy before seeing you in new york i shouldnt have advised itthis time  the honourable adams face stiffened  thats what you said but  and i meant it mr vane interrupted i was never pledged to your candidacy as a citizen ive been thinking over my situation some this summer and ill tell you in so many plain words what it is i guess you knowi guess everybody knows whos thought about it i deceived myself for a long time by believing that i earned my living as the attorney for the northeastern railroads ive drawn up some pretty good papers for them and ive won some pretty difficult suits im not proud of em all but let that go do you know what i am  the honourable adam was capable only of a startled ejaculation was hilary vane in his right senses  im merely their paid political tool mr vane continued in the same tone ive sold them my brain and my right of opinion as a citizen i wanted to make this clear to you first of all not that you didnt know it but i wished you to know that i know it when mr flint said that you were to be the republican nominee my business was to work to get you elected which i did and when it became apparent that you couldnt be nominated  hold on cried the honourable adam  please wait until i have finished when it became apparent that you couldnt be nominated mr flint sent me to try to get you to withdraw and he decreed that the new candidate should pay your expenses up to date i failed in that mission  i dont blame you hilary exclaimed mr hunt i told you so at the time but i guess ill soon be in a position where i can make flint walk the trackshis own tracks  adam said mr vane it is because i deserve as much of the blame as mr flint that i am here  again mr hunt was speechless the honourable hilary vane in an apologetic mood a surmise flashed into the brain of the honourable adam and sparkled there the honourable giles henderson was prepared to withdraw and hilary had come by authority to see if he would pay the honourable giles campaign expenses well he could snap his fingers at that  flint has treated me like a dog he declared  mr flint never pretended answered mr vane coldly that the nomination and election of a governor was anything but a business transaction his regard for you is probably unchanged but the interests he has at stake are too large to admit of sentiment as a factor  exactly exclaimed mr hunt and i hear he hasnt treated you just right hilary i understand  hilarys eyes flashed for the first time  never mind that adam he said quietly ive been treated as i deserve i have nothing whatever to complain of from mr flint i will tell you why i came here tonight i havent felt right about you since that interview and the situation tonight is practically what it was then you cant be nominated  cant be nominated gasped mr hunt and he reached to the table for his figures ill have four hundred on the first ballot and ive got two hundred and fifty more pledged to me as second choice if youve come up here at this time of night to try to deceive me on that you might as well go back and wire flint its no use why i can name the delegates if youll listen  mr vane shook his head sadly and confident as he was the movement sent a cold chill down the honourable adams spine for faith in mr vanes judgment had become almost a second nature he had to force himself to remember that this was not the old hilary  you wont have three hundred adam at any time answered mr vane once you used to believe what i said and if you wont now you wont but i cant go away without telling you what i came for  whats that demanded mr hunt wonderingly  its this replied hilary with more force than he had yet shown you cant get that nomination if youll let me know what your campaign expenses have been up to dateall of em you understand tonight tooill give you a check for them within the next two weeks  who makes this offer demanded mr hunt with more curiosity than alarm mr flint  no said hilary mr flint does not use the roads funds for such purposes  henderson  no said hilary i cant see what difference it makes to you  the honourable adam had an eminently human side and he laid his hand on mr vanes knee  i think ive got a notion as to where that money would come from hilary he said im much obliged to you my friend i wouldnt take it even if i thought youd sized up the situation right buti dont agree with you this time i know ive got the nomination and i want to say once more that i think youre a square man and i dont hold anything against you  mr vane rose  im sorry adam he said my offer holds good after tomorrow  after tomorrow  yes said the honourable hilary i dont feel right about this thing ergood night adam  hold on cried mr hunt as a new phase of the matter struck him why if i got out  what then said mr vane turning around  oh i wont get out said mr hunt but if i didwhy there wouldnt according to your way of thinking be any chance for a dark horse  what do you mean demanded mr vane  now dont get mad hilary i guess and you know that flint hasnt treated you decently this summer after all youve done for him and i admire the way youre standing by him i wouldnt do it i just wanted to say mr hunt added slowly that i respect you all the more for trying to get me out ifalways according to your notion of the conventionif i dont get out and havent any chance they tell me on pretty good authority austen vane will get the nomination  hilary vane walked to the door opened it and went out and slammed it behind him  it is morninga hot morning as so many recalland the partisans of the three leaders are early astir and at seventhirty mr tooting discovers something going on briskly which he terms dealing in futures my vote is yours as long as you are in the race but after that i have something negotiable the honourable adam hunt strolls into the rotunda after an early breakfast with a toothpick in his mouth and is pointed out by the sophisticated to new arrivals as the man who spent seven thousand dollars over night much of which is said to have stuck in the pockets of two feudal chiefs who could be named is it possible that there is a split in the feudal system at last that the two feudal chiefs who could be named are rebels against highest authority a smile from the sophisticated one this duke and baron have merely stopped to pluck a bird it matters not whether or not the bird is an erstwhile friendhe has been outlawed by highest authority and is fair game the bird with the toothpick in his mouth creates a smile from other chiefs of the system in good standing who are not too busy to look at him they have ceased all attempts to buttonhole him for he is unapproachable  the other bird the rebel of leith who has never been in the feudal system at all they have stopped laughing at it is he who has brought the empire to its most precarious state  and now while strangers from near and far throng into town drawn by the sensational struggle which is to culminate in battle today mr crewe is marshalling his forces all the delegates who can be collected and who wear the button with the likeness and superscription of humphrey crewe are drawn up beside the monument in the park where the ripton band is stationed and presently they are seen by cheering crowds marching to martial music towards the convention hall where they collect in a body with signs and streamers in praise of the peoples champion well to the front and centre this is generally regarded as a piece of consummate general ship on the part of their leader they are applauded from the galleriesalready packedespecially from one conspicuous end where sit that company of ladies now so famed whose efforts have so materially aided the cause of the peoples champion gay streamers vie with gayer gowns and morning papers on the morrow will have something to say about the fashionable element and the special car which brought them from leith  my but it is hot  the hall is filled now with the thousand delegates or their representatives who are fortunate enough to possess their credentials something of this matter later general doby chairman of the convention an impressive but mournful figure could not call a roll if he wanted to not that he will want to impossible to tell by the convenient laws of the state whether the duly elected delegates of hull or mercer or truro are here or not since their credentials may be bought or sold or conferred some political giants who have not negotiated their credentials are recognized as they walk down the aisle the statesmanlike figure of senator whitredge a cheer that of senator green not so statesmanlike but a cheer congressman fairplay cheers andhilary vane his a figure that does not inspire cheersleast of all todaythe man upon whose shoulders rests the political future of the northeastern the conservative mr tredways and other lincoln radicals of long ago who rely on his strength and judgment are not the sort to cheer and yetand yet hilary inspires some feeling when with stooping gait he traverses the hall and there is a hush in many quarters as delegates and spectators watch his progress to the little room off the platform the generals room as the initiated know  ah but few know what a hateful place it is to hilary vane today this keyboard at which he has sat so complacently in years gone by the envied of conventions he sits down wearily at the basswood table and scarcely hears the familiar sounds without which indicate that the convention of conventions has begun extraordinary phenomenon at such a time scenes of long ago and little cherished then are stealing into his mind  the reverend mr crane so often chaplain of the legislature and known to the irreverent as the chaplain of the northeastern is praying now for guidance in the counsels of this great gathering of the peoples representatives god will hear mr botcher better if he closes his eyes which he does now the platform is being read by state senator billings closed eyes would best suit this proceeding too as a parallel to that platform one can think only of the ten commandments the republican party chosen children of israel must be kept free from the domination of corporations cheers and banner waving for a full minute some better method of choosing delegates which will more truly reflect the will of the people plank of the honourable jacob botcher whose conscience is awakening never mind the rest it is a triumph for mr crewe and is all printed in that orthodox reform newspaper the state tribune with urgent editorials that it must be carried out to the letter  and what now delegates credential holders audience and the reverend mr crane draw long breaths of heated carbon dioxide postmaster burrows of edmundton in rounded periods is putting in nomination his distinguished neighbour and fellowcitizen the honourable adam b hunt who can subscribe and say amen to every plank in that platform he believes it he has proclaimed it in public and he embodies it mr burrows indulges in slight but effective sarcasm of sham reformers and socalled business men who perform the arduous task of cutting coupons and live in rarefied regions where they can only be seen by the common people when the light is turned on cheers from two partisan bodies and groans and hisses from another general doby with a pained face pounding with the gavel this isnt a circumstance to whats coming general  after general doby has succeeded in abating the noise in honourof the honourable adam there is a hush of expectancy humphrey crewe who has made all this trouble and enthusiasm is to be nominated next and the honourable timothy wailing of newcastle arises to make that celebrated oration which the cynical have called the thousanddollar speech and even if they had named it well which is not for a moment to be admitted it is cheap for the price how mr crewes ears must tingle as he paces his headquarters in the pelican almost would it be sacrilege to set down cold on paper the words that come burning out of the honourable timothys loyal heart here gentlemen is a man at last not a mere puppet who signs his name when a citizen of new york pulls the string one who is prepared to make any sacrificeto spend his life if need be in their service a barely audible voice before the cheering commences i guess thats so humphrey crewe needs no defencethe honourable timothy aversat his hands or any ones not merely an idealist but a practical man who has studied the needs of the state unselfish to the core longing like washington the father of his country to remain in a beautiful country home where he dispenses hospitality with a flowing hand to poor and rich alike yet harking to the call of duty leaving like the noble roman of old his plough in the furrowsame voice as before i wish hed left his automobil thar hisses and laughter the honourable timothy undaunted snatches his hand from the breast of his prince albert and flings it with a superb gesture towards the pelican gentlemen i have the honour to nominate to this convention that peerless leader for the right the honourable humphrey crewe of leithour next governor  general andrew jackson himself had he been alive and on this historic ground and chairman of that convention could scarce have quelled the tumult aroused by this name and this speechmuch less general doby although a man of presence measurable by scales with weights enough our general has no more ponderosity now than a leaf in a mountain storm at haleand no more control over the hurricane behold him now pounding with his gavel on something which should give forth a sound but doesnt who is he to change the speechs figurenot the generals who is he to drive a wild eighthorse team who is fit only to conduct mr flints oxen in years gone by  it is a memorable scene sketched to life for the metropolitan press the man on the chair his face lighted by a fanatic enthusiasm is the honourable hamilton tooting coatless and collarless leading the cheers that shake the building that must have struck terror to the soul of augustus p flint himselffifty miles away but the endurance of the human throat is limited  why in the name of political strategy has united states senator greene been chosen to nominate the honourable giles henderson of kingston some say that it is the will of highest authority others that the senator is a close friend of the honourable gilesbuys his coal from him wholesale both surmises are true the senators figure is not impressive his voice less so and he reads from manuscript to the accompaniment of continual cries of louder a hook for leviathan a great deal of dribble said the senator for little rocks sometimes strike fire has been heard about the will of the people  the honourable giles henderson is beholden to no man and to no corporation and will go into office prepared to do justice impartially to all  bucopia verborumlet us to the main business  to an hundred newspapers to mr flint at fairview and other important personages ticks out the momentous news that the balloting has begun no use trying to hold your breath until the first ballot is announced it takes time to obtain the votes of one thousand menespecially when neither general doby nor any one else knows who they are the only way is to march up on the stage by counties and file past the ballotbox putnam with their glittereyed duke mr bascom at their headpresumably solid for adam b hunt baron burrows who farms out the postoffice at edmundton leads edmunds county earl elisha jane consul at some hot place where he spends the inclement months drops the first ticket for haines county ostensibly solid for homemade virtue and the honourable giles  an hour and a quarter of suspense and torture passes while collars wilt and coats come off and fans in the gallery wave incessantly and excited conversation buzzes in every quarter and now see there is whispering on the stage among the bigbugs mr chairman doby rises with a paper in his hand and the buzzing dies down to silence     the honourable giles henderson of kingston has398    the honourable humphrey crewe of leith has 353    the honourable adam b hunt of edmundton has  249    and a majority being required there is no choice  are the supporters of the peoples champion crestfallen think you mr tooting is not leading them for the moment but is pressing through the crowd outside the hall and flying up the street to the pelican and the bridal suite where he is first with the news note for an unabridged biography the great man is discovered sitting quietly by the window poring over a book on the modern science of roadbuilding some notes from which he is making for his first message and instead of the reek of tobacco smoke the room is filled with the scent of the floral tributes brought down by the ladies auxiliary from leith in mr crewes righthand pocket neatly typewritten is his speech of acceptance he is never caught unprepared unkind now to remind him of that prediction made last night about the first ballot to the newspapersand useless  i told you last night they were buyin em right under our noses cried mr tooting in a paroxysm of indignation and you wouldnt believe me they got over one hundred and sixty away from us  it strikes me mr tooting said mr crewe that it was your business to prevent that  there will no doubt be a discussion when the biographer reaches this juncture concerning the congruity of reform delegates who can be bought it is too knotty a point of ethics to be dwelt upon here  prevent it echoed mr tooting and in the strong light of the righteousness of that eye reproaches failed him but theres a whole lot of em can be seen right now while the ballots are being taken it wont be decided on the next ballot  mr tooting said mr crewe indubitably proving that he had the qualities of a leaderif such proof were necessary go back to the convention i have no doubt of the outcome but that doesnt mean you are to relax your efforts do you understand  i guess i do replied mr tooting and was gone he still has his flag up he whispered into the honourable timothy watlings ear when he reached the hall hell stand a little more yet  mr tooting at times speaks a language unknown to usand the second ballot is going on and during its progress the two principal lieutenants of the peoples champion were observed going about the hall apparently exchanging the time of day with various holders of credentials mr jane too is going about the hall and postmaster burrows and postmaster bill fleeting of brampton and the honourable nat billings and messrs bascom and botcher and mr manning division superintendent and the honourable orrin young railroad commissioner and candidate for reappointmentall are embracing the opportunity to greet humble friends or to make new acquaintances another hour and a quarter with the temperature steadily rising and the carbon dioxide increasingand the second ballot is announced     the honourable giles henderson of kingston has 440    the honourable humphrey crewe of leith has 336    the honourable adam b hunt of edmundton has 255  and there are three votes besides improperly made out  what the newspapers call indescribable excitement ensues the three votes improperly made out are said to be trip passes accidentally dropped into the box by the supporters of the honourable elisha jane and add up the sum total of the votes thirtyone votes more than there are credentials in the hall mystery of mysteries how can it be the ballot announces general doby after endless rapping is a blank cheers recriminations exultation disgust of decent citizens attempts by twenty men to get the eye of the president which is too watery to see any of them and rushes for the platform to suggest remedies or ask what is going to be done about such palpable fraud what can be done call the roll how in blazes can you call the roll when you dont know whos here messrs jane botcher bascom and fleming are not disturbed and improve their time watling and tooting rush to the bridal suite and rush back again to demand justice general doby mingles his tears with theirs and somebody calls him a jellyfish he does not resent it friction makes the air hotter and hottershadrach meshach and abednego would scarce enter into this furnaceand general doby has a large damp spot on his back as he pounds and pounds and pounds until we are off again on the third ballot no dinner and threethirty pm two delegates have fainted but the essential parts of themthe credentialsare left behind  fourforty whispering again and the gavel drops     the honourable giles henderson of kingston has 412    the honourable humphrey crewe of leith has 325    the honourable adam b hunt of edmundton has 250    and there is no choice on the third ballot  thirteen delegates are actually missing this time scour the town and now even the newspaper adjectives describing the scene have given out a persistent and terrifying rumour goes the rounds wheres tom gaylord somebody said he was in the hall a moment ago on a ripton credential if so hes gone out againgone out to consult the dark horse who is in town somewhere another ominous sign mr redbrook mr widgeon of hull and the other rural delegates who have been voting for the peoples champion and who have not been observed in friendly conversation with anybody at all now have their heads together mr billings goes sauntering by but cannot hear what they are saying something must be done and right away and the knowing metropolitan reporters are winking at each other and declaring darkly that a sensation is about to turn up  where is hilary vane doesnt he realize the danger ortraitorous thoughtdoesnt he care to see his son nominated would be a singular revenge for the indignities which are said to have been heaped upon him does hilary vane the strong man of the state merely sit at the keyboard powerless while the tempest itself shakes from the organ a new and terrible music nearly six hours he has sat at the basswood table while senators congressmen feudal chiefs and even chairman doby himself flit in and out whisper in his ear set papers before him and figures and problems and telegrams from highest authority he merely nods his head says a word now and then or holds his peace does he know what hes about if they had not heard things concerning his healthand other thingsthey would still feel safe he seems the only calm man to be found in the hallbut is the calm aberration  a conference in the corner of the platform while the fourth ballot is progressing is held between senators whitredge and greene mr ridout and mr manning so far the honourable hilary has apparently done nothing but let the storm take its course a wingfooted messenger has returned who has seen mr thomas gaylord walking rapidly up maple street and austen vane most astute and reprehensible of politicians is said to be at the widow peasleys quietly awaiting the call the name of austen vaneanother messenger saysis running like wildfire through the hall from row to row mr crewe has no chanceso rumour goes a reformer to pervert the saying of a celebrated contemporary humorist must fight marquis of queensberry to win and the peoples champion it is averred has not shrewd country delegates who had listened to the champions speeches and had come to the capital prepared to vote for purity had been observing the movements since yesterday of mr tooting and mr wading with no inconsiderable interest now was the psychological moment for austen vane but who was to beard hilary  no champion was found and the empire the fate of which was in the hands of a madman was cracking let an individual of character and known antirailroad convictions such as the gentleman said to be at the widow peasleys be presented to the convention and they would nominate him were messrs bascom and botcher going to act the part of samsons were they working for revenge and a new regime mr whitredge started for the pelican not at his ordinary senatorial gait to get mr flint on the telephone  the result of the fourth ballot was announced and bedlam broke loose  the honourable giles henderson of kingston has 419 the honourable humphrey crewe of leith has 337 the honourable adam b hunt of edmundton has 256  total one thousand and eleven out of a thousand two delegates abstained from voting and proclaimed the fact but were heard only a few feet away other delegates whose flesh and blood could stand the atmosphere no longer were known to have left the hall aha the secret is out if anybody could hear it at the end of every ballot several individuals emerge and mix with the crowd in the street astute men sometimes make mistakes and the following conversation occurs between one of the individuals in question and mr crewes chauffeur     individual do you want to come in and see the convention and    vote     chauffeur i am frenchman     individual that doesnt cut any ice ill make out the ballot    and all youll have to do is to drop it in the box    chauffeur all right i vote for meester crewe  sudden disappearance of the individual  nor is this all the duke of putnam for example knows how many credentials there are in his countysay seventysix he counts the men present and voting and his result is sixtyone fifteen are absent getting food orsomething else fifteen vote over again but as the human brain is prone to error and there are men in the street the duke miscalculates the earl of haines miscalculates too resulteleven over a thousand votes and some nine hundred men in the hall  how are you going to stop it mr watling climbs up on the platform and shakes his fist in general dobys face and general doby tearfully appeals for an honest ballotto the winds  in the meantime the honourable elisha jane spurred on by desperation and thoughts of a dolce far niente gone forever has sought and cornered mr bascom  for gods sake brush cries the honourable elisha hasnt this thing gone far enough a little of it is all rightthe boys understand that but have you thought what it means to you and me if these blanked reformers get inif a feller like austen vane is nominated  that cold hard glitter which we have seen was in mr bascoms eyes  you fellers have got the colic was the remark of the archrebel do you think old hilary doesnt know what hes about  it looks that way to me said mr jane  it looks that way to doby too i guess said mr bascom with a glance of contempt at the general hes lost about fifteen pounds today did hilary send you down here he demanded  no mr jane confessed  then go back and chase yourself around the platform some more was mr bascoms unfeeling advice and dont have a fit here all the brains in this hall are in hilarys room when hes ready to talk business with me in behalf of the honourable giles henderson i guess hell do so  but fear had entered the heart of the honourable elisha and there was a sickly feeling in the region of his stomach which even the strong medicine administered by the honourable brush failed to alleviate he perceived senator whitredge returned from the pelican but the adviceif anythe president of the northeastern has given the senator is not forthcoming in practice mr flint any more than ulysses himself cannot recall the tempests when his own followers have slit the bagsand in sight of ithaca another conference at the back of the stage out of which emerges state senator nat billings and gets the ear of general doby  let em yell says mr billingsas though the general by raising one adipose hand could quell the storm eyes are straining scouts are watching at the back of the hall and in the street for the first glimpse of the dreaded figure of mr thomas gaylord let em yell counsels mr billings and if they do nominate anybody nobodyll hear em and send word to putnam county to come along on their fifth ballot  it is mr billings himself who sends word to putnam county in the name of the conventions chairman before the messenger can reach putnam county another arrives on the stage with wide pupils tom gaylord is coming this momentous news marconilike penetrates the storm and is already on the floor mr widgeon and mr redbrook are pushing their way towards the door the conference emboldened by terror marches in a body into the little room and surrounds the calmly insane lieutenantgeneral of the forces it would be illnatured to say that visions of lost railroad commissionerships lost consulships lost postmastershipsyes of lost senatorships were in these loyal heads at this crucial time  it was all very well so said the first spokesman to pluck a few feathers from a bird so bountifully endowed as the honourable adam but were not two gentlemen who should be nameless carrying the joke a little too far mr vane unquestionably realized what he was doing butwas it not almost time to call in the two gentlemen andand come to some understanding  gentlemen said the honourable hilary apparently unmoved i have not seen mr bascom or mr botcher since the sixteenth day of august and i do not intend to  some clearing of throats followed this ominous declarationand a painful silence the thing must be said and who would say it senator whitredge was the hero  mr thomas gaylord has just entered the convention hall and is said to be about to nominatea dark horse the moment was favourable the convention demoralized and at least one hundred delegates had left the hall how about the last ballot senator which showed 1011  the honourable hilary rose abruptly closed the door to shut out the noise and turned and looked mr whitredge in the eye  who is the dark horse he demanded  the members of the conference coughed again looked at each other and there was a silence for some inexplicable reason nobody cared to mention the name of austen vane  the honourable hilary pointed at the basswood table  senator he said i understand you have been telephoning mr flint have you got orders to sit down there  my dear sir said the senator you misunderstand me  have you got orders to sit down there mr vane repeated  no answered the senator mr flints confidence in you  the honourable hilary sat down again and at that instant the door was suddenly flung open by postmaster bill fleeting of brampton his genial face aflame with excitement and streaming with perspiration forgotten in this moment is senatorial courtesy and respect for the powers of the feudal system  say boys he cried putnam countys voting and theres ben no nomination and aint likely to be jim scudder the stationmaster at wye is here on credentials and he says for sure the things fizzled out and tom gaylords left the hall  again a silence save for the high hum let in through the open doorway the members of the conference stared at the honourable hilary who seemed to have forgotten their presence for he had moved his chair to the window and was gazing out over the roofs at the fastfading red in the western sky  an hour later when the room was in darkness save for the bar of light that streamed in from the platform chandelier senator whitredge entered  hilary he said  there was no answer mr whitredge felt in his pocket for a match struck it and lighted the single jet over the basswood table mr vane still sat by the window the senator turned and closed the door and read from a paper in his hand so used was he to formality that he read it formally yet with a feeling of intense relief of deference of apology  fifth ballotthe honourable giles henderson of kingston has 587 the honourable adam b hunt of edmundton has 230 the honourable humphrey crewe of leith has 154  and giles henderson is nominatedhilary  yes said mr vane  i dont think any of us werequite ourselves today it wasnt that we didnt believe in youbut we didnt have all the threads in our hands andfor reasons which i think i can understandyou didnt take us into your confidence i want to  the words died on the senators lips so absorbed had he been in his momentous news and solicitous over the result of his explanation that his eye looked outward for the first time and even then accidentally  hilary he cried for gods sake whats the matter are you sick  yes whitredge said mr vane slowly sick at heart  it was but natural that these extraordinary and incomprehensible words should have puzzled and frightened the senator more than ever  your heart he repeated  yes my heart said hilary  the senator reached for the icewater on the table  here he cried pouring out a glass its only the heatits been a hard daydrink this  but hilary did not raise his arm the door opened others coming to congratulate hilary vane on the greatest victory he had ever won offices were secure once more the feudal system intact and rebels justly punished others coming to make their peace with the commander whom senseless as they were they had dared to doubt  they crowded past each other on the threshold and stood grouped beyond the basswood table staringstaringmen suddenly come upon a tragedy instead of a feast the senator still holding the glass of water in a hand that trembled and spilled it and it was the senator after all who first recovered his presence of mind he set down the water pushed his way through the group into the hall where the tumult and the shouting die mr giles henderson escorted is timidly making his way towards the platform to read his speech of acceptance of a willing bondage when a voice rings outif there is a physician in the house will he please come forward  and then a hushand then the buzz of comment back to the little room once more where they are gathered speechless about hilary vane and the doctor comes young dr tredway of ripton who is before all others  i expected this to happen gentlemen he said and i have been here all day at the request of mr vanes son for this purpose  austen  it was hilary who spoke  i have sent for him said the doctor and now gentlemen if you will kindly  they withdrew and the doctor shut the door outside the honourable giles is telling them how seriously he regards the responsibility of the honour thrust upon him by a great party but nobody hears him in the wild rumours that fly from mouth to mouth as the hall empties rushing in against the tide outpouring tall stern vigorous is a young man whom many recognize whose name is on many lips as they make way for him who might have saved them if he would the door of the little room opens and he stands before his father looking down at him and the stern expression is gone from his face  austen said mr vane  yes judge  take me away from here take me homenowtonight  austen glanced at dr tredway  it is best said the doctor we will take him hometonight     chapter xxviii the voice of an era  they took him home in the stateroom of the sleeper attached to the night express from the south although mr flint by telephone had put a special train at his disposal the long service of hilary vane was over he had won his last fight for the man he had chosen to call his master and those who had fought behind him whose places whose very luminary existences had depended on his skill knew that the end had come nay were already speculating manoeuvring and taking sides who would be the new captaingeneral who would be strong enough to suppress the straining ambitions of the many that the empire might continue to flourish in its integrity and gather tribute it is the worldold cry around the palace walls long live the new rulerif you can find him among the curdling factions  they carried hilary home that september night when sawanec was like a gray ghostmountain facing the waning moon back to the home of those strange renaissance austens which he had reclaimed for a grim puritanism and laid him in the carved and canopied bedstead channing austen had brought from spain euphrasia had met them at the door but a trained nurse from the ripton hospital was likewise in waiting and a new york specialist had been summoned to prolong if possible the life of one from whom all desire for life had passed  before sunrise a wind came from the northern spruces the dawn was cloudless fiery red and the air had an autumn sharpness at ten oclock dr harmon arrived was met at the station by austen and spent half an hour with dr tredway at noon the examination was complete thanks to generations of selfdenial by the vanes of camden street mr hilary vane might live indefinitely might even recover partially but at present he was condemned to remain with his memories in the great canopied bed  the honourable hilary had had another caller that morning besides dr harmonno less a personage than the president of the northeastern railroads himself who had driven down from fairview immediately after breakfast austen having gone to the station dr tredway had received mr flint in the darkened hall and had promised to telephone to fairview the verdict of the specialist at present dr tredway did not think it wise to inform hilary of mr flints visitnot at least until after the examination  mr vane exhibited the same silent stoicism on receiving the verdict of dr harmon as he had shown from the first with the clew to hilarys life which dr tredway had given him the new york physician understood the case one common enough in his practice in a great city where the fittest survivesometimes only to succumb to unexpected and irreparable blows in the evening of life  on his return from seeing dr harmon off austen was met on the porch by dr tredway  your father has something on his mind said the doctor and perhaps it is just as well that he should be relieved he is asking for you and i merely wished to advise you to make the conversation as short as possible  austen climbed the stairs in obedience to this summons and stood before his father at the bedside hilary lay back among the pillows and the brightness of that autumn noonday only served to accentuate the pallor of his face the ravages of age which had come with such incredible swiftness and the outline of a once vigorous frame the eyes alone shone with a strange new light and austen found it unexpectedly difficult to speak he sat down on the bed and laid his hand on the helpless one that rested on the coverlet  austen said mr vane i want you to go to fairview  his sons hand tightened over his own  yes judge  i want you to go now  yes judge  you know the combination of my safe at the office its never been changed sincesince you were there open it you will find two tin boxes containing papers labelled augustus p flint i want you to take them to fairview and put them into the hands of mr flint himself ii cannot trust any one else i promised to take them myself butflint will understand  ill go right away said austen rising and trying to speak cheerfully mr flint was here early this morninginquiring for you  hilary vanes lips trembled and another expression came into his eyes  rode down to look at the scrapheapdid he  austen strove to conceal his surprise at his fathers words and change of manner  tredway saw him he said im pretty sure mr flint doesnt feel that way judge he has taken your illness very much to heart i know and he left some fruit and flowers for you  i guess his daughter sent those said hilary  his daughter austen repeated  if i didnt think so mr vane continued id send em back i never knew what she was until she picked me up and drove me down here ive always done victoria an injustice  austen walked to the door and turned slowly  ill go at once judge he said  in the kitchen he was confronted by euphrasia  when is that woman going away she demanded ive took care of hilary vane nigh on to forty years and i guess i know as much about nursing and more about hilary than that young thing with her cap and apron i told dr tredway so she even came down here to let me know what to cook for him and i sent her about her business  austen smiled it was the first sign since his return the night before euphrasia had given that an affection for hilary vane lurked beneath the nature  she wont stay long phrasie he answered and added mischievously for a very good reason  and whats that asked euphrasia  because you wont allow her to i have a notion that shell pack up and leave in about three days and that all the doctors in ripton couldnt keep her here  get along with you said euphrasia who could not for the life of her help looking a little pleased  im going off for a few hours he said more seriously dr tredway tells me they do not look for any developmentsfor the worse  where are you going asked euphrasia sharply  to fairview he said  euphrasia moved the kettle to another part of the stove  youll see her she said  who austen asked but his voice must have betrayed him a little for euphrasia turned and seized him by the elbows and looked up into his face  victoria she said  he felt himself tremble at the nameat the strangeness of its sound on euphrasias lips  i do not expect to see miss flint he answered controlling himself as well as he was able i have an errand for the judge with mr flint himself  euphrasia had guessed his secret but how  hadnt you better see her said euphrasia in a curious monotone  but i have no errand with her he objected mystified yet excited by euphrasias manner  she fetched hilary home said euphrasia  yes  she couldnt have ben kinder if she was his own daughter  i know he began but euphrasia interrupted  she sent that englishman for the doctor and waited to take the news to her father and she came out in this kitchen and talked to me  austen started euphrasia was not looking at him now and suddenly she dropped his arms and went to the window overlooking the garden  she wouldnt go in the parlour but come right out here in her fine clothes i told her i didnt think she belonged in a kitchenbut i guess i did her an injustice said euphrasia slowly  i think you did he said and wondered  she looked at that garden euphrasia went on and cried out i didnt callate she was like that and the first thing i knew i was talking about your mother and id forgot who i was talking to she wahnt like a strangerit was just as if id known her always i havent understood it yet and after a while i told her about that verse and she wanted to see itthe verse about the skylark you know  yes said austen  well the way she read it made me cry it brought back sarah austen so somehow i cant account for it she puts me in mind of your mother  austen did not speak  in more ways than one said euphrasia i didnt look to find her so naturaland so gentle and their she has a way of scolding you just as sarah austen had that youd never suspect  did she scold youphrasie asked austen and the irresistible humour that is so near to sorrow made him smile again  indeed she did and it surprised me somecoming right out of a summer sky i told her what i thought about hilary and how hed driven you out of your own mothers house she said youd ought to be sent for and i said you oughtnt to set foot in this house until hilary sent for you she said id no right to take such a revengethat youd come right away if you knew hilaryd had a stroke and that hilaryd never send for youbecause he couldnt she said he was like a man on a desert island  she was right answered austen  i dont know about that said euphrasia she hadnt put up with hilary for forty years as i had and seen what hed done to your mother and you but thats what she said and she went for you herself when she found the doctor couldnt go austen aint you going to see her  austen shook his head gently and smiled at her  im afraid its no use phrasie he said just because she has beenkind we mustnt be deceived its h er nature to be kind  euphrasia crossed the room swiftly and seized his arm again  she loves you austen she cried she loves you do you think that id love her that id plead for her if she didnt  austens breath came deeply he disengaged himself and went to the window  no he said you dont know you cantknow i have only seen hera few times she lives a different lifeand with other people she will marry a man who can give her more  do you think i could be deceived exclaimed euphrasia almost fiercely its as true as the sun shining on that mountain you believe she loves the englishman but i tell you she loves youyou  he turned towards her  how do you know he asked as though he were merely curious  because im a woman and shes a woman said euphrasia oh she didnt confess it if she had i shouldnt think so much of her but she told me as plain as though she had spoken it in words before she left this room  austen shook his head again  phrasie he said im afraid youve been building castles in spain and he went out and across to the stable to harness pepper  austen did not believe euphrasia on that eventful evening when victoria had called at jabe jenneys the worlds aspect had suddenly changed for him old values had fadedvalues which after all had been but tints and glowsand sterner but truer colours took their places he saw victorias life in a new perspectiveone in which his was but a small place in the background of her numerous beneficences which was after all the perspective in which he had first viewed it but by degrees the hope that she loved him had grown and grown until it had become unconsciously the supreme element of his existencethe hope that stole sweetly into his mind with the morning light and stayed him through the day and blended into the dreams of darkness  by inheritance by tradition by habits of thought austen vane was an americanan american as differentiated from the citizen of any other nation upon the earth the french have an expressive phrase in speaking of a person as belonging to this or that world meaning the circle by which the life of an individual is bounded the true american recognizes these circlesbut with complacency and with a sure knowledge of his destiny eventually to find himself within the one for which he is best fitted by his talents and his tastes the mere fact that victoria had been brought up amongst people with whom he had nothing in common would not have deterred austen vane from pressing his suit considerations of honour had stood in the way and hope had begun to whisper that these might in the end be surmounted once they had disappeared and she loved him that were excuse and reason enough  and suddenly the sight of victoria with a probable suitorwho at once had become magnified into an accepted suitorhad dispelled hope euphrasia euphrasia had been deceived as he had by a loving kindness and a charity that were natural but what so natural to one who had lived the life of austen vane as that she should marry amongst those whose ways of life were her ways in the brief time in which he had seen her and this other man austens quickened perceptions had detected tacit understanding community of interest a habit of thought and mannerin short a common language unknown to him between the two and more than these the victoria of the blissful excursions he had known was changed as she had spoken to himconstrained distant apart although still dispensing kindness going out of her way to bring hilary home and to tell him of hilarys accident rumour which cannot be confined in casks or bottles had since informed austen vane that mr rangely had spent the day with victoria and had remained at fairview far into the evening rumour went farther thanks to mrs pomfret and declared the engagement already an accomplished fact and to austen in the twilight in front of jabe jenneys the affair might well have assumed the proportions of an intimacy of long standing rather than that of the chance acquaintance of an hour friends in common modes of life in common and incidents in common are apt to sweep away preliminaries  such were austens thoughts as he drove to fairview that september afternoon when the leaves were turning their white backs to the northwest breeze the sun was still high and the distant hills and mountains were as yet scarce stained with blue and stood out in startling clearness against the sky would he see her that were a pain he scarce dared contemplate  he reached the arched entrance was on the drive here was the path again by which she had come down the hillside here was the very stone on which she had stoodawaiting him why why had she done that wellremembered figure amidst the yellow leaves dancing in the sunlight here he had stopped perforce and here he had looked up into his face and smiled and spoken  at length he gained the plateau across which the driveway ran between round young maples straight to fairview house and he remembered the stares from the teatables and how she had come out to his rescue now the lawn was deserted save for a gardener among the shrubs he rang the stablebell and as he waited for an answer to his summons the sense of his remoteness from these surroundings of hers deepened and with a touch of inevitable humour he recalled the lowceiled bedroom at mr jenneys and the kitchen in hanover street the annual cost of the care of that lawn and driveway might well have maintained one of these households  he told the stableboy to wait it is to be remarked as curious that the name of the owner of the house on austens lips brought the first thought of him to austens mind he was going to see and speak with mr flint a man who had been his enemy ever since the day he had come here and laid down his pass on the presidents desk the man whoso he believed until three days agohad stood between him and happiness well it did not matter now  austen followed the silentmoving servant through the hall those were the stairs which knew her feet these the roomsso subtly flowerscentedshe lived in then came the narrow passage to the sterner apartment of the master himself mr flint was alone and seated upright behind the massive oak desk from which bulwark the president of the northeastern was wont to meet his opponents and his enemies and few visitors came into his presence here or elsewhere who were not to be got the better of if possible a lifelong habit had accustomed mr flint to treat all men as adversaries until they were proved otherwise his square closecropped head his large features his alert eyes were those of a fighter  he did not rise but nodded suddenly austen was enveloped in a flame of wrath that rose without warning and blinded him and it was with a supreme effort to control himself that he stopped in the doorway he was frightened for he had felt this before and he knew it for the anger that demands physical violence  come in mr vane said the president  austen advanced to the desk and laid the boxes before mr flint  mr vane told me to say that he would have brought these himself had it been possible here is the list and i shall be much obliged if you will verify it before i go back  sit down said mr flint  austen sat down with the corner of the desk between them while mr flint opened the boxes and began checking off the papers on the list  how is your father this afternoon he asked without looking up  as well as can be expected said austen  of course nobody knew his condition but himself mr flint continued but it was a great shock to mewhen he resigned as my counsel three days ago  austen laid his forearm on the desk and his hand closed  he resigned three days ago he exclaimed  mr flint was surprised but concealed it  i can understand under the circumstances how he has overlooked telling you his resignation takes effect today  austen was silent a moment while he strove to apply this fact to his fathers actions  he waited until after the convention  exactly said mr flint catching the implied accusation in austens tone and needless to say if i had been able to prevent his going in view of what happened on monday night i should have done so as you know after hisaccident he went to the capital without informing any one  as a matter of honour said austen  mr flint looked up from the papers and regarded him narrowly for the tone in which this was spoken did not escape the president of the northeastern he saw in fact that at the outset he had put a weapon into austens hands hilarys resignation was a vindication of austens attitude an acknowledgment that the business and political practices of his life had been wrong  what austen really felt when he had grasped the significance of that fact was reliefgratitude a wave of renewed affection for his father swept over him of affection and pity and admiration and for the instant he forgot mr flint  as a matter of honour mr flint repeated knowing he was ill mr vane insisted upon going to that convention even at the risk of his life it is a fitting close to a splendid career and one that will not soon be forgotten  austen merely looked at mr flint who may have found the glance a trifle disconcerting for he turned to the papers again  i repeat he went on presently that this illness of mr vanes is not only a great loss to the northeastern system but a great blow to me personally i have been associated with him closely for more than a quarter of a century and i have never seen a lawyer of greater integrity clearheadedness and sanity of view he saw things as they were and he did as much to build up the business interests and the prosperity of this state as any man i know of he was true to his word and true to his friends  still austen did not reply he continued to look at mr flint and mr flint continued to check the papers only more slowly he had nearly finished the first box  a wave of political insanity to put it mildly seems to be sweeping over this country said the president of the northeastern men who would paralyze and destroy the initiative of private enterprise men who themselves are ambitious and either incapable or unsuccessful have sprung up writers who have no conscience whose one idea is to make money out of a passing craze against honest capital have aided them disappointed and dangerous politicians who merely desire office and power have lifted their voices in the hue and cry to fool the honest voter i am glad to say i believe that the worst of this madness and rascality is over that the common sense of the people of this country is too great to be swept away by the methods of these selfseekers that the ordinary man is beginning to see that his bread and butter depends on the brain of the officers who are trying honestly to conduct great enterprises for the benefit of the average citizen  we did not expect to escape in this state mr flint went on raising his head and meeting austens look the disease was too prevalent and too catching for the weakminded we had our selfseekers who attempted to bring ruin upon an institution which has done more for our population than any other i do not hesitate to speak of the northeastern railroads as an institution and as an institution which has been as conscientiously and conservatively conducted as any in the country and with as scrupulous a regard for the welfare of all hilary vane as you doubtless know was largely responsible for this my attention as president of all the roads has been divided hilary vane guarded the interests in this state and no man could have guarded them better he well deserves the thanks of future generations for the uncompromising fight he made against such men and such methods it has broken him down at a time of life when he has earned repose but he has the satisfaction of knowing that he has won the battle for conservative american principles and that he has nominated a governor worthy of the traditions of the state  and mr flint started checking off the papers again had the occasion been less serious austen could have smiled at mr flints ruseso characteristic of the tactics of the president of the northeasternof putting him into a position where criticism of the northeastern and its practices would be criticism of his own father as it was he only set his jaw more firmly an expression indicative of contempt for such tactics he had not come there to be lectured out of the book of arguments on the divine right of railroads to govern but to see that certain papers were delivered in safety  had his purpose been deliberately to enter into a contest with mr flint austen could not have planned the early part of it any better than by pursuing this policy of silence to a man of mr flints temperament and training it was impossible to have such an opponent within reach without attempting to hector him into an acknowledgment of the weakness of his position further than this austen had touched him too often on the quick merely to be considered in the light of a young man who held opposite and unfortunate viewsalthough it was mr flints endeavour to put him in this light the list of injuries was too fresh in mr flints mindeven that last conversation with victoria in which she had made it plain that her sympathies were with austen  but with an opponent who would not be led into ambush who had the strength to hold his fire under provocation it was no easy matter to maintain a height of conscious matteroffact rectitude and implied reproof austens silence austens attitude declared louder than words the contempt for such manoeuvres of a man who knows he is in the rightand knows that his adversary knows it it was this silence and this attitude which proclaimed itself that angered mr flint yet made him warily conceal his anger and change his attack  it is some years since we met mr vane he remarked presently  austens face relaxed into something of a smile  four i think he answered  you hadnt long been back from that western experience well your father has one decided consolation you have fulfilled his hope that you would settle down here and practise in the state and i hear that you are fast forging to the front you are counsel for the gaylord company i believe  the result of an unfortunate accident said austen mr hammer died  and on the occasion when you did me the honour to call on me said mr flint if i remember rightly you expressed some rather radical viewsfor the son of hilary vane  for the son of hilary vane austen agreed with a smile  mr flint ignored the implication in the repetition  thinking as mach as i do of mr vane i confess that your views at that time rather disturbed me it is a matter of relief to learn that you have refused to lend yourself to the schemes of men like our neighbour mr humphrey crewe of leith  honesty compels me to admit answered austen that i did not refrain on mr crewes account  although said mr flint drumming on the table there was some talk that you were to be brought forward as a dark horse in the convention and as a candidate unfriendly to the interests of the northeastern railroads i am glad you did not consent to be put in any such position i perceive that a young man of your ability andpopularity a vane of camden street must inevitably become a force in this state and as a force you must retain the conservatism of the vanesthe traditional conservatism of the state the northeastern railroads will continue to be a very large factor in the life of the people after you and i are gone mr vane you will have to live as it were with that corporation and help to preserve it we shall have to work together perhaps to that endwho can say i repeat i am glad that your good sense led you to refrain from coming as a candidate before that convention there is time enough in the future and you could not have been nominated  on the contrary answered austen quietly i could have been nominated  mr flint smiled knowinglybut with an effort what a relief it would have been to him to charge horse and foot to forget that he was a railroad president dealing with a potential power  do you honestly believe that he asked  i am not accustomed to dissemble my beliefs said austen gravely the fact that my father had faith enough in me to count with certainty on my refusal to go before the convention enabled him to win the nomination for the candidate of your railroads  mr flint continued to smile but into his eyes had crept a gleam of anger  it is easy to say such thingsafter the convention he remarked  and it would have been impossible to say their before austen responded instantly with a light in his own eyes my nomination was the only disturbing factor in the situation for you and the politicians who had your interests in hand and it was as inevitable as night and day that the forces of the candidates who represented the two wings of the machine of the northeastern railroads should have united against mr crewe i want to say to you frankly that if my father had not been the counsel for your corporation and responsible for its political success or if he could have resigned with honour before the convention i should not have refused to let my name go in after all he added in a lower tone and with a slight gesture characteristic of him when a subject was distasteful it doesnt matter who is elected governor this autumn  what cried mr flint surprised out of his attitude as much by austens manner as by austens words  it doesnt matter said austen whether the northeastern railroads have succeeded this time in nominating and electing a governor to whom they can dictate and who will reappoint railroad commissioners and other state officials in their interests the practices by which you have controlled this state mr flint and elected governors and councillors and state and national senators are doomed however necessary these practices may have been from your point of view they violated every principle of free government and were they to continue the nation to which we belong would inevitably decay and become the scorn of the world those practices depended for their success on one conditionwhich in itself is the most serious of ills in a republicthe ignorance and disregard of the voter you have but to read the signs of the times to see clearly that the day of such conditions is past to see that the citizens of this state and this country are thinking for themselves as they should are alive to the dangers and determined to avert it you may succeed in electing one more governor and one more senate or two before the people are able to destroy the machinery you have built up and repeal the laws you have made to sustain it i repeat it doesnt matter in the long run the era of political domination by a corporation and mainly for the benefit of a corporation is over  mr flint had been drumming on the desk his face growing a darker red as austen proceeded never since he had become president of the northeastern railroads had any man said such things to his face and the fact that austen vane had seemingly not spoken in wrath although forcefully enough to compel him to listen had increased mr flints anger austen apparently cared very little for him or his opinions in comparison with his own estimate of right and wrong  it seems said mr flint that you have grown more radical since your last visit  if it be radical to refuse to accept a pass from a railroad to bind my liberty of action as an attorney and a citizen then i am radical replied austen if it be radical to maintain that the elected representatives of the people should not receive passes or be beholden to any man or any corporation i acknowledge the term if it be radical to declare that these representatives should be elected without interference and while in office should do exact justice to the body of citizens on the one hand and the corporations on the other i declare myself a radical but my radicalism goes back behind the establishment of railroads mr flint back to the foundation of this government to the idea from which it sprang  mr flint smiled again  we have changed materially since then he said i am afraid such a utopian state of affairs beautiful as it is will not work in the twentieth century it is a commercial age and the interests which are the bulwark of the countrys strength must be protected  yes said austen we have changed materially the mistake you make and men like you is the stress which you lay on that word material are there no such things as moral interests mr flint and are they not quite as important in government if not more important than material interests surely we cannot have commercial and political stability without cominertial and political honour if as a nation we lose sight of the ideals which have carried us so far which have so greatly modified the conditions of other peoples than ourselves we shall perish as a force in the world and if this government proves a failure how long do you think the material interests of which you are so solicitous will endure or do you care whether they endure beyond your lifetime perhaps not but it is a matter of importance not only to the nation but to the world whether or not the moral idea of the united states of america is perpetuated i assure you  i begin to fear mr vane said the president of the northeastern that you have missed your vocation suppose i were to grant you for the sake of argument that the northeastern railroads being the largest taxpayers in this state have taken an interest in seeing that conservative men fill responsible offices suppose such to be the case and we abruptly ceaseto take such an interest what then are we not at the mercy of any and all unscrupulous men who build up a power of their own and start again the blackmail of the old days  you have put the case mildly said austen and ingeniously as a matter of fact mr flint you know as well as i do that for years you have governed this state absolutely for the purpose of keeping down your taxes avoiding unnecessary improvements for safety and comfort and paying high dividends  perhaps you realize that in depicting these criminal operations so graphically cried mr flint interrupting you are involving the reputation of one of the best citizens the state ever hadyour own father  austen vane leaned forward across the desk and even mr flint if the truth were known recoiled a little before the anger he had aroused it shot forth from austens eyes proclaimed itself in the squareness of the face and vibrated in every word he spoke  mr flint he said i refrain from comment upon your methods of argument there were many years in which my father believed the practices which he followed in behalf of your railroad to be necessaryand hence justified and i have given you the credit of holding the same belief public opinion would not perhaps at that time have protected your property from political blackmail i merely wished you to know mr flint that there is no use in attempting to deceive me in regard to the true colour of those practices it is perhaps useless for me to add that in my opinion you understand as well as i do the real reason for mr vanes resignation and illness once he became convinced that the practices were wrong he could no longer continue them without violating his conscience he kept his word to youat the risk of his life and as his son i take a greater pride in him today than i ever have before  austen got to his feet he was formidable even to mr flint who had met many formidable and angry men in his timealthough not of this type perhapswho can sayhe was the in the mind of the president unconscious embodiment of the northeastern of the new forces which had arisen against himforces which he knew in his secret soul he could not combat because they were the irresistible forces of things not material all his life he had met and successfully conquered forces of another kind and put down with a strong hand merely physical encroachments  mr flints nature was not an introspective one and if he had tried he could not have accounted for his feelings he was angrythat was certain but he measured the six feet and more of austen vane with his eye and in spite of himself experienced the compelled admiration of one fighting man for another a thought which had made itself vaguely felt at intervals in the past half hour shot suddenly and poignantly through mr flints mind what if this young man who dared in spite of every interest to oppose him should in the apparently inevitable trend of things become  mr flint rose and went to the window where he stood silent for a space looking out played upon by unwonted conflicting thoughts and emotions at length with a characteristic snap of the fingers he turned abruptly austen vane was still standing beside the desk his face was still square determined but mr flint noted curiously that the anger was gone from his eyes and that anotheralthough equally humanexpression had taken its placea more disturbing expression to mr flint  it appears mr vane he said gathering up the papers and placing them in the boxes it appears that we are able to agree upon one point at leasthilary vane  mr flint said austen i did not come up here with any thought of arguing with you of intruding any ideasi may hold but you have yourself asked me one question which i feel bound to answer to the best of my ability before i go you have asked me what in my opinion would happen if you ceasedas you express itto take an interest in the political affairs of this state  i believe as firmly as i stand here that the public opinion which exists today would protect your property and i base that belief on the good sense of the average american voter the public would protect you not only in its own interests but from an inherent sense of fair play on the other hand if you persist in a course of political manipulation which is not only obsolete but wrong you will magnify the just charges against you and the just wrath you will put ammunition into the hands of the agitators you rightly condemn the stockholders of your corporation perhaps are bound to suffer some from the fact that you have taken its lifeblood to pay dividends and the public will demand that it be built up into a normal and healthy condition on the other hand it could not have gone on as it was but the corporation will suffer much more if a delayed justice is turned into vengeance  you ask me what i could do i should recognize frankly the new conditions and declare as frankly what the old ones were and why such methods of defence as you adopted were necessary and justified i should announce openly that from this day onward the northeastern railroads depended for fair play on an enlightened publicand i think your trust would be well founded and your course vindicated i should declare from this day onward that the issue of political passes newspaper passes and all other subterfuges would be stopped and that all political hirelings would be dismissed i should appeal to the people of this state to raise up political leaders who would say to the corporations we will protect you from injustice if you will come before the elected representatives of the people openly and say what you want and why you want it by such a course you would have in a day the affection of the people instead of their distrust they would rally to your defence and more than that you would have done a service for american government the value of which cannot well be estimated  mr flint rang the bell on his desk and his secretary appeared  put these in my private safe mr freeman he said  mr freeman took the boxes glanced curiously at austen and went out it was the same secretary austen recalled who had congratulated him four years before then mr flint laid his hand deliberately on the desk and smiled slightly as he turned to austen  if you had run a railroad as long as i have mr vane he said i do you the credit of thinking that you would have intelligence enough to grasp other factors which your present opportunities for observation have not permitted you to perceive nevertheless i am much obliged to you for your opinion and i value thefrankness in which it was given and i shall hope to hear good news of your father remember me to him and tell him how deeply i feel his affliction i shall call again in a day or two  austen took up his hat  good day mr flint he said i will tell him  by the time he had reached the door mr flint had gone back to the window once more and appeared to have forgotten his presence     chapter xxix the vale of the blue  austen himself could not well have defined his mental state as he made his way through the big rooms towards the door but he was aware of one main desireto escape from fairview with the odours of the flowers in the tall silver vases on the pianoher pianothe spirit of desire which had so long possessed him waking and sleeping returnedreturned to torture him now with greater skill amidst these her possessions her volume of chopin on the rack bound in red leather and stamped with her initials which compelled his glance as he passed and brought vivid to his memory the night he had stood in the snow and heard her playing so he told himself it must always be for him to stand in the snow listening  he reached the hall with a vast relief perceived that it was empty and opened the door and went out strange that he should note first of all as he parsed a moment at the top of the steps that the very day had changed the wind had fallen the sun well on his course towards the rim of western hills poured the golden light of autumn over field and forest while sawanec was already in the blue shadow the expectant stillness of autumn reigned and all unconsciously austens blood was quickened though a quickening of pain  the surprise of the instant over he noticed that his horse was gonehad evidently been taken to the stables and rather than ring the bell and wait in the mood in which he found himself he took the path through the shrubbery from which he had seen the groom emerge  it turned beyond the corner of the house descended a flight of stone steps and turned again  they stood gazing each at the other for a space of time not to be computed before either spoke and the sense of unreality which comes with a sudden fulfilment of intense desireor dreadwas upon austen could this indeed be her figure and this her face on which he watched the colour rise so he remembered afterwards like the slow flood of day were there so many victorias that a new oneand a strange oneshould confront him at every meeting and even while he looked this victoria tooone who had been near him and departedwas surveying him now from an unapproachable height of selfpossession and calm she held out her hand and he took it scarce knowingthat it was hers  how do you do mr vane she said i did not expect to meet you here  i was searching for the stable to get my horse he answered lamely  and your father she asked quickly i hope he is notworse  it was thus she supplied him quite naturally with an excuse for being at fairview and yet her solicitude for hilary was wholly unaffected  dr harmon who came from new york has been more encouraging than i had dared to hope said austen and by the way mr vane believes that you had a share in the fruit and flowers which mr flint so kindly brought ifhe had known that i were to see you i am sure he would have wished me to thank you  victoria turned and tore a leaf from the spiraea  i will show you where the stables are she said the path divides a little farther onand you might find yourself in the kitchen  austen smiled and as she went on slowly he followed her the path not being wide enough for them to walk abreast his eyes caressing the stray hairs that clustered about her neck and caught the light it seemed so real and yet so unrealizable that he should be here with her  i am afraid he said that i did not express my gratitude as i should have done the evening you were good enough to come up to jabe jenneys  he saw her colour rise again but she did not pause  please dont say anything about it mr vane of course i understand how you felt she cried  neither my father nor myself will forget that service said austen  it was nothing answered victoria in a low voice or rather it was something i shall always be glad that i did not miss i have seen mr vane all my life but i nevernever really knew him until that day i have come to the conclusion she added in a lighter tone that the young are not always the best judges of the old there she added is the path that goes to the kitchen which you probably would have taken  he laughed past and future were blotted out and he lived only in the present he could think of nothing but that she was here beside him afterwards cataclysms might come and welcome  isnt there another place he asked where i might lose my way  she turned and gave him one of the swift searching looks he recalled so well a look the meaning of which he could not declare save that she seemed vainly striving to fathom something in himas though he were not fathomable he thought she smiled a little as she took the lefthand path  you will remember me to your father she said i hope he is not suffering  he is not suffering austen replied perhapsif it were not too much to askperhaps you might come to see him sometime i can think of nothing that would give him greater pleasure  i will comesometime she answered i am going away tomorrow but  away he repeated in dismay now that he was beside her all unconsciously the dominating male spirit which was so strong in him and which moves not woman alone but the world was asserting itself for the moment he was the only man and she the only woman in the universe  i am going on a promised visit to a friend of mine  for how long he demanded  i dont know said victoria calmly probably until she gets tired of me and there she added are the stables where no doubt you will find your faithful pepper  they had come out upon an elevation above the hard service drive and across it below them was the coach house with its clocktower and weathervane and its two wings enclosing a paved court where a whistling stableboy was washing a carriage austen regarded this scene an instant and glanced back at her profile it was expressionless  might i not lingera few minutes he asked  her lips parted slightly in a smile and she turned her head how wonderfully he thought it was poised upon her shoulders  i havent been very hospitable have i she said but then you seemed in such a hurry to go didnt you you were walking so fast when i met you that you quite frightened me  was i asked austen in surprise  she laughed  you looked as if you were ready to charge somebody but this isnt a very nice placeto linger and if you really will stay awhile said victoria we might walk over to the dairy where that model protege of yours eben fitch whom you once threatened with corporal chastisement if he fell from grace is engaged i know he will be glad to see you  austen laughed as he caught up with her she was already halfway across the road  do you always beat people if they do wrong she asked  it was eben who requested it if i remember rightly he said fortunately the trial has not yet arrived your methods he added seem to be more successful with eben  they went down the grassy slope with its groups of halfgrown trees through an orchard shot with slanting yellow sunlightthe golden fruit harvested by the morning winds littering the ground and then by a gate into a dimpled emerald pasture slope where the guernseys were feeding along a water run they spoke of trivial things that found no place in austens memory and at times upon one pretext or another he fell behind a little that he might feast his eyes upon her  eben was not at the dairy and austen betraying no undue curiosity as to his whereabouts they walked on up the slopes and still upward towards the crest of the range of hills that marked the course of the blue he did not allow his mind to dwell upon this new footing they were on but clung to it before in those delicious moments with her seemingly pilfered from the angry gods the sense of intimacy had been deep deep because robbing the gods together they had shared the feeling of guilt had known that retribution would coma and now the gods had locked their treasurechest although themselves powerless to redeem from him the memory of what he had gained nor could they apparently deprive him of the vision of her in the fields and woods beside him though transformed by their magic into a new victoria keeping him lightly and easily at a distance  scattering the sheep that flecked the velvet turf of the uplands they stood at length on the granite crown of the crest itself far below them wound the blue into its vale of sapphire shadows with its hillsides of the mystic fabric of the backgrounds of the masters of the renaissance for a while they stood in silence under the spell of the scenes enchantment and then victoria seated herself on the rock and he dropped to a place at her side  i thought you would like the view she said but perhaps you have been here perhaps i am taking you to one of your own possessions  he had flung his hat upon the rock and she glanced at his serious sunburned face his eyes were still fixed contemplatively on the yale of the blue but he turned to her with a smile  it has become yours by right of conquest he answered  she did not reply to that the immobility of her face save for the one look she had flashed upon him surprised and puzzled him more and morethe worldold indefinable eternal feminine quality of the spring  so you refused to be governor she said presentlysurprising him again  it scarcely came to that he replied  what did it come to she demanded  he hesitated  i had to go down to the capital on my fathers account but i did not go to the convention i stayed he said slowly at the little cottage across from the duncan house whereyou were last winter he paused but she gave no sign tom gaylord came up there late in the afternoon and wanted me to be a candidate  and you refused  yes  but you could have been nominated  yes he admitted it is probable the conditions were chaotic  are you sure you have done right she asked it has always seemed to me from what i know and have heard of you that you were made for positions of trust you would have been a better governor than the man they have nominated  his expression became set  i am sure i have done right he answered deliberately it doesnt make any difference who is governor this time  doesnt make any difference she exclaimed  no he said things have changedthe people have changed the old method of politics which was wrong although it had some justification in conditions has gone out a new and more desirable state of affairs has come i am at liberty to say this much to you now he added fixing his glance upon her because my father has resigned as counsel for the northeastern and i have just had a talk withmr flint  you have seen my father she asked in a low voice and her face was averted  yes he answered  youdid not agree she said quickly  his blood beat higher at the question and the manner of her asking it but he felt that he must answer it honestly unequivocally whatever the cost  no we did not agree it is only fair to tell you that we differedvitally on the other hand it is just that you should know that we did not part in anger but i think with a mutual respect  she drew breath  i knew she said i knew if he could but talk to you he would understand that you were sincereand you have proved it i am gladi am glad that you saw him the quality of the sunlight changed the very hills leaped and the river sparkled could she care why did she wish her father to know that he was sincere  you are glad that i saw him he repeated  but she met his glance steadily  my father has so little faith in human nature she answered he has a faculty of doubting the honesty of his opponentsi suppose because so many of them have been dishonest andi believe in my friends she added smiling isnt it natural that i should wish to have my judgment vindicated  he got to his feet and walked slowly to the far edge of the rock where he stood for a while seemingly gazing off across the spaces to sawanec it was like him thus to question the immutable victoria sat motionless but her eyes followed irresistibly the lines of power in the tall figure against the skythe breadth of shoulder and slimness of hip and length of limb typical of the men who had conquered and held this land for their descendants suddenly with a characteristic movement of determination he swung about and came towards her and at the same instant she rose  dont you think we should be going back she said  rut he seemed not to hear her  may i ask you something he said  that depends she answered  are you going to marry mr rangely  no she said and turned away why did you think that  he quivered  victoria  she looked up at him swiftly half revealed her eyes like stars surprised by the flush of dawn in her cheeks hope quickened at the vision of hope the seats of judgment themselves were filled with radiance and rumour cowered and fled like the spirit of night he could only gaze enraptured  yes she answered  his voice was firm but low yet vibrant with sincerity with the vast store of feeling of compelling magnetism that was in the man and moved in spite of themselves those who knew him his words victoria remembered afterwardsall of them but it was to the call of the voice she responded his was the fibre which grows stronger in times of crisis sure of himself proud of the love which he declared he spoke as a man who has earned that for which he prayssimply and with dignity  i love you he said i have known it since i have known you but you must see why i could not tell you so it was very hard for there were times when i led myself to believe that you might come to love me there were times when i should have gone away if i hadnt made a promise to stay in ripton i ask you to marry me because iknow that i shall love you as long as i live i can give you this at least and i can promise to protect and cherish you i cannot give you that to which you have been accustomed all your life that which you have here at fairview but i shouldnt say this to you if i believed that you cared for them aboveother things  oh austen she cried i do notido not they would be hateful to mewithout you i would rather live with youat jabe jenneys and her voice caught in an exquisite note between laughter and tears i love you do you understand you oh how could you ever have doubted it how could you what you believe i believe and austen i have been so unhappy for three days  he never knew whether as the most precious of graces ever conferred upon man with a womanly gesture she had raised her arms and laid her hands upon his shoulders before he drew her to him and kissed her face that vied in colour with the coming glow in the western sky above the prying eyes of men above the world itself he held her striving to realize some little of the vast joy of this possession and failing and at last she drew away from him gently that she might look searchingly into his face again and shook her head slowly  and you were going away she said without a word i thoughtyou didnt care how could i have known that you were juststupid  his eyes lighted with humour and tenderness  how long have you cared victoria he asked  she became thoughtful  always i think she answered only i didnt know it i think i loved you even before i saw you  before you saw me  i think it began said victoria when i learned that you had shot mr blodgettonly i hope you will never do such a thing again and you will please try to remember she added after a moment that i am neither eben fitch nor your friend tom gaylord  sunset found them seated on the rock with the waters of the river turned to wine at the miracle in the sky their miracle at times their eyes wandered to the mountain which seemed to regard them from a discreet distancewith a kindly and protecting majesty  and you promised said victoria to take me up there when will you do it  i thought you were going away he replied  unforeseen circumstances she answered have compelled me to change my plans  then we will go tomorrow he said  to the delectable land said victoria dreamily your land where we shall bebenevolent despots austen  yes he had not ceased to thrill at the sound of his name upon her lips  do you think she asked glancing at him do you think you have money enough to go abroadjust for a little while  he laughed joyously  i dont know he said but i shall make it a point to examine my bankaccount tonight i havent done sofor some time  we will go to venice and drift about in a gondola on one of those gray days when the haze comes in from the adriatic and touches the city with the magic of the past sometimes i like the gray days bestwhen i am happy and then she added regarding him critically although you are very near perfection there are some things you ought to see and learn to make your education complete i will take you to all the queer places i love when you are ambassador to france you know it would be humiliating to have to have an interpreter wouldnt it  whats the use of both of us knowing the language he demanded  im afraid we shall betoo happy she sighed presently  too happy he repeated  i sometimes wonder she said whether happiness and achievement go together and yeti feel sure that you will achieve  to please you victoria he answered i think i should almost be willing to try     chapter xxx ps  by request of one who has read thus far and is still curious  yes and another who in spite of himself has fallen in love with victoria and would like to linger a while longer even though it were with the paltry excuse of discussing that worldold question of herscan sublime happiness and achievement go together novels on the problem of sex nowadays often begin with marriages but rarely discuss the happy ones and many a woman is forced to sit wistfully at home while her companion soars          yet may i look with heart unshook          on blow brought home or missed          yet may i hear with equal ear          the clarions down the list          yet set my lance above mischance          and ride the barriere          oh hit or miss how little tis          my lady is not there  a verse in this connection which may be a perversion of mr kiplings meaning but not so far from it after all and yet would the eagle attempt the great flights if contentment were on the plain find the mainspring of achievement and you hold in your hand the secret of the worlds mechanism some aver that it is woman  do the gods ever confer the rarest of gifts upon him to whom they have given pinions do they mate him ever with another who soars as high as he who circles higher that he may circle higher still who can answer must those who soar be condemned to eternal loneliness and was it a longing they did not comprehend which bade them stretch their wings toward the sun who can say  alas we cannot write of the future of austen and victoria vane we can only surmise and hope and prayyes and believe romance walks with parted lips and head raised to the sky and let us follow her because thereby our eyes are raised with hers we must believe or perish  postscripts are not fashionable the satiated theatre goer leaves before the end of the play and has worked out the problem for himself long before the end of the last act sentiment is not supposed to exist in the orchestra seats but above in many senses is the gallery from whence an excited voice cries out when the sleeper returns to life its rip van winkle the gallery where are the human passions which make this world our world the gallery played upon by anger vengeance derision triumph hate and love the gallery which lingers and applauds long after the fifth curtain and then goes reluctantly hometo dream and he who scorns the gallery is no artist for there lives the soul of art we raise our eyes to it and to it we dedicate this our playand for it we lift the curtain once more after those in the orchestra have departed  it is obviously impossible in a few words to depict the excitement in ripton in leith in the state at large when it became known that the daughter of mr flint was to marry austen vanea fitting if unexpected climax to a drama how would mr flint take it mr flint it may be said took it philosophically and when austen went up to see him upon this matter he shook hands with his future soninlawand they agreed to disagree and beyond this it is safe to say that mr flint was relieved for in his secret soul he had for many years entertained a dread that victoria might marry a foreigner he had this consolation at any rate  his wife denied herself for a day to her most intimate friendsfor it was she who had entertained visions of a title and it was characteristic of the rose of sharon that she knew nothing of the vanes beyond the name the discovery that the austens were the oldest family in the state was in the nature of a balm and henceforth in speaking of austen she never failed to mention the fact that his greatgrandfather was minister to spain in the 30sa period when her own was engaged in a far different calling  and hilary vane received the news with a grim satisfaction dr tredway believing that it had done more for him than any medicine or specialists and when one warm october day victoria herself came and sat beside the canopied bed her conquest was complete he surrendered to her as he had never before surrendered to man or woman or child and the desire to live surged back into his heartthe desire to live for austen and victoria it became her custom to drive to ripton in the autumn mornings and to sit by the hour reading to hilary in the mellow sunlight in the lee of the house near sarah austens little garden yes victoria believed she had developed in him a taste for reading although he would have listened to emerson from her lips  and sometimes when she paused after one of his long silences to glance at him she would see his eyes fixed with a strange rapt look on the garden or the dim lavender form of sawanec through the haze and knew that he was thinking of a priceless thing which he had once possessed and missed then victoria would close the volume and fall to dreaming too  what was happiness was it contentment if it were it might endurecontentment being passive but could active aggressive exultant joy exist for a lifetime jealous of its least prerogative perpetually watchful for its least abatement singing unending anthems on its conquest of the world the very intensity of her feelings at such times sobered victoriaalarmed her was not perfection at war with the worlds scheme and did not achievement spring from a void  but when austen appeared with pepper to drive her home to fairview his presence never failed to revive the fierce faith that it was his destiny to make the world better and hers to help him wondrous afternoons they spent together in that stillest and most mysterious of seasons in the hill countryautumn autumn and happiness happiness as shameless as the flaunting scarlet maples on the slopes defiant of the dying year of the future shadowy and unreal as the hills before them in the haze once after a long silence she started from a revery with the sudden consciousness of his look intent upon her and turned with parted lips and eyes which smiled at him out of troubled depths  dreaming victoria he said  yes she answered simply and was silent once more he loved these silences of hershinting as they did of unexplored chambers in an inexhaustible treasurehouse which by some strange stroke of destiny was his and yet he felt at times the vague sadness of them like the sadness of the autumn and longed to dispel it  it is so wonderful she went on presently in a low voice it is so wonderful i sometimes think that it must be likelike this that it cannot last i have been wondering whether we shall be as happy when the world discovers that you are great  he shook his head at her slowly in mild reproof  isnt that borrowing trouble victoria he said i think you need have no fear of finding the world as discerning as yourself  she searched his face  will you ever change she asked  yes he said no man can stand such flattery as that without deteriorating i warn you i shall become consequential and pompous and altogether insupportable and then you will leave me and never realize that it has been all your fault  victoria laughed but there was a little tremor in her voice and her eyes still rested on his face  but i am serious austen she said i sometimes feel that in the future we shall not always have many such days as these its selfish but i cant help it there are so many things you will have to do without me dont you ever think of that  his eyes grew grave and he reached out and took her hand in his  i think rather of the trials life may bring victoria he answered of the hours when judgment halts when the way is not clear do you remember the last night you came to jabe jenneys i stood in the road long after you had gone and a desolation such as i had never known came over me i went in at last and opened a book to some verses i had been reading which i shall never forget shall i tell you what they were  yes she whispered  they contain my answer to your question he said         what became of all the hopes         words and song and lute as well         say this struck you when life gropes         feebly for the path where fell         light last on the evening slopes         one friend in that path shall be         to secure my step from wrong         one to count night day for me         patient through the watches long         serving most with none to see  victoria can you guess who that friend is  she pressed his hand and smiled at him but her eyes were wet  i have thought of it in that way too dear butbut i did not know that you had i do not think that many men have that point of view austen  many men he answered have not the same reason to be thankful as i  there is a time when the first sharp winds which fill the air with flying leaves have come and gone when the stillness has come again and the sunlight is tinged with a yellower gold and the pastures are still a vivid green and the mountain stained with a deeper blue than any gem called indian summer and it was in this season that victoria and austen were married in a little church at tunbridge near fairview by the bishop of the diocese who was one of victorias dearest friends mr thomas gaylord for whose benefit there were many rehearsals was best man miss beatrice chillingham maid of honour and it was unanimously declared by victorias bridesmaids who came up from new york that they had fallen in love with the groom  how describe the wedding breakfast and festivities at fairview house on a november day when young ladies could walk about the lawns in the filmiest of gowns how recount the guests and leave out no friendsfor none were left out mr jabe jenney and mrs jenney who wept as she embraced both bride and groom and euphrasia in a new steelcoloured silk and a state of absolute subjection and incredulous happiness would that there were time to chronicle that most amazing of conquests of victoria over euphrasia and mrs pomfret who remarkable as it may seem not only recognized austen without her lorgnette but quite overwhelmed him with an unexpected cordiality and declared her intention of giving them a dinner in new york  my dear she said after kissing victoria twice he is most distinguishedlookingi had no ideaand a person who grows upon one and i am told he is descended from channing austen of whom i have often heard my grandfather speak victoria i always had the greatest confidence in your judgment  although victoria had a memory what woman worth her salt has not she was far too happy to remind mrs pomfret of certain former occasions and merely smiled in a manner which that lady declared to be enigmatic she maintained that she had never understood victoria and it was characteristic of mrs pomfret that her respect increased in direct proportion to her lack of understanding  mr thomas gaylord in a waistcoat which was the admiration of all who beheld it proposed the health of the bride and proved indubitably that the best of oratory has its origin in the heart and not in the mindfor tom had never been regarded by his friends as a demosthenes he was interrupted from time to time by shouts of laughter certain episodes in the early career of mr austen vane in which if tom was to be believed he was an unwilling participant were particularly appreciated and shortly after that amidst a shower of miscellaneous articles and rice mr and mrs vane took their departure  they drove through the yellow sunlight to ripton with lingering looks at the hills which brought back memories of boys and sorrows and in hanover street bade goodby to hilary vane a new and strange contentment shone in his face as he took victorias hands in his and they sat with him until euphrasia came it was not until they were well on their way to new york that they opened the letter he had given them and discovered that it contained something which would have enabled them to remain in europe the rest of their lives had they so chosen  we must leave them amongst the sunny ruins of italy and greece and southern france on a marvellous journey that was personally conducted by victoria  mr crewe was unable to go to the wedding having to attend a directors meeting of some importance in the west he is still in politics and still hopeful and he was married not long afterwards to miss alice pomfret      pg editors bookmarks     fame sometimes comes in the line of duty    genius is almost one hundred percent directness
