39673636	thankful blossom   by  bret harte     i  the time was the year of grace 1779 the locality morristown new jersey  it was bitterly cold  a northeasterly wind had been stiffening the mud of the mornings thaw into a rigid record of that days wayfaring on the baskingridge road  the hoofprints of cavalry the deep ruts left by baggagewagons and the deeper channels worn by artillery lay stark and cold in the waning light of an april day  there were icicles on the fences a rime of silver on the windward bark of maples and occasional bare spots on the rocky protuberances of the road as if nature had worn herself out at the knees and elbows through long waiting for the tardy spring  a few leaves disinterred by the thaw became crisp again and rustled in the wind making the summer a thing so remote that all human hope and conjecture fled before them  here and there the wayside fences and walls were broken down or dismantled and beyond them fields of snow downtrodden and discolored and strewn with fragments of leather camp equipage harness and castoff clothing showed traces of the recent encampment and congregation of men  on some there were still standing the ruins of rudely constructed cabins or the semblance of fortification equally rude and incomplete  a fox stealing along a halffilled ditch a wolf slinking behind an earthwork typified the human abandonment and desolation  one by one the faint sunset tints faded from the sky the faroff crests of the orange hills grew darker the nearer files of pines on the whatnong mountain became a mere black background and with the comingon of night came too an icy silence that seemed to stiffen and arrest the very wind itself  the crisp leaves no longer rustled the waving whips of alder and willow snapped no longer the icicles no longer dropped a cold fruitage from barren branch and spray and the roadside trees relapsed into stony quiet so that the sound of horses hoofs breaking through the thin dull lustreless films of ice that patched the furrowed road might have been heard by the nearest continental picket a mile away  either a knowledge of this or the difficulties of the road evidently irritated the viewless horseman  long before he became visible his voice was heard in halfsuppressed objurgation of the road of his beast of the country folk and the country generally steady you jade  jump you devil jump  curse the road and the beggarly farmers that durst not mend it  and then the moving bulk of horse and rider suddenly arose above the hill floundered and splashed and then as suddenly disappeared and the rattling hoofbeats ceased  the stranger had turned into a deserted lane still cushioned with untrodden snow  a stone wall on one handin better keeping and condition than the boundary monuments of the outlying fieldsbespoke protection and exclusiveness  halfway up the lane the rider checked his speed and dismounting tied his horse to a wayside sapling  this done he went cautiously forward toward the end of the lane and a farmhouse from whose gable window a light twinkled through the deepening night  suddenly he stopped hesitated and uttered an impatient ejaculation  the light had disappeared  he turned sharply on his heel and retraced his steps until opposite a farmshed that stood a few paces from the wall hard by a large elm cast the gaunt shadow of its leafless limbs on the wall and surrounding snow  the stranger stepped into this shadow and at once seemed to become a part of its trembling intricacies  at the present moment it was certainly a bleak place for a tryst there was snow yet clinging to the trunk of the tree and a film of ice on its bark the adjacent wall was slippery with frost and fringed with icicles  yet in all there was a ludicrous suggestion of some sentiment past and unseasonable several dislodged stones of the wall were so disposed as to form a bench and seats and under the elmtrees film of ice could still be seen carved on its bark the effigy of a heart divers initials and the legend thine forever  the stranger however kept his eyes fixed only on the farmshed and the open field beside it  five minutes passed in fruitless expectancy ten minutes  and then the rising moon slowly lifted herself over the black range of the orange hills and looked at him blushing a little as if the appointment were her own  the face and figure thus illuminated were those of a strongly built handsome man of thirty so soldierly in bearing that it needed not the buff epaulets and facings to show his captains rank in the continental army  yet there was something in his facial expression that contradicted the manliness of his presencean irritation and querulousness that were inconsistent with his size and strength  this fretfulness increased as the moments went by without sign or motion in the faintly lit field beyond until in peevish exasperation he began to kick the nearer stones against the wall  moooow  the soldier started  not that he was frightened nor that he had failed to recognize in these prolonged syllables the deepchested halfdrowsy low of a cow but that it was so near himevidently just beside the wall  if an object so bulky could have approached him so near without his knowledge might not she  moooo  he drew nearer the wall cautiously  so cushy  mooly  come up bossy he said persuasively  moobut here the low unexpectedly broke down and ended in a very human and rather musical little laugh  thankful exclaimed the soldier echoing the laugh a trifle uneasily and affectedly as a hooded little head arose above the wall  well replied the figure supporting a prettily rounded chin on her hands as she laid her elbows complacently on the wallwell what did you expect  did you want me to stand here all night while you skulked moonstruck under a tree  or did you look for me to call you by name did you expect me to shout out capt allan brewster  thankful hush  capt allan brewster of the connecticut contingent continued the girl with an affected raising of a low pathetic voice that was however inaudible beyond the tree  capt brewster behold meyour obleeged and humble servant and sweetheart to command  capt brewster succeeded after a slight skirmish at the wall in possessing himself of the girls hand at which although still struggling she relented slightly  it isnt every lad that id low for she said with an affected pout and there may be others that would not take it amiss though there be fine ladies enough at the assembly halls at morristown as might think it hoydenish  nonsense love said the captain who had by this time mounted the wall and encircled the girls waist with his arm  nonsense you startled me only  but he added suddenly taking her round chin in his hand and turning her face toward the moon with an uneasy halfsuspicion why did you take that light from the window  what has happened  we had unexpected guests sweetheart said thankful the count just arrived  that infernal hessian  he stopped and gazed questioningly into her face  the moon looked upon her at the same time the face was as sweet as placid as truthful as her own  possibly these two inconstants understood each other  nay allan he is not a hessian but an exiled gentleman from abroada nobleman  there are no noblemen now sniffed the trooper contemptuously congress has so decreed it  all men are born free and equal  but they are not allan said thankful with a pretty trouble in her brows even cows are not born equal  is yon calf that was dropped last night by brindle the equal of my red heifer whose mother come by herself in a ship from surrey  do they look equal  titles are but breath said capt brewster doggedly  there was an ominous pause  nay there is one nobleman left said thankful and he is my ownmy natures nobleman  capt brewster did not reply  from certain arch gestures and wreathed smiles with which this forward young woman accompanied her statement it would seem to be implied that the gentleman who stood before her was the nobleman alluded to  at least he so accepted it and embraced her closely her arms and part of her mantle clinging around his neck  in this attitude they remained quiet for some moments slightly rocking from side to side like a metronome a movement i fancy peculiarly bucolic pastoral and idyllic and as such i wot observed by theocritus and virgil  at these supreme moments weak woman usually keeps her wits about her much better than your superior reasoning masculine animal and while the gallant captain was losing himself upon her perfect lips miss thankful distinctly heard the farmgate click and otherwise noticed that the moon was getting high and obtrusive  she half released herself from the captains arms thoughtfully and tenderlybut firmly tell me all about yourself allan dear she said quietly making room for him on the wallall everything  she turned upon him her beautiful eyeseyes habitually earnest and even grave in expression yet holding in their brave brown depths a sweet childlike reliance and dependency eyes with a certain tender deprecating droop in the brownfringed lids and yet eyes that seemed to say to every man who looked upon them i am truthful be frank with me  indeed i am convinced there is not one of my impressible sex who looking in those pleading eyes would not have perjured himself on the spot rather than have disappointed their fair owner  capt brewsters mouth resumed its old expression of discontent  everything is growing worse thankful and the cause is lost congress does nothing and washington is not the man for the crisis  instead of marching to philadelphia and forcing that wretched rabble of hancock and adams at the point of the bayonet he writes letters  a dignified formal old fool interrupted mistress thankful indignantly and look at his wife  didnt mistress ford and mistress baily ay and the best blood of morris county go down to his excellencys in their finest bibs and tuckers and didnt they find my lady in a pinafore doing chores  vastly polite treatment indeed  as if the whole world didnt know that the general was taken by surprise when my lady came riding up from virginia with all those fine cavaliers just to see what his excellency was doing at these assembly balls  and fine doings i dare say  this is but idle gossip thankful said capt brewster with the faintest appearance of selfconsciousness the assembly balls are conceived by the general to strengthen the confidence of the townsfolk and mitigate the rigors of the winter encampment  i go there myself rarely i have but little taste for junketing and gavotting with my country in such need  no thankful  what we want is a leader and the men of connecticut feel it keenly  if i have been spoken of in that regard added the captain with a slight inflation of his manly breast it is because they know of my sacrificesbecause as new england yeomen they know my devotion to the cause  they know of my suffering  the bright face that looked into his was suddenly afire with womanly sympathy the pretty brow was knit the sweet eyes overflowed with tenderness  forgive me allan  i forgotperhaps loveperhaps dearest you are hungry now  no not now replied captain brewster with gloomy stoicism yet he added it is nearly a week since i have tasted meat  iibrought a few things with me continued the girl with a certain hesitating timidity  she reached down and produced a basket from the shadow of the wall  these chickensshe held up a pair of pulletsthe commanderinchief himself could not buy i kept them for my commander  and this pot of marmalade which i know my allan loves is the same i put up last summer  i thought very tenderly you might like a piece of that bacon you liked so once dear  ah sweetheart shall we ever sit down to our little board  shall we ever see the end of this awful war  dont you think dear very pleadingly it would be best to give it up king george is not such a very bad man is he ive thought sweetheart very confidently that mayhap you and he might make it all up without the aid of those washingtons who do nothing but starve one to death  and if the king only knew you allanshould see you as i do sweethearthed do just as you say  during this speech she handed him the several articles alluded to and he received them storing them away in such receptacles of his clothing as were convenientwith this notable difference that with her the act was graceful and picturesque with him there was a ludicrousness of suggestion that his broad shoulders and uniform only heightened  i think not of myself lass he said putting the eggs in his pocket and buttoning the chickens within his martial breast  i think not of myself and perhaps i often spare that counsel which is but little heeded  but i have a duty to my mento connecticut he here tied the marmalade up in his handkerchief  i confess i have sometimes thought i might under provocation be driven to extreme measures for the good of the cause  i make no pretence to leadership but  with you at the head of the army broke in thankful enthusiastically peace would be declared within a fortnight  there is no flattery however outrageous that a man will not accept from the woman whom he believes loves him  he will perhaps doubt its influence in the colder judgment of mankind but he will consider that this poor creature at least understands him and in some vague way represents the eternal but unrecognized verities and when this is voiced by lips that are young and warm and red it is somehow quite as convincing as the bloodless remoter utterance of posterity  wherefore the trooper complacently buttoned the compliment over his chest with the pullets  i think you must go now allan she said looking at him with that pseudomaternal air which the youngest of women sometimes assume to their lovers as if the doll had suddenly changed sex and grown to mans estate  you must go now dear for it may so chance that father is considering my absence overmuch  you will come again a wednesday sweetheart and you will not go to the assemblies nor visit mistress judith nor take any girl pickaback again on your black horse and you will let me know when you are hungry  she turned her brown eyes lovingly yet with a certain pretty trouble in the brow and such a searching pleading inquiry in her glance that the captain kissed her at once  then came the final embrace performed by the captain in a halfperfunctory quiet manner with a due regard for the friable nature of part of his provisions  satisfying himself of the integrity of the eggs by feeling for them in his pocket he waved a military salute with the other hand to miss thankful and was gone  a few minutes later the sound of his horses hoofs rang sharply from the icy hillside  but as he reached the summit two horsemen wheeled suddenly from the shadow of the roadside and bade him halt  capt brewster if this moon does not deceive me queried the foremost stranger with grave civility  the same  major van zandt i calculate returned brewster querulously  your calculation is quite right  i regret capt brewster that it is my duty to inform you that you are under arrest  by whose orders  the commanderinchiefs  for what  mutinous conduct and disrespect of your superior officers  the sword that capt brewster had drawn at the sudden appearance of the strangers quivered for a moment in his strong hand  then sharply striking it across the pommel of his saddle he snapped it in twain and cast the pieces at the feet of the speaker  go on he said doggedly  capt brewster said major van zandt with infinite gravity it is not for me to point out the danger to you of this outspoken emotion except practically in its effect upon the rations you have in your pocket  if i mistake not they have suffered equally with your steel forward march  capt brewster looked down and then dropped to the rear as the discased yolks of mistress thankfuls most precious gift slid slowly and pensively over his horses flanks to the ground    ii  mistress thankful remained at the wall until her lover had disappeared then she turned a mere lissom shadow in that uncertain light and glided under the eaves of the shed and thence from tree to tree of the orchard lingering a moment under each as a trout lingers in the shadow of the bank in passing a shallow and so reached the farmhouse and the kitchen door where she entered thence by a back staircase she slipped to her own bower from whose window half an hour before she had taken the signalling light this she lit again and placed upon a chest of drawers and taking off her hood and a shapeless sleeveless mantle she had worn went to the mirror and proceeded to readjust a high horn comb that had been somewhat displaced by the captains arm and otherwise after the fashion of her sex to remove all traces of a previous lover it may be here observed that a man is very apt to come from the smallest encounter with his dulcinea distrait bored or shamefaced to forget that his cravat is awry or that a long blond hair is adhering to his button  but as to mademoisellewell looking at miss pussys sleek paws and spotless face would you ever know that she had been at the creamjug  thankful was i think satisfied with her appearance  small doubt but she had reason for it  and yet her gown was a mere slip of flowered chintz gathered at the neck and falling at an angle of fifteen degrees to within an inch of a short petticoat of gray flannel  but so surely is the complete mould of symmetry indicated in the poise or line of any single member that looking at the erect carriage of her graceful brown head or below to the curves that were lost in her shapely ankles or the little feet that hid themselves in the broadbuckled shoes you knew that the rest was as genuine and beautiful  mistress thankful after a pause opened the door and listened then she softly slipped down the back staircase to the front hall it was dark but the door of the companyroom or parlor was faintly indicated by the light that streamed beneath it  she stood still for a moment hesitatingly when suddenly a hand grasped her own and half led half dragged her into the sittingroom opposite  it was dark there was a momentary fumbling for the tinderbox and flint a muttered oath over one or two impeding articles of furniture and thankful laughed  and then the light was lit and her father a gray wrinkled man of sixty still holding her hand stood before her  you have been out mistress  i have said thankful  and not alone growled the old man angrily  no said mistress thankful with a smile that began in the corners of her brown eyes ran down into the dimpled curves of her mouth and finally ended in the sudden revelation of her white teethno not alone  with whom asked the old man gradually weakening under her strong saucy presence  well father said thankful taking a seat on a table and swinging her little feet somewhat ostentatiously toward him i was with capt allan brewster of the connecticut contingent  that man  that man  i forbid you seeing him again  thankful gripped the table with a hand on each side of her to emphasize the statement and swinging her feet replied  i shall see him as often as i like father  thankful blossom  abner blossom  i see you know not said mr blossom abandoning the severely paternal mandatory air for one of confidential disclosure i see you know not his reputation  he is accused of inciting his regiment to revoltof being a traitor to the cause  and since when abner blossom have you felt such concern for the cause  since you refused to sell supplies to the continental commissary except at double profits since you told me you were glad i had not polities like mistress ford  hush said the father motioning to the parlor  hush echoed thankful indignantly  i wont be hushed everybody says hush to me  the count says hush  allan says hush  you say hush  im aweary of this hushing  ah if there was a man who didnt say it to me and mistress thankful lifted her fine eyes to the ceiling  you are unwise thankfulfoolish indiscreet  that is why you require much monition  thankful swung her feet in silence for a few moments then suddenly leaped from the table and seizing the old man by the lapels of his coat fixed her eyes upon him and said suspiciously  why did you keep me from going in the companyroom  why did you bring me in here  blossom senior was staggered for a moment  because you know the count  and you were afraid the count should know i had a sweetheart well ill go in and tell him now she said marching toward the door  then why did you not tell him when you slipped out an hour ago eh lass queried the old man grasping her hand  but tis all one thankful twas not for him i stopped you  there is a young spark with himay came even as you left lassa likely young gallant and he and the count are jabbering away in their own lingo a kind of italian belike eh thankful  i know not she said thoughtfully  which way came the other in fact a fear that this young stranger might have witnessed the captains embrace began to creep over her  from town my lass  thankful turned to her father as if she had been waiting a reply to a longasked question well  were it not well to put on a few furbelows and a tucker queried the old man  tis a gallant young spark none of your country folk  no said thankful with the promptness of a woman who was looking her best and knew it  and the old man looking at her accepted her judgment and without another word led her to the parlor door and opening it said briefly my daughter mistress thankful blossom  with the opening of the door came the sound of earnest voices that instantly ceased upon the appearance of mistress thankful  two gentlemen lolling before the fire arose instantly and one came forward with an air of familiar yet respectful recognition  nay this is far too great happiness mistress thankful he said with a strongly marked foreign accent and a still more strongly marked foreign manner  i have been in despair and my friend here the baron pomposo likewise  the slightest trace of a smile and the swiftest of reproachful glances lit up the dark face of the baron as he bowed low in the introduction  thankful dropped the courtesy of the periodi e a duck with semicircular sweep of the right foot forward  but the right foot was so pretty and the grace of the little figure so perfect that the baron raised his eyes from the foot to the face in serious admiration  in the one rapid feminine glance she had given him she had seen that he was handsome in the second which she could not help from his protracted silence she saw that his beauty centred in his girlish half fawnlike dark eyes  the baron explained mr blossom rubbing his hands together as if through mere friction he was trying to impart a warmth to the reception which his hard face discountenancedthe baron visits us under discouragement  he comes from far countries  it is the custom of gentlefolk ofof foreign extraction to wander through strange lands commenting upon the habits and doings of the peoples  he will find in jersey continued mr blossom apparently appealing to thankful yet really evading her contemptuous glance a hardworking yeomanry ever ready to welcome the stranger and account to him penny for penny for all his necessary expenditure for which purpose in these troublous times he will provide for himself gold or other moneys not affected by these local disturbances  he will find good friend blossom said the baron in a rapid voluble way utterly at variance with the soft quiet gravity of his eyes beauty grace accomplishment andehsanta maria what shall i say  he turned appealingly to the count  virtue nodded the count  truly birtoo all in the fair lady of thees countries  ah believe me honest friend blossom there is mooch more in thees than in thoss  so much of this speech was addressed to mistress thankful that she had to show at least one dimple in reply albeit her brows were slightly knit and she had turned upon the speaker her honest questioning eyes  and then the general washington has been kind enough to offer his protection added the count  any foolany one supplemented thankful hastily with a slight blushmay have the generals pass ay and his good word  but what of mistress prudence bookstavershe that has a sweetheart in knyphausens brigade ayi warrant a hessian but of gentle blood as mistress prudence has often told meand look you all her letters stopped by the general ay i warrant read by my lady washington too as if twere her fault that her lad was in arms against congress riddle me that now  tis but prudence lass said blossom frowning on the girl tis that she might disclose some movement of the army tending to defeat the enemy  and why should she not try to save her lad from capture or ambuscade such as befell the hessian commissary with the provisions that you  mr blossom in an ostensible fatherly embrace managed to pinch mistress thankful sharply  hush lass he said with simulated playfulness your tongue clacks like the whippany millmy daughter has small concerntis the manner of womenfolkin politics he explained to his guests  these dangersome days have given her sore affliction by way of parting comrades of her childhood and others whom she has much affected  it has in some sort soured her  mr blossom would have recalled this speech as soon as it escaped him lest it should lead to a revelation from the truthful mistress thankful of her relations with the continental captain  but to his astonishment and i may add to my own she showed nothing of that disposition she had exhibited a few moments before  on the contrary she blushed slightly and said nothing  and then the conversation changedupon the weather the hard winter the prospects of the cause a criticism upon the commanderinchiefs management of affairs the attitude of congress etc between mr blossom and the count characterized i hardly need say by that positiveness of opinion that distinguishes the unprofessional  in another part of the room it so chanced that mistress thankful and the baron were talking about themselves the assembly balls who was the prettiest woman in morristown and whether gen washingtons attentions to mistress pyne were only perfunctory gallantry or what and if lady washingtons hair was really gray and if that young aidedecamp major van zandt were really in love with lady or whether his attentions were only the zeal of a subalternin the midst of which a sudden gust of wind shook the house and mr blossom going to the front door came back with the announcement that it was snowing heavily  and indeed within that past hour to their astonished eyes the whole face of nature had changed  the moon was gone the sky hidden in a blinding whirling swarm of stinging flakes  the wind bitter and strong had already fashioned white feathery drifts upon the threshold over the painted benches on the porch and against the doorposts  mistress thankful and the baron had walked to the rear doorthe baron with a slight tropical shudderto view this meteorological change  as mistress thankful looked over the snowy landscape it seemed to her that all record of her past experience had been effaced her very footprints of an hour before were lost the gray wall on which she leaned was white and spotless now even the familiar farmshed looked dim and strange and ghostly  had she been there had she seen the captain was it all a fancy  she scarcely knew  a sudden gust of wind closed the door behind them with a crash and sent mistress thankful with a slight feminine scream forward into the outer darkness  but the baron caught her by the waist and saved her from heaven knows what imaginable disaster and the scene ended in a halfhysterical laugh  but the wind then set upon them both with a malevolent fury and the baron was i presume obliged to draw her closer to his side  they were alone save for the presence of those mischievous confederates nature and opportunity  in the halfobscurity of the storm she could not help turning her mischievous eyes on his  but she was perhaps surprised to find them luminous soft and as it seemed to her at that moment grave beyond the occasion  an embarrassment utterly new and singular seized upon her and when as she half feared yet half expected he bent down and pressed his lips to hers she was for a moment powerless  but in the next instant she boxed his ears sharply and vanished in the darkness when mr blossom opened the door to the baron he was surprised to find that gentleman alone and still more surprised to find when they reentered the house to see mistress thankful enter at the same moment demurely from the front door  when mr blossom knocked at his daughters door the next morning it opened upon her completely dressed but withal somewhat pale and if the truth must be told a little surly  and you were stirring so early thankful he said twould have been but decent to have bidden godspeed to the guests especially the baron who seemed much concerned at your absence  miss thankful blushed slightly but answered with savage celerity and since when is it necessary that i should dance attendance upon every foreign jackinthebox that may lie at the house  he has shown great courtesy to you mistress and is a gentleman  courtesy indeed said mistress thankful  he has not presumed said mr blossom suddenly bringing his cold gray eyes to bear upon his daughters  no no said thankful hurriedly flaming a bright scarlet butnothing but what have you there a letter  ayfrom the captain i warrant said mr blossom handing her a threecornered bit of paper twas left here by a campfollower thankful he continued with a meaning glance you will heed my counsel in season  the captain is not meet for such as you  thankful suddenly grew pale and contemptuous again as she snatched the letter from his hand  when his retiring footsteps were lost on the stairs she regained her color and opened the letter  it was slovenly written grievously misspelled and read as follows   sweetheart a tyranous act begotten in envy and jealousie keeps me here a prisoner  last night i was basely arrested by servile hands for that freedom of thought and expression for which i have already sacrifized so muchaye all that man hath but love and honour  but the end is near  when for the maintenance of power the liberties of the peoples are subdued by martial supremacy and the dictates of ambition the state is lost  i lie in vile bondage here in morristown under charge of disrespeckme that a twelvemonth past left a home and respectable connexions to serve my country  believe me still your own love albeit in the power of tyrants and condemned it may be to the scaffold  the messenger is trustworthy and will speed safely to me such as you may deliver unto him  the provender sanktified by your hands and made precious by yr love was wrested from me by servil hands and the eggs sweetheart were somewhat addled  the bacon is methinks by this time on the table of the comrinchief  such is tyranny and ambition sweetheart farewell for the present  allan   mistress thankful read this composition once twice and then tore it up  then reflecting that it was the first letter of her lovers that she had not kept she tried to put together again the torn fragments but vainly and then in a pet new to her cast them from the window during the rest of the day she was considerably distraite and even manifested more temper than she was wont to do and later when her father rode away on his daily visit to morristown she felt strangely relieved  by noon the snow ceased or rather turned into a driving sleet that again in turn gave way to rain  by this time she became absorbed in her household dutiesin which she was usually skilfuland in her own thoughts that today had a novelty in their meaning  in the midst of this at about dark her room being in the rear of the house she was perhaps unmindful of the trampling of horse without or the sound of voices in the hall below  neither was uncommon at that time  although protected by the continental army from forage or the rudeness of soldiery the blossom farm had always been a haltingplace for passing troopers commissary teamsters and reconnoitring officers  gen sullivan and col hamilton had watered their horses at its broad substantial wayside trough and sat in the shade of its porch  miss thankful was only awakened from her daydream by the entrance of the negro farmhand caesar  fo god missy thankful them sogers is gwine into camp in the road i reckon for theys jest makin theysevs free afo the house and theys an officer in the companyroom with his spurs cocked on the table readin a book  a quick flame leaped into thankfuls cheek and her pretty brows knit themselves over darkening eyes  she arose from her work no longer the moody girl but an indignant goddess and pushing the servant aside swept down the stairs and threw open the door  an officer sitting by the fire in an easy lounging attitude that justified the servants criticism arose instantly with an air of evident embarrassment and surprise that was however as quickly dominated and controlled by a gentlemans breeding  i beg your pardon he said with a deep inclination of his handsome head but i had no idea that there was any member of this household at homeat least a lady  he hesitated a moment catching in the raising of her brownfringed lids a sudden revelation of her beauty and partly losing his composure  i am major van zandt i have the honor of addressing  thankful blossom said thankful a little proudly divining with a womans swift instinct the cause of the majors hesitation  but her triumph was checked by a new embarrassment visible in the face of the officer at the mention of her name  thankful blossom repeated the officer quickly  you are then the daughter of abner blossom  certainly said thankful turning her inquiring eyes upon him he will be here betimes  he has gone only to morristown  in a new fear that had taken possession of her her questioning eyes asked has he not  the officer answering her eyes rather than her lips came toward her gravely  he will not return today mistress thankful nor perhaps even tomorrow  he isa prisoner  thankful opened her brown eyes aggressively on the major  a prisonerfor what  for aiding and giving comfort to the enemy and for harboring spies replied the major with military curtness  mistress thankfuls cheek flushed slightly at the last sentence a recollection of the scene on the porch and the barons stolen kiss flashed across her and for a moment she looked as guilty as if the man before her had been a witness to the deed  he saw it and misinterpreted her confusion  belike then said mistress thankful slightly raising her voice and standing squarely before the major belike then i should be a prisoner too for the guests of this house if they be spies were my guests and as my fathers daughter i was their hostess ay man and right glad to be the hostess of such gallant gentlemengentlemen i warrant too fine to insult a defenceless girl gentlemen spies that did not cock their boots on the table or turn an honest farmers house into a taproom  an expression of half pain half amusement covered the face of the major but he made no other reply than by a profound and graceful bow courteous and deprecatory as it was it apparently exasperated mistress thankful only the more  and pray who are these spies and who is the informer said mistress thankful facing the soldier with one hand truculently placed on her flexible hip and the other slipped behind her methinks tis only honest we should know when and how we have entertained both  your father mistress thankful said major van zandt gravely has long been suspected of favoring the enemy but it has been the policy of the commanderinchief to overlook the political preferences of noncombatants and to strive to win their allegiance to the good cause by liberal privileges  but when it was lately discovered that two strangers although bearing a pass from him have been frequenters of this house under fictitious names  you mean count ferdinand and the baron pomposo said thankful quicklytwo honest gentlefolk and if they choose to pay their devoirs to a lassalthough perhaps not a quality lady yet an honest girl  dear mistress thankful said the major with a profound bow and smile that spite of its courtesy drove thankful to the verge of wrathful hysterics if you establish that factand from this slight acquaintance with your charms i doubt not you willyour father is safe from further inquiry or detention  the commanderinchief is a gentleman who has never underrated the influence of your sex nor held himself averse to its fascinations  what is the name of this informer broke in mistress thankful angrily  who is it that has dared  it is but kings evidence mayhap mistress thankful for the informer is himself under arrest  it is on the information of capt allan brewster of the connecticut contingent  mistress thankful whitened then flushed and then whitened again then she stood up to the major  its a liea cowardly lie  major van zandt bowed  mistress thankful flew up stairs and in another moment swept back again into the room in riding hat and habit  i suppose i can go and seemy father she said without lifting her eyes to the officer  you are free as air mistress thankful  my orders and instructions far from implicating you in your fathers offences do not even suggest your existence  let me help you to your horse  the girl did not reply  during that brief interval however caesar had saddled her white mare and brought it to the door mistress thankful disdaining the offered hand of the major sprang to the saddle  the major still held the reins  one moment mistress thankful  let me go she said with suppressed passion  one moment i beg  his hand still held her bridlerein  the mare reared nearly upsetting her  crimson with rage and mortification she raised her ridingwhip and laid it smartly over the face of the man before her  he dropped the rein instantly  then he raised to her a face calm and colorless but for a red line extending from his eyebrow to his chin and said quietly  i had no desire to detain you  i only wished to say that when you see gen washington i know you will be just enough to tell him that major van zandt knew nothing of your wrongs or even your presence here until you presented them and that since then he has treated you as became an officer and a gentleman  yet even as he spoke she was gone  at the moment that her fluttering skirt swept in a furious gallop down the hillside the major turned and reentered the house  the few lounging troopers who were witnesses of the scene prudently turned their eyes from the white face and blazing eyes of their officer as he strode by them  nevertheless when the door closed behind him contemporary criticism broke out  tis a tory jade vexed that she cannot befool the major as she has the captain muttered sergeant tibbitts  and going to try her tricks on the general added private hicks  howbeit both these critics may have been wrong  for as mistress thankful thundered down the morristown road she thought of many things she thought of her sweetheart allan a prisoner and pining for her help and her solicitude and yethow dared heif he had really betrayed or misjudged her  and then she thought bitterly of the count and the baron and burned to face the latter and in some vague way charge the stolen kiss upon him as the cause of all her shame and mortification  and lastly she thought of her father and began to hate everybody  but above all and through all in her vague fears for her father in her passionate indignation against the baron in her fretful impatience of allan one thing was ever dominant and obtrusive one thing she tried to put away but could notthe handsome colorless face of major van zandt with the red welt of her ridingwhip overlying its cold outlines    iii  the rising wind which had ridden much faster than mistress thankful had increased to a gale by the time it reached morristown  it swept through the leafless maples and rattled the dry bones of the elms  it whistled through the quiet presbyterian churchyard as if trying to arouse the sleepers it had known in days gone by  it shook the blank lustreless windows of the assembly rooms over the freemasons tavern and wrought in their gusty curtains moving shadows of those amply petticoated dames and tightly hosed cavaliers who had swung in sir roger or jigged in money musk the night before  but i fancy it was around the isolated ford mansion better known as the headquarters that the wind wreaked its grotesque rage it howled under its scant eaves it sang under its bleak porch it tweaked the peak of its front gable it whistled through every chink and cranny of its square solid unpicturesque structure situated on a hillside that descended rapidly to the whippany river every summer zephyr that whispered through the porches of the morristown farmhouses charged as a stiff breeze upon the swinging half doors and windows of the ford mansion every wintry wind became a gale that threatened its security the sentry who paced before its front porch knew from experience when to linger under its lee and adjust his threadbare outer coat to the bitter north wind  within the house something of this cheerlessness prevailed  it had an ascetic gloom which the scant firelight of the receptionroom and the dying embers on the diningroom hearth failed to dissipate  the central hall was broad and furnished plainly with a few rushbottomed chairs on one of which half dozed a black bodyservant of the commanderinchief  two officers in the diningroom drawn close by the chimneycorner chatted in undertones as if mindful that the door of the drawingroom was open and their voices might break in upon its sacred privacy  the swinging light in the hall partly illuminated it or rather glanced gloomily from the black polished furniture the lustreless chairs the quaint cabinet the silent spinet the skeletonlegged centretable and finally upon the motionless figure of a man seated by the fire  it was a figure since so well known to the civilized world since so celebrated in print and painting as to need no description here  its rare combination of gentle dignity with profound force of a set resoluteness of purpose with a philosophical patience have been so frequently delivered to a people not particularly remarkable for these qualities that i fear it has too often provoked a spirit of playful aggression in which the deeper underlying meaning was forgotten  so let me add that in manner physical equipoise and even in the mere details of dress this figure indicated a certain aristocratic exclusiveness  it was the presentment of a kinga king who by the irony of circumstances was just then waging war against all kingship a ruler of men who just then was fighting for the right of these men to govern themselves but whom by his own inherent right he dominated from the crown of his powdered head to the silver buckle of his shoe he was so royal that it was not strange that his brother george of england and hanoverruling by accident otherwise impiously known as the grace of godcould find no better way of resisting his power than by calling him mr washington  the sound of horses hoofs the formal challenge of sentry the grave questioning of the officer of the guard followed by footsteps upon the porch did not apparently disturb his meditation  nor did the opening of the outer door and a charge of cold air into the hall that invaded even the privacy of the receptionroom and brightened the dying embers on the hearth stir his calm preoccupation  but an instant later there was the distinct rustle of a feminine skirt in the hall a hurried whispering of mens voices and then the sudden apparition of a smooth freshfaced young officer over the shoulder of the unconscious figure  i beg your pardon general said the officer doubtingly but  you are not intruding col hamilton said the general quietly  there is a young lady without who wishes an audience of your excellency  tis mistress thankful blossomthe daughter of abner blossom charged with treasonous practice and favoring the enemy now in the guardhouse at morristown  thankful blossom repeated the general interrogatively  your excellency doubtless remembers a little provincial beauty and a famous toast of the countrysidethe cressida of our morristown epic who led our gallant  connecticut captain astray  you have the advantages besides the better memory of a younger man colonel said washington with a playful smile that slightly reddened the cheek of his aidedecamp  yet i think i have heard of this phenomenon  by all means admit herand her escort  she is alone general responded the subordinate  then the more reason why we should be polite returned washington for the first time altering his easy posture rising to his feet and lightly clasping his ruffled hands before him  we must not keep her waiting  give her access my dear colonel at once and even as she camealone  the aidedecamp bowed and withdrew  in another moment the halfopened door swung wide to mistress thankful blossom  she was so beautiful in her simple ridingdress so quaint and original in that very beauty and above all so teeming with a certain vital earnestness of purpose just positive and audacious enough to set off that beauty that the grave gentleman before her did not content himself with the usual formal inclination of courtesy but actually advanced and taking her cold little hand in his graciously led her to the chair he had just vacated  even if your name were not known to me mistress thankful said the commanderinchief looking down upon her with grave politeness nature has methinks spared you the necessity of any introduction to the courtesy of a gentleman  but how can i especially serve you  alack the blaze of mistress thankfuls brown eyes had become somewhat dimmed in the grave halflights of the room in the graver deeper dignity of the erect soldierlike figure before her  the bright color born of the tempest within and without had somehow faded from her cheek the sauciness begotten from bullying her horse in the last halfhours rapid ride was so subdued by the actual presence of the man she had come to bully that i fear she had to use all her selfcontrol to keep down her inclination to whimper and to keep back the tears that oddly enough rose to her sweet eyes as she lifted them to the quietly critical yet placid glance of her interlocutor  i can readily conceive the motive of this visit miss thankful continued washington with a certain dignified kindliness that was more reassuring than the formal gallantry of the period and it is i protest to your credit  a fathers welfare however erring and weak that father may be is most seemly in a maiden  thankfuls eyes flashed again as she rose to her feet  her upper lip that had a moment before trembled in a pretty infantine distress now stiffened and curled as she confronted the dignified figure before her it is not of my father i would speak she said saucily i did not ride here alone tonight in this weather to talk of him i warrant he can speak for himself  i came here to speak of myself of liesay lies told of me a poor girl ay of cowardly gossip about me and my sweetheart capt brewster now confined in prison because he hath loved me a lass without polities or adherence to the causeas if twere necessary every lad should ask the confidence or permission of yourself or belike my lady washington in his preferences  she paused a moment out of breath  with a womans quickness of intuition she saw the change in washingtons facesaw a certain cold severity overshadowing it  with a womans fateful persistencya persistency which i humbly suggest might on occasion be honorably copied by our more politic sexshe went on to say what was in her even if she were obliged with a womans honorable inconsistency to unsay it an hour or two later an inconsistency which i also humbly protest might be as honorably imitated by uson occasion  it has been said said thankful blossom quickly that my father has given entertainment knowingly to two spiestwo spies that begging your excellencys pardon and the pardon of congress i know only as two honorable gentlemen who have as honorably tendered me their affections  it is said and basely and most falsely too that my sweetheart capt allan brewster has lodged this information  i have ridden here to deny it  i have ridden here to demand of you that an honest womans reputation shall not be sacrificed to the interests of politics that a prying mob of ragamuffins shall not be sent to an honest farmers house to spy and spyand turn a poor girl out of doors that they might do it tis shameful so it is there tis most scandalous so it is there now  spies indeed what are they pray  in the indignation which the recollection of her wrongs had slowly gathered in her from the beginning of this speech she had advanced her face rosy with courage and beautiful in its impertinence within a few inches of the dignified features and quiet gray eyes of the great commander  to her utter stupefaction he bent his head and kissed her with a grave benignity full on the centre of her audacious forehead  be seated i beg mistress blossom he said taking her cold hand in his and quietly replacing her in the unoccupied chair  be seated i beg and give me if you can your attention for a moment  the officer intrusted with the ungracious task of occupying your fathers house is a member of my military family and a gentleman  if he has so far forgotten himselfif he has so far disgraced himself and me as  no no uttered thankful with feverish alacrity the gentleman was most considerate  on the contrarymayhapishe hesitated and then came to a full stop with a heightened color as a vivid recollection of that gentlemans face with the mark of her ridingwhip lying across it rose before her  i was about to say that major van zandt as a gentleman has known how to fully excuse the natural impulses of a daughter continued washington with a look of perfect understanding but let me now satisfy you on another point where it would seem we greatly differ  he walked to the door and summoned his servant to whom he gave an order  in another moment the freshfaced young officer who had at first admitted her reappeared with a file of official papers  he glanced slyly at thankful blossoms face with an amused look as if he had already heard the colloquy between her and his superior officer and had appreciated that which neither of the earnest actors in the scene had themselves felta certain sense of humor in the situation  howbeit standing before them col hamilton gravely turned over the file of papers  thankful bit her lips in embarrassment  a slight feeling of awe and a presentiment of some fastcoming shame a new and strange consciousness of herself her surroundings of the dignity of the two men before her an uneasy feeling of the presence of two ladies who had in some mysterious way entered the room from another door and who seemed to be intently regarding her from afar with a curiosity as if she were some strange animal and a wild premonition that her whole future life and happiness depended upon the events of the next few momentsso took possession of her that the brave girl trembled for a moment in her isolation and loneliness  in another instant col hamilton speaking to his superior but looking obviously at one of the ladies who had entered handed a paper to washington and said here are the charges  read them said the general coldly  col hamilton with a manifest consciousness of another hearer than mistress blossom and his general read the paper  it was couched in phrases of military and legal precision and related briefly that upon the certain and personal knowledge of the writer abner blossom of the blossom farm was in the habit of entertaining two gentlemen namely the count ferdinand and the baron pomposo suspected enemies of the cause and possible traitors to the continental army  it was signed by allan brewster late captain in the connecticut contingent  as col hamilton exhibited the signature thankful blossom had no difficulty in recognizing the familiar bad hand and equally familiar misspelling of her lover  she rose to her feet  with eyes that showed her present trouble and perplexity as frankly as they had a moment before blazed with her indignation she met one by one the glances of the group who now seemed to be closing round her  yet with a womans instinct she felt i am constrained to say more unfriendliness in the silent presence of the two women than in the possible outspoken criticism of our muchabused sex  of course said a voice which thankful at once by a womans unerring instinct recognized as the elder of the two ladies and the legitimate keeper of the conscience of some one of the men who were presentof course mistress thankful will be able to elect which of her lovers among her countrys enemies she will be able to cling to for support in her present emergency  she does not seem to have been so special in her favors as to have positively excluded any one  at least dear lady washington she will not give it to the man who has proven a traitor to her said the younger woman impulsively that isi beg your ladyships pardonshe hesitated observing in the dead silence that ensued that the two superior male beings present looked at each other in lofty astonishment  he that is traitrous to his country said lady washington coldly is apt to be traitrous elsewhere  twere as honest to say that he that was traitrous to his king was traitrous to his country said mistress thankful with sudden audacity bending her knit brows on lady washington  but that lady turned dignifiedly away and mistress thankful again faced the general  i ask your pardon she said proudly for troubling you with my wrongs  but it seems to me that even if another and a greater wrong were done me by my sweetheart through jealousy it would not justify this accusation against me even though she added darting a wicked glance at the placid brocaded back of lady washington even though that accusation came from one who knows that jealousy may belong to the wife of a patriot as well as a traitor  she was herself again after this speech although her face was white with the blow she had taken and returned  col hamilton passed his hand across his mouth and coughed slightly gen washington standing by the fire with an impassive face turned to thankful gravely  you are forgetting mistress thankful that you have not told me how i can serve you  it cannot be that you are still concerned in capt brewster who has given evidence against your otherfriends and tacitly against you  nor can it be on their account for i regret to say they are still free and unknown  if you come with any information exculpating them and showing they are not spies or hostile to the cause your fathers release shall be certain and speedy  let me ask you a single question  why do you believe them honest  because said mistress thankful they wereweregentlemen  many spies have been of excellent family good address and fair talents said washington gravely but you have mayhap some other reason  because they talked only to me said mistress thankful blushing mightily because they preferred my company to fathers becauseshe hesitated a momentbecause they spoke not of politics butofthat which lads mainly talk ofandandhere she broke down a littleand the baron i only saw once but hehere she broke down utterlyi know they werent spies there now  i must ask you something more said washington with grave kindness whether you give me the information or not you will consider that if what you believe is true it cannot in any way injure the gentlemen you speak of while on the other hand it may relieve your father of suspicion  will you give to col hamilton my secretary a full description of themthat fuller description which capt brewster for reasons best known to yourself was unable to give  mistress thankful hesitated for a moment and then with one of her truthful glances at the commanderinchief began a detailed account of the outward semblance of the count  why she began with him i am unable to say but possibly it was because it was easier for when she came to describe the baron she was i regret to say somewhat vague and figurative  not so vague however but that col hamilton suddenly started up with a look at his chief who instantly checked it with a gesture of his ruffled hand  i thank you  mistress thankful he said quite impassively but did this other gentleman this baron  pomposo said thankful proudly  a titter originated in the group of ladies by the window and became visible on the fresh face of col hamilton but the dignified color of washingtons countenance was unmoved  may i ask if the baron made an honorable tender of his affections to you he continued with respectful gravityif his attentions were known to your father and were such as honest mistress blossom could receive  father introduced him to me and wanted me to be kind to him hehe kissed me and i slapped his face said thankful quickly with cheeks as red i warrant as the barons might have been  the moment the words had escaped her truthful lips she would have given her life to recall them  to her astonishment however col hamilton laughed outright and the ladies turned and approached her but were checked by a slight gesture from the otherwise impassive figure of the general  it is possible mistress thankful he resumed with undisturbed composure that one at least of these gentlemen may be known to us and that your instincts may be correct  at least rest assured that we shall fully inquire into it and that your father shall have the benefit of that inquiry  i thank your excellency said thankful still reddening under the contemplation of her own late frankness and retreating toward the door  ithinkimustgonow  it is late and i have far to ride  to her surprise however washington stepped forward and again taking her hands in his said with a grave smile for that very reason if for none other you must be our guest tonight mistress thankful blossom  we still retain our virginian ideas of hospitality and are tyrannous enough to make strangers conform to them even though we have but perchance the poorest of entertainment to offer them  lady washington will not permit mistress thankful blossom to leave her roof tonight until she has partaken of her courtesy as well as her counsel  mistress thankful blossom will make us believe that she has at least in so far trusted our desire to serve her justly by accepting our poor hospitality for a single night said lady washington with a stately courtesy  thankful blossom still stood irresolutely at the door  but the next moment a pair of youthful arms encircled her and the younger gentlewoman looking into her brown eyes with an honest frankness equal to her own said caressingly dear mistress thankful though i am but a guest in her ladyships house let me i pray you add my voice to hers  i am mistress schuyler of albany at your service mistress thankful as col hamilton here will bear me witness did i need any interpreter to your honest heart  believe me dear mistress thankful i sympathize with you and only beg you to give me an opportunity tonight to serve you  you will stay i know and you will stay with me and we shall talk over the faithlessness of that overjealous yankee captain who has proved himself i doubt not as unworthy of you as he is of his country  hateful to thankful as was the idea of being commiserated she nevertheless could not resist the gentle courtesy and gracious sympathy of miss schuyler  besides it must be confessed that for the first time in her life she felt a doubt of the power of her own independence and a strange fascination for this young gentlewoman whose arms were around her who could so thoroughly sympathize with her and yet allow herself to be snubbed by lady washington  you have a mother i doubt not said thankful raising her questioning eyes to miss schuyler  irrelevant as this question seemed to the two gentlemen miss schuyler answered it with feminine intuition and you dear mistress thankful  have none said thankful and here i regret to say she whimpered slightly at which miss schuyler with tears in her own fine eyes bent her head suddenly to thankfuls ear put her arm about the waist of the pretty stranger and then to the astonishment of col hamilton quietly swept her out of the august presence  when the door had closed upon them col hamilton turned halfsmilingly halfinquiringly to his chief  washington returned his glance kindly but gravely and then said quietly  if your suspicions jump with mine colonel i need not remind you that it is a matter so delicate that it would be as well if you locked it in your own breast for the present at least that you should not intimate to the gentleman whom you may have suspected aught that has passed this evening  as you will general said the subaltern respectfully but may i askhe hesitatedif you believe that anything more than a passing fancy for a pretty girl  when i asked your silence colonel interrupted washington kindly laying his hand upon the shoulder of the younger man it was because i thought the matter sufficiently momentous to claim my own private and especial attention  i ask your excellencys pardon said the young man reddening through his fresh complexion like a girl i only meant  that you would ask to be relieved tonight interrupted washington with a benign smile forasmuch as you wished the more to show entertainment to our dear friend miss schuyler and her guest a wayward girl colonel but methinks an honest one treat her of your own quality colonel but discreetly and not too kindly lest we have mistress schuyler another injured damsel on our hands and with a half playful gesture peculiar to the man and yet not inconsistent with his dignity he half led half pushed his youthful secretary from the room  when the door had closed upon the colonel lady washington rustled toward her husband who stood still quiet and passive on the hearthstone  you surely see in this escapade nothing of political intrigueno treachery she said hastily  no said washington quietly  nothing more than an idle wanton intrigue with a foolish vain country girl  pardon me my lady said washington gravely  i doubt not we may misjudge her  tis no common rustic lass that can thus stir the country side  twere an insult to your sex to believe it  it is not yet sure that she has not captured even so high game as she has named if she has it would add another interest to a treaty of comity and alliance  that creature said lady washingtonthat lightolove with her connecticut captain lover  pardon me but this is preposterous and with a stiff courtesy she swept from the room leaving the central figure of historyas such central figures are apt to be leftalone  later in the evening mistress schuyler so far subdued the tears and emotions of thankful that she was enabled to dry her eyes and rearrange her brown hair in the quaint little mirror in mistress schuylers chamber mistress schuyler herself lending a touch and suggestion here and there after the secret freemasonry of her sex you are well rid of this forsworn captain dear mistress thankful and methinks that with hair as beautiful as yours the new style of wearing it though a modish frivolity is most becoming  i assure you tis much affected in new york and philadelphiadrawn straight back from the forehead after this manner as you see  the result was that an hour later mistress schuyler and mistress blossom presented themselves to col hamilton in the receptionroom with a certain freshness and elaboration of toilet that not only quite shamed the young officers affaire negligence but caused him to open his eyes in astonishment  perhaps she would rather be alone that she might indulge her grief he said doubtingly in an aside to miss schuyler rather than appear in company  nonsense quoth mistress schuyler  is a young woman to mope and sigh because her lover proves false  but her father is a prisoner said hamilton in amazement  can you look me in the face said mistress schuyler mischievously and tell me that you dont know that in twentyfour hours her father will be cleared of these charges  nonsense  do you think i have no eyes in my head  do you think i misread the generals face and your own  but my dear girl said the officer in alarm  oh i told her so but not why responded miss schuyler with a wicked look in her dark eyes though i had warrant enough to do so to serve you for keeping a secret from me  and with this parthian shot she returned to mistress thankful who with her face pressed against the window was looking out on the moonlit slope beside the whippany river  for by one of those freaks peculiar to the american springtide the weather had again marvellously changed  the rain had ceased and the ground was covered with an icing of sleet and snow that now glittered under a clear sky and a brilliant moon  the northeast wind that shook the loose sashes of the windows had transformed each dripping tree and shrub to icy stalactites that silvered under the moons cold touch  tis a beautiful sight ladies said a bluff hearty middleaged man joining the group by the window  but god send the spring to us quickly and spare us any more such cruel changes  my lady moon looks fine enough glittering in yonder treetops but i doubt not she looks down upon many a poor fellow shivering under his tattered blankets in the camp beyond  had ye seen the connecticut tatterdemalions file by last night with arms reversed showing their teeth at his excellency and yet not daring to bite had ye watched these fainthearts these doubting thomases ripe for rebellion against his excellency against the cause but chiefly against the weatherye would pray for a thaw that would melt the hearts of these men as it would these stubborn fields around us two weeks more of such weather would raise up not one allan brewster but a dozen such malcontent puppies ripe for a drumhead courtmartial  yet tis a fine night gen sullivan said col hamilton sharply nudging the ribs of his superior officer with his elbow  there would be little trouble on such a night i fancy to track our ghostly visitant  both of the ladies becoming interested and col hamilton having thus adroitly turned the flank of his superior officer he went on you should know that the camp and indeed the whole locality here is said to be haunted by the apparition of a graycoated figure whose face is muffled and hidden in his collar but who has the password pat to his lips and whose identity hath baffled the sentries  this figure it is said forasmuch as it has been seen just before an assault an attack or some tribulation of the army is believed by many to be the genius or guardian spirit of the cause and as such has incited sentries and guards to greater vigilance and has to some seemed a premonition of disaster  before the last outbreak of the connecticut militia master graycoat haunted the outskirts of the weatherbeaten and bedraggled camp and i doubt not saw much of that preparation that sent that regiment of fainthearted oniongatherers to flaunt their woes and their wrongs in the face of the general himself  here col hamilton in turn received a slight nudge from mistress schuyler and ended his speech somewhat abruptly  mistress thankful was not unmindful of both these allusions to her faithless lover but only a consciousness of mortification and wounded pride was awakened by them  in fact during the first tempest of her indignation at his arrest still later at the arrest of her father and finally at the discovery of his perfidy to her she had forgotten that he was her lover she had forgotten her previous tenderness toward him and now that her fire and indignation were spent only a sense of numbness and vacancy remained  all that had gone before seemed not something to be regretted as her own act but rather as the act of another thankful blossom who had been lost that night in the snowstorm she felt she had become within the last twentyfour hours not perhaps another woman but for the first time a women  yet it was singular that she felt more confused when a few moments later the conversation turned upon major van zandt it was still more singular that she even felt considerably frightened at that confusion finally she found herself listening with alternate irritability shame and curiosity to praises of that gentleman of his courage his devotion and his personal graces  for one wild moment thankful felt like throwing herself on the breast of mistress schuyler and confessing her rudeness to the major but a conviction that mistress schuyler would share that secret with col hamilton that major van zandt might not like that revelation and oddly enough associated with this a feeling of unconquerable irritability toward that handsome and gentle young officer kept her mouth closed  besides she said to herself he ought to know if hes such a fine gentleman as they say just how i was feeling and that i dont mean any rudeness to him and with this unanswerable feminine logic poor thankful to some extent stilled her own honest little heart  but not i fear entirely  the night was a restless one to her like all impulsive natures the season of reflection and perhaps distrust came to her upon acts that were already committed and when reason seemed to light the way only to despair  she saw the folly of her intrusion at the headquarters as she thought only when it was too late to remedy it she saw the gracelessness and discourtesy of her conduct to major van zandt only when distance and time rendered an apology weak and ineffectual  i think she cried a little to herself lying in the strange gloomy chamber of the healthfully sleeping mistress schuyler the sweet security of whose manifest goodness and kindness she alternately hated and envied and at last unable to stand it longer slipped noiselessly from her bed and stood very wretched and disconsolate before the window that looked out upon the slope toward the whippany river the moon on the newfallen frigid and untrodden snow shone brightly  far to the left it glittered on the bayonet of a sentry pacing beside the riverbank and gave a sense of security to the girl that perhaps strengthened another idea that had grown up in her mind  since she could not sleep why should she not ramble about until she could  she had been accustomed to roam about the farm in all weathers and at all times and seasons  she recalled to herself the nighta tempestuous onewhen she had risen in serious concern as to the lyingin of her favorite alderney heifer and how she had saved the life of the calf a weakling dropped apparently from the clouds in the tempest as it lay beside the barn  with this in her mind she donned her dress again and with mistress schuylers mantle over her shoulders noiselessly crept down the narrow staircase passed the sleeping servant on the settee and opening the rear door in another moment was inhaling the crisp air and tripping down the crisp snow of the hillside  but mistress thankful had overlooked one difference between her own farm and a military encampment  she had not proceeded a dozen yards before a figure apparently started out of the ground beneath her and levelling a bayoneted musket across her path called halt  the hot blood mounted to the girls cheek at the first imperative command she had ever received in her life nevertheless she halted unconsciously and without a word confronted the challenger with her old audacity  who comes there reiterated the sentry still keeping his bayonet level with her breast  thankful blossom she responded promptly  the sentry brought his musket to a present  pass thankful blossom and god send it soon and the spring with it and goodnight he said with a strong milesian accent  and before the stillamazed girl could comprehend the meaning of his abrupt challenge or his equally abrupt departure he had resumed his monotonous pace in the moonlight indeed as she stood looking after him the whole episode the odd unreality of the moonlit landscape the novelty of her position the morbid play of her thoughts seemed to make it part of a dream which the morning light might dissipate but could never fully explain  with something of this feeling still upon her she kept her way to the river  its banks were still fringed with ice through which its dark current flowed noiselessly  she knew it flowed through the camp where lay her faithless lover and for an instant indulged the thought of following it and facing him with the proof of his guilt but even at the thought she recoiled with a new and sudden doubt in herself and stood dreamily watching the shimmer of the moon on the icy banks until another and it seemed to her equally unreal vision suddenly stayed her feet and drove the blood from her feverish cheeks  a figure was slowly approaching from the direction of the sleeping encampment  tall erect and habited in a gray surtout with a hood partially concealing its face it was the counterfeit presentment of the ghostly visitant she had heard described thankful scarcely breathed  the brave little heart that had not quailed before the sentrys levelled musket a moment before now faltered and stood still as the phantom with a slow and majestic tread moved toward her  she had only time to gain the shelter of a tree before the figure majestically unconscious of her presence passed slowly by  through all her terror thankful was still true to a certain rustic habit of practical perception to observe that the tread of the phantom was quite audible over the crust of snow and was visible and palpable as the imprint of a military boot  the blood came back to thankfuls cheek and with it her old audacity in another instant she was out from the tree and tracking with a light feline tread the apparition that now loomed up the hill before her slipping from tree to tree she followed until it passed before the door of a low hut or farmshed that stood midway up the hill  here it entered and the door closed behind it  with every sense feverishly alert thankful from the secure advantage of a large maple watched the door of the hut  in a few moments it reopened to the same figure free of its gray enwrappings  forgetful of every thing now but detecting the face of the impostor the fearless girl left the tree and placed herself directly in the path of the figure  at the same moment it turned toward her inquiringly and the moonlight fell full upon the calm composed features of gen washington  in her consternation thankful could only drop an embarrassed courtesy and hang out two lovely signals of distress in her cheeks  the face of the pseudo ghost alone remained unmoved  you are wandering late mistress thankful he said at last with a paternal gravity and i fear that the formal restraint of a military household has already given you some embarrassment yonder sentry for instance might have stopped you  oh he did said thankful quickly but its all right please your excellency  he asked me who went there and i told him and he was vastly polite i assure you  the grave features of the commanderinchief relaxed in a smile you are more happy than most of your sex in turning a verbal compliment to practical account  for know then dear young lady that in honor of your visit to the headquarters the password tonight through this encampment was none other than your own pretty patronymicthankful blossom  the tears glittered in the girls eyes and her lip trembled but with all her readiness of speech she could only say oh your excellency  then you did pass the sentry continued washington looking at her intently with a certain grave watchfulness in his gray eyes and doubtless you wandered at the riverbank  although i myself tempted by the night sometimes extend my walk as far as yonder shed it were a hazardous act for a young lady to pass beyond the protection of the line  oh i met no one your excellency said the usually truthful thankful hastily rushing to her first lie with grateful impetuosity  and saw no one asked washington quietly  no one said thankful raising her brown eyes to the generals  they both looked at each otherthe naturally most veracious young woman in the colonies and the subsequent allegorical impersonation of truth in americaand knew each other lied and i imagine respected each other for it  i am glad to hear you say so mistress thankful said washington quietly for twould have been natural for you to have sought an interview with your recreant lover in yonder camp though the attempt would have been unwise and impossible  i had no such thought your excellency said thankful who had really quite forgotten her late intention yet if with your permission i could hold a few moments converse with capt brewster it would greatly ease my mind  twould not be well for the present said washington thoughtfully but in a day or two capt brewster will be tried by courtmartial at morristown  it shall be so ordered that when he is conveyed thither his guard shall halt at the blossom farm  i will see that the officer in command gives you an opportunity to see him  and i think i can promise also mistress thankful that your father shall be also present under his own roof a free man  they had reached the entrance to the mansion and entered the hall thankful turned impulsively and kissed the extended hand of the commander  you are so good  i have been so foolishso very very wrong she said with a slight trembling of her lip  and your excellency believes my story and those gentlemen were not spies but even as they gave themselves to be  i said not that much replied washington with a kindly smile but no matter  tell me rather mistress thankful how far your acquaintance with these gentlemen has gone or did it end with the box on the ear that you gave the baron  he had asked me to ride with him to the baskingridge and ihad saidyes faltered mistress thankful  unless i misjudge you mistress thankful you can without great sacrifice promise me that you will not see him until i give you my permission said washington with grave playfulness  the swinging light shone full in thankfuls truthful eyes as she lifted them to his  i do she said quietly  goodnight said the commander with a formal bow  goodnight your excellency    iv  the sun was high over the short hills when mistress thankful the next day drew up her sweating mare beside the blossom farm gate she had never looked prettier she had never felt more embarrassed as she entered her own house  during her rapid ride she had already framed a speech of apology to major van zandt which however utterly fled from her lips as that officer showed himself respectfully on the threshold yet she permitted him to usurp the functions of the grinning caesar and help her from her horse albeit she was conscious of exhibiting the awkward timidity of a bashful rustic until at last with a stammering thank ye she actually ran up stairs to hide her glowing face and far too conscious eyelids  during the rest of that day major van zandt quietly kept out of the way without obtrusively seeming to avoid her  yet when they met casually in the performance of her household duties the innocent mistress thankful noticed under her downcast penitential eyelids that the eyes of the officer followed her intently  and thereat she fell unconsciously to imitating him and so they eyed each other furtively like cats and rubbed themselves along the walls of rooms and passages when they met lest they should seem designedly to come near each other and enacted the gravest and most formal of genuflexions courtesies and bows when they accidentally did meet  and just at the close of the second day as the elegant major van zandt was feeling himself fast becoming a drivelling idiot and an awkward country booby the arrival of a courier from headquarters saved that gentleman his selfrespect forever  mistress thankful was in her sittingroom when he knocked at her door she opened it in sudden conscious trepidation  i ask pardon for intruding mistress thankful blossom he said gravely but i have herehe held out a pretentious documenta letter for you from headquarters  may i hope that it contains good newsthe release of your fatherand that it relieves you from my presence and an espionage which i assure you cannot be more unpleasant to you than it has been to myself  as he entered the room thankful had risen to her feet with the full intention of delivering to him her little set apology but as he ended his speech she looked at him blankly and burst out crying  of course he was in an instant at her side and holding her cold little hand  then she managed to say between her tears that she had been wanting to make an apology to him that she had wanted to say ever since she arrived that she had been rude very rude and that she knew he never could forgive her that she had been trying to say that she never could forget his gentle forbearance only she added suddenly raising her tearfringed brown lids to the astonished man you wouldnt ever let me  dear mistress thankful said the major in consciencestricken horror if i have made myself distant to you believe me it was only because i feared to intrude upon your sorrow  i reallydear mistress thankfuli  when you took all the pains to go round the hall instead of through the diningroom lest i should ask you to forgive me sobbed mistress thankful i thoughtyoumusthate me and preferred to  perhaps this letter may mitigate your sorrow mistress thankful said the officer pointing to the letter she still held unconsciously in her hand  with a blush at her preoccupation thankful opened the letter  it was a halfofficial document and ran as follows   the commanderinchief is glad to inform mistress thankful blossom that the charges preferred against her father have upon fair examination been found groundless and trivial  the commanderinchief further begs to inform mistress blossom that the gentleman known to her under the name of the baron pomposo was his excellency don juan morales ambassador and envoy extraordinary of the court of spain and that the gentleman known to her as the count ferdinand was senor godoy secretary to the embassy  the commanderinchief wishes to add that mistress thankful blossom is relieved of any further obligation of hospitality toward these honorable gentlemen as the commanderinchief regrets to record the sudden and deeplytobedeplored death of his excellency this morning by typhoid fever and the possible speedy return of the embassy  in conclusion the commanderinchief wishes to bear testimony to the truthfulness intuition and discretion of mistress thankful blossom  by order of his excellency   gen george washington  alex hamilton secretary  to mistress thankful blossom of blossom farm   thankful blossom was silent for a few moments and then raised her abashed eyes to major van zandt  a single glance satisfied her that he knew nothing of the imposture that had been practised upon herknew nothing of the trap into which her vanity and selfwill had led her  dear mistress thankful said the major seeing the distress in her face i trust the news is not ill  surely i gathered from the sergeant that  what said thankful looking at him intently  that in twentyfour hours at furthest your father would be free and that i should be relieved  i know that you are aweary of your task major said thankful bitterly rejoice then to know your information is correct and that my father is exoneratedunlessunless this is a forgery and gen washington should turn out to be somebody else and you should turn out to be somebody else  and she stopped short and hid her wet eyes in the windowcurtains  poor girl said major van zandt to himself  this trouble has undoubtedly frenzied her  fool that i was to lay up the insult of one that sorrow and excitement had bereft of reason and responsibility twere better i should retire at once and leave her to herself and the young man slowly retreated toward the door  but at this moment there were alarming symptoms of distress in the windowcurtain and the major paused as a voice from its dimity depths said plaintively and you are going without forgiving me  forgive you mistress thankful said the major striding to the curtain and seizing a little hand that was obtruded from its foldsforgive you rather can you forgive me for the follythe cruelty of mistakingofofand here the major hitherto famous for facile compliments utterly broke down  but the hand he held was no longer cold but warm and intelligent and in default of coherent speech he held fast by that as the thread of his discourse until mistress thankful quietly withdrew it thanked him for his forgiveness and retired deeper behind the curtain  when he had gone she threw herself in a chair and again gave way to a passionate flood of tears  in the last twentyfour hours her pride had been utterly humbled the independent spirit of this selfwilled little beauty had met for the first time with defeat when she had got over her womanly shock at the news of the sham barons death she had i fear only a selfish regard at his taking off believing that if living he would in some way show the worldwhich just then consisted of the headquarters and major van zandtthat he had really made love to her and possibly did honorably love her still and might yet give her an opportunity to reject him  and now he was dead and she was held up to the world as the conceited plaything of a fine gentlemans masquerading sport  that her fathers cupidity and ambition made him sanction the imposture in her bitterness she never doubted  no  lover friend fatherall had been false to her and the only kindness she had received was from the men she had wantonly insulted  poor little blossom indeed a most premature blossom i fear a most unthankful blossom sitting there shivering in the first chill wind of adversity rocking backward and forward with the skirt of her dimity shortgown over her shoulders and her little buckled shoes and clocked stockings pathetically crossed before her  but healthy youth is reactive and in an hour or two thankful was down at the cowshed with her arms around the neck of her favorite heifer to whom she poured out much of her woes and from whom she won an intelligent sort of slobbering sympathy  and then she sharply scolded caesar for nothing at all and a moment after returned to the house with the air and face of a deeply injured angel who had been disappointed in some celestial idea of setting this world right but was still not above forgivenessa spectacle that sunk major van zandt into the dark depths of remorse and eventually sent him to smoke a pipe of virginia with his men in the roadside camp seeing which thankful went early to bed and cried herself to sleep  and nature possibly followed her example for at sunset a great thaw set in and by midnight the freed rivers and brooks were gurgling melodiously and tree and shrub and fence were moist and dripping  the red dawn at last struggled through the vaporous veil that hid the landscape  then occurred one of those magical changes peculiar to the climate yet perhaps preeminently notable during that historic winter and spring  by ten oclock on that 3d of may 1780 a fervent junelike sun had rent that vaporous veil and poured its direct rays upon the gaunt and haggard profile of the jersey hills  the chilled soil responded but feebly to that kiss perhaps a few of the willows that yellowed the riverbanks took on a deeper color  but the country folk were certain that spring had come at last and even the correct and selfsustained major van zandt came running in to announce to mistress thankful that one of his men had seen a violet in the meadow in another moment mistress thankful had donned her cloak and pattens to view this firstling of the laggard summer  it was quite natural that major van zandt should accompany her as she tripped on and so without a thought of their past differences they ran like very children down the moist and rocky slope that led to the quaggy meadow  such was the influence of the vernal season  but the violets were hidden  mistress thankful regardless of the wet leaves and her new gown groped with her fingers among the withered grasses  major van zandt leaned against a bowlder and watched her with admiring eyes  youll never find flowers that way she said at last looking up to him impatiently  go down on your knees like an honest man there are some things in this world worth stooping for  the major instantly dropped on his knees beside her  but at that moment mistress thankful found her posies and rose to her feet stay where you are she said mischievously as she stooped down and placed a flower in the lapel of his coat  that is to make amends for my rudeness  now get up  but the major did not rise  he caught the two little hands that had seemed to flutter like birds against his breast and looking up into the laughing face above him said dear mistress thankful dare i remind you of your own words that there be some things worth stooping for  think of my love mistress thankful as a flowermayhap not as gracious to you as your violets but as honest andandandas  ready to spring up in a single night laughed thankful  but no get up major  what would the fine ladies of morristown say of your kneeling at the feet of a country girlthe play and sport of every fine gentleman  what if mistress bolton should see her own cavalier the modish major van zandt proffering his affections to the disgraced sweetheart of a perjured traitor  leave go my hand i pray you majorif you respect  she was free yet she faltered a moment beside him with tears quivering on her long brown lashes  then she said tremulously rise up major  let us think no more of this  i pray you forgive me if i have again been rude  the major struggled to rise to his feet  but he could not  and then i regret to have to record that the fact became obvious that one of his shapely legs was in a boghole and that he was perceptibly sinking out of sight  whereat mistress thankful trilled out a threesyllabled laugh looked demure and painfully concerned at his condition and then laughed again  the major joined in her mirth albeit his face was crimson  and then with a little cry of alarm she flew to his side and put her arms around him  keep away keep away for heavens sake mistress blossom he said quickly or i shall plunge you into my mishap and make you as ridiculous as myself  but the quickwitted girl had already leaped to an adjacent bowlder take off your sash she said quickly fasten it to your belt and throw it to me  he did so  she straightened herself back on the rock  now all together she cried with a preliminary strain on the sash and then the cords of her welltrained muscles stood out on her rounded arms and with a long pull and a strong pull and a pull all together she landed the major upon the rock  and then she laughed and then inconsistent as it may appear she became grave and at once proceeded to scrape him off and rub him down with dried leaves with ferntwigs with her handkerchief with the border of her mantle as if he were a child until he blushed with alternate shame and secret satisfaction  they spoke but little on their return to the farmhouse for mistress thankful had again become grave  and yet the sun shone cheerily above them the landscape was filled with the joy of resurrection and new and awakened life the breeze whispered gentle promises of hope and the fruition of their hopes in the summer to come  and these two fared on until they reached the porch with a halfpleased halffrightened consciousness that they were not the same beings who had left it a halfhour before  nevertheless at the porch mistress thankful regained something of her old audacity  as they stood together in the hall she handed him back the sash she had kept with her  as she did so she could not help saying there are some things worth stooping for major van zandt  but she had not calculated upon the audacity of the man and as she turned to fly she was caught by his strong arm and pinioned to his side  she struggled honestly i think and perhaps more frightened at her own feelings than at his strength but it is to be recorded that he kissed her in a moment of comparative yielding and then frightened himself released her quickly whereat she fled to her room and threw herself panting and troubled upon her bed  for an hour or two she lay there with flushed cheeks and conflicting thoughts  he must never kiss me again she said softly to herself unlessbut the interrupting thought said i shall die if he kiss me not again and i never can kiss another  and then she was roused by a footstep upon the stair which in that brief time she had learned to know and look for and a knock at the door she opened it to major van zandt white and so colorless as to bring out once more the faint red line made by her ridingwhip two days before as if it had risen again in accusation  the blood dropped out of her cheeks as she gazed at him in silence  an escort of dragoons said major van zandt slowly and with military precision has just arrived bringing with them one capt allan brewster of the connecticut contingent on his way to morristown to be tried for mutiny and treason  a private note from col hamilton instructs me to allow him to have a private audience with youif you so wish it  with a womans swift and too often hopeless intuition thankful knew that this was not the sole contents of the letter and that her relations with capt brewster were known to the man before her but she drew herself up a little proudly and turning her truthful eyes upon the major said i do so wish it  it shall be done as you desire mistress blossom returned the officer with cold politeness as he turned upon his heel  one moment major van zandt said thankful swiftly  the major turned quickly but thankfuls eyes were gazing thoughtfully forward and scarcely glanced at him  i would prefer she said timidly and hesitatingly that this interview should not take place under the roof wherewherewheremy father lives  halfway down the meadow there is a barn and before it a broken part of the wall fronting on a sycamoretree  he will know where it is  tell him i will see him there in half an hour  a smile which the major had tried to make a careless one curled his lip satirically as he bowed in reply  it is the first time he said dryly that i believe i have been honored with arranging a tryst for two lovers but believe me mistress thankful i will do my best  in half an hour i will turn my prisoner over to you  in half an hour the punctual mistress thankful with a hood hiding her pale face passed the officer in the hall on the way to her rendezvous  an hour later caesar came with a message that mistress thankful would like to see him  when the major entered the sittingroom he was shocked to find her lying pale and motionless on the sofa but as the door closed she rose to her feet and confronted him  i do not know she said slowly whether you are aware that the man i just now parted from was for a twelvemonth past my sweetheart and that i believed i loved him and knew i was true to him  if you have not heard it i tell you now for the time will come when you will hear part of it from the lips of others and i would rather you should take the whole truth from mine  this man was false to me  he betrayed two friends of mine as spies  i could have forgiven it had it been only foolish jealousy but it was i have since learned from his own lips only that he might gratify his spite against the commanderinchief by procuring their arrest and making a serious difficulty in the american camp by means of which he hoped to serve his own ends  he told me this believing that i sympathized with him in his hatred of the commanderinchief and in his own wrongs and sufferings  i confess to my shame major van zandt that two days ago i did believe him and that i looked upon you as a mere catchpoll or bailiff of the tyrant that i found out how i was deceived when i saw the commanderinchief you major who know him so well need not be told  nor was it necessary for me to tell this man that he had deceived me for i felt thatthatwasnottheonly reasonwhy i could no longer returnhis love  she paused as the major approached her earnestly and waved him back with her hand  he reproached me bitterly with my want of feeling for his misfortunes she went on again he recalled my past protestations he showed me my loveletters and he told me that if i were still his true sweetheart i ought to help him  i told him if he would never call me by that name again if he would give up all claim to me if he would never speak write to me nor see me again if he would hand me back my lettersi would help him  she stopped the blood rushed into her pale face  you will remember major that i accepted this mans love as a young foolish trustful girl but when i made him this offerhehe accepted it  the dog said major van zandt  but in what way could you help this double traitor  i have helped him said thankful quietly  but how said major van zandt  by becoming a traitor myself she said turning upon him almost fiercely  hear me  while you were quietly pacing these halls while your men were laughing and talking in the road caesar was saddling my white mare the fleetest in the country  he led her to the lane below that mare is now two miles away with capt brewster on her back  why do you not start major  look at me  i am a traitor and this is my bribe and she drew a package of letters from her bosom and flung them on the table  she had been prepared for an outbreak or exclamation from the man before her but not for his cold silence  speak she cried at last passionately  speak  open your lips if only to curse me order in your men to arrest me  i will proclaim myself guilty and save your honor  but only speak  may i ask said major van zandt coldly why you have twice honored me with a blow  because i loved you because when i first saw you i saw the only man that was my master and i rebelled because when i found i could not help but love you i knew i never had loved before and i would wipe out with one stroke all the past that rose in judgment against me because i would not have you ever confronted with one endearing word of mine that was not meant for you  major van zandt turned from the window where he had stood and faced the girl with sad resignation  if i have in my foolishness mistress thankful shown you how great was your power over me when you descended to this artifice to spare my feelings by confessing your own love for me you should have remembered that you were doing that which forever kept me from wooing or winning you  if you had really loved me your heart as a womans would have warned you against that which my heart as a gentlemans has made a law of honor when i tell you as much for the sake of relieving your own conscience as for the sake of justifying mine that if this man a traitor my prisoner and your recognized lover had escaped from my custody without your assistance connivance or even knowledge i should have deemed it my duty to forsake you until i caught him even if we had been standing before the altar  thankful heard him but only as a strange voice in the distance as she stood with fixed eyes and breathless parted lips before him yet even then i fear that womanlike she did not comprehend his rhetoric of honor but only caught here and there a dull benumbing idea that he despised her and that in her effort to win his love she had killed it and ruined him forever  if you think it strange continued the major that believing as i do i stand here only to utter moral axioms when my duty calls me to pursue your lover i beg you to believe that it is only for your sake i wish to allow a reasonable time between your interview with him and his escape that shall save you from any suspicion of complicity  do not think he added with a sad smile as the girl made an impatient step toward him do not think i am running any risk  the man cannot escape  a cordon of pickets surrounds the camp for many miles  he has not the countersign and his face and crime are known  yes said thankful eagerly but a part of his own regiment guards the baskingridge road  how know you this said the major seizing her hand  he told me  before she could fall on her knees and beg his forgiveness he had darted from the room given an order and returned with cheeks and eyes blazing  hear me he said rapidly taking the girls two hands you know not what youve done  i forgive you  but this is no longer a matter of duty but my personal honor  i shall pursue this man alone  i shall return with him or not at all  farewell  god bless you  but before he reached the door she caught him again  only say you have forgiven me once more  i do  guert  there was something in the girls voice more than this first utterance of his christian name that made him pause  i toldaliejustnow  there is a fleeter horse in the stable than my mare tis the roan filly in the second stall  god bless you  he was gone  she waited to hear the clatter of his horses hoofs in the roadway  when caesar came in a few moments later to tell the news of capt brewsters escape the room was empty but it was soon filled again by a dozen turbulent troopers  of course shes gone said sergeant tibbitts the jade flew with the captain  ay tis plain enough  two horses are gone from the stable besides the majors said private hicks  nor was this military criticism entirely a private one  when the courier arrived at headquarters the next morning it was to bring the report that mistress thankful blossom after assisting her lover to escape had fled with him  the renegade is well off our hands said gen sullivan gruffly he has saved us the public disgrace of a trial but this is bad news of major van zandt  what news of the major asked washington quickly  he pursued the vagabond as far as springfield killing his horse and falling himself insensible before major mertons quarters here he became speedily delirious fever supervened and the regimental surgeon after a careful examination pronounced his case one of smallpox  a whisper of horror and pity went around the room  another gallant soldier who should have died leading a charge laid by the heels by a beggars filthy distemper growled sullivan  where will it end  god knows said hamilton  poor van zandt  but whither was he sentto the hospital  no a special permit was granted in his case and tis said he was removed to the blossom farmit being remote from neighborsand the house placed under quarantine  abner blossom has prudently absented himself from the chances of infection and the daughter has fled  the sick man is attended only by a black servant and an ancient crone so that if the poor major escapes with his life or without disfigurement pretty mistress bolton of morristown need not be scandalized or jealous    v  the ancient crone alluded to in the last chapter had been standing behind the windowcurtains of that bedroom which had been thankful blossoms in the weeks gone by  she did not move her head but stood looking demurely after the manner of ancient crones over the summer landscape  for the summer had come before the tardy spring was scarce gone and the elms before the window no longer lisped but were eloquent in the softest zephyrs  there was the flash of birds in among the bushes the occasional droning of bees in and out the open window and a perpetually swinging censer of flower incense rising from below the farm had put on its gayest bridal raiment and looking at the old farmhouse shadowed with foliage and green with creeping vines it was difficult to conceive that snow had ever lain on its porches or icicles swung from its mossy eaves  thankful said a voice still tremulous with weakness  the ancient crone turned drew aside the curtains and showed the sweet face of thankful blossom more beautiful even in its paleness  come here darling repeated the voice  thankful stepped to the sofa whereon lay the convalescent major van zandt  tell me sweetheart said the major taking her hand in his when you married me as you told the chaplain that you might have the right to nurse me did you never think that if death spared me i might be so disfigured that even you dear love would have turned from me with loathing  that was why i did it dear said thankful mischievously  i knew that the pride and the sense of honor and selfdevotion of some people would have kept them from keeping their promises to a poor girl  but darling continued the major raising her hand to his lips suppose the case had been reversed suppose you had taken the disease that i had recovered without disfigurement but that this sweet face  i thought of that too interrupted thankful  well what would you have done dear said the major with his old mischievous smile  i should have died said thankful gravely  but how  somehow  but you are to go to sleep and not ask impertinent and frivolous questions for father is coming tomorrow  thankful dear do you know what the trees and the birds said to me as i lay there tossing with fever  no dear  thankful blossom  thankful blossom  thankful blossom is coming  do you know what i said sweetheart as i lifted your dear head from the ground when you reeled from your horse just as i overtook you at springfield  no dear  there are some things in life worth stooping for  and she winged this parthian arrow home with a kiss
