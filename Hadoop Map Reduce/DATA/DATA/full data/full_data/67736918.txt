import to one capable of inspiring them yet i cannot deny myself the pleasure of so far intruding on your reserve as at least to make public acknowledgment of the debt i can never repay    contents   dante  spenser  wordsworth  milton  keats      dante1  on the banks of a little river so shrunken by the suns of summer that it seems fast passing into a tradition but swollen by the autumnal rains with an italian suddenness of passion till the massy bridge shudders under the impatient heap of waters behind it stands a city which in its period of bloom not so large as boston may well rank next to athens in the history which teaches come l uom s eterna  originally only a convenient spot in the valley where the fairs of the neighboring etruscan city of fiesole were held it gradually grew from a huddle of booths to a town and then to a city which absorbed its ancestral neighbor and became a cradle for the arts the letters the science and the commerce2 of modern europe for her cimabue wrought who infused byzantine formalism with a suggestion of nature and feeling for her the pisani who divined at least if they could not conjure with it the secret of greek supremacy in sculpture for her the marvellous boy ghiberti proved that unity of composition and grace of figure and drapery were never beyond the reach of genius3 for her brunelleschi curved the dome which michel angelo hung in air on st peters for her giotto reared the belltower graceful as an horatian ode in marble and the great triumvirate of italian poetry good sense and culture called her mother there is no modern city about which cluster so many elevating associations none in which the past is so contemporary with us in unchanged buildings and undisturbed monuments the house of dante is still shown children still receive baptism at the font il mio bel san giovanni where he was christened before the acorn dropped that was to grow into a keel for columbus and an inscribed stone marks the spot where he used to sit and watch the slow blocks swing up to complete the masterthought of arnolfo in the convent of st mark hard by lived and labored beato angelico the saint of christian art and fra bartolommeo who taught raphael dignity from the same walls savonarola went forth to his triumphs shortlived almost as the crackle of his martyrdom the plain little chamber of michel angelo seems still to expect his return his last sketches lie upon the table his staff leans in the corner and his slippers wait before the empty chair on one of the vineclad hills just without the city walls ones feet may press the same stairs that milton climbed to visit galileo to an american there is something supremely impressive in this cumulative influence of the past full of inspiration and rebuke something saddening in this repeated proof that moral supremacy is the only one that leaves monuments and not ruins behind it time who with us obliterates the labor and often the names of yesterday seems here to have spared almost the prints of the care piante that shunned the sordid paths of worldly honor  around the courtyard of the great museum of florence stand statues of her illustrious dead her poets painters sculptors architects inventors and statesmen and as the traveller feels the ennobling lift of such society and reads the names or recognizes the features familiar to him as his own threshold he is startled to find fame as commonplace here as notoriety everywhere else and that this fifthrate city should have the privilege thus to commemorate so many famous men her sons whose claim to preeminence the whole world would concede among them is one figure before which every scholar every man who has been touched by the tragedy of life lingers with reverential pity the haggard cheeks the lips clamped together in unfaltering resolve the scars of lifelong battle and the brow whose sharp outline seems the monument of final victory this at least is a face that needs no name beneath it this is he who among literary fames finds only two that for growth and immutability can parallel his own the suffrages of highest authority would now place him second in that company where he with proud humility took the sixth place4  dante durante by contraction dante degli alighieri was born at florence in 1265 probably during the month of may5 this is the date given by boccaccio who is generally followed though he makes a blunder in saying sedendo urbano quarto nella cattedra di san pietro for urban died in october 1264 some misled by an error in a few of the early manuscript copies of the divina commedia would have him born five years earlier in 1260 according to arrivabene6 sansovino was the first to confirm boccaccios statement by the authority of the poet himself basing his argument on the first verse of the inferno    nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita  the average age of man having been declared by the psalmist to be seventy years and the period of the poets supposed vision being unequivocally fixed at 13007 leonardo aretino and manetti add their testimony to that of boccaccio and 1265 is now universally assumed as the true date voltaire8 nevertheless places the poets birth in 1260 and jauntily forgives bayle who he says écrivait à rotterdam currente calamo pour son libraire for having been right declaring that he esteems him neither more nor less for having made a mistake of five years oddly enough voltaire adopts this alleged blunder of five years on the next page in saying that dante died at the age of 56 though he still more oddly omits the undisputed date of his death 1321 which would have shown bayle to be right the poets descent is said to have been derived from a younger son of the great roman family of the frangipani classed by the popular rhyme with the orsini and colonna    colonna orsini e frangipani   prendono oggi e pagano domani  that his ancestors had been long established in florence is an inference from some expressions of the poet and from their dwelling having been situated in the more ancient part of the city the most important fact of the poets genealogy is that he was of mixed race the alighieri being of teutonic origin dante was born as he himself tells us9 when the sun was in the constellation gemini and it has been absurdly inferred from a passage in the inferno10 that his horoscope was drawn and a great destiny predicted for him by his teacher brunetto latini the ottimo comento tells us that the twins are the house of mercury who induces in men the faculty of writing science and of acquiring knowledge this is worth mentioning as characteristic of the age and of dante himself with whom the influence of the stars took the place of the old notion of destiny11 it is supposed from a passage in boccaccios life of dante that alighiero the father was still living when the poet was nine years old if so he must have died soon after for leonardo aretino who wrote with original documents before him tells us that dante lost his father while yet a child this circumstance may have been not without influence in muscularizing his nature to that character of selfreliance which shows itself so constantly and sharply during his afterlife his tutor was brunetto latini a very superior man for that age says aretino parenthetically like alexander gill he is now remembered only as the schoolmaster of a great poet and that he did his duty well may be inferred from dantes speaking of him gratefully as one who by times taught him how man eternizes himself this and what villani says of his refining the tuscan idiom for so we understand his farli scorti in bene parlare12 are to be noted as of probable influence on the career of his pupil of the order of dantes studies nothing can be certainly affirmed his biographers send him to bologna padua paris naples and even oxford all are doubtful paris and oxford most of all and the dates utterly undeterminable yet all are possible nay perhaps probable bologna and padua we should be inclined to place before his exile paris and oxford if at all after it if no argument in favor of paris is to be drawn from his pape satan13 and the corresponding paix paix sathan in the autobiography of cellini nor from the very definite allusion to doctor siger14 we may yet infer from some passages in the commedia that his wanderings had extended even farther15 for it would not be hard to show that his comparisons and illustrations from outward things are almost invariably drawn from actual eyesight as to the nature of his studies there can be no doubt that he went through the trivium grammar dialectic rhetoric and the quadrivium arithmetic music geometry and astronomy of the then ordinary university course to these he afterward added painting or at least drawingdesignavo un angelo sopra certe tavolette16 theology and medicine he is said to have been the pupil of cimabue and was certainly the friend of giotto the designs for some of whose frescos at assisi and elsewhere have been wrongly attributed to him though we may safely believe in his helpful comment and suggestion to prove his love of music the episode of casella were enough even without boccaccios testimony the range of dantes study and acquirement would be encyclopedic in any age but at that time it was literally possible to master the omne scibile and he seems to have accomplished it how lofty his theory of science was is plain from this passage in the convito he is not to be called a true lover of wisdom filosofo who loves it for the sake of gain as do lawyers physicians and almost all churchmen li religiosi who study not in order to know but to acquire riches or advancement and who would not persevere in study should you give them what they desire to gain by it and it may be said that as true friendship between men consists in each wholly loving the other the true philosopher loves every part of wisdom and wisdom every part of the philosopher inasmuch as she draws all to herself and allows no one of his thoughts to wander to other things17 the convito gives us a glance into dantes library we find aristotle whom he calls the philosopher the master cited seventysix times cicero eighteen albertus magnus seven boethius six plato at secondhand four aquinas avicenna ptolemy the digest lucan and ovid three each virgil juvenal statius seneca and horace twice each and algazzali alfrogan augustine livy orosius and homer at secondhand once of greek he seems to have understood little of hebrew and arabic a few words but it was not only in the closet and from books that dante received his education he acquired perhaps the better part of it in the streets of florence and later in those homeless wanderings which led him as he says wherever the italian tongue was spoken his were the only open eyes of that century and as nothing escaped them so there is nothing that was not photographed upon his sensitive brain to be afterward fixed forever in the commedia what florence was during his youth and manhood with its guelphs and ghibellines its nobles and trades its bianchi and neri its kaleidoscopic revolutions all parties loving liberty and doing their best to destroy her as voltaire says it would be beyond our province to tell even if we could foreshortened as events are when we look back on them across so many ages only the upheavals of party conflict catching the eye while the spaces of peace between sink out of the view of history a whole century seems like a mere wild chaos yet during a couple of such centuries the cathedrals of florence pisa and siena got built cimabue giotto arnolfo the pisani brunelleschi and ghiberti gave the impulse to modern art or brought it in some of its branches to its culminating point modern literature took its rise commerce became a science and the middle class came into being it was a time of fierce passions and sudden tragedies of picturesque transitions and contrasts it found dante shaped him by every experience that life is capable ofrank ease love study affairs statecraft hope exile hunger dependence despairuntil he became endowed with a sense of the nothingness of this worlds goods possible only to the rich and a knowledge of man possible only to the poor the few wellascertained facts of dantes life may be briefly stated in 1274 occurred what we may call his spiritual birth the awakening in him of the imaginative faculty and of that profounder and more intense consciousness which springs from the recognition of beauty through the antithesis of sex it was in that year that he first saw beatrice portinari in 1289 he was present at the battle of campaldino fighting on the side of the guelphs who there utterly routed the ghibellines and where he says characteristically enough i was present not a boy in arms and where i felt much fear but in the end the greatest pleasure from the various changes of the fight18 in the same year he assisted at the siege and capture of caprona19 in 1290 died beatrice married to simone dei bardi precisely when is uncertain but before 1287 as appears by a mention of her in her fathers will bearing date january 15 of that year dantes own marriage is assigned to various years ranging from 1291 to 1294 but the earlier date seems the more probable as he was the father of seven children the youngest a daughter named beatrice in 1301 his wife was gemma dei donati and through her dante whose family though noble was of the lesser nobility became nearly connected with corso donati the head of a powerful clan of the grandi or greater nobles in 1293 occurred what is called the revolution of gian della bella in which the priors of the trades took the power into their own hands and made nobility a disqualification for office a noble was defined to be any one who counted a knight among his ancestors and thus the descendant of cacciaguida was excluded  della bella was exiled in 1295 but the nobles did not regain their power on the contrary the citizens having all their own way proceeded to quarrel among themselves and subdivided into the popolani grossi and popolani minuti or greater and lesser tradesa distinction of gentility somewhat like that between wholesale and retail tradesmen the grandi continuing turbulent many of the lesser nobility among them dante drew over to the side of the citizens and between 1297 and 1300 there is found inscribed in the book of the physicians and apothecaries dante d aldighiero degli aldighieri poeta fiorentino20 professor de vericour21 thinks it necessary to apologize for this lapse on the part of the poet and gravely bids us take courage nor think that dante was ever an apothecary in 1300 we find him elected one of the priors of the city in order to a perfect misunderstanding of everything connected with the florentine politics of this period one has only to study the various histories the result is a spectrum on the minds eye which looks definite and brilliant but really hinders all accurate vision as if from too steady inspection of a catharinewheel in full whirl a few words however are necessary if only to make the confusion palpable the rival german families of welfs and weiblingens had given their names softened into guelfi and ghibellinifrom which gabriel harvey22 ingeniously but mistakenly derives elves and goblinsto two parties in northern italy representing respectively the adherents of the pope and of the emperor but serving very well as rallyingpoints in all manner of intercalary and subsidiary quarrels the nobles especially the greater onesperhaps from instinct perhaps in part from hereditary tradition as being more or less teutonic by descentwere commonly ghibellines or imperialists the bourgeoisie were very commonly guelphs or supporters of the pope partly from natural antipathy to the nobles and partly perhaps because they believed themselves to be espousing the more purely italian side sometimes however the party relation of nobles and burghers to each other was reversed but the names of guelph and ghibelline always substantially represented the same things the family of dante had been guelphic and we have seen him already as a young man serving two campaigns against the other party but no immediate question as between pope and emperor seems then to have been pending and while there is no evidence that he was ever a mere partisan the reverse would be the inference from his habits and character just before his assumption of the priorate however a new complication had arisen a family feud beginning at the neighboring city of pistoja between the cancellieri neri and cancellieri bianchi23 had extended to florence where the guelphs took the part of the neri and the ghibellines of the bianchi24 the city was instantly in a ferment of street brawls as actors in one of which some of the medici are incidentally namedthe first appearance of that family in history both parties appealed at different times to the pope who sent two ambassadors first a bishop and then a cardinal both pacificators soon flung out again in a rage after adding the new element of excommunication to the causes of confusion it was in the midst of these things that dante became one of the six priors june 1300an office which the florentines had made bimestrial in its tenure in order apparently to secure at least six constitutional chances of revolution in the year he advised that the leaders of both parties should be banished to the frontiers which was forthwith done the ostracism including his relative corso donati among the neri and his most intimate friend the poet guido cavalcanti among the bianchi they were all permitted to return before long but after dantes term of office was over and came accordingly bringing at least the scriptural allowance of seven other motives of mischief with them affairs getting worse 1301 the neri with the connivance of the pope boniface viii entered into an arrangement with charles of valois who was preparing an expedition to italy dante was meanwhile sent on an embassy to rome september 1301 according to arrivabene25 but probably earlier by the bianchi who still retained all the offices at florence it is the tradition that he said in setting forth if i go who remains and if i stay who goes whether true or not the story implies what was certainly true that the council and influence of dante were of great weight with the more moderate of both parties on october 31 1301 charles took possession of florence in the interest of the neri dante being still at rome january 27 1302 sentence of exile was pronounced against him and others with a heavy fine to be paid within two months if not paid the entire confiscation of goods and whether paid or no exile the charge against him being pecuniary malversation in office the fine not paid as it could not be without admitting the justice of the charges which dante scorned even to deny in less than two months march 10 1302 a second sentence was registered by which he with others was condemned to be burned alive if taken within the boundaries of the republic26 from this time the life of dante becomes semimythical and for nearly every date we are reduced to the as they say of herodotus he became now necessarily identified with his fellowexiles fragments of all parties united by common wrongs in a practical if not theoretic ghibellinism and shared in their attempts to reinstate themselves by force of arms he was one of their council of twelve but withdrew from it on account of the unwisdom of their measures whether he was present at their futile assault on florence july 22 1304 is doubtful but probably he was not from the ottimo comento written at least in part27 by a contemporary as early as 1333 we learn that dante soon separated himself from his companions in misfortune with mutual discontents and recriminations28 during the nineteen years of dantes exile it would be hard to say where he was not in certain districts of northern italy there is scarce a village that has not its tradition of him its sedia rocca spelonca or torre di dante and what between the patriotic complaisance of some biographers overwilling to gratify as many provincial vanities as possible and the pettishness of others anxious only to snub them the confusion becomes hopeless29 after his banishment we find some definite trace of him first at arezzo with uguccione della faggiuola then at siena then at verona with the scaligeri he himself says through almost all parts where this language italian is spoken a wanderer wellnigh a beggar i have gone showing against my will the wound of fortune truly i have been a vessel without sail or rudder driven to diverse ports estuaries and shores by that hot blast the breath of grievous poverty and i have shown myself to the eyes of many who perhaps through some fame of me had imagined me in quite other guise in whose view not only was my person debased but every work of mine whether done or yet to do became of less account30 by the election of the emperor henry vii of luxemburg november 1308 and the news of his proposed expedition into italy the hopes of dante were raised to the highest pitch henry entered italy october 1310 and received the iron crown of lombardy at milan on the day of epiphany 1311 his movements being slow and his policy undecided dante addressed him that famous letter urging him to crush first the hydra and myrrha florence as the root of all the evils of italy april 16 1311 to this year we must probably assign the new decree by which the seigniory of florence recalled a portion of the exiles excepting dante however among others by name31 the undertaking of henry after an illdirected dawdling of two years at last ended in his death at buonconvento august 24 1313 carlyle says wrongly september poisoned it was said in the sacramental bread by a dominican friar bribed thereto by florence32 the story is doubtful the more as dante nowhere alludes to it as he certainly would have done had he heard of it according to balbo dante spent the time from august 1313 to november 1314 in pisa and lucca and then took refuge at verona with can grande della scala whom voltaire calls drolly enough le grand can de vérone as if he had been a tartar where he remained till 1318 foscolo with equal positiveness sends him immediately after the death of henry to guido da polenta33 at ravenna and makes him join can grande only after the latter became captain of the ghibelline league in december 1318 in 1316 the government of florence set forth a new decree allowing the exiles to return on conditions of fine and penance dante rejected the offer by accepting which his guilt would have been admitted in a letter still hot after these five centuries with indignant scorn is this then the glorious return of dante alighieri to his country after nearly three lustres of suffering and exile did an innocence patent to all merit thisthis the perpetual sweat and toil of study far from a man the housemate of philosophy be so rash and earthen hearted a humility as to allow himself to be offered up bound like a schoolboy or a criminal far from a man the preacher of justice to pay those who have done him wrong as for a favor this is not the way of retaining to my country but if another can be found that shall not derogate from the fame and honor of dante that i will enter on with no lagging steps for if by none such florence may be entered by me then never can i not everywhere behold the mirrors of the sun and stars speculate on sweetest truths under any sky without first giving myself up inglorious nay ignominious to the populace and city of florence nor shall i want for bread dionisi puts the date of this letter in 131534 he is certainly wrong for the decree is dated december 11 1316 foscolo places it in 1316 troya early in 1317 and both may be right as the year began march 25 whatever the date of dantes visit to voltaires great khan35 of verona or the length of his stay with him may have been it is certain that he was in ravenna in 1320 and that on his return thither from an embassy to venice concerning which a curious letter forged probably by doni is extant he died on september 14 1321 13th according to others he was buried at ravenna under a monument built by his friend guido novello36 dante is said to have dictated the following inscription for it on his deathbed    jvra monarchiae svperos phlegethonta lacvsqve   lvstrando cecini volvervnt fata qvovsqve   sed qvia pars cessit melioribvs hospita castris   avctoremqve svvm petiit felicior astris   hic clavdor dantes patriis extorris ab oris   qvem genvit parvi florentia mater amoris  of which this rude paraphrase may serve as a translation    the rights of monarchy the heavens the stream of fire the pit   in vision seen i sang as far as to the fates seemed fit   but since my soul an alien here hath flown to nobler wars   and happier now hath gone to seek its maker mid the stars   here am i dante shut exiled from the ancestral shore   whom florence the of all leastloving mother bore37  if these be not the words of dante what is internal evidence worth the indomitably selfreliant man loyal first of all to his most unpopular convictions his very host guido being a guelph puts his ghibellinism jura monarchiae in the front the man whose whole life like that of selected souls always had been a war fare calls heaven another campa better one thank god the wanderer of so many years speaks of his soul as a guestglad to be gone doubtless the exile whose sharpest reproaches of florence are always those of an outraged lover finds it bitter that even his unconscious bones should lie in alien soil  giovanni villani the earliest authority and a contemporary thus sketches him this man was a great scholar in almost every science though a layman was a most excellent poet philosopher and rhetorician perfect as well in composing and versifying as in haranguing a most noble speaker this dante on account of his learning was a little haughty and shy and disdainful and like a philosopher almost ungracious knew not well how to deal with unlettered folk benvenuto da imola tells us that he was very abstracted as we may well believe of a man who carried the commedia in his brain boccaccio paints him in this wise our poet was of middle height his face was long his nose aquiline his jaw large and the lower lip protruding somewhat beyond the upper a little stooping in the shoulders his eyes rather large than small dark of complexion his hair and beard thick crisp and black and his countenance always sad and thoughtful his garments were always dignified the style such as suited ripeness of years his gait was grave and gentlemanlike and his bearing whether public or private wonderfully composed and polished in meat and drink he was most temperate nor was ever any more zealous in study or whatever other pursuit seldom spake he save when spoken to though a most eloquent person in his youth he delighted especially in music and singing and was intimate with almost all the singers and musicians of his day he was much inclined to solitude and familiar with few and most assiduous in study as far as he could find time for it dante was also of marvellous capacity and the most tenacious memory various anecdotes of him are related by boccaccio sacchetti and others none of them verisimilar and some of them at least fifteen centuries old when revamped most of them are neither veri nor ben trovati one clear glimpse we get of him from the ottimo comento the author of which says38 i the writer heard dante say that never a rhyme had led him to say other than he would but that many a time and oft molte e spesse volte he had made words say for him what they were not wont to express for other poets that is the only sincere glimpse we get of the living breathing wordcompelling dante  looked at outwardly the life of dante seems to have been an utter and disastrous failure what its inward satisfactions must have been we with the paradiso open before us can form some faint conception to him longing with an intensity which only the word dantesque will express to realize an ideal upon earth and continually baffled and misunderstood the far greater part of his mature life must have been labor and sorrow we can see how essential all that sad experience was to him can understand why all the fairy stories hide the luck in the ugly black casket but to him then and there how seemed it    thou shalt relinquish everything of thee   beloved most dearly this that arrow is   shot from the bow of exile first of all   and thou shalt prove how salt a savor hath   the bread of others and how hard a path   to climb and to descend the strangers stairs39  come sa di sale who never wet his bread with tears says goethe knows ye not ye heavenly powers our nineteenth century made an idol of the noble lord who broke his heart in verse once every six months but the fourteenth was lucky enough to produce and not to make an idol of that rarest earthly phenomenon a man of genius who could hold heartbreak at bay for twenty years and would not let himself die till he had done his task at the end of the vita nuova his first work dante wrote down that remarkable aspiration that god would take him to himself after he had written of beatrice such things as were never yet written of woman it was literally fulfilled when the commedia was finished twentyfive years later scarce was dante at rest in his grave when italy felt instinctively that this was her great man boccaccio tells us that in 132940 cardinal poggetto du poiet caused dantes treatise de monarchiâ to be publicly burned at bologna and proposed further to dig up and burn the bones of the poet at ravenna as having been a heretic but so much opposition was roused that he thought better of it yet this was during the pontificate of the frenchman john xxii the reproof of whose simony dante puts in the mouth of st peter who declares his seat vacant41 whose damnation the poet himself seems to prophesy42 and against whose election he had endeavored to persuade the cardinals in a vehement letter in 1350 the republic of florence voted the sum of ten golden florins to be paid by the hands of messer giovanni boccaccio to dantes daughter beatrice a nun in the convent of santa chiara at ravenna in 1396 florence voted a monument and begged in vain for the metaphorical ashes of the man of whom she had threatened to make literal cinders if she could catch him alive in 142943 she begged again but ravenna a dead city was tenacious of the dead poet in 1519 michel angelo would have built the monument but leo x refused to allow the sacred dust to be removed finally in 1829 five hundred and eight years after the death of dante florence got a cenotaph fairly built in santa croce by ricci ugly beyond even the usual lot of such with three colossal figures on it dante in the middle with italy on one side and poesy on the other the tomb at ravenna built originally in 1483 by cardinal bembo was restored by cardinal corsi in 1692 and finally rebuilt in its present form by cardinal gonzaga in 1780 all three of whom commemorated themselves in latin inscriptions it is a little shrine covered with a dome not unlike the tomb of a mohammedan saint and is now the chief magnet which draws foreigners and their gold to ravenna the valet de place says that dante is not buried under it but beneath the pavement of the street in front of it where also he says he saw my lord byron kneel and weep like everything in ravenna it is dirty and neglected  in 1373 august 9 florence instituted a chair of the divina commedia and boccaccio was named first professor he accordingly began his lectures on sunday october 3 following but his comment was broken off abruptly at the 17th verse of the 17th canto of the inferno by the illness which ended in his death december 21 1375 among his successors were filippo villani and filelfo bologna was the first to follow the example of florence benvenuto da imola having begun his lectures according to tiraboschi so early as 1375 chairs were established also at pisa venice piacenza and milan before the close of the century the lectures were delivered in the churches and on feastdays which shows their popular character balbo reckons but this is guesswork that the ms copies of the divina commedia made during the fourteenth century and now existing in the libraries of europe are more numerous than those of all other works ancient and modern made during the same period between the invention of printing and the year 1500 more than twenty editions were published in italy the earliest in 1472 during the sixteenth century there were forty editions during the seventeentha period for italy of sceptical dilettanteismonly three during the eighteenth thirtyfour and already during the first half of the nineteenth at least eighty the first translation was into spanish in 142844 m st rené taillandier says that the commedia was condemned by the inquisition in spain but this seems too general a statement for according to foscolo45 it was the commentary of landino and vellutello and a few verses in the inferno and paradiso which were condemned the first french translation was that of grangier 1596 but the study of dante struck no root there till the present century rivarol who translated the inferno in 1783 was the first frenchman who divined the wonderful force and vitality of the commedia46 the expressions of voltaire represent very well the average opinion of cultivated persons in respect of dante in the middle of the eighteenth century he says the italians call him divine but it is a hidden divinity few people understand his oracles he has commentators which perhaps is another reason for his not being understood his reputation will go on increasing because scarce anybody reads him47 to father bettinelli he writes i estimate highly the courage with which you have dared to say that dante was a madman and his work a monster but he adds what shows that dante had his admirers even in that flippant century there are found among us and in the eighteenth century people who strive to admire imaginations so stupidly extravagant and barbarous48 elsewhere he says that the commedia was an odd poem but gleaming with natural beauties a work in which the author rose in parts above the bad taste of his age and his subject and full of passages written as purely as if they had been of the time of ariosto and tasso49 it is curious to see this antipathetic fascination which dante exercised over a nature so opposite to his own  at the beginning of this century châteaubriand speaks of dante with vague commendation evidently from a very superficial acquaintance and that only with the inferno probably from rivarols version50 since then there have been four or five french versions in prose or verse including one by lamennais but the austerity of dante will not condescend to the conventional elegance which makes the charm of french and the most virile of poets cannot be adequately rendered in the most feminine of languages yet in the works of fauriel ozanam ampère and villemain france has given a greater impulse to the study of dante than any other country except germany into germany the commedia penetrated later how utterly dante was unknown there in the sixteenth century is plain from a passage in the vanity of the arts and sciences of cornelius agrippa where he is spoken of among the authors of lascivious stories there have been many of these historical pandars of which some of obscure fame as aeneas sylvius dantes and petrarch boccace pontanus etc51 the first german translation was that of kannegiesser 1809 versions by streckfuss kopisch and prince john late king of saxony followed goethe seems never to have given that attention to dante which his everalert intelligence might have been expected to bestow on so imposing a moral and aesthetic phenomenon unless the conclusion of the second part of faust be an inspiration of the paradiso we remember no adequate word from him on this theme his remarks on one of the german translations are brief dry and without that breadth which comes only of thorough knowledge and sympathy but german scholarship and constructive criticism through witte kopisch wegele ruth and others have been of preeminent service in deepening the understanding and facilitating the study of the poet in england the first recognition of dante is by chaucer in the hugelin of pisa of the monkes tale52 and an imitation of the opening verses of the third canto of the inferno assembly of foules in 1417 giovanni da serravalle bishop of fermo completed a latin prose translation of the commedia a copy of which as he made it at the request of two english bishops whom he met at the council of constance was doubtless sent to england later we find dante now and then mentioned but evidently from hearsay only53 till the time of spenser who like milton fifty years later shows that he had read his works closely thenceforward for more than a century dante became a mere name used without meaning by literary sciolists lord chesterfield echoes voltaire and dr drake in his literary hours54 could speak of darwins botanic garden as showing the wild and terrible sublimity of dante the first complete english translation was by boydof the inferno in 1785 of the whole poem in 1802 there have been eight other complete translations beginning with carys in 1814 six since 1850 beside several of the inferno singly of these that of longfellow is the best it is only within the last twenty years however that the study of dante in any true sense became at all general even coleridge seems to have been familiar only with the inferno in america professor ticknor was the first to devote a special course of illustrative lectures to dante he was followed by longfellow whose lectures illustrated by admirable translations are remembered with grateful pleasure by many who were thus led to learn the full significance of the great christian poet a translation of the inferno into quatrains by tw parsons ranks with the best for spirit faithfulness and elegance in denmark and russia translations of the inferno have been published beside separate volumes of comment and illustration we have thus sketched the steady growth of dantes fame and influence to a universality unparalleled except in the case of shakespeare perhaps more remarkable if we consider the abstruse and mystical nature of his poetry it is to be noted as characteristic that the veneration of dantophilists for their master is that of disciples for their saint perhaps no other man could have called forth such an expression as that of ruskin that the central man of all the world as representing in perfect balance the imaginative moral and intellectual faculties all at their highest is dante  the first remark to be made upon the writings of dante is that they are all with the possible exception of the treatise de vulgari eloquio autobiographic and that all of them including that are parts of a mutually related system of which the central point is the individuality and experience of the poet in the vita nuova he recounts the story of his love for beatrice portinari showing how his grief for her loss turned his thoughts first inward upon his own consciousness and failing all help there gradually upward through philosophy to religion and so from a world of shadows to one of eternal substances it traces with exquisite unconsciousness the gradual but certain steps by which memory and imagination transubstantiated the woman of flesh and blood into a holy ideal combining in one radiant symbol of sorrow and hope that faith which is the instinctive refuge of unavailing regret that grace of god which higher natures learn to find in the trial which passeth all understanding and that perfect womanhood the dream of youth and the memory of maturity which beckons toward the forever unattainable as a contribution to the physiology of genius no other book is to be compared with the vita nuova it is more important to the understanding of dante as a poet than any other of his works it shows him and that in the midst of affairs demanding practical ability and presence of mind capable of a depth of contemplative abstraction equalling that of a soofi who has passed the fourth step of initiation it enables us in some sort to see how from being the slave of his imaginative faculty he rose by selfculture and force of will to that mastery of it which is art we comprehend the commedia better when we know that dante could be an active clearheaded politician and a mystic at the same time various dates have been assigned to the composition of the vita nuova the earliest limit is fixed by the death of beatrice in 1290 though some of the poems are of even earlier date and the book is commonly assumed to have been finished by 1295 foscolo says 1294 but professor karl witte a high authority extends the term as far as 130055 the title of the book also vita nuova has been diversely interpreted mr garrow who published an english version of it at florence in 1846 entitles it the early life of dante balbo understands it in the same way56 but we are strongly of the opinion that new life is the interpretation sustained by the entire significance of the book itself  his next work in order of date is the treatise de monarchiâ it has been generally taken for granted that dante was a guelph in politics up to the time of his banishment and that out of resentment he then became a violent ghibelline not to speak of the consideration that there is no author whose life and works present so remarkable a unity and logical sequence as those of dante professor witte has drawn attention to a fact which alone is enough to demonstrate that the de monarchiâ was written before 1300 that and the vita nuova are the only works of dante in which no allusion whatever is made to his exile that bitter thought was continually present to him in the convito it betrays itself often and with touching unexpectedness even in the treatise de vulgari eloquio he takes as one of his examples of style i have most pity for those whosoever they are that languish in exile and revisit their country only in dreams we have seen that the one decisive act of dantes priorate was to expel from florence the chiefs of both parties as the sowers of strife and he tells us paradiso xvii that he had formed a party by himself the king of saxony has well defined his political theory as being an ideal ghibellinism57 and he has been accused of want of patriotism only by those shortsighted persons who cannot see beyond their own parish dantes want of faith in freedom was of the same kind with miltons refusing as tacitus had done before to confound license with liberty the argument of the de monarchiâ is briefly this as the object of the individual man is the highest development of his faculties so is it also with men united in societies but the individual can only attain the highest development when all his powers are in absolute subjection to the intellect and society only when it subjects its individual caprices to an intelligent head this is the order of nature as in families and men have followed it in the organization of villages towns cities again since god made man in his own image men and societies most nearly resemble him in proportion as they approach unity but as in all societies questions must arise so there is need of a monarch for supreme arbiter and only a universal monarch can be impartial enough for this since kings of limited territories would always be liable to the temptation of private ends with the internal policy of municipalities commonwealths and kingdoms the monarch would have nothing to do only interfering when there was danger of an infraction of the general peace this is the doctrine of the first book enforced sometimes eloquently always logically and with great fertility of illustration it is an enlargement of some of the obiter dicta of the convito the earnestness with which peace is insisted on as a necessary postulate of civic wellbeing shows what the experience had been out of which dante had constructed his theory it is to be looked on as a purely scholastic demonstration of a speculative thesis in which the manifold exceptions and modifications essential in practical application are necessarily left aside dante almost forestalls the famous proposition of calvin that it is possible to conceive a people without a prince but not a prince without a people when he says non enim gens propter regem sed e converso rex propter gentem58 and in his letter to the princes and peoples of italy on the coming of henry vii he bids them obey their prince but so as freemen preserving their own constitutional forms he says also expressly animadvertendum sane quod cum dicitur humanum genus potest regi per unum supremum principem non sic intelligendum est ut ab illo uno prodire possint municipia et leges municipales habent namque nationes regna et civitates inter se proprietates quas legibus differentibus regulari oportet schlosser the historian compares dantes system with that of the united states59 it in some respects resembled more the constitution of the netherlands under the supreme stadtholder but parallels between ideal and actual institutions are always unsatisfactory60  the second book is very curious in it dante endeavors to demonstrate the divine right of the roman empire to universal sovereignty one of his arguments is that christ consented to be born under the reign of augustus another that he assented to the imperial jurisdiction in allowing himself to be crucified under a decree of one of its courts the atonement could not have been accomplished unless christ suffered under sentence of a court having jurisdiction for otherwise his condemnation would have been an injustice and not a penalty moreover since all mankind was typified in the person of christ the court must have been one having jurisdiction over all mankind and since he was delivered to pilate an officer of tiberius it must follow that the jurisdiction of tiberius was universal he draws an argument also from the wager of battle to prove that the roman empire was divinely permitted at least if not instituted for since it is admitted that god gives the victory and since the romans always won it therefore it was gods will that the romans should attain universal empire in the third book he endeavors to prove that the emperor holds by divine right and not by permission of the pope he assigns supremacy to the pope in spirituals and to the emperor in temporals this was a delicate subject and though the king of saxony a catholic says that dante did not overstep the limits of orthodoxy it was on account of this part of the book that it was condemned as heretical61  next follows the treatise de vulgari eloquio though we have doubts whether we possess this book as dante wrote it inclining rather to think that it is a copy in some parts textually exact in others an abstract there can be no question either of its great glossological value or that it conveys the opinions of dante we put it next in order though written later than the convito only because like the de monarchiâ it is written in latin it is a proof of the national instinct of dante and of his confidence in his genius that he should have chosen to write all his greatest works in what was deemed by scholars a patois but which he more than any other man made a classic language had he intended the de monarchiâ for a political pamphlet he would certainly not have composed it in the dialect of the few the de vulgari eloquio was to have been in four books whether it was ever finished or not it is impossible to say but only two books have come down to us it treats of poetizing in the vulgar tongue and of the different dialects of italy from the particularity with which it treats of the dialect of bologna it has been supposed to have been written in that city or at least to furnish an argument in favor of dantes having at some time studied there in lib ii cap ii is a remarkable passage in which defining the various subjects of song and what had been treated in the vulgar tongue by different poets he says that his own theme had been righteousness  the convito is also imperfect it was to have consisted of fourteen treatises but as we have it contains only four in the first he justifies the use of the vulgar idiom in preference to the latin in the other three he comments on three of his own canzoni it will be impossible to give an adequate analysis of this work in the limits allowed us62 it is an epitome of the learning of that age philosophical theological and scientific as affording illustration of the commedia and of dantes style of thought it is invaluable it is reckoned by his countrymen the first piece of italian prose and there are parts of it which still stand unmatched for eloquence and pathos the italians even such a man as cantù among the rest find in it and a few passages of the commedia the proof that dante as a natural philosopher was wholly in advance of his agethat he had among other things anticipated newton in the theory of gravitation but this is as idle as the claim that shakespeare had discovered the circulation of the blood before harvey63 and one might as well attempt to dethrone newton because chaucer speaks of the love which draws the apple to the earth the truth is that it was only as a poet that dante was great and original glory enough surely to have not more than two competitors and in matters of science as did all his contemporaries sought the guiding hand of aristotle like a child dante is assumed by many to have been a platonist but this is not true in the strict sense of the word like all men of great imagination he was an idealist and so far a platonist as shakespeare might be proved to have been by his sonnets but dantes direct acquaintance with plato may be reckoned at zero and we consider it as having strongly influenced his artistic development for the better that transcendentalist as he was by nature so much so as to be in danger of lapsing into an oriental mysticism his habits of thought should have been made precise and his genius disciplined by a mind so severely logical as that of aristotle this does not conflict with what we believe to be equally true that the platonizing commentaries on his poem like that of landino are the most satisfactory beside the prose already mentioned we have a small collection of dantes letters the recovery of the larger number of which we owe to professor witte they are all interesting some of them especially so as illustrating the prophetic character with which dante invested himself the longest is one addressed to can grande della scalla explaining the intention of the commedia and the method to be employed in its interpretation the authenticity of this letter has been doubted but is now generally admitted  we shall barely allude to the minor poems full of grace and depth of mystic sentiment and which would have given dante a high place in the history of italian literature even had he written nothing else they are so abstract however that without the extrinsic interest of having been written by the author of the commedia they would probably find few readers all that is certainly known in regard to the commedia is that it was composed during the nineteen years which intervened between dantes banishment and death attempts have been made to fix precisely the dates of the different parts but without success and the differences of opinion are bewildering foscolo has constructed an ingenious and forcible argument to show that no part of the poem was published before the authors death the question depends somewhat on the meaning we attach to the word published in an age of manuscript the wide dispersion of a poem so long even as a single one of the three divisions of the commedia would be accomplished very slowly but it is difficult to account for the great fame which dante enjoyed during the latter years of his life unless we suppose that parts at least of his greatest work had been read or heard by a large number of persons this need not however imply publication and witte whose opinion is entitled to great consideration supposes even the inferno not to have been finished before 1314 or 1315 in a matter where certainty would be impossible it is of little consequence to reproduce conjectural dates in the letter to can grande before alluded to dante himself has stated the theme of his song he says that the literal subject of the whole work is the state of the soul after death simply considered but if the work be taken allegorically the subject is man as by merit or demerit through freedom of the will he renders himself liable to the reward or punishment of justice he tells us that the work is to be interpreted in a literal allegorical moral and anagogical sense a mode then commonly employed with the scriptures64 and of which he gives the following example to make which mode of treatment more clear it may be applied in the following verses in exitu israel de aegypto domus jacob de populo barbaro facta est judaea sanctificatio ejus israel potestas ejus65 for if we look only at the literal sense it signifies the going out of the children of israel from egypt in the time of moses if at the allegorical it signifies our redemption through christ if at the moral it signifies the conversion of the soul from the grief and misery of sin to a state of grace and if at the anagogical it signifies the passage of the blessed soul from the bondage of this corruption to the freedom of eternal glory a latin couplet cited by one of the old commentators puts the matter compactly together for us    litera gesta refert quid credas allegoria   moralis quid agas quid speres anagogia  dante tells us that he calls his poem a comedy because it has a fortunate ending and gives its title thus here begins the comedy of dante alighieri a florentine by birth but not in morals66 the poem consists of three parts hell purgatory and paradise each part is divided into thirtythree cantos in allusion to the years of the saviours life for though the hell contains thirtyfour the first canto is merely introductory in the form of the verse triple rhyme we may find an emblem of the trinity and in the three divisions of the threefold state of man sin grace and beatitude symbolic meanings reveal themselves or make themselves suspected everywhere as in the architecture of the middle ages an analysis of the poem would be out of place here but we must say a few words of dantes position as respects modern literature if we except wolfram von eschenbach he is the first christian poet the first indeed we might say the only one whose whole system of thought is colored in every finest fibre by a purely christian theology lapse through sin mediation and redemption these are the subjects of the three parts of the poem or otherwise stated intellectual conviction of the result of sin typified in virgil symbol also of that imperialism whose origin he sang moral conversion after repentance by divine grace typified in beatrice reconciliation with god and actual blinding vision of himthe pure in heart shall see god here are general truths which any christian may accept and find comfort in but the poem comes nearer to us than this it is the real history of a brother man of a tempted purified and at last triumphant human soul it teaches the benign ministry of sorrow and that the ladder of that faith by which man climbs to the actual fruition of things not seen ex quovis ligno non fit but only of the cross manfully borne the poem is also in a very intimate sense an apotheosis of woman indeed as marvells drop of dew mirrored the whole firmament so we find in the commedia the image of the middle ages and the sentimental gyniolatry of chivalry which was at best but skindeep is lifted in beatrice to an ideal and universal plane it is the same with catholicism with imperialism with the scholastic philosophy and nothing is more wonderful than the power of absorption and assimilation in this man who could take up into himself the world that then was and reproduce it with such cosmopolitan truth to human nature and to his own individuality as to reduce all contemporary history to a mere comment on his vision we protest therefore against the parochial criticism which would degrade dante to a mere partisan which sees in him a luther before his time and would clap the bonnet rouge upon his heavenly muse  like all great artistic minds dante was essentially conservative and arriving precisely in that period of transition when church and empire were entering upon the modern epoch of thought he strove to preserve both by presenting the theory of both in a pristine and ideal perfection the whole nature of dante was one of intense belief there is proof upon proof that he believed himself invested with a divine mission like the hebrew prophets with whose writings his whole soul was imbued it was back to the old worship and the god of the fathers that he called his people and not isaiah himself was more destitute of that humor that sense of ludicrous contrast which is an essential in the composition of a sceptic in dantes time learning had something of a sacred character the line was hardly yet drawn between the clerk and the possessor of supernatural powers it was with the next generation with the elegant petrarch even more truly than with the kindly boccaccio that the purely literary life and that dilettanteism which is the twin sister of scepticism began as a merely literary figure the position of dante is remarkable not only as respects thought but as respects aesthetics also his great poem stands as a monument on the boundary line between the ancient and modern he not only marks but is in himself the transition arma virumque cano that is the motto of classic song the things of this world and great men dante says subjectum est homo not vir my theme is man not a man the scene of the old epic and drama was in this world and its catastrophe here dante lays his scene in the human soul and his fifth act in the other world he makes himself the protagonist of his own drama in the commedia for the first time christianity wholly revolutionizes art and becomes its seminal principle but aesthetically also as well as morally dante stands between the old and the new and reconciles them the theme of his poem is purely subjective modern what is called romantic but its treatment is objective almost to realism here and there and it is limited by a form of classic severity in the same way he sums up in himself the two schools of modern poetry which had preceded him and while essentially lyrical in his subject is epic in the handling of it so also he combines the deeper and more abstract religious sentiment of the teutonic races with the scientific precision and absolute systematism of the romanic in one respect dante stands alone while we can in some sort account for such representative men as voltaire and goethe nay even shakespeare by the intellectual and moral fermentation of the age in which they lived dante seems morally isolated and to have drawn his inspiration almost wholly from his own internal reserves of his mastery in style we need say little here of his mere language nothing could be better than the expression of rivarol his verse holds itself erect by the mere force of the substantive and verb without the help of a single epithet we will only add a word on what seems to us an extraordinary misapprehension of coleridge who disparages dante by comparing his lucifer with miltons satan he seems to have forgotten that the precise measurements of dante were not prosaic but absolutely demanded by the nature of his poem he is describing an actual journey and his exactness makes a part of the verisimilitude we read the paradise lost as a poem the commedia as a record of fact and no one can read dante without believing his story for it is plain that he believed it himself it is false aesthetics to confound the grandiose with the imaginative miltons angels are not to be compared with dantes at once real and supernatural and the deity of milton is a calvinistic zeus while nothing in all poetry approaches the imaginative grandeur of dantes vision of god at the conclusion of the paradiso in all literary history there is no such figure as dante no such homogeneousness of life and works such loyalty to ideas such sublime irrecognition of the unessential and there is no moral more touching than that the contemporary recognition of such a nature so endowed and so faithful to its endowment should be summed up in the sentence of florence igne comburatur sic quod moriatur67  the range of dantes influence is not less remarkable than its intensity minds the antipodes of each other in temper and endowment alike feel the force of his attraction the pervasive comfort of his light and warmth boccaccio and lamennais are touched with the same reverential enthusiasm the imaginative ruskin is rapt by him as we have seen perhaps beyond the limit where critical appreciation merges in enthusiasm and the matteroffact schlosser tells us that he who was wont to contemplate earthly life wholly in an earthly light has made use of dante landino and vellutello in his solitude to bring a heavenly light into his inward life almost all other poets have their seasons but dante penetrates to the moral core of those who once fairly come within his sphere and possesses them wholly his readers turn students his students zealots and what was a taste becomes a religion the homeless exile finds a home in thousands of grateful hearts e venne da esilio in questa pace  every kind of objection aesthetic and other may be and has been made to the divina commedia especially by critics who have but a superficial acquaintance with it or rather with the inferno which is as far as most english critics go coleridge himself who had a way of divining what was in books may be justly suspected of not going further though with carey to help him mr carlyle who has said admirable things of dante the man was very imperfectly read in dante the author or he would never have put sordello in hell and the meeting with beatrice in paradise in france it was not much better though rivarol has said the best thing hitherto of dantes parsimony of epithet68 before ozanam who if with decided ultramontane leanings has written excellently well of our poet and after careful study voltaire though not without relentings toward a poet who had put popes heels upward in hell regards him on the whole as a stupid monster and barbarian it was no better in italy if we may trust foscolo who affirms that neither pelli nor others deservedly more celebrated than he ever read attentively the poem of dante perhaps never ran through it from the first verse to the last69 accordingly we have heard that the commedia was a sermon a political pamphlet the revengeful satire of a disappointed ghibelline nay worse of a turncoat guelph it is narrow it is bigoted it is savage it is theological it is mediaeval it is heretical it is scholastic it is obscure it is pedantic its italian is not that of la crusca its ideas are not those of an enlightened eighteenth century it is everything in short that a poem should not be and yet singularly enough the circle of its charm has widened in proportion as men have receded from the theories of church and state which are supposed to be its foundation and as the modes of thought of its author have become more alien to those of his readers in spite of all objections some of which are well founded the commedia remains one of the three or four universal books that have ever been written  we may admit with proper limitations the modern distinction between the artist and the moralist with the one form is all in all with the other tendency the aim of the one is to delight of the other to convince the one is master of his purpose the other mastered by it the whole range of perception and thought is valuable to the one as it will minister to imagination to the other only as it is available for argument with the moralist use is beauty good only as it serves an ulterior purpose with the artist beauty is use good in and for itself in the fine arts the vehicle makes part of the thought coalesces with it the living conception shapes itself a body in marble color or modulated sound and henceforth the two are inseparable the results of the moralist pass into the intellectual atmosphere of mankind it matters little by what mode of conveyance but where as in dante the religious sentiment and the imagination are both organic something interfused with the whole being of the man so that they work in kindly sympathy the moral will insensibly suffuse itself with beauty as a cloud with light then that fine sense of remote analogies awake to the assonance between facts seemingly remote and unrelated between the outward and inward worlds though convinced that the things of this life are shadows will be persuaded also that they are not fantastic merely but imply a substance somewhere and will love to set forth the beauty of the visible image because it suggests the ineffably higher charm of the unseen original dantes ideal of life the enlightening and strengthening of that native instinct of the soul which leads it to strive backward toward its divine source may sublimate the senses till each becomes a window for the light of truth and the splendor of god to shine through in him as in calderon the perpetual presence of imagination not only glorifies the philosophy of life and the science of theology but idealizes both in symbols of material beauty though dantes conception of the highest end of man was that he should climb through every phase of human experience to that transcendental and supersensual region where the true the good and the beautiful blend in the white light of god yet the prism of his imagination forever resolved the ray into color again and he loved to show it also where entangled and obstructed in matter it became beautiful once more to the eye of sense speculation he tells us is the use without any mixture of our noblest part the reason and this part cannot in this life have its perfect use which is to behold god who is the highest object of the intellect except inasmuch as the intellect considers and beholds him in his effects70 underlying dante the metaphysician statesman and theologian was always dante the poet71 irradiating and vivifying gleaming through in a picturesque phrase or touching things unexpectedly with that ideal light which softens and subdues like distance in the landscape the stern outline of his system wavers and melts away before the eye of the reader in a mirage of imagination that lifts from beyond the sphere of vision and hangs in serener air images of infinite suggestion projected from worlds not realized but substantial to faith hope and aspiration beyond the horizon of speculation floats in the passionless splendor of the empyrean the city of our god the rome whereof christ is a roman72 the citadel of refuge even in this life for souls purified by sorrow and self denial transhumanized73 to the divine abstraction of pure contemplation and it is called empyrean he says in his letter to can grande which is the same as a heaven blazing with fire or ardor not because there is in it a material fire or burning but a spiritual one which is blessed love or charity but this splendor he bodies forth if sometimes quaintly yet always vividly and most often in types of winning grace  dante was a mystic with a very practical turn of mind a platonist by nature an aristotelian by training his feet keep closely to the narrow path of dialectics because he believed it the safest while his eyes are fixed on the stars and his brain is busy with things not demonstrable save by that grace of god which passeth all understanding nor capable of being told unless by far off hints and adumbrations though he himself has directly explained the scope the method and the larger meaning of his greatest work74 though he has indirectly pointed out the way to its interpretation in the convito and though everything he wrote is but an explanatory comment on his own character and opinions unmistakably clear and precise yet both man and poem continue not only to be misunderstood popularly but also by such as should know better75 that those who confined their studies to the commedia should have interpreted it variously is not wonderful for out of the first or literal meaning others open one out of another each of wider circuit and purer abstraction like dantes own heavens giving and receiving light76 indeed dante himself is partly to blame for this the form or mode of treatment he says is poetic fictive descriptive digressive transumptive and withal definitive divisive probative improbative and positive of examples here are conundrums enough to be sure to italians at home for whom the great arenas of political and religious speculation were closed the temptation to find a subtler meaning than the real one was irresistible italians in exile on the other hand made dante the stalkinghorse from behind which they could take a long shot at church and state or at obscurer foes77  infinitely touching and sacred to us is the instinct of intense sympathy which drawst hese latter toward their great forerunner exul immeritus like themselves78 but they have too often wrung a meaning from dante which is injurious to the man and out of keeping with the ideas of his age the aim in expounding a great poem should be not to discover an endless variety of meanings often contradictory but whatever it has of great and perennial significance for such it must have or it would long ago have ceased to be living and operative would long ago have taken refuge in the chartreuse of great libraries dumb thenceforth to all mankind we do not mean to say that this minute exegesis is useless or unpraiseworthy but only that it should be subsidiary to the larger way it serves to bring out more clearly what is very wonderful in dante namely the omnipresence of his memory throughout the work so that its intimate coherence does not exist in spite of the reconditeness and complexity of allusion but is woven out of them the poem has many senses he tells us and there can be no doubt of it but it has also and this alone will account for its fascination a living soul behind them all and informing all an intense singleness of purpose a core of doctrine simple human and wholesome though it be also to use his own phrase the bread of angels  nor is this unity characteristic only of the divina commedia all the works of dante with the possible exception of the de vulgari eloquio which is unfinished are component parts of a whole duty of man mutually completing and interpreting one another they are also as truly as wordsworths prelude a history of the growth of a poets mind like the english poet he valued himself at a high rate the higher no doubt after fortune had made him outwardly cheap sempre il magnanimo si magnifica in suo cuore e così lo pusillanimo per contrario sempre si tiene meno che non è79 as in the prose of milton whose striking likeness to dante in certain prominent features of character has been remarked by foscolo there are in dantes minor works continual allusions to himself of great value as material for his biographer those who read attentively will discover that the tenderness he shows toward francesca and her lover did not spring from any friendship for her family but was a constant quality of his nature and that what is called his revengeful ferocity is truly the implacable resentment of a lofty mind and a lover of good against evil whether showing itself in private or public life perhaps hating the former manifestation of it the most because he believed it to be the root of the lattera faith which those who have watched the course of politics in a democracy as he had will be inclined to share his gentleness is all the more striking by contrast like that silken compensation which blooms out of the thorny stem of the cactus his moroseness80 his party spirit and his personal vindictiveness are all predicated upon the inferno and upon a misapprehension or careless reading even of that dantes zeal was not of that sentimental kind quickly kindled and as soon quenched that hovers on the surface of shallow minds    even as the flame of unctuous is wont   to move upon the outer surface only81  it was the steady heat of an inward fire kindling the whole character of the man through and through like the minarets of his own city of dis82 he was as seems distinctive in some degree of the latinized races an unflinching à priori logician not unwilling to syllogize invidious verities83 wherever they might lead him like sigier whom he has put in paradise though more than suspected of heterodoxy but at the same time as we shall see he had something of the practical good sense of that teutonic stock whence he drew a part of his blood which prefers a malleable syllogism that can yield without breaking to the inevitable but incalculable pressure of human nature and the stiffer logic of events his theory of church and state was not merely a fantastic one but intended for the use and benefit of men as they were and he allowed accordingly for aberrations to which even the law of gravitation is forced to give place how much more then any scheme whose very startingpoint is the freedom of the will  we are thankful for a commentator at last who passes dryshod over the turbide onde of inappreciative criticism and quietly waving aside the thick atmosphere which has gathered about the character of dante both as man and poet opens for us his city of doom with the diviningrod of reverential study miss rossetti comes commended to our interest not only as one of a family which seems to hold genius by the tenure of gavelkind but as having a special claim by inheritance to a love and understanding of dante she writes english with a purity that has in it something of feminine softness with no lack of vigor or precision her lithe mind winds itself with surprising grace through the metaphysical and other intricacies of her subject she brings to her work the refined enthusiasm of a cultivated woman and the penetration of sympathy she has chosen the better way in which germany took the lead of interpreting dante out of himself the pure spring from which and from which alone he drew his inspiration and not from muddy fra alberico or abbate giovacchino from stupid visions of saint paul or voyages of saint brandan she has written by far the best comment that has appeared in english and we should say the best that has been done in england were it not for her fathers comento analitico for excepting which her filial piety will thank us students of dante in the original will be grateful to her for many suggestive hints and those who read him in english will find in her volume a travelling map in which the principal points and their connections are clearly set down in what we shall say of dante we shall endeavor only to supplement her interpretation with such sidelights as may have been furnished us by twenty years of assiduous study dantes thought is multiform and like certain street signs once common presents a different image according to the point of view let us consider briefly what was the plan of the divina commedia and dantes aim in writing it which if not to justify was at least to illustrate for warning and example the ways of god to man the higher intention of the poem was to set forth the results of sin or unwisdom and of virtue or wisdom in this life and consequently in the life to come which is but the continuation and fulfilment of this the scene accordingly is the spiritual world of which we are as truly denizens now as hereafter the poem is a diary of the human soul in its journey upwards from error through repentance to atonement with god to make it apprehensible by those whom it was meant to teach nay from its very nature as a poem and not a treatise of abstract morality it must set forth everything by means of sensible types and images    to speak thus is adapted to your mind   since only from the sensible it learns   what makes it worthy of intellect thereafter   on this account the scripture condescends   unto your faculties and feet and hands   to god attributes and means something else84  whoever has studied mediaeval art in any of its branches need not be told that dantes age was one that demanded very palpable and even revolting types as in the old legend a drop of scalding sweat from the damned soul must shrivel the very skin of those for whom he wrote to make them wince if not to turn them away from evil doing to consider his hell a place of physical torture is to take circes herd for real swine its mouth yawns not only under florence but before the feet of every man everywhere who goeth about to do evil his hell is a condition of the soul and he could not find images loathsome enough to express the moral deformity which is wrought by sin on its victims or his own abhorrence of it its inmates meet you in the street every day    hell hath no limits nor is circumscribed   in one self place for where we are is hell   and where hell is there we must ever be85  it is our own sensual eye that gives evil the appearance of good and out of a crooked hag makes a bewitching siren the reason enlightened by the grace of god sees it as it truly is full of stench and corruption86 it is this office of reason which dante undertakes to perform by divine commission in the inferno there can be no doubt that he looked upon himself as invested with the prophetic function and the hebrew forerunners in whose society his soul sought consolation and sustainment certainly set him no example of observing the conventions of good society in dealing with the enemies of god indeed his notions of good society were not altogether those of this world in any generation he would have defined it as meaning the peers of philosophy souls free from wretched and vile delights and from vulgar habits endowed with genius and memory87 dante himself had precisely this endowment and in a very surprising degree his genius enabled him to see and to show what he saw to others his memory neither forgot nor forgave very hateful to his fervid heart and sincere mind would have been the modern theory which deals with sin as involuntary error and by shifting off the fault to the shoulders of atavism or those of society personified for purposes of excuse but escaping into impersonality again from the grasp of retribution weakens that sense of personal responsibility which is the root of selfrespect and the safeguard of character dante indeed saw clearly enough that the divine justice did at length overtake society in the ruin of states caused by the corruption of private and thence of civic morals but a personality so intense as his could not be satisfied with such a tardy and generalized penalty as this it is thou he says sternly who hast done this thing and thou not society shalt be damned for it nay damned all the worse for this paltry subterfuge this is not my judgment but that of universal nature88 from before the beginning of the world89 accordingly the highest reason typified in his guide virgil rebukes him for bringing compassion to the judgments of god90 and again embraces him and calls the mother that bore him blessed when he bids filippo argenti begone among the other dogs91 this latter case shocks our modern feelings the more rudely for the simple pathos with which dante makes argenti answer when asked who he was thou seest i am one that weeps it is also the one that makes most strongly for the theory of dantes personal vindictiveness92 and it may count for what it is worth we are not greatly concerned to defend him on that score for he believed in the righteous use of anger and that baseness was its legitimate quarry he did not think the tweeds and fisks the political wirepullers and conventionpackers of his day merely amusing and he certainly did think it the duty of an upright and thoroughly trained citizen to speak out severely and unmistakably he believed firmly almost fiercely in a divine order of the universe a conception whereof had been vouchsafed him and that whatever and whoever hindered or jostled it whether wilfully or blindly it mattered not was to be got out of the way at all hazards because obedience to gods law and not making things generally comfortable was the highest duty of man as it was also his only way to true felicity it has been commonly assumed that dante was a man soured by undeserved misfortune that he took up a wholly new outfit of political opinions with his fallen fortunes and that his theory of life and of mans relations to it was altogether reshaped for him by the bitter musings of his exile this would be singular to say the least in a man who tells us that he felt himself indeed foursquare against the strokes of chance and whose convictions were so intimate that they were not merely intellectual conclusions but parts of his moral being fortunately we are called on to believe nothing of the kind dante himself has supplied us with hints and dates which enable us to watch the germination and trace the growth of his double theory of government applicable to man as he is a citizen of this world and as he hopes to become hereafter a freeman of the celestial city it would be of little consequence to show in which of two equally selfish and shortsighted parties a man enrolled himself six hundred years ago but it is worth something to know that a man of ambitious temper and violent passions aspiring to office in a city of factions could rise to a level of principle so far above them all dantes opinions have life in them still because they were drawn from living sources of reflection and experience because they were reasoned out from the astronomic laws of history and ethics and were not weatherguesses snatched in a glance at the doubtful political sky of the hour    swiftly the politic goes is it dark he borrows a lantern   slowly the statesman and sure guiding his feet by the stars  it will be well then to clear up the chronology of dantes thought when his ancestor cacciaguida prophesies to him the life which is to be his after 130093 he says speaking of his exile   and that which most shall weigh upon thy shoulders   will be the bad and foolish company   with which into this valley thou shalt fall                                        of their bestiality their own proceedings   shall furnish proof so twill be well for thee   a party to have made thee by thyself  here both context and grammatical construction infallible guides in a writer so scrupulous and exact imply irresistibly that dante had become a party by himself before his exile the measure adopted by the priors of florence while he was one of them with his assent and probably by his counsel of sending to the frontier the leading men of both factions confirms this implication among the persons thus removed from the opportunity of doing mischief was his dearest friend guido cavalcanti to whom he had not long before addressed the vita nuova94 dante evidently looked back with satisfaction on his conduct at this time and thought it both honest and patriotic as it certainly was disinterested we whose country is the world as the ocean to the fish he tells us though we drank of the arno in infancy and love florence so much that because we loved her we suffer exile unjustly support the shoulders of our judgment rather upon reason than the senses95 and again speaking of old ago he says and the noble soul at this age blesses also the times past and well may bless them because revolving them in memory she recalls her righteous conduct without which she could not enter the port to which she draws nigh with so much riches and so great gain this language is not that of a man who regrets some former action as mistaken still less of one who repented it for any disastrous consequences to himself so in justifying a man for speaking of himself he alleges two examplesthat of boethius who did so to clear himself of the perpetual infamy of his exile and that of augustine for by the process of his life which was from bad to good from good to better and from better to best he gave us example and teaching96 after middle life at least dante had that wisdom whose use brings with it marvellous beauties that is contentment with every condition of time and contempt of those things which others make their masters97 if dante moreover wrote his treatise de monarchiâ before 1302 and we think wittes inference98 from its style and from the fact that he nowhere alludes to his banishment in it conclusive on this point then he was already a ghibelline in the same larger and unpartisan sense which ever after distinguished him from his italian contemporaries    let let the ghibellines ply their handicraft   beneath some other standard for this ever   ill follows he who it and justice parts  he makes justinian say speaking of the roman eagle99 his ghibellinism though undoubtedly the result of what he had seen of italian misgovernment embraced in its theoretical application the civilized world his political system was one which his reason adopted not for any temporary expediency but because it conduced to justice peace and civilizationthe three conditions on which alone freedom was possible in any sense which made it worth having dante was intensely italian nay intensely florentine but on all great questions he was by the logical structure of his mind and its philosophic impartiality incapable of intellectual provincialism100 if the circle of his affections as with persistent natures commonly was narrow his thought swept a broad horizon from that tower of absolute self which he had reared for its speculation even upon the principles of poetry mechanical and other101 he had reflected more profoundly than most of those who criticise his work and it was not by chance that he discovered the secret of that magical word too few which not only distinguishes his verse from all other but so strikingly from his own prose he never took the bit of art102 between his teeth where only poetry and not doctrine was concerned  if dantes philosophy on the one hand was practical a guide for the conduct of life it was on the other a much more transcendent thing whose body was wisdom her soul love and her efficient cause truth it is a practice of wisdom from the mere love of it for so we must interpret his amoroso uso di sapienzia when we remember how he has said before103 that the love of wisdom for its delight or profit is not true love of wisdom and this love must embrace knowledge in all its branches for dante is content with nothing less than a pancratic training and has a scorn of dilettanti specialists and quacks wherefore none ought to be called a true philosopher who for any delight loves any part of knowledge as there are many who delight in composing canzoni and delight to be studious in them and who delight to be studious in rhetoric and in music and flee and abandon the other sciences which are all members of wisdom104 many love better to be held masters than to be so with him wisdom is the generalization from many several knowledges of small account by themselves it results therefore from breadth of culture and would be impossible without it philosophy is a noble lady donna gentil105 partaking of the divine essence by a kind of eternal marriage while with other intelligences she is united in a less measure as a mistress of whom no lover takes complete joy106 the eyes of this lady are her demonstrations and her smile is her persuasion the eyes of wisdom are her demonstrations by which truth is beheld most certainly and her smile is her persuasions in which the interior light of wisdom is shown under a certain veil and in these two is felt that highest pleasure of beatitude which is the greatest good in paradise107 it is to be known that the beholding this lady was so largely ordained for us not merely to look upon the face which she shows us but that we may desire to attain the things which she keeps concealed and as through her much thereof is seen by reason so by her we believe that every miracle may have its reason in a higher intellect and consequently may be whence our good faith has its origin whence comes the hope of those unseen things which we desire and through that the operation of charity by the which three virtues we rise to philosophize in that celestial athens where the stoics peripatetics and epicureans through the art of eternal truth accordingly concur in one will108  as to the double scope of dantes philosophy we will cite a passage from the convito all the more to our purpose as it will illustrate his own method of allegorizing verily the use of our mind is double that is practical and speculative the one and the other most delightful although that of contemplation be the more so that of the practical is for us to act virtuously that is honorably with prudence temperance fortitude and justice these are the four stars seen by dante purgatorio i 2227 that of the speculative is not to act for ourselves but to consider the works of god and nature verily of these uses one is more full of beatitude than the other as it is the speculative which without any admixture is the use of our noblest part and this part in this life cannot have its use perfectly which is to see god except inasmuch as the intellect considers him and beholds him through his effects and that we should seek this beatitude as the highest and not the other the gospel of mark teaches us if we will look well mark says that mary magdalene mary the mother of james and mary salome went to find the saviour at the tomb and found him not but found a youth clad in white who said to them ye seek the saviour and i say unto you that he is not here and yet fear ye not but go and say unto his disciples and peter that he will go before them into galilee and there ye shall see him even as he told you by these three women may be understood the three sects of the active life that is the epicureans the stoics and the peripatetics who go to the tomb that is to the present life which is a receptacle of things corruptible and seek the saviour that is beatitude and find him not but they find a youth in white raiment who according to the testimony of matthew and the rest was an angel of god this angel is that nobleness of ours which comes from god as hath been said which speaks in our reason and says to each of these sects that is to whoever goes seeking beatitude in this life that it is not here but go and say to the disciples and to peter that is to those who go seeking it and those who are gone astray like peter who had denied that it will go before them into galilee that is into speculation galilee is as much as to say whiteness whiteness is a body full of corporeal light more than any other and so contemplation is fuller of spiritual light than anything else here below and he says it will go before and does not say it will be with you to give us to understand that god always goes before our contemplation nor can we ever overtake here him who is our supreme beatitude and it is said there ye shall see him as he told you that is here ye shall have of his sweetness that is felicity as is promised you here that is as it is ordained that ye can have and thus it appears that we find our beatitude this felicity of which we are speaking first imperfect in the active life that is in the operations of the moral virtues and afterwards wellnigh perfect in the operation of the intellectual ones the which two operations are speedy and most direct ways to lead to the supreme beatitude the which cannot be had here as appears by what has been said109  at first sight there may seem to be some want of agreement in what dante says here of the souls incapacity of the vision of god in this life with the triumphant conclusion of his own poem but here as elsewhere dante must be completed and explained by himself we must know that everything most greatly desires its own perfection and in that its every desire is appeased and by that everything is desired that is the one is drawn toward the other draws and this is that desire which makes every delight maimed for no delight is so great in this life that it can take away from the soul this thirst so that desire remain not in the thought110 and since it is most natural to wish to be in god the human soul naturally wills it with all longing and since its being depends on god and is preserved thereby it naturally desires and wills to be united with god in order to fortify its being and since in the goodnesses of human nature is shown some reason for those of the divine it follows that the human soul unites itself in a spiritual way with those so much the more strongly and quickly as they appear more perfect and this appearance happens according as the knowledge of the soul is clear or impeded and this union is what we call love whereby may be known what is within the soul seeing those it outwardly loves and the human soul which is ennobled with the ultimate potency that is reason participates in the divine nature after the manner of an eternal intelligence because the soul is so ennobled and denuded of matter in that sovran potency that the divine light shines in it as in an angel111 this union with god may therefore take place before the warfare of life is over but is only possible for souls perfettamente naturati perfectly endowed by nature112 this depends on the virtue of the generating soul and the concordant influence of the planets and if it happen that through the purity of the recipient soul the intellectual virtue be well abstracted and absolved from every corporeal shadow the divine bounty is multiplied in it as a thing sufficient to receive the same113 and there are some who believe that if all the aforesaid virtues powers should unite for the production of a soul in their best disposition so much of the deity would descend into it that it would be almost another incarnate god114 did dante believe himself to be one of these he certainly gives us reason to think so he was born under fortunate stars as he twice tells us115 and he puts the middle of his own life at the thirtyfifth year which is the period he assigns for it in the diviner sort of men116  the stages of dantes intellectual and moral growth may we think be reckoned with some approach to exactness from data supplied by himself in the poems of the vita nuova beatrice until her death was to him simply a poetical ideal a type of abstract beauty chosen according to the fashion of the day after the manner of the provençal poets but in a less carnal sense than theirs and by the fourth nature of animals that is the sensitive man has another love whereby he loves according to sensible appearance even as a beast and by the fifth and final nature that is the truly human or to speak better angelic that is rational man has a love for truth and virtue wherefore since this nature is called mind i said that love discoursed in my mind to make it understood that this love was that which is born in the noblest of natures that is the love of truth and virtue and to shut out every false opinion by which it might be suspected that my love was for the delight of sense117 this is a very weighty affirmation made as it is so deliberately by a man of dantes veracity who would and did speak truth at every hazard let us dismiss at once and forever all the idle tales of dantes amours of la montanina gentucca pietra lisetta and the rest to that outer darkness of impure thoughts là onde la stoltezza dipartille118 we think miss rossetti a little hasty in allowing that in the years which immediately followed beatrices death dante gave himself up more or less to sensual gratification and earthly aim the earthly aim we in a certain sense admit the sensual gratification we reject as utterly inconsistent not only with dantes principles but with his character and indefatigable industry miss rossetti illustrates her position by a subtle remark on the lulling spell of an intellectual and sensitive delight in good running parallel with a voluntary and actual indulgence in evil  the dead beatrice beckoned him toward the life of contemplation and it was precisely during this period that he attempted to find happiness in the life of action verily it is to be known that we may in this life have two felicities following two ways good and best which lead us thither the one is the active the other the contemplative life the which though by the active we may attain as has been said unto good felicity leads us to the best felicity and blessedness119 the life of my heart that is of my inward self was wont to be a sweet thought which went many times to the feet of god that is to say in thought i contemplated the kingdom of the blessed and i tell the final cause why i mounted thither in thought when i say where it the sweet thought beheld a lady in glory that i might make it understood that i was and am certain by her gracious revelation that she was in heaven not on earth as i had vainly imagined whither i went in thought so often as was possible to me as it were rapt120 this passage exactly answers to another in purgatorio xxx 115138   not only by the work of those great wheels   that destine every seed unto some end   according as the stars are in conjunction   but by the largess of celestial graces                                        such had this man become in his new life   potentially that every righteous habit   would have made admirable proof in him                                        some time i did sustain him with my look volto   revealing unto him my youthful eyes   i led him with me turned in the right way   as soon as ever of my second age   i was upon the threshold and changed life   himself from me he took and gave to others   when from the flesh to spirit i ascended   and beauty and virtue were in me increased   i was to him less dear and less delightful   and into ways untrue he turned his steps   pursuing the false images of good   that never any promises fulfil121   nor prayer for inspiration me availed122   by means of which in dreams and otherwise   i called him back so little did he heed them   so low he fell that all appliances   for his salvation were already short   save showing him the people of perdition  now dante himself we think gives us the clew by following which we may reconcile the contradiction what miss rossetti calls the astounding discrepancy between the lady of the vita nuova who made him unfaithful to beatrice and the same lady in the convito who in attributes is identical with beatrice herself we must remember that the prose part of the convito which is a comment on the canzoni was written after the canzoni themselves how long after we cannot say with certainty but it was plainly composed at intervals a part of it probably after dante had entered upon old age which began as he tells us with the fortyfifth year consequently after 1310 dante had then written a considerable part of the divina commedia in which beatrice was to go through her final and most ethereal transformation in his mind and memory we say in his memory for such idealizations have a very subtle retrospective action and the new condition of feeling or thought is uneasy till it has half unconsciously brought into harmony whatever is inconsistent with it in the past the inward life unwillingly admits any break in its continuity and nothing is more common than to hear a man in venting an opinion taken up a week ago say with perfect sincerity i have always thought so and so whatever belief occupies the whole mind soon produces the impression on us of having long had possession of it and one mode of consciousness blends so insensibly with another that it is impossible to mark by an exact line where one begins and the other ends dante in his exposition of the canzoni must have been subject to this subtlest and most deceitful of influences he would try to reconcile so far as he conscientiously could his present with his past this he could do by means of the allegorical interpretation for it would be a great shame to him he says in the vita nuova who should poetize something under the vesture of some figure or rhetorical color and afterwards when asked could not strip his words of that vesture in such wise that they should have a true meaning now in the literal exposition of the canzone beginning voi che intendendo il terzo ciel movete123 he tells us that the grandezza of the donna gentil was temporal greatness one certainly of the felicities attainable by way of the vita attiva and immediately after gives us a hint by which we may comprehend why a proud124 man might covet it how much wisdom and how great a persistence in virtue abito virtuoso are hidden for want of this lustre125 when dante reaches the terrestrial paradise126 which is the highest felicity of this world and therefore the consummation of the active life he is welcomed by a lady who is its symbol                         who went along   singing and culling floweret after floweret  and warming herself in the rays of love or actual speculation that is where love makes its peace felt127 that she was the symbol of this is evident from the previous dream of dante128 in which he sees leah the universally accepted type of it                         walking in a meadow   gathering flowers and singing she was saying   know whosoever may my name demand   that i am leah who go moving round   my beauteous hands to make myself a garland  that is to say of good works she having washed him thoroughly from sin129                   all dripping brought   into the dance of the four beautiful130  who are the intellectual virtues prudence justice temperance and fortitude the four stars guides of the practical life which he had seen when he came out of the hell where he had beheld the results of sin and arrived at the foot of the mount of purification that these were the special virtues of practical goodness dante had already told us in a passage before quoted from the convito131 that this was dantes meaning is confirmed by what beatrice says to him132    short while shalt thou be here a forester silvano   and thou shalt be with me forevermore   a citizen of that rome where christ is roman  for by a forest he always means the world of life and action133 at the time when dante was writing the canzoni on which the convito was a comment he believed science to be the ultimate perfection itself and not the way to it134 but before the convito was composed he had become aware of a higher and purer light an inward light in that beatrice already clarified wellnigh to a mere image of the mind who lives in heaven with the angels and on earth with my soul135  so spiritually does dante always present beatrice to us even where most corporeal as in the vita nuova that many like biscione and rossetti have doubted her real existence but surely we must consent to believe that she who speaks of                       the fair limbs wherein   i was enclosed which scattered are in earth  was once a creature of flesh and blood    a creature not too bright and good   for human natures daily food  when she died dantes grief like that of constance filled her room up with something fairer than the reality had ever been there is no idealizer like unavailing regret all the more if it be a regret of fancy as much as of real feeling she early began to undergo that change into something rich and strange in the sea136 of his mind which so completely supernaturalized her at last it is not impossible we think to follow the process of transformation during the period of the convito canzoni when he had so given himself to study that to his weakened eyes the stars were shadowed with a white blur137 this star of his imagination was eclipsed for a time with the rest as his love had never been of the senses which is bestial138 so his sorrow was all the more ready to be irradiated with celestial light and to assume her to be the transmitter of it who had first awakened in him the nobler impulses of his nature    such had this man become in his new life   potentially  and given him the first hints of a higher nay of the highest good with that turn for double meaning and abstraction which was so strong in him her very name helped him to allegorize her into one who makes blessed beat and thence the step was a short one to personify in her that theosophy which enables man to see god and to be mystically united with him even in the flesh already in the vita nuova139 she appears to him as afterwards in the terrestrial paradise clad in that color of flame which belongs to the seraphim who contemplate god in himself simply and not in his relation to the son or the holy spirit140 when misfortune came upon him when his schemes of worldly activity failed and science was helpless to console as it had never been able wholly to satisfy she already rose before him as the lost ideal of his youth reproaching him with his desertion of purely spiritual aims it is perhaps in allusion to this that he fixes the date of her death with such minute precision on the 9th june 1390 most probably his own twentyfifth birthday on which he passed the boundary of adolescence141  that there should seem to be a discrepancy between the lady of the vita nuova and her of the convito dante himself was already aware when writing the former and commenting it explaining the sonnet beginning gentil pensier he says in this sonnet i make two parts of myself according as my thoughts were divided in two the one part i call heart that is the appetite the other soul that is reason it is true that in the preceding sonnet i take side with the heart against the eyes which were weeping for the lost beatrice and that appears contrary to what i say in the present one and therefore i say that in that sonnet also i mean by my heart the appetite because my desire to remember me of my most gentle lady was still greater than to behold this one albeit i had already some appetite for her but slight as should seem whence it appears that the one saying is not contrary to the other142 when therefore dante speaks of the love of this lady as the adversary of reason he uses the word in its highest sense not as understanding intellectus but as synonymous with soul already when the latter part of the vita nuova nay perhaps the whole of the explanatory portion of it was written the plan of the commedia was complete a poem the higher aim of which was to keep the soul alive both in this world and for the next as dante tells us the contradiction in his mind was though he did not become aware of it till afterwards more apparent than real he sought consolation in study and failing to find it in learning scienza he was led to seek it in wisdom sapienza which is the love of god and the knowledge of him143 he had sought happiness through the understanding he was to find it through intuition the lady philosophy according as she is moral or intellectual includes both her gradual transfiguration is exemplified in passages already quoted the active life leads indirectly by a knowledge of its failures and sins inferno or directly by a righteous employment of it purgatorio to the same end the use of the sciences is to induce in us the ultimate perfection that of speculating upon truth the use of the highest of them theology the contemplation of god144 to this they all lead up in one of those curious chapters of the convito145 where he points out the analogy between the sciences and the heavens dante tells us that he compares moral philosophy with the crystalline heaven or primum mobile because it communicates life and gives motion to all the others below it but what gives motion to the crystalline heaven moral philosophy itself the most fervent appetite which it has in each of its parts to be conjoined with each part of that most divine quiet heaven theology146 theology the divine science corresponds with the empyrean because of its peace the which through the most excellent certainty of its subject which is god suffers no strife of opinions or sophistic arguments147 no one of the heavens is at rest but this and in none of the inferior sciences can we find repose though he likens physics to the heaven of the fixed stars in whose name is a suggestion of the certitude to be arrived at in things demonstrable dante had this comparison in mind it may be inferred when he said    well i perceive that never sated is   our intellect unless the truth illume it   beyond which nothing true148 expands itself   it rests therein as wild beast in his lair   when it attains it and it can attain it   if not then each desire would frustrate be   therefore springs up in fashion of a shoot   doubt at the foot of truth and this is nature   which to the top from height to height impels us149  the contradiction as it seems to us resolves itself into an essential easily apprehensible if mystical unity dante at first gave himself to the study of the sciences after he had lost the simple unquestioning faith of youth as the means of arriving at certainty from the root of every truth to which he attained sprang this sucker rampollo of doubt drawing out of it the very sap of its life in this way was philosophy truly an adversary of his soul and the reason of his remorse for fruitless studies which drew him away from the one that alone was and could be fruitful is obvious enough but by and by out of the very doubt came the sweetness150 of a higher and truer insight he became aware that there were things in heaven and earth undreamt of in your philosophy as another doubter said who had just finished his studies but could not find his way out of the scepticism they engendered as dante did    insane is he who hopeth that our reason   can traverse the illimitable way   which the one substance in three persons follows   mortals remain contented at the quia   for if ye had been able to see all   no need there were had been for mary to bring forth   and ye have seen desiring without fruit   those whose desire would have been quieted   which evermore is given them for a grief   i speak of aristotle and of plato   and many others151  whether at the time when the poems of the vita nuova were written the lady who withdrew him for a while from beatrice was which we doubt a person of flesh and blood or not she was no longer so when the prose narrative was composed any one familiar with dantes double meanings will hardly question that by putting her at a window which is a place to look out of he intended to imply that she personified speculation a word which he uses with a wide range of meaning sometimes as looking for sometimes as seeing like shakespeares    there is no speculation in those eyes  sometimes as intuition or the beholding all things in god who is the cause of all this is so obvious and the image in this sense so familiar that we are surprised it should have been hitherto unremarked it is plain that even when the vita nuova was written the lady was already philosophy but philosophy applied to a lower range of thought not yet ascended from flesh to spirit the lady who seduced him was the science which looks for truth in second causes or even in effects instead of seeking it where alone it can be found in the first cause she was the philosophy which looks for happiness in the visible world of shadows and not in the spiritual and therefore substantial world the guerdon of his search was doubt but dante as we have seen made his very doubts help him upward toward certainty each became a round in the ladder by which he climbed to clearer and clearer vision till the end152 philosophy had made him forget beatrice it was philosophy who was to bring him back to her again washed clean in that very stream of forgetfulness that had made an impassable barrier between them153 dante had known how to find in her the gift of achilless lance                  which used to be the cause   first of a sad and then a gracious boon154  there is another possible and even probable theory which would reconcile the beatrice of the purgatorio with her of the vita nuova suppose that even in the latter she signified theology or at least some influence that turned his thoughts to god pietro di dante commenting the pargoletta passage in the purgatorio says expressly that the poet had at one time given himself to the study of theology and deserted it for poesy and other mundane sciences this must refer to a period beginning before 1290 again there is an early tradition that dante in his youth had been a novice in a franciscan convent but never took the vows buti affirms this expressly in his comment on inferno xvi 106123 it is perhaps slightly confirmed by what dante says in the convito155 that one cannot only turn to religion by making himself like in habit and life to st benedict st augustine st francis and st dominic but likewise one may turn to good and true religion in a state of matrimony for god wills no religion in us but of the heart if he had ever thought of taking monastic vows his marriage would have cut short any such intention if he ever wished to wed the real beatrice portinari and was disappointed might not this be the time when his thoughts took that direction if so the impulse came indirectly at least from her  we have admitted that beatrice portinari was a real creature    col sangue suo e con le sue giunture  but how real she was and whether as real to the poets memory as to his imagination may fairly be questioned she shifts as the controlling emotion or the poetic fitness of the moment dictates from a woman loved and lost to a gracious exhalation of all that is fairest in womanhood or most divine in the soul of man and ere the eye has defined the new image it has become the old one again or another mingled of both    nor one nor other seemed now what it was   een as proceedeth on before the flame   upward along the paper a brown color   which is not black as yet and the white dies156  as the mystic griffin in the eyes of beatrice her demonstrations so she in his own    now with the one now with the other nature   think reader if within myself i marvelled   when i beheld the thing itself stand still   and in its image it transformed itself157  at the very moment when she had undergone her most sublimated allegorical evaporation his instinct as poet which never failed him realized her into woman again in those scenes of almost unapproached pathos which make the climax of his purgatorio the verses tremble with feeling and shine with tears158 beatrice recalls her own beauty with a pride as natural as that of fair annie in the old ballad and compares herself as advantageously with the brown brown bride who had supplanted her if this be a ghost we do not need be told that she is a woman still159 we must remember however that beatrice had to be real that she might be interesting to be beautiful that her goodness might be persuasive nay to be beautiful at any rate because beauty has also something in it of divine dante has told in a passage already quoted that he would rather his readers should find his doctrine sweet than his verses but he had his relentings from this stoicism    canzone i believe those will be rare   who of thine inner sense can master all   such toil it costs thy native tongue to learn   wherefore if ever it perchance befall   that thou in presence of such men shouldst fare   as seem not skilled thy meaning to discern   i pray thee then thy grief to comfort turn   saying to them o thou my new delight   take heed at least how fair i am to sight160  we believe all dantes other ladies to have been as purely imaginary as the dulcinea of don quixote useful only as motives but a real beatrice is as essential to the human sympathies of the divina commedia as her glorified idea to its allegorical teaching and this dante understood perfectly well161 take her out of the poem and the heart of it goes with her take out her ideal and it is emptied of its soul she is the menstruum in which letter and spirit dissolve and mingle into unity those who doubt her existence must find dantes graceful sonnet162 to guido cavalcante as provoking as sanchos story of his having seen dulcinea winnowing wheat was to his master so alien is it from all that which eminent persons who are constituted and preserved for other exercises and entertainments do and ought to do163 but we should always remember in reading dante that with him the allegorical interpretation is the true one verace sposizione and that he represents himself and that at a time when he was known to the world only by his minor poems as having made righteousness rettitudine in other words moral philosophy the subject of his verse164 love with him seems first to have meant the love of truth and the search after it speculazione and afterwards the contemplation of it in its infinite source speculazione in its higher and mystical sense this is the divine love which where it shines darkens and wellnigh extinguishes all other loves165 wisdom is the object of it and the end of wisdom to contemplate god the true mirror verace spegio speculum wherein all things are seen as they truly are nay she herself is the brightness of the eternal light the unspotted mirror of the majesty of god166  there are two beautiful passages in the convito which we shall quote both because they have as we believe a close application to dantes own experience and because they are good specimens of his style as a writer of prose in the manly simplicity which comes of an earnest purpose and in the eloquence of deep conviction this is as far beyond that of any of his contemporaries as his verse nay more has hardly been matched by any italian from that day to this illustrating the position that  the highest desire of everything and the first given us by nature is to return to its first cause he says and since god is the beginning of our souls and the maker of them like unto himself according as was written let us make man in our image and likeness this soul most greatly desires to return to him and as a pilgrim who goes by a way he has never travelled who believes every house he sees afar off to be his inn and not finding it to be so directs his belief to another and so from house to house till he come to the inn so our soul forthwith on entering upon the new and nevertravelled road of this life directs its eyes to the goal of its highest good and therefore believes whatever thing it sees that seems to have in it any good to be that and because its first knowledge is imperfect by reason of not being experienced nor indoctrinated small goods seem to it great wherefore we see children desire most greatly an apple and then proceeding further on desire a bird and then further yet desire fine raiment and then a horse and then a woman and then riches not great and then greater and greater and this befalls because in none of these things it finds that which it goes seeking and thinks to find it further on by which it may be seen that one desirable stands before another in the eyes of our soul in a fashion as it were pyramidal for the smallest at first covers the whole of them and is as it were the apex of the highest desirable which is god as it were the base of all so that the further we go from the apex toward the base the desirables appear greater and this is the reason why human desires become wider one after the other verily this way is lost through error as the roads of earth are for as from one city to another there is of necessity one best and straightest way and one that always leads farther from it that is the one which goes elsewhere and many others some less roundabout and some less direct so in human life are divers roads whereof one is the truest and another the most deceitful and certain ones less deceitful and certain less true and as we see that that which goes most directly to the city fulfils desire and gives repose after weariness and that which goes the other way never fulfils it and never can give repose so it falls out in our life the good traveller arrives at the goal and repose the erroneous never arrives thither but with much weariness of mind always with greedy eyes looks before him167 if we may apply dantes own method of exposition to this passage we find him telling us that he first sought felicity in knowledge    that apple sweet which through so many branches   the care of mortals goeth in pursuit of168  then in fame a bird that flits before us as we follow169 then in being esteemed of men to be clothed in purple  to sit next to darius  and be called darius his cousin  then in power170 then in the riches of the holy spirit in larger and larger measure171 he too had found that there was but one straight road whether to the terrestrial paradise or the celestial city and may come to question by and by whether they be not parallel one with the other or even parts of the same road by which only repose is to be reached at last then when in old age the noble soul returns to god as to that port whence she set forth on the sea of this life  just as to him who comes from a long journey before he enters into the gate of his city the citizens thereof go forth to meet him so the citizens of the eternal life go to meet her and do so because of her good deeds and contemplations who having already betaken herself to god seems to see those whom she believes to be nigh unto god172 this also was to be the experience of dante for who can doubt that the paradiso was something very unlike a poetical exercise to him who appeals to the visions even of sleep as proof of the souls immortality  when did his soul catch a glimpse of that certainty in which the mind that museth upon many things can find assured rest we have already said that we believe dantes political opinions to have taken their final shape and the de monarchiâ to have been written before 1300173 that the revision of the vita nuova was completed in that year seems probable from the last sonnet but one which is addressed to pilgrims on their way to the santa veronica at rome174 in this sonnet he still laments beatrice as dead he would make the pilgrims share his grief it is the very folly of despairing sorrow that calls on the first comer stranger though he be for a sympathy which none can fully give and he least of all but in the next sonnet the last in the book there is a surprising change of tone the transfiguration of beatrice has begun and we see completing itself that natural gradation of grief which will erelong bring the mourner to call on the departed saint to console him for her own loss the sonnet is remarkable in more senses than one first for its psychological truth and then still more for the light it throws on dantes inward history as poet and thinker hitherto he had celebrated beauty and goodness in the creature henceforth he was to celebrate them in the creator whose praise they were175 we give an extempore translation of this sonnet in which the meaning is preserved so far as is possible where the grace is left out we remember with some compunction as we do it that dante has said know every one that nothing harmonized by a musical band can be transmuted from its own speech to another without breaking all its sweetness and harmony176 and cervantes was of the same mind177    beyond the sphere that hath the widest gyre   passeth the sigh178 that leaves my heart below   a new intelligence doth love bestow   on it with tears that ever draws it higher   when it wins thither where is its desire   a lady it beholds who honor so   and light receives that through her splendid glow   the pilgrim spirit179 sees her as in fire   it sees her such that telling me again   i understand it not it speaks so low   unto the mourning heart that bids it tell   its speech is of that noble one i know   for beatrice i often hear full plain   so that dear ladies i conceive it well  no one can read this in its connection with what goes before and what follows without feeling that a new conception of beatrice had dawned upon the mind of dante dim as yet or purposely made to seem so and yet the authentic forerunner of the fulness of her rising as the light of his day and the guide of his feet the divine wisdom whose glory pales all meaner stars the conception of a poem in which dantes creed in politics and morals should be picturesquely and attractively embodied and of the high place which beatrice should take in it had begun vaguely to shape itself in his thought as he brooded over it of a sudden it defined itself clearly soon after this sonnet there appeared to me a marvellous vision180 wherein i saw things which made me propose not to say more of that blessed one until i could treat of her more worthily and to arrive at that i study all i can as she verily knows so that if it be the pleasure of him through whom all things live that my life hold out yet a few years i hope to say that of her which was never yet said of any woman and then may it please him who is the lord of courtesy that my soul may go to see the glory of her lady that is of that blessed beatrice who gloriously beholds the face of him qui est per omnia saecula benedictus it was the method of presentation that became clear to dante at this timethe plan of the great poem for whose completion the experience of earth and the inspiration of heaven were to combine and which was to make him lean for many years181 the doctrinal scope of it was already determined man he tells us is the only creature who partakes at once of the corruptible and incorruptible nature and since every nature is ordained to some ultimate end it follows that the end of man is double and as among all beings he alone partakes of the corruptible and incorruptible so alone among all beings he is ordained to a double end whereof the one is his end as corruptible the other as incorruptible that unspeakable providence therefore foreordered two ends to be pursued by man to wit beatitude in this life which consists in the operation of our own virtue and is figured by the terrestrial paradise and the beatitude of life eternal which consists in a fruition of the divine countenance whereto our own virtue cannot ascend unless aided by divine light which is understood by the celestial paradise the one we attain by practice of the moral and intellectual virtues as they are taught by philosophers the other by spiritual teachings transcending human reason and the practice of the theological virtues of faith hope and charity for one reason suffices which was wholly made known to us by philosophers for the other we need the light of supernatural truth revealed by the holy spirit and needful for us men led astray by cupidity turn their backs on both and in their bestiality need bit and rein to keep them in the way wherefore to man was a double guidance needful according to the double end the supreme pontiff in spiritual the emperor in temporal things182  but how to put this theory of his into a poetic form which might charm while it was teaching he would typify reason in virgil who would serve also as a symbol of political wisdom as having celebrated the founding of the empire and the grace of god in that beatrice whom he had already supernaturalized into something which passeth all understanding in choosing virgil he was sure of that interest and sympathy which his instinct led him to seek in the predisposition of his readers for the popular imagination of the middle ages had busied itself particularly with the mantuan poet the church had given him a quasiorthodoxy by interpreting his jam redit et virgo as a prophecy of the birth of christ at naples he had become a kind of patron saint and his bones were exhibited as relics dante himself may have heard at mantua the hymn sung on the anniversary of st paul in which the apostle to the gentiles is represented as weeping at the tomb of the greatest of poets above all virgil had described the descent of aeneas to the underworld dantes choice of a guide was therefore in a certain degree made for him but the mere reason183 of man without the illumination of divine grace cannot be trusted and accordingly the intervention of beatrice was neededof beatrice as miss rossetti admirably well expresses it already transfigured potent not only now to charm and soothe potent to rule to the intellect a light to the affections a compass and a balance a sceptre over the will  the wood obscure in which dante finds himself is the world184 the three beasts who dispute his way are the sins that most easily beset us pride the lusts of the flesh and greed we are surprised that miss rossetti should so localize and confine dantes meaning as to explain them by florence france and rome had he written in so narrow a sense as this it would indeed be hard to account for the persistent power of his poem but it was no political pamphlet that dante was writing subjectum est homo and it only takes the form of a diary by dante alighieri because of the intense realism of his imagination a realism as striking in the paradiso as the inferno though it takes a different shape everything the most supersensual presented itself to his mind not as abstract idea but as visible type as men could once embody a quality of good in a saint and see it as they even now in moments of heightened fantasy or enthusiasm can personify their country and speak of england france or america as if they were real beings so did dante habitually185 he saw all his thoughts as distinctly as the hypochondriac sees his black dog and as in that their form and color were but the outward form of an inward and spiritual condition whatever subsidiary interpretations the poem is capable of its great and primary value is as the autobiography of a human soul of yours and mine it may be as well as dantes in that lie its profound meaning and its permanent force that an exile a proud man forced to be dependent should have found some consolation in brooding over the justice of god weighed in such different scales from those of man in contrasting the outward prosperity of the sinner with the awful spiritual ruin within is not wonderful nay we can conceive of his sometimes finding the wrath of god sweeter than his mercy but it is wonderful that out of the very wreck of his own life he should have built this threearched bridge still firm against the wash and wear of ages stretching from the pit to the empyrean by which men may pass from a doubt of gods providence to a certainty of his longsuffering and lovingkindness    the infinite goodness hath such ample arms   that it receives whatever turns to it186  a tear is enough to secure the saving clasp of them187 it cannot be too often repeated that dantes other world is not in its first conception a place of departed spirits it is the spiritual world whereof we become denizens by birth and citizens by adoption it is true that for artistic purposes he makes it conform so far as possible with vulgar preconceptions but he himself has told us again and again what his real meaning was virgil tells dante    thou shalt behold the people dolorous   who have foregone the good of intellect188  the good of the intellect dante tells us after aristotle is truth189 he says that virgil has led him through the deep night of the truly dead190 who are they dante had in mind the saying of the apostle to be carnally minded is death he says in man to live is to use reason then if living is the being of man to depart from that use is to depart from being and so to be dead and doth not he depart from the use of reason who doth not reason out the object of his life i say that so vile a person is dead seeming to be alive for we must know that the wicked man may be called truly dead he is dead who follows not the teacher and of such a one some might say how is he dead and yet goes about i answer that the man is dead and the beast remains191 accordingly he has put living persons in the inferno like frate alberigo and branca d oria of whom he says with bitter sarcasm that he still eats and drinks and puts on clothes as if that were his highest ideal of the true ends of life192 there is a passage in the first canto of the inferno193 which has been variously interpreted             the ancient spirits disconsolate   who cry out each one for the second death  miss rossetti cites it as an example of what she felicitously calls an ambiguity not hazy but prismatic and therefore not really perplexing she gives us accordingly our choice of two interpretations each cries out on account of the second death which he is suffering and each cries out for death to come a second time and ease him of his sufferings194 buti says here one doubts what the author meant by the second death and as for me i think he meant the last damnation which shall be at the day of judgment because they would wish through envy that it had already come that they might have more companions since the first death is the first damnation when the soul parted from the body is condemned to the pains of hell for its sins the second is when resuscitated at the judgment day they shall be finally condemned soul and body together it may otherwise be understood as annihilation imola says each would wish to die again if he could to put an end to his pain do not hold with some who think that dante calls the second death the day of judgment and then quotes a passage from st augustine which favors that view pietro di dante gives us four interpretations among which to choose the first being that allegorically depraved and vicious men are in a certain sense dead in reputation and this is the first death the second is that of the body this we believe to be the true meaning dante himself in a letter to the most rascally scelestissimis dwellers in florence gives us the key but you transgressors of the laws of god and man whom the direful maw of cupidity hath enticed not unwilling to every crime does not the terror of the second death torment you their first death was in their sins the second is what they may expect from the just vengeance of the emperor henry vii the world dante leads us through is that of his own thought and it need not surprise us therefore if we meet in it purely imaginary beings like tristrem195 and renoard of the club196 his personality is so strongly marked that it is nothing more than natural that his poem should be interpreted as if only he and his opinions prejudices or passions were concerned he would not have been the great poet he was if he had not felt intensely and humanly but he could never have won the cosmopolitan place he holds had he not known how to generalize his special experience into something mediatorial for all of us pietro di dante in his comment on the thirtyfirst canto of the purgatorio says that unless you understand him and his figures allegorically you will be deceived by the bark and adds that our author made his pilgrimage as the representative of the rest in persona ceterorum197 to give his vision reality he has adapted it to the vulgar mythology but to understand it as the author meant it must be taken in the larger sense to confine it to florence or to italy is to banish it from the sympathies of mankind it was not from the campanile of the badia that dante got his views of life and man  the relation of dante to literature is monumental and marks the era at which the modern begins he is not only the first great poet but the first great prose writer who used a language not yet subdued to literature who used it moreover for scientific and metaphysical discussion thus giving an incalculable impulse to the culture of his countrymen by making the laity free of what had hitherto been the exclusive guild of clerks198 whatever poetry had preceded him whether in the romance or teutonic tongues is interesting mainly for its simplicity without forethought or as in the nibelungen for a kind of savage grandeur that rouses the sympathy of whatever of the natural man is dormant in us but it shows no trace of the creative faculty either in unity of purpose or style the proper characteristics of literature if it have the charm of wanting artifice it has not the higher charm of art we are in the realm of chaos and chance nebular with phosphorescent gleams here and there star stuff but uncondensed in stars the nibelungen is not without farreaching hints and forebodings of something finer than we find in it but they are a glamour from the vague darkness which encircles it like the whisper of the sea upon an unknown shore at night powerful only over the more vulgar side of the imagination and leaving no thought scarce even any image at least of beauty behind them such poems are the amours not the lasting friendships and possessions of the mind they thrill and cannot satisfy  but dante is not merely the founder of modern literature he would have been that if he had never written anything more than his canzoni which for elegance variety of rhythm and fervor of sentiment were something altogether new they are of a higher mood than any other poems of the same style in their own language or indeed in any other in beauty of phrase and subtlety of analogy they remind one of some of the greek tragic choruses we are constantly moved in them by a nobleness of tone whose absence in many admired lyrics of the kind is poorly supplied by conceits so perfect is dantes mastery of his material that in compositions as he himself has shown so artificial199 the form seems rather organic than mechanical which cannot be said of the best of the provençal poets who led the way in this kind dantes sonnets also have a grace and tenderness which have been seldom matched his lyrical excellence would have got him into the collections and he would have made here and there an enthusiast as donne does in english but his great claim to remembrance is not merely italian it is that he was the first christian poet in any proper sense of the word the first who so subdued dogma to the uses of plastic imagination as to make something that is still poetry of the highest order after it has suffered the disenchantment inevitable in the most perfect translation verses of the kind usually called sacred reminding one of the adjectives double meaning had been written before his time in the vulgar tonguesuch verses as remain inviolably sacred in the volumes of specimens looked at with distant reverence by the pious and with far other feelings by the profane reader there were cycles of poems in which the physical conflict between christianity and paganism200 furnished the subject but in which the theological views of the authors whether doctrinal or historical could hardly be reconciled with any system of religion ancient or modern there were church legends of saints and martyrs versified fit certainly to make any other form of martyrdom seem amiable to those who heard them and to suggest palliative thoughts about diocletian finally there were the romances of arthur and his knights which later by means of allegory contrived to be both entertaining and edifying every one who listened to them paying the minstrel his money and having his choice whether he would take them as song or sermon in the heroes of some of these certain christian virtues were typified and around a few of them as the holy grail a perfume yet lingers of cloistered piety and withdrawal wolfram von eschenbach indeed has divided his parzival into three books of simplicity doubt and healing which has led gervinus to trace a not altogether fanciful analogy between that poem and the divina commedia the doughty old poet who says of himself    of song i have some slight control   but deem her of a feeble soul   that doth not love my naked sword   above my sweetest lyric word  tells us that his subject is the choice between good and evil    whose soul takes untruth for its bride   and sets himself on evils side   chooses the black and sure it is   his path leads down to the abyss   but he who doth his nature feed   with steadfastness and loyal deed   lies open to the heavenly light   and takes his portion with the white  but wolframs poem has no system and shows good feeling rather than settled conviction above all it is wandering as he himself confesses and altogether wants any controlling purpose but to whatever extent christianity had insinuated itself into and colored european literature it was mainly as mythology the christian idea had never yet incorporated itself it was to make its avatar in dante to understand fully what he accomplished we must form some conception of what is meant by the christian idea to bring it into fuller relief let us contrast it with the greek idea as it appears in poetry for we are not dealing with a question of theology so much as with one of aesthetics  greek art at its highest point is doubtless the most perfect that we know but its circle of motives was essentially limited and the greek drama in its passion its pathos and its humor is primarily greek and secondarily human its tragedy chooses its actors from certain heroic families and finds its springs of pity and terror in physical suffering and worldly misfortune its best examples like the antigone illustrate a single duty or like the hippolytus a single passion on which as on a pivot the chief character statuesquely simple in its details revolves as pieces of sculpture are sometimes made to do displaying its different sides in one invariable light the general impression left on the mind and this is apt to be a truer one than any drawn from single examples is that the duty is one which is owed to custom that the passion leads to a breach of some convention settled by common consent201 and accordingly it is an outraged society whose figure looms in the background rather than an offended god at most it was one god of many and meanwhile another might be friendly in the greek epic the gods are partisans they hold caucuses they lobby and logroll for their candidates the tacit admission of a revealed code of morals wrought a great change the complexity and range of passion is vastly increased when the offence is at once both crime and sin a wrong done against order and against conscience at the same time the relation of the greek tragedy to the higher powers is chiefly antagonistic struggle against an implacable destiny sublime struggle and of heroes but sure of defeat at last and that defeat is final grand figures are those it exhibits to us in some respects unequalled and in their severe simplicity they compare with modern poetry as sculpture with painting considered merely as works of art these products of the greek imagination satisfy our highest conception of form they suggest inevitably a feeling of perfect completeness isolation and independence of something rounded and finished in itself the secret of those old shapers died with them their wand is broken their book sunk deeper than ever plummet sounded the type of their work is the greek temple which leaves nothing to hope for in unity and perfection of design in harmony and subordination of parts and in entireness of impression but in this aesthetic completeness it ends it rests solidly and complacently on the earth and the mind rests there with it  now the christian idea has to do with the human soul which christianity may be almost said to have invented while all paganism represents a few preeminent families the founders of dynasties or ancestors of races as of kin with the gods christianity makes every pedigree end in deity makes monarch and slave the children of one god its heroes struggle not against but upward and onward toward the higher powers who are always on their side its highest conception of beauty is not aesthetic but moral with it prosperity and adversity have exchanged meanings it finds enemies in those worldly goodfortunes where pagan and even hebrew literature saw the highest blessing and invincible allies in sorrow poverty humbleness of station where the former world recognized only implacable foes while it utterly abolished all boundary lines of race or country and made mankind unitary its hero is always the individual man whoever and wherever he may be above all an entirely new conception of the infinite and of mans relation to it came in with christianity that and not the finite is always the background consciously or not it changed the scene of the last act of every drama to the next world endless aspiration of all the faculties became thus the ideal of christian life and to express it more or less perfectly the ideal of essentially christian art it was this which the middle ages instinctively typified in the gothic cathedralno accidental growth but the visible symbol of an inward faithwhich soars forever upward and yearns toward heaven like a martyrflame suddenly turned to stone  it is not without significance that goethe who like dante also absorbed and represented the tendency and spirit of his age should during his youth and while europe was alive with the moral and intellectual longing which preluded the french revolution have loved the gothic architecture it is no less significant that in the period of reaction toward more positive thought which followed he should have preferred the greek his greatest poem conceived during the former era is gothic dante endeavoring to conform himself to literary tradition began to write the divina commedia in latin and had elaborated several cantos of it in that dead and intractable material but that poetic instinct which is never the instinct of an individual but of his age could not so be satisfied and leaving the classic structure he had begun to stand as a monument of failure he completed his work in italian instead of endeavoring to manufacture a great poem out of what was foreign and artificial he let the poem make itself out of him the epic which he wished to write in the universal language of scholars and which might have had its ten lines in the history of literature would sing itself in provincial tuscan and turns out to be written in the universal dialect of mankind thus all great poets have been in a certain sense provincialhomer dante shakespeare goethe burns scott in the heart of midlothian and bride of lammermoorbecause the office of the poet is always vicarious because nothing that has not been living experience can become living expression because the collective thought the faith the desire of a nation or a race is the cumulative result of many ages is something organic and is wiser and stronger than any single person and will make a great statesman or a great poet out of any man who can entirely surrender himself to it  as the gothic cathedral then is the type of the christian idea so is it also of dantes poem and as that in its artistic unity is but the completed thought of a single architect which yet could never have been realized except out of the faith and by the contributions of an entire people whose beliefs and superstitions whose imagination and fancy find expression in its statues and its carvings its calm saints and martyrs now at rest forever in the seclusion of their canopied niches and its wanton grotesques thrusting themselves forth from every pinnacle and gargoyle so in dantes poem while it is as personal and peculiar as if it were his private journal and autobiography we can yet read the diary and the autobiography of the thirteenth century and of the italian people complete and harmonious in design as his work is it is yet no pagan temple enshrining a type of the human made divine by triumph of corporeal beauty it is not a private chapel housing a single saint and dedicate to one chosen bloom of christian piety or devotion it is truly a cathedral over whose high altar hangs the emblem of suffering of the divine made human to teach the beauty of adversity the eternal presence of the spiritual not overhanging and threatening but informing and sustaining the material in this cathedral of dantes there are sidechapels as is fit with altars to all christian virtues and perfections but the great impression of its leading thought is that of aspiration for ever and ever in the three divisions of the poem we may trace something more than a fancied analogy with a christian basilica there is first the ethnic forecourt then the purgatorial middlespace and last the holy of holies dedicated to the eternal presence of the mediatorial god  but what gives dantes poem a peculiar claim to the title of the first christian poem is not merely its doctrinal truth or its christian mythology but the fact that the scene of it is laid not in this world but in the soul of man that it is the allegory of a human life and therefore universal in its significance and its application the genius of dante has given to it such a selfsubsistent reality that one almost gets to feel as if the chief value of contemporary italian history had been to furnish it with explanatory footnotes and the age in which it was written assumes towards it the place of a satellite for italy dante is the thirteenth century  most men make the voyage of life as if they carried sealed orders which they were not to open till they were fairly in midocean but dante had made up his mind as to the true purpose and meaning of our existence in this world shortly after he had passed his twentyfifth year he had already conceived the system about which as a connecting thread the whole experience of his life the whole result of his studies was to cluster in imperishable crystals the cornerstone of his system was the freedom of the will in other words the right of private judgment with the condition of accountability which beatrice calls the noble virtue202 as to every man is offered his choice between good and evil and as even upon the root of a nature originally evil a habit of virtue may be engrafted203 no man is excused all hope abandon ye who enter in for they have thrown away reason which is the good of the intellect and it seems to me no less a marvel to bring back to reason him in whom it is wholly spent than to bring back to life him who has been four days in the tomb204 as a guide of the will in civil affairs the emperor in spiritual the pope205 dante is not one of those reformers who would assume the office of god to make all things new he knew the power of tradition and habit and wished to utilize it for his purpose he found the empire and the papacy already existing but both needing reformation that they might serve the ends of their original institution bad leadership was to blame men fit to gird on the sword had been turned into priests and good preachers spoiled to make bad kings206 the spiritual had usurped to itself the prerogatives of the temporal power   rome that reformed the world accustomed was   two suns to have which one road and the other   of god and of the world made manifest   one has the other quenched and to the crosier   the sword is joined and ill beseemeth it                                        because being joined one feareth not the other207  both powers held their authority directly from god not so however that the roman prince is not in some things subject to the roman pontiff since that human felicity to be attained only by peace justice and good government possible only under a single ruler is in some sort ordained to the end of immortal felicity let caesar use that reverence toward peter which a firstborn son ought to use toward a father that shone upon by the light of paternal grace he may more powerfully illumine the orb of earth over which he is set by him alone who is the ruler of all things spiritual and temporal208 as to the fatal gift of constantine dante demonstrates that an emperor could not alienate what he held only in trust but if he made the gift the pope should hold it as a feudatory of the empire for the benefit however of christs poor209 dante is always careful to distinguish between the papacy and the pope he prophesies for boniface viii a place in hell210 but acknowledges him as the vicar of christ goes so far even as to denounce the outrage of guillaume de nogaret at anagni as done to the saviour himself211 but in the spiritual world dante acknowledges no such supremacy and when he would have fallen on his knees before adrian v is rebuked by him in a quotation from the apocalypse                err not fellowservant am i   with thee and with the others to one power212  so impartial was this man whose great work is so often represented as a kind of bag in which he secreted the gall of personal prejudice so truly catholic is he that both parties find their arsenal in him the romanist proves his soundness in doctrine the antiromanist claims him as the first protestant the mazzinist and the imperialist can alike quote him for their purpose dantes ardent conviction would not let him see that both church and empire were on the wane if an ugly suspicion of this would force itself upon him perhaps he only clung to both the more tenaciously but he was no blind theorist he would reform the church through the church and is less anxious for italian independence than for italian good government under an emperor from germany rather than from utopia  the papacy was a necessary part of dantes system as a supplement to the empire which we strongly incline to believe was always foremost in his mind in a passage already quoted he says that the soil where rome sits is worthy beyond what men preach and admit that is as the birthplace of the empire both in the convito and the de monarchia he affirms that the course of roman history was providentially guided from the first rome was founded in the same year that brought into the world david ancestor of the redeemer after the flesh st augustine said that god showed in the most opulent and illustrious empire of the romans how much the civil virtues might avail even without true religion that it might be understood how this added men became citizens of another city whose king is truth whose law charity and whose measure eternity dante goes further than this he makes the romans as well as the jews a chosen people the one as founders of civil society the other as depositaries of the true faith213 one side of dantes mind was so practical and positive and his pride in the romans so intense214 that he sometimes seems to regard their mission as the higher of the two without peace which only good government could give mankind could not arrive at the highest virtue whether of the active or contemplative life and since what is true of the part is true of the whole and it happens in the particular man that by sitting quietly he is perfected in prudence and wisdom it is clear that the human race in the quiet or tranquillity of peace is most freely and easily disposed for its proper work which is almost divine as it is written thou hast made him a little lower than the angels215 whence it is manifest that universal peace is the best of those things which are ordained for our beatitude hence it is that not riches not pleasures not honors not length of life not health not strength not comeliness was sung to the shepherds from on high but peace216 it was dantes experience of the confusion of italy where                      one doth gnaw the other   of those whom one wall and one fosse shut in217  that suggested the thought of a universal umpire for that after all was to be the chief function of his emperor he was too wise to insist on a uniformity of political institutions a priori218 for he seems to have divined that the surest stay of order as of practical wisdom is habit which is a growth and cannot be made offhand he believed with aristotle that vigorous minds were intended by nature to rule219 and that certain races like certain men are born to leadership220 he calls democracies oligarchies and petty princedoms tyrannides oblique policies which drive the human race to slavery as is patent in all of them to one who reasons221 he has nothing but pity for mankind when it has become a manyheaded beast despising the higher intellect irrefragable in reason the lower which hath the face of experience222 he had no faith in a turbulent equality asserting the divine right of im as good as you he thought it fatal to all discipline the confounding of persons hath ever been the beginning of sickness in the state223 it is the same thought which shakespeare puts in the mouth of ulysses                         degree being vizarded   the unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask                         when degree is shaked   which is the ladder to all high designs   the enterprise is sick224  yet no one can read dante without feeling that he had a high sense of the worth of freedom whether in thought or government he represents indeed the very object of his journey through the triple realm of shades as a search after liberty225 but it must not be that scramble after undefined and indefinable rights which ends always in despotism equally degrading whether crowned with a red cap or an imperial diadem his theory of liberty has for its cornerstone the freedom of the will and the will is free only when the judgment wholly controls the appetite226 on such a base even a democracy may rest secure and on such alone  rome was always the central point of dantes speculation a shadow of her old sovereignty was still left her in the primacy of the church to which unity of faith was essential he accordingly has no sympathy with heretics of whatever kind he puts the extroubadour bishop of marseilles chief instigator of the horrors of provence in paradise227 the church is infallible in spiritual matters but this is an affair of outward discipline merely and means the church as a form of polity unity was dantes leading doctrine and therefore he puts mahomet among the schismatics not because he divided the church but the faith228 dantes church was of this world but he surely believed in another and spiritual one it has been questioned whether he was orthodox or not there can be no doubt of it so far as outward assent and conformity are concerned which he would practice himself and enforce upon others as the first postulate of order the prerequisite for all happiness in this life in regard to the visible church he was a reformer but no revolutionist it is sheer ignorance to speak of him as if there were anything new or exceptional in his denunciation of the corruptions of the clergy they were the commonplaces of the age nor were they confined to laymen229 to the absolute authority of the church dante admitted some exceptions he denies that the supreme pontiff has the unlimited power of binding and loosing claimed for him otherwise he might absolve me impenitent which god himself could not do230    by malison of theirs is not so lost   eternal love that it cannot return231  nor does the sacredness of the office extend to him who chances to hold it philip the fair himself could hardly treat boniface viii worse than he with wonderful audacity he declares the papal throne vacant by the mouth of saint peter himself232 even if his theory of a dual government were not in question dante must have been very cautious in meddling with the church it was not an age that stood much upon ceremony he himself tells us he had seen men burned alive and the author of the ottimo comento says i the writer saw followers of his fra dolcino burned at padua to the number of twentytwo together233 clearly in such a time as this one must not make the veil of the mysterious terse too thin234  in the affairs of this life dante was as we have said supremely practical and he makes prudence the chief of the cardinal virtues235 he has made up his mind to take things as they come and to do at rome as the romans do    ah savage company but in the church   with saints and in the tavern with the gluttons236  in the world of thought it was otherwise and here dantes doctrine if not precisely esoteric was certainly not that of his day and must be gathered from hints rather than direct statements the general notion of god was still perhaps is largely even now of a provincial one might almost say a denominational deity the popular poets always represent macon apolm tervagant and the rest as quasideities unable to resist the superior strength of the christian god the paynim answers the arguments of his wouldbe converters with the taunt that he would never worship a divinity who could not save himself from being done ignominiously to death dante evidently was not satisfied with the narrow conception which limits the interest of the deity to the affairs of jews and christians that saying of saint paul whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare i unto you had perhaps influenced him but his belief in the divine mission of the roman people probably was conclusive the roman empire had the help of miracles in perfecting itself he says and then enumerates some of them the first is that under numa pompilius the second king of the romans when he was sacrificing according to the rite of the gentiles a shield fell from heaven into the city chosen of god237 in the convito we find virgil speaking in the person of god and aeacus wisely having recourse to god the god being jupiter238 ephialtes is punished in hell for rebellion against the supreme jove239 and that there may be no misunderstanding dante elsewhere invokes the                           jove supreme   who upon earth for us wast crucified240  it is noticeable also that dante with evident design constantly alternates examples drawn from christian and pagan tradition or mythology241 he had conceived a unity in the human race all of whose branches had worshipped the same god under divers names and aspects had arrived at the same truth by different roads we cannot understand a passage in the twentysixth paradiso where dante inquires of adam concerning the names of god except as a hint that the chosen people had done in this thing even as the gentiles did242 it is true that he puts all pagans in limbo where without hope they live in longing and that he makes baptism essential to salvation243 but it is noticeable that his limbo is the elysium of virgil and that he particularizes adam noah moses abraham david and others as prisoners there with the rest till the descent of christ into hell244 but were they altogether without hope and did baptism mean an immersion of the body or a purification of the soul the state of the heathen after death had evidently been to dante one of those doubts that spring up at the foot of every truth in the de monarchia he says there are some judgments of god to which though human reason cannot attain by its own strength yet is it lifted to them by the help of faith and of those things which are said to us in holy writas to this that no one however perfect in the moral and intellectual virtues both as a habit of the mind and in practice can be saved without faith it being granted that he shall never have heard anything concerning christ for the unaided reason of man cannot look upon this as just nevertheless with the help of faith it can245 but faith it should seem was long in lifting dante to this height for in the nineteenth canto of the paradiso which must have been written many years after the passage just cited the doubt recurs again and we are told that it was a cavern concerning which he had made frequent questioning the answer is given here    truly to him who with me subtilizes   if so the scripture were not over you   for doubting there were marvellous occasion  but what scripture dante seems cautious tells us that the eternal judgments are above our comprehension postpones the answer and when it comes puts an orthodox prophylactic before it                    unto this kingdom never   ascended one who had not faith in christ   before or since he to the tree was nailed   but look thou many crying are christ christ   who at the judgment shall be far less near   to him than some shall be who knew not christ  there is then some hope for the man born on the bank of indus who has never heard of christ dante is still cautious but answers the question indirectly in the next canto by putting the trojan ripheus among the blessed    who would believe down in the errant world   that eer the trojan ripheus in this round   could be the fifth one of these holy lights   now knoweth he enough of what the world   has not the power to see of grace divine   although his sight may not discern the bottom  then he seems to hesitate again brings in the church legend of trajan brought back to life by the prayers of gregory the great that he might be converted and after an interval of fifty lines tells us how ripheus was saved    the other one through grace that from so deep   a fountain wells that never hath the eye   of any creature reached its primal wave   set all his love below on righteousness   wherefore from grace to grace did god unclose   his eye to our redemption yet to be   whence he believed therein and suffered not   from that day forth the stench of paganism   and he reproved therefor the folk perverse   those maidens three whom at the right hand wheel246   thou didst behold were unto him for baptism   more than a thousand years before baptizing  if the reader recall a passage already quoted from the convito247 he will perhaps think with us that the gate of dantes limbo is left ajar even for the ancient philosophers to slip out the divine judgments are still inscrutable and the ways of god past finding out but faith would seem to have led dante at last to a more merciful solution of his doubt than he had reached when he wrote the de monarchia it is always humanizing to see how the most rigid creed is made to bend before the kindlier instincts of the heart the stern dante thinks none beyond hope save those who are dead in sin and have made evil their good but we are by no means sure that he is not right in insisting rather on the implacable severity of the law than on the possible relenting of the judge exact justice is commonly more merciful in the long run than pity for it tends to foster in men those stronger qualities which make them good citizens an object second only with the romanminded dante to that of making them spiritually regenerate nay perhaps even more important as a necessary preliminary to it the inscription over the gate of hell tells us that the terms on which we receive the trust of life were fixed by the divine power which can what it wills and are therefore unchangeable by the highest wisdom and therefore for our truest good by the primal love and therefore the kindest these are the three attributes of that justice which moved the maker of them dante is no harsher than experience which always exacts the uttermost farthing no more inexorable than conscience which never forgives nor forgets no teaching is truer or more continually needful than that the stains of the soul are ineffaceable and that though their growth may be arrested their nature is to spread insidiously till they have brought all to their own color evil is a far more cunning and persevering propagandist than good for it has no inward strength and is driven to seek countenance and sympathy it must have company for it cannot bear to be alone in the dark while    virtue can see to do what virtue would   by her own radiant light  there is one other point which we will dwell on for a moment as bearing on the question of dantes orthodoxy his nature was one in which as in swedenborgs a clear practical understanding was continually streamed over by the northern lights of mysticism through which the familiar stars shine with a softened and more spiritual lustre nothing is more interesting than the way in which the two qualities of his mind alternate and indeed play into each other tingeing his matteroffact sometimes with unexpected glows of fancy sometimes giving an almost geometrical precision to his most mystical visions in his letter to can grande he says it behooves not those to whom it is given to know what is best in us to follow the footprints of the herd much rather are they bound to oppose its wanderings for the vigorous in intellect and reason endowed with a certain divine liberty are constrained by no customs nor is it wonderful since they are not governed by the laws but much more govern the laws themselves it is not impossible that dante whose love of knowledge was allembracing may have got some hint of the doctrine of the oriental sufis with them the first and lowest of the steps that lead upward to perfection is the law a strict observance of which is all that is expected of the ordinary man whose mind is not open to the conception of a higher virtue and holiness but the sufi puts himself under the guidance of some holy man virgil in the inferno whose teaching he receives implicitly and so arrives at the second step which is the path purgatorio by which he reaches a point where he is freed from all outward ceremonials and observances and has risen from an outward to a spiritual worship the third step is knowledge paradiso endowed by which with supernatural insight he becomes like the angels about the throne and has but one farther step to take before he reaches the goal and becomes one with god the analogies of this system with dantes are obvious and striking they become still more so when virgil takes leave of him at the entrance of the terres trial paradise with the words    expect no more a word or sign from me   free and upright and sound is thy freewill   and error were it not to do its bidding   thee oer thyself i therefore crown and mitre248  that is i make thee king and bishop over thyself the inward light is to be thy law in things both temporal and spiritual the originality of dante consists in his not allowing any divorce between the intellect and the soul in its highest sense in his making reason and intuition work together to the same end of spiritual perfection the unsatisfactoriness of science leads faust to seek repose in worldly pleasure it led dante to find it in faith of whose efficacy the shortcoming of all logical substitutes for it was the most convincing argument that we cannot know is to him a proof that there is some higher plane on which we can believe and see dante had discovered the incalculable worth of a single idea as compared with the largest heap of facts ever gathered to a man more interested in the soul of things than in the body of them the little finger of plato is thicker than the loins of aristotle  we cannot but think that there is something like a fallacy in mr buckles theory that the advance of mankind is necessarily in the direction of science and not in that of morals no doubt the laws of morals existed from the beginning but so also did those of science and it is by the application not the mere recognition of both that the race is benefited no one questions how much science has done for our physical comfort and convenience and with the mass of men these perhaps must of necessity precede the quickening of their moral instincts but such material gains are illusory unless they go hand in hand with a corresponding ethical advance the man who gives his life for a principle has done more for his kind than he who discovers a new metal or names a new gas for the great motors of the race are moral not intellectual and their force lies ready to the use of the poorest and weakest of us all we accept a truth of science so soon as it is demonstrated are perfectly willing to take it on authority can appropriate whatever use there may be in it without the least understanding of its processes as men send messages by the electric telegraph but every truth of morals must be redemonstrated in the experience of the individual man before he is capable of utilizing it as a constituent of character or a guide in action a man does not receive the statements that two and two make four and that the pure in heart shall see god on the same terms the one can be proved to him with four grains of corn he can never arrive at a belief in the other till he realize it in the intimate persuasion of his whole being this is typified in the mystery of the incarnation the divine reason must forever manifest itself anew in the lives of men and that as individuals this atonement with god this identification of the man with the truth249 so that right action shall not result from the lower reason of utility but from the higher of a will so purified of self as to sympathize by instinct with the eternal laws250 is not something that can be done once for all that can become historic and traditional a dead flower pressed between the leaves of the family bible but must be renewed in every generation and in the soul of every man that it may be valid certain sects show their recognition of this in what are called revivals a gross and carnal attempt to apply truth as it were mechanically and to accomplish by the etherization of excitement and the magnetism of crowds what is possible only in the solitary exaltations of the soul this is the high moral of dantes poem we have likened it to a christian basilica and as in that so there is here also painted or carven every image of beauty and holiness the artists mind could conceive for the adornment of the holy place we may linger to enjoy these if we will but if we follow the central thought that runs like the nave from entrance to choir it leads us to an image of the divine made human to teach us how the human might also make itself divine dante beholds at last an image of that power love and wisdom one in essence but trine in manifestation to answer the needs of our triple nature and satisfy the senses the heart and the mind   within the deep and luminous subsistence   of the high light appeared to me three circles   of threefold color and of one dimension   and by the second seemed the first reflected   as iris is by iris and the third   seemed fire that equally by both is breathed                                        within itself of its own very color   seemed to me painted with our effigy   wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein  he had reached the high altar where the miracle of transubstantiation is wrought itself also a type of the great conversion that may be accomplished in our own nature the lower thing assuming the qualities of the higher not by any process of reason but by the very fire of the divine love                     then there smote my mind   a flash of lightning wherein came its wish251  perhaps it seems little to say that dante was the first great poet who ever made a poem wholly out of himself but rightly looked at it implies a wonderful selfreliance and originality in his genius his is the first keel that ever ventured into the silent sea of human consciousness to find a new world of poetry    lacqua ch io prendo giammai non si corse252  he discovered that not only the story of some heroic person but that of any man might be epical that the way to heaven was not outside the world but through it living at a time when the end of the world was still looked for as imminent253 he believed that the second coming of the lord was to take place on no more conspicuous stage than the soul of man that his kingdom would be established in the surrendered will a poem the precious distillation of such a character and such a life as his through all those sorrowing but undespondent years must have a meaning in it which few men have meaning enough in themselves wholly to penetrate that its allegorical form belongs to a past fashion with which the modern mind has little sympathy we should no more think of denying than of whitewashing a fresco of giotto but we may take it as we may nature which is also full of double meanings either as picture or as parable either for the simple delight of its beauty or as a shadow of the spiritual world we may take it as we may history either for its picturesqueness or its moral either for the variety of its figures or as a witness to that perpetual presence of god in his creation of which dante was so profoundly sensible he had seen and suffered much but it is only to the man who is himself of value that experience is valuable he had not looked on man and nature as most of us do with less interest than into the columns of our daily newspaper he saw in them the latest authentic news of the god who made them for he carried everywhere that vision washed clear with tears which detects the meaning under the mask and beneath the casual and transitory the eternal keeping its sleepless watch the secret of dantes power is not far to seek whoever can express himself with the full force of unconscious sincerity will be found to have uttered something ideal and universal dante intended a didactic poem but the most picturesque of poets could not escape his genius and his sermon sings and glows and charms in a manner that surprises more at the fiftieth reading than the first such variety of freshness is in imagination  there are no doubt in the divina commedia regarded merely as poetry sandy spaces enough both of physics and metaphysics but with every deduction dante remains the first of descriptive as well as moral poets his verse is as various as the feeling it conveys now it has the terseness and edge of steel and now palpitates with iridescent softness like the breast of a dove in vividness he is without a rival he drags back by its tangled locks the unwilling head of some petty traitor of an italian provincial town lets the fire glare on the sullen face for a moment and it sears itself into the memory forever he shows us an angel glowing with that love of god which makes him a star even amid the glory of heaven and the holy shape keeps lifelong watch in our fantasy constant as a sentinel he has the skill of conveying impressions indirectly in the gloom of hell his bodily presence is revealed by his stirring something on the mount of expiation by casting a shadow would he have us feel the brightness of an angel he makes him whiten afar through the smoke like a dawn254 or walking straight toward the setting sun he finds his eyes suddenly unable to withstand a greater splendor against which his hand is unavailing to shield him even its reflected light then is brighter than the direct ray of the sun255 and how mack more keenly do we feel the parched lips of master adam for those rivulets of the casentino which run down into the arno making their channels cool and soft his comparisons are as fresh as simple and as directly from nature as those of homer256 sometimes they show a more subtle observation as where he compares the stooping of antaeus over him to the leaning tower of garisenda to which the clouds flying in an opposite direction to its inclination give away their motion257 his suggestions of individuality too from attitude or speech as in farinata sordello or pia258 give in a hint what is worth acres of socalled characterpainting in straightforward pathos the single and sufficient thrust of phrase he has no competitor he is too sternly touched to be effusive and tearful    io non piangeva si dentro impietrai259  his is always the true coin of speech                            si lucida e si tonda   che nel suo conio nulla ci sinforsa  and never the highly ornamented promise to pay token of insolvency  no doubt it is primarily by his poetic qualities that a poet must be judged for it is by these if by anything that he is to maintain his place in literature and he must be judged by them absolutely with reference that is to the highest standard and not relatively to the fashions and opportunities of the age in which he lived yet these considerations must fairly enter into our decision of another side of the question and one that has much to do with the true quality of the man with his character as distinguished from his talent and therefore with how much he will influence men as well as delight them we may reckon up pretty exactly a mans advantages and defects as an artist these he has in common with others and they are to be measured by a recognized standard but there is something in his genius that is incalculable it would be hard to define the causes of the difference of impression made upon us respectively by two such men as aeschylus and euripides but we feel profoundly that the latter though in some respects a better dramatist was an infinitely lighter weight aeschylus stirs something in us far deeper than the sources of mere pleasurable excitement the man behind the verse is far greater than the verse itself and the impulse he gives to what is deepest and most sacred in us though we cannot always explain it is none the less real and lasting some men always seem to remain outside their work others make their individuality felt in every part of it their very life vibrates in every verse and we do not wonder that it has made them lean for many years the virtue that has gone out of them abides in what they do the book such a man makes is indeed as milton called it the precious lifeblood of a master spirit theirs is a true immortality for it is their soul and not their talent that survives in their work dantes concise forthrightness of phrase which to that of most other poets is as a stab260 to a blow with a cudgel the vigor of his thought the beauty of his images the refinement of his conception of spiritual things are marvellous if we compare him with his age and its best achievement but it is for his power of inspiring and sustaining it is because they find in him a spur to noble aims a secure refuge in that defeat which the present always seems that they prize dante who know and love him best he is not merely a great poet but an influence part of the souls resources in time of trouble from him she learns that married to the truth she is a mistress but otherwise a slave shut out of all liberty261  all great poets have their message to deliver us from something higher than they we venture on no unworthy comparison between him who reveals to us the beauty of this worlds love and the grandeur of this worlds passion and him who shows that love of god is the fruit whereof all other loves are but the beautiful and fleeting blossom that the passions are yet sublimer objects of contemplation when subdued by the will they become patience in suffering and perseverance in the upward path but we cannot help thinking that if shakespeare be the most comprehensive intellect so dante is the highest spiritual nature that has expressed itself in rhythmical form had he merely made us feel how petty the ambitions sorrows and vexations of earth appear when looked down on from the heights of our own character and the seclusion of our own genius or from the region where we commune with god he had done much    i with my sight returned through one and all   the sevenfold spheres and i beheld this globe   such that i smiled at its ignoble semblance262  but he has done far more he has shown us the way by which that country far beyond the stars may be reached may become the habitual dwellingplace and fortress of our nature instead of being the object of its vague aspiration in moments of indolence at the round table of king arthur there was left always one seat empty for him who should accomplish the adventure of the holy grail it was called the perilous seat because of the dangers he must encounter who would win it in the company of the epic poets there was a place left for whoever should embody the christian idea of a triumphant life outwardly all defeat inwardly victorious who should make us partakers of that cup of sorrow in which all are communicants with christ he who should do this would indeed achieve the perilous seat for he must combine poesy with doctrine in such cunning wise that the one lose not its beauty nor the other its severityand dante has done it as he takes possession of it we seem to hear the cry he himself heard when virgil rejoined the company of great singers    all honor to the loftiest of poets     footnotes      1 the shadow of dante being an

an age when     stonecutting was cheap would have aimed at something more befitting     the occasion it is certain at least in dantes case that cardinal     bembo would never have inserted in the very

over into     his own image therefore it is manifest that in this love the divine     virtue descends into men in the guise of an angel  and it is to     be noted that the descending of the virtue of

to have happened to dante for i do not know it     though it be true that whether things like these or others were the     cause of it once parted from her he would never come where she was     nor suffer her to come where he was for all that she was the mother     of several children by him that he did not come to her is not     wonderful for he would have been burned alive if he had dante could     not send for her because he was a homeless wanderer she remained in     florence with her children because she had powerful relations and     perhaps property there it is plain also that what boccaccio says     of dantes lussuria had no better foundation it gave him a chance     to turn a period he gives no particulars and his general statement     is simply incredible lionardo bruni

passes not save     by error that point which is beyond our natural understanding and so     is limited and measured in the angelic nature the amount of that     wisdom which the nature of each is

to a living mistress  it is instructive to     compare the effect of his purely sensuous verses with that of     dantes which have such a wonderful reach behind them they are     singularly pleasing but they do not stay by us as those of his model     had done by him  spenser was as milton called him a sage and     serious poet he would be the last to take offence if we draw from     him a moral

dante we have never been able to find it unless it be in that     passage inferno xv 119 where brunetto latini lingers under the     burning shower to recommend his tesoro to his former pupil there is     a comical touch of nature in an authors solicitude for his little     work not as in fieldings case after its but his own damnation     we are not sure but we fancy we catch the momentary flicker of a     smile across those serious eyes of dantes there is something like     humor in the opening verses of the xvi paradiso where dante tells     us how even in heaven he could not help glorying in being gently     bornhe who had devoted a canzone and a book of the convito to     proving that nobility consisted wholly in virtue but there is after     all something touchingly natural in the feeling dante unjustly     robbed of his property and with it of the independence so dear to     him seeing             needy nothings trimmed in jollity       and captive good attending captain ill      would naturally fall back on a distinction which money could neither     buy nor replace there is a curious passage in the convito which     shows how bitterly he resented his undeserved poverty he tells us     that buried treasure commonly revealed itself to the bad rather than     the good verily i saw the place on the flanks of a mountain in     tuscany called falterona where the basest peasant of the whole     countryside digging found there more than a bushel of pieces of the     finest silver which perhaps had awaited him more than a thousand     years tr iv c 11 one can see the grimness of his face as he     looked and thought how salt a savor hath the bread of others       160 lenvoi of canzone xiv of the canzoniere i of the convito     dante cites the first verse of this canzone paradiso viii 37       161 how dante himself could allegorize even historical personages     may be seen in a curious passage of the convito tr iv c 28     where commenting on a passage of lucan he treats martia and cato as     mere figures of speech       162 ii of the canzoniere see fraticellis preface       163 don quixote p ii c viii       164 de vulgari eloquio l ii c 2 he says the

in     which the verace speglio is spoken of paradise xxvi 107 108        che fa di sè pareglie l altre cose       e nulla face lui di sè pareglio      butis comment is that is makes of itself a receptacle to other     things that is to all things that exist which are all seen in it     dante says ubi supra the descending of the virtue of one thing     into another is a reducing that other into a likeness of itself     whence we see that the sun sending his ray down hitherward reduces     things to a likeness with his light in so far as they are able by     their disposition to receive light from his power so i say that god     reduces this love to a likeness with himself as much as it is     possible for it to be like him in provençal pareilh means like     and dante may have formed his word from it but the four earliest     printed texts read        che fa di sè pareglio all altre cose      accordingly we are inclined to think that the next verse should be     corrected thus        e nulla face a lui di sè pareglio      we would form pareglio from parere a something in which things     appear as miraglio from mirare a something in which they are     seen god contains all things in himself but nothing can wholly     contain him the blessed behold all things in him as if reflected     but not one of the things so reflected is capable of his image in its     completeness this interpretation is confirmed by paradiso xix     4951        e quinci appar ch ogni minor natura       É corto recettacolo a quel bene         che non ha fine e sè con sè misura       166 wisdom of solomon vii 26 quoted by dante convito tr     iii c 15 there are other passages in the wisdom of solomon     besides that just cited which we may well believe dante to have had     in his mind when writing the canzone beginning        amor che nella mente mi ragiona      and the commentary upon it and some to which his experience of life     must have given an intenser meaning the writer of that book also     personifies wisdom as the mistress of his soul i loved her and     sought her out from my youth i desired to make her my spouse and i     was a lover of her beauty he says of wisdom that she was present     when thou god madest the world and dante in the same way     identifies her with the divine logos citing as authority the     beginning of the gospel of john he tells us i perceived that i     could not otherwise obtain her except god gave her me and dante     came at last to the same conclusion again for the very true     beginning of her is the desire of discipline and the care of     discipline is love and love is the keeping of her laws and the     giving heed unto her laws is the assurance of incorruption but who     can doubt that he read with a bitter exultation and applied to     himself passages like these which follow when the righteous fled     from his brothers wrath she guided him in right paths showed him the     kingdom of god and gave him knowledge of holy things she defended     him from his enemies and kept him safe from those that lay in wait      that he might know that godliness is stronger than all she     forsook him not but delivered him from sin she went down with him     into the pit and left him not in bonds till she brought him the     sceptre of the kingdom  and gave him perpetual glory it was     perhaps from this book that dante got the hint of making his     punishments and penances typical of the sins that earned them     wherefore whereas men lived dissolutely and unrighteously thou     hast tormented them with their own abominations dante was intimate     with the scriptures they do even a scholar no harm m victor le     clerc in his histoire littéraire de la france au quatorzième     siècle tom ii p 72 thinks it not impossible that a passage     in the lamentations of jeremiah paraphrased by dante may have been     suggested to him by rutebeuf or tristan rather than by the prophet     himself dante would hardly have found himself so much at home in the     company of jongleurs as in that of prophets yet he was familiar     with french and provençal poetry beside the evidence of the vulgari     eloquio there are frequent and broad traces in the commedia of the     roman de la rose slighter ones of the chevalier de la charette     guillaume dorange and a direct imitation of

the knowledge     of god dante quotes this in speaking of the influence of the stars     which interpreting it presently by the theological way he     compares to that of the holy spirit and thy counsel who hath known     except thou give wisdom and send thy holy spirit from above wisdom     of solomon ix 17 the last words of the convito are her     philosophy whose proper dwelling is in the depths of the divine     mind the ordinary reading is ragione reason but it seems to us     an obvious blunder for magione mansion dwelling       172 convito tr iv c 28       173 he refers to a change

wont he was a guelph by inheritance he     became a ghibelline by conviction       174 it should seem from dantes words at the time when much     people went to see the blessed image and ye seem to come from a     far off people that this was some extraordinary occasion and what     so likely as the jubilee of 1300 compare paradiso xxxi 103108     dantes comparisons are so constantly drawn from actual eyesight     that his allusion inferno xiii 2833 to a device of boniface     viii for passing the crowds quietly across the bridge of saint     angelo renders it not unlikely that he was in rome at that time and     perhaps conceived his poem there as giovanni villani his chronicle     that rome would deeply stir his mind and heart is beyond question     and certes i am of a firm opinion

 uncertain if pietro was the author of it indeed we strongly doubt     it it is at least one of the earliest for it appears by the     comment on paradiso xxvi that the greater part of it was written     before 1341 it is remarkable for the strictness with which it holds     to the spiritual interpretation of the poem and deserves much more     to be called ottimo than the comment which goes by that name its     publication is due to the zeal and liberality of the late lord     vernon to whom students of dante are also indebted for the     paralleltext reprint of the four earliest editions

shadows of names some of them mere initials nor can it be said of them that their works have perished because they were written in an obsolete dialect for it is the poem that keeps the language alive and not the language that buoys up the poem the revival of letters as it is called was at first the revival of ancient letters which while it made men pedants could do very little toward making them poets much less toward making them original writers there was nothing left of the freshness vivacity invention and careless faith in the present which make many of the productions of the norman trouvères delightful reading even now the whole of europe during the fifteenth century produced no book which has continued readable or has become in any sense of the word a classic i do not mean that that century has left us no illustrious names that it was not enriched with some august intellects who kept alive the apostolic succession of thought and speculation who passed along the still unextinguished torch of intelligence the lampada vitae to those who came after them but a classic is properly a book which maintains itself by virtue of that happy coalescence of matter and style that innate and exquisite sympathy between the thought that gives life and the form that consents to every mood of grace and dignity which can be simple without being vulgar elevated without being distant and which is something neither ancient nor modern always new and incapable of growing old it is not his latin which makes horace cosmopolitan nor can bérangers french prevent his becoming so no hedge of language however thorny no dragoncoil of centuries will keep men away from these true apples of the hesperides if once they have caught sight or scent of them if poems die it is because there was never true life in them that is that true poetic vitality which no depth of thought no airiness of fancy no sincerity of feeling can singly communicate but which leaps throbbing at touch of that shaping faculty the imagination take aristotles ethics the scholastic philosophy the theology of aquinas the ptolemaic system of astronomy the small politics of a provincial city of the middle ages mix in at will grecian roman and christian mythology and tell me what chance there is to make an immortal poem of such an incongruous mixture can these dry bones live yes dante can create such a soul under these ribs of death that one hundred and fifty editions of his poem shall be called for in these last sixty years the first half of the sixth century since his death accordingly i am apt to believe that the complaints one sometimes hears of the neglect of our older literature are the regrets of archaeologists rather than of critics one does not need to advertise the squirrels where the nuttrees are nor could any amount of lecturing persuade them to spend their teeth on a hollow nut  on the whole the scottish poetry of the fifteenth century has more meat in it than the english but this is to say very little where it is meant to be serious and lofty it falls into the same vices of unreality and allegory which were the fashion of the day and which there are some patriots so fearfully and wonderfully made as to relish stripped of the archaisms that turn every y to a meaningless z spell which quhilk shake schaik bugle bowgill powder puldir and will not let us simply whistle till we have puckered our mouths to quhissill in which the scottish antiquaries love to keep it disguisedas if it were nearer to poetry the further it got from all human recognition and sympathystripped of these there is little to distinguish it from the contemporary versemongering south of the tweed their compositions are generally as stiff and artificial as a trellis in striking contrast with the popular balladpoetry of scotland some of which possibly falls within this period though most of it is later which clambers lawlessly if you will but at least freely and simply twining the bare stem of old tradition with graceful sentiment and lively natural sympathies i find a few sweet and flowing verses in dunbars merle and nightingaleindeed one whole stanza that has always seemed exquisite to me it is this    neer sweeter noise was heard by living man   than made this merry gentle nightingale   her sound went with the river as it ran   out through the fresh and flourished lusty vale   o merle quoth she o fool leave off thy tale   for in thy song good teaching there is none   for both are lostthe time and the travail   of every love but upon god alone  but except this lucky poem i find little else in the serious verses of dunbar that does not seem to me tedious and pedantic i dare say a few more lines might be found scattered here and there but i hold it a sheer waste of time to hunt after these thin needles of wit buried in unwieldy haystacks of verse if that be genius the less we have of it the better his dance of the seven deadly sins over which the excellent lord hailes went into raptures is wanting in everything but coarseness and if his invention dance at all it is like a galleyslave in chains under the lash it would be well for us if the sins themselves were indeed such wretched bugaboos as he has painted for us what he means for humor is but the dullest vulgarity his satire would be billingsgate if it could and failing becomes a mere offence in the nostrils for it takes a great deal of salt to keep scurrility sweet mr sibbald in his chronicle of scottish poetry has admiringly preserved more than enough of it and seems to find a sort of national savor therein such as delights his countrymen in a haggis or the german in his sauerkraut the uninitiated foreigner puts his handkerchief to his nose wonders and gets out of the way as soon as he civilly can barbours brus if not precisely a poem has passages whose simple tenderness raises them to that level that on freedom is familiar263 but its highest merit is the natural and unstrained tone of manly courage in it the easy and familiar way in which barbour always takes chivalrous conduct as a matter of course as if heroism were the least you could ask of any man i modernize a few verses to show what i mean when the king of england turns to fly from the battle of bannockburn and barbour with his usual generosity tells us he has heard that sir aymer de valence led him away by the bridlerein against his will sir giles dargente    saw the king thus and his menie   shape them to flee so speedily   he came right to the king in hy hastily   and said sir since that is so   that ye thus gate your gate will go   have ye goodday for back will i   yet never fled i certainly   and i choose here to bide and die   than to live shamefully and fly  the brus is in many ways the best rhymed chronicle ever written it is national in a high and generous way but i confess i have little faith in that quality in literature which is commonly called nationalitya kind of praise seldom given where there is anything better to be said literature that loses its meaning or the best part of it when it gets beyond sight of the parish steeple is not what i understand by literature to tell you when you cannot fully taste a book that it is because it is so thoroughly national is to condemn the book to say it of a poem is even worse for it is to say that what should be true of the whole compass of human nature is true only to some northandbyeasthalfeast point of it i can understand the nationality of firdusi when looking sadly back to the former glories of his country he tells us that the nightingale still sings old persian i can understand the nationality of burns when he turns his plough aside to spare the rough burr thistle and hopes he may write a song or two for dear auld scotias sake that sort of nationality belongs to a country of which we are all citizensthat country of the heart which has no boundaries laid down on the map all great poetry must smack of the soil for it must be rooted in it must suck life and substance from it but it must do so with the aspiring instinct of the pine that climbs forever toward diviner air and not in the grovelling fashion of the potato any verse that makes you and me foreigners is not only not great poetry but no poetry at all dunbars works were disinterred and edited some thirty years ago by mr laing and whoso is national enough to like thistles may browse there to his hearts content i am inclined for other pasture having long ago satisfied myself by a good deal of dogged reading that every generation is sure of its own share of bores without borrowing from the past  a little later came gawain douglas whose translation of the aeneid is linguistically valuable and whose introductions to the seventh and twelfth booksthe one describing winter and the other mayhave been safely praised they are so hard to read there is certainly some poetic feeling in them and the welcome to the sun comes as near enthusiasm as is possible for a ploughman with a good steady yoke of oxen who lays over one furrow of verse and then turns about to lay the next as cleverly alongside it as he can but it is a wrong done to good taste to hold up this item kind of description any longer as deserving any other credit than that of a good memory it is a mere bill of parcels a postmortem inventory of nature where imagination is not merely not called for but would be out of place why a recipe in the cookerybook is as much like a good dinner as this kind of stuff is like true wordpainting the poet with a real eye in his head does not give us everything but only the best of everything he selects he combines or else gives what is characteristic only while the false style of which i have been speaking seems to be as glad to get a pack of impertinences on its shoulders as christian in the pilgrims progress was to be rid of his one strong verse that can hold itself upright as the french critic rivarol said of dante with the bare help of the substantive and verb is worth acres of this dead cordwood piled stick on stick a boundless continuity of dryness i would rather have written that halfstanza of longfellows in the wreck of the hesperus of the billow that swept her crew like icicles from her deck than all gawain douglass tedious enumeration of meteorological phenomena put together a real landscape is never tiresome it never presents itself to us as a disjointed succession of isolated particulars we take it in with one sweep of the eyeits light its shadow its melting gradations of distance we do not say it is this it is that and the other and we may be sure that if a description in poetry is tiresome there is a grievous mistake somewhere all the pictorial adjectives in the dictionary will not bring it a hairsbreadth nearer to truth and nature the fact is that what we see is in the mind to a greater degree than we are commonly aware as coleridge says    o lady we receive but what we give   and in our life alone doth nature live  i have made the unfortunate dunbar the text for a diatribe on the subject of descriptive poetry because i find that this old ghost is not laid yet but comes back like a vampire to suck the life out of a true enjoyment of poetryand the medicine by which vampires were cured was to unbury them drive a stake through them and get them under ground again with all despatch the first duty of the muse is to be delightful and it is an injury done to all of us when we are put in the wrong by a kind of statutory affirmation on the part of the critics of something to which our judgment will not consent and from which our taste revolts a collection of poets is commonly made up nine parts in ten of this perfunctory versemaking and i never look at one without regretting that we have lost that excellent latin phrase corpus poetarum in fancy i always read it on the backs of the volumesa body of poets indeed with scarce one soul to a hundred of them  one genuine english poet illustrated the early years of the sixteenth centuryjohn skelton he had vivacity fancy humor and originality gleams of the truest poetical sensibility alternate in him with an almost brutal coarseness he was truly rabelaisian before rabelais but there is a freedom and hilarity in much of his writing that gives it a singular attraction a breath of cheerfulness runs along the slender stream of his verse under which it seems to ripple and crinkle catching and casting back the sunshine like a stream blown on by clear western winds  but skelton was an exceptional blossom of autumn a long and dreary winter follows surrey who brought back with him from italy the blankverse not long before introduced by trissino is to some extent another exception he had the sentiment of nature and unhackneyed feeling but he has no mastery of verse nor any elegance of diction we have gascoyne surrey wyatt stiff pedantic artificial systematic as a country cemetery and worst of all the whole time desperately in love every verse is as flat thin and regular as a lath and their poems are nothing more than bundles of such tied trimly together they are said to have refined our language let us devoutly hope they did for it would be pleasant to be grateful to them for something but i fear it was not so for only genius can do that and sternhold and hopkins are inspired men in comparison with them for sternhold was at least the author of two noble stanzas    the lord descended from above     and bowed the heavens high   and underneath his feet he cast     the darkness of the sky   on cherubs and on cherubims     full royally he rode   and on the wings of all the winds     came flying all abroad  but gascoyne and the rest did nothing more than put the worst school of italian love poetry into an awkward english dress the italian proverb says inglese italianizzato diavolo incarnato that an englishman italianized is the very devil incarnate and one feels the truth of it here the very titles of their poems set one yawning and their wit is the cause of the dulness that is in other men the lover deceived by his love repenteth him of the true love he bare her as thus    where i sought heaven there found i hap     from danger unto death   much like the mouse that treads the trap     in hope to find her food   and bites the bread that stops her breath     so in like case i stood  the lover accusing his love for her unfaithfulness proposeth to live in liberty he says    but i am like the beaten fowl     that from the net escaped   and thou art like the ravening owl     that all the night hath waked  and yet at the very time these men were writing there were simple balladwriters who could have set them an example of simplicity force and grandeur compare the futile efforts of these poetasters to kindle themselves by a painted flame and to be pathetic over the lay figure of a mistress with the wild vigor and almost fierce sincerity of the twa corbies    as i was walking all alone   i heard twa corbies making a moan   the one unto the other did say   where shall we gang dine today   in beyond that old turf dyke   i wot there lies a new slain knight   and naebody kens that he lies there   but his hawk and his hound and his lady fair   his hound is to the hunting gone   his hawk to fetch the wild fowl home   his lady has taen another mate   so we may make our dinner sweet   oer his white bones as they lie bare   the wind shall blow forevermair  there was a lesson in rhetoric for our worthy friends could they have understood it but they were as much afraid of an attack of nature as of the plague  such was the poetical inheritance of style and diction into which spenser was born and which he did more than any one else to redeem from the leaden gripe of vulgar and pedantic conceit sir philip sidney born the year after him with a keener critical instinct and a taste earlier emancipated than his own would have been had he lived longer perhaps even more directly influential in educating the taste and refining the vocabulary of his contemporaries and immediate successors the better of his pastoral poems in the arcadia are in my judgment more simple natural and above all more pathetic than those of spenser who sometimes strains the shepherds pipe with a blast that would better suit the trumpet sidney had the good sense to feel that it was unsophisticated sentiment rather than rusticity of phrase that befitted such themes264 he recognized the distinction between simplicity and vulgarity which wordsworth was so long in finding out and seems to have divined the fact that there is but one kind of english that is always appropriate and never obsolete namely the very best265 with the single exception of thomas campion his experiments in adapting classical metres to english verse are more successful than those of his contemporaries some of his elegiacs are not ungrateful to the ear and it can hardly be doubted that coleridge borrowed from his eclogue of strephon and klaius the pleasing movement of his own catullian hendecasyllabics spenser perhaps out of deference to sidney also tried his hand at english hexameters the introduction of which was claimed by his friend gabriel harvey who thereby assured to himself an immortality of grateful remembrance but the result was a series of jolts and jars proving that the language had run off the track he seems to have been half conscious of it himself and there is a gleam of mischief in what he writes to harvey i like your late english hexameter so exceedingly well that i also enure my pen sometime in that kind which i find indeed as i have often heard you defend in word neither so hard nor so harsh but that it will easily yield itself to our mothertongue for the only or chiefest hardness which seemeth is in the accent which sometime gapeth and as it were yawneth illfavoredly coming short of that it should and sometime exceeding the measure of the number as in carpenter the middle syllable being used short in speech when it shall be read long in verse seemeth like a lame gosling that draweth one leg after her and heaven being used short as one syllable when it is in verse stretched out with a diastole is like a lame dog that holds up one leg266 it is almost inconceivable that spensers hexameters should have been written by the man who was so soon to teach his native language how to soar and sing and to give a fuller sail to english verse  one of the most striking facts in our literary history is the preeminence at once so frankly and unanimously conceded to spenser by his contemporaries at first it is true he had not many rivals before the faery queen two long poems were printed and popularthe mirror for magistrates and warners albions englandand not long after it came the polyolbion of drayton and the civil wars of daniel this was the period of the saurians in english poetry interminable poems book after book and canto after canto like farstretching vertebrae that at first sight would seem to have rendered earth unfit for the habitation of man they most of them sleep well now as once they made their readers sleep and their huge remains lie embedded in the deep morasses of chambers and anderson we wonder at the length of face and general atrabilious look that mark the portraits of the men of that generation but it is no marvel when even their relaxations were such downright hard work fathers when their day on earth was up must have folded down the leaf and left the task to be finished by their sonsa dreary inheritance yet both drayton and daniel are fine poets though both of them in their most elaborate works made shipwreck of their genius on the shoal of a bad subject neither of them could make poetry coalesce with gazetteering or chroniclemaking it was like trying to put a declaration of love into the forms of a declaration in trover the polyolbion is nothing less than a versified gazetteer of england and walesfortunately scotland was not yet annexed or the poem would have been even longer and already it is the plesiosaurus of verse mountains rivers and even marshes are personified to narrate historical episodes or to give us geographical lectures there are two fine verses in the seventh book where speaking of the cutting down some noble woods he says    their trunks like aged folk now bare and naked stand   as for revenge to heaven each held a withered hand  and there is a passage about the sea in the twentieth book that comes near being fine but the far greater part is mere joinerwork consider the life of man that we flee away as a shadow that our days are as a post and then think whether we can afford to honor such a draft upon our time as is implied in these thirty books all in alexandrines even the laborious selden who wrote annotations on it sometimes more entertaining than the text gave out at the end of the eighteenth book yet drayton could write well and had an agreeable lightsomeness of fancy as his nymphidia proves his poem to the cambrobritons on their harp is full of vigor it runs it leaps clashing its verses like swords upon bucklers and moves the pulse to a charge  daniel was in all respects a man of finer mould he did indeed refine our tongue and deserved the praise his contemporaries concur in giving him of being welllanguaged267 writing two hundred and fifty years ago he stands in no need of a glossary and i have noted scarce a dozen words and not more turns of phrase in his works that have become obsolete this certainly indicates both remarkable taste and equally remarkable judgment there is an equable dignity in his thought and sentiment such as we rarely meet his best poems always remind me of a tableland where because all is so level we are apt to forget on how lofty a plane we are standing i think his musophilus the best poem of its kind in the language the reflections are natural the expression condensed the thought weighty and the language worthy of it but he also wasted himself on an historical poem in which the characters were incapable of that remoteness from ordinary associations which is essential to the ideal not that we can escape into the ideal by merely emigrating into the past or the unfamiliar as in the german legend the little black kobold of prose that haunts us in the present will seat himself on the first load of furniture when we undertake our flitting if the magician be not there to exorcise him no man can jump off his own shadow nor for that matter off his own age and it is very likely that daniel had only the thinking and languaging parts of a poets outfit without the higher creative gift which alone can endow his conceptions with enduring life and with an interest which transcends the parish limits of his generation in the prologue to his masque at court he has unconsciously defined his own poetry    wherein no wild no rude no antic sport   but tender passions motions soft and grave   the still spectator must expect to have  and indeed his verse does not snatch you away from ordinary associations and hurry you along with it as is the wont of the higher kinds of poetry but leaves you as it were upon the bank watching the peaceful current and lulled by its somewhat monotonous murmur his bestknown poem blunderingly misprinted in all the collections is that addressed to the countess of cumberland it is an amplification of horaces integer vitae and when we compare it with the original we miss the point the compactness and above all the urbane tone of the original it is very fine english but it is the english of diplomacy somehow and is never downright this or that but always has the honor to be so or so with sentiments of the highest consideration yet the praise of welllanguaged since it implies that good writing then as now demanded choice and forethought is not without interest for those who would classify the elements of a style that will wear and hold its colors well his diction if wanting in the more hardy evidences of muscle has a suppleness and spring that give proof of training and endurance his defence of rhyme written in prose a more difficult test than verse has a passionate eloquence that reminds one of burke and is more lightarmed and modern than the prose of milton fifty years later for us occidentals he has a kindly prophetic word    and who in time knows whither we may vent   the treasure of our tongue to what strange shores   the gain of our best glory may be sent   to enrich unknowing nations with our stores   what worlds in the yet unformed occident   may come refined with accents that are ours  during the period when spenser was getting his artistic training a great change was going on in our mothertongue and the language of literature was disengaging itself more and more from that of ordinary talk the poets of italy spain and france began to rain influence and to modify and refine not only style but vocabulary men were discovering new worlds in more senses than one and the visionary finger of expectation still pointed forward there was as we learn from contemporary pamphlets very much the same demand for a national literature that we have heard in america this demand was nobly answered in the next generation but no man contributed so much to the transformation of style and language as spenser for not only did he deliberately endeavor at reform but by the charm of his diction the novel harmonies of his verse his ideal method of treatment and the splendor of his fancy he made the new manner popular and fruitful we can trace in spensers poems the gradual growth of his taste through experiment and failure to that assured selfconfidence which indicates that he had at length found out the true bent of his geniusthat happiest of discoveries and not so easy as it might seem which puts a man in undisturbed possession of his own individuality before his time the boundary between poetry and prose had not been clearly defined his great merit lies not only in the ideal treatment with which he glorified common things and gilded them with a ray of enthusiasm but far more in the ideal point of view which he first revealed to his countrymen he at first sought for that remoteness which is implied in an escape from the realism of daily life in the pastorala kind of writing which oddly enough from its original intention as a protest in favor of naturalness and of human as opposed to heroic sentiments had degenerated into the most artificial of abstractions but he was soon convinced of his error and was not long in choosing between an unreality which pretended to be real and those everlasting realities of the mind which seem unreal only because they lie beyond the horizon of the everyday world and become visible only when the mirage of fantasy lifts them up and hangs them in an ideal atmosphere as in the old fairytales the task which the age imposes on its poet is to weave its straw into a golden tissue and when every device has failed in comes the witch imagination and with a touch the miracle is achieved simple as miracles always are after they are wrought  spenser like chaucer a londoner was born in 1553268 nothing is known of his parents except that the name of his mother was elizabeth but he was of gentle birth as he more than once informs us with the natural satisfaction of a poor man of genius at a time when the business talent of the middle class was opening to it the door of prosperous preferment in 1569 he was entered as a sizar at pembroke hall cambridge and in due course took his bachelors degree in 1573 and his masters in 1576 he is supposed on insufficient grounds as it appears to me to have met with some disgust or disappointment during his residence at the university269 between 1576 and 1578 spenser seems to have been with some of his kinsfolk in the north it was during this interval that he conceived his fruitless passion for the rosalinde whose jilting him for another shepherd whom he calls menalcas is somewhat perfunctorily bemoaned in his pastorals270 before the publication of his shepherds calendar in 1579 he had made the acquaintance of sir philip sidney and was domiciled with him for a time at penshurst whether as guest or literary dependant is uncertain in october 1579 he is in the household of the earl of leicester in july 1580 he accompanied lord grey de wilton to ireland as secretary and in that country he spent the rest of his life with occasional flying visits to england to publish poems or in search of preferment his residence in that country has been compared to that of ovid in pontus and no doubt there were certain outward points of likeness the irishry by whom he was surrounded were to the full as savage as hostile and as tenacious of their ancestral habitudes as the scythians271 who made tomi a prison and the descendants of the earlier english settlers had degenerated as much as the mixhellenes who disgusted the latin poet spenser himself looked on his life in ireland as a banishment in his colm clouts come home again he tells us that sir walter raleigh who visited him in 1589 and heard what was then finished of the faery queen          gan to cast great liking to my lore   and great disliking to my luckless lot   that banisht had myself like wight forlore   into that waste where i was quite forgot   the which to leave thenceforth he counselled me   unmeet for man in whom was aught regardful   and wend with him his cynthia to see   whose grace was great and bounty most rewardful  but spenser was already living at kilcolman castle which with 3028 acres of land from the forfeited estates of the earl of desmond was confirmed to him by grant two years later amid scenery at once placid and noble whose varied charm he felt profoundly he could not complain with ovid    non liber hie ullus non qui mihi commodet aurem  for he was within reach of a cultivated society which gave him the stimulus of hearty admiration both as poet and scholar  above all he was fortunate in a seclusion that prompted study and deepened meditation while it enabled him to converse with his genius disengaged from those worldly influences which would have disenchanted it of its mystic enthusiasm if they did not muddle it ingloriously away surely this sequestered nest was more congenial to the brooding of those ethereal visions of the faery queen and to giving his soul a loose than    the smoke the wealth and noise of rome        and all the busy pageantry   that wise men scorn and fools adore  yet he longed for london if not with the homesickness of bussyrabutin in exile from the parisian sun yet enough to make him joyfully accompany raleigh thither in the early winter of 1589 carrying with him the first three books of the great poem begun ten years before horaces nonum prematur in annum had been more than complied with and the success was answerable to the wellseasoned material and conscientious faithfulness of the work but spenser did not stay long in london to enjoy his fame seen close at hand with its jealousies intrigues and selfish basenesses the court had lost the enchantment lent by the distance of kilcolman a nature so prone to ideal contemplation as spensers would be profoundly shocked by seeing too closely the ignoble springs of contemporaneous policy and learning by what paltry personal motives the noble opportunities of the world are at any given moment endangered it is a sad discovery that history is so mainly made by ignoble men                vide questo globo   tal chei sorrise del suo vil sembiante  in his colin clout written just after his return to ireland he speaks of the court in a tone of contemptuous bitterness in which as it seems to me there is more of the sorrow of disillusion than of the gall of personal disappointment he speaks so he tells us      to warn young shepherds wandering wit   which through report of that lifes painted bliss   abandon quiet home to seek for it   and leave their lambs to loss misled amiss   for sooth to say it is no sort of life   for shepherd fit to live in that same place   where each one seeks with malice and with strife   to thrust down other into foul disgrace   himself to raise and he doth soonest rise   that best can handle his deceitful wit   in subtle shifts   to which him needs a guileful hollow heart   masked with fair dissembling courtesy   a filëd tongue furnisht with terms of art   no art of school but courtiers schoolery   for arts of school have there small countenance   counted but toys to busy idle brains   and there professors find small maintenance   but to be instruments of others gains   nor is there place for any gentle wit   unless to please it can itself apply                                            even such is all their vaunted vanity   naught else but smoke that passeth soon away                                            so they themselves for praise of fools do sell   and all their wealth for painting on a wall                                            whiles single truth and simple honesty   do wander up and down despised of all272  and again in his mother hubberds tale in the most pithy and masculine verses he ever wrote   most miserable man whom wicked fate   hath brought to court to sue for hadiwist   that few have found and many one hath mist   full httle knowest thou that hast not tried   what hell it is in suing long to bide   to lose good days that might be better spent   to waste long nights in pensive discontent   to speed to day to be put back tomorrow   to feed on hope to pine with fear and sorrow   to have thy princes grace yet want her peers   to have thy asking yet wait many years   to fret thy soul with crosses and with cares   to eat thy heart through comfortless despairs   to fawn to crouch to wait to ride to run   to spend to give to want to be undone                                            whoever leaves sweet home where mean estate   in safe assurance without strife or hate   finds all things needful for contentment meek   and will to court for shadows vain to seek                                            that curse god send unto mine enemy273  when spenser had once got safely back to the secure retreat and serene companionship of his great poem with what profound and pathetic exultation must he have recalled the verses of dante   chi dietro a jura e chi ad aforismi   sen giva e chi seguendo sacerdozio   e chi regnar per forza e per sofismi   e chi rubare e chi civil negozio   chi nei diletti della carne involto   s affaticava e chi si dava all ozio   quando da tutte queste cose sciolto   con beatrice m era suso in cielo   cotanto gloriosamente accolto274  what spenser says of the indifference of the court to learning and literature is the more remarkable because he himself was by no means an unsuccessful suitor queen elizabeth bestowed on him a pension of fifty pounds and shortly after he received the grant of lands already mentioned it is said indeed that lord burleigh in some way hindered the advancement of the poet who more than once directly alludes to him either in reproach or remonstrance in the ruins of time after speaking of the death of walsingham   since whose decease learning lies unregarded   and men of armes do wander unrewarded  he gives the following reason for their neglect    for he that now wields all things at his will   scorns th one and th other in his deeper skill   o grief of griefs o gall of all good hearts   to see that virtue should despisëd be   of him that first was raised for virtuous parts   and now broad spreading like an aged tree   lets none shoot up that nigh him planted be   o let the man of whom the muse is scorned   nor live nor dead be of the muse adorned  and in the introduction to the fourth book of the faery queen he says

love and do not live amiss  if lord burleigh could not relish such a dish of nightingales tongues as the faery queen he is very much more to be pitied than spenser the sensitive purity of the poet might indeed well be wounded when a poem in which he proposed to himself to discourse at large of the ethick part of moral philosophy275 could be so misinterpreted but spenser speaks in the same strain and without any other than a general application in his tears of the muses and his friend sidney undertakes the defence of poesy because it was undervalued but undervalued by whom by the only persons about whom he knew or cared anything those whom we should now call society and who were then called the court the inference i would draw is that among the causes which contributed to the marvellous efflorescence of genius in the last quarter of the sixteenth century the influence of direct patronage from above is to be reckoned at almost nothing276 then as when the same phenomenon has happened elsewhere there must have been a sympathetic public literature properly so called draws its sap from the deep soil of human natures common and everlasting sympathies the gathered leafmould of countless generations greek oiae per phullon geneae and not from any topdressing capriciously scattered over the surface at some masters bidding277 england had long been growing more truly insular in language and political ideas when the reformation came to precipitate her national consciousness by secluding her more completely from the rest of europe hitherto there had been englishmen of a distinct type enough honestly hating foreigners and reigned over by kings of whom they were proud or not as the case might be but there was no england as a separate entity from the sovereign who embodied it for the time being278 but now an english people began to be dimly aware of itself their having got a religion to themselves must have intensified them much as the having a god of their own did the jews the exhilaration of relief after the long tension of anxiety when the spanish armada was overwhelmed like the hosts of pharaoh while it confirmed their assurance of a provincial deity must also have been like sunshine to bring into flower all that there was of imaginative or sentimental in the english nature already just in the first flush of its spring       the yongë sonne   had in the bull half of his course yronne  and just at this moment of blossoming every breeze was dusty with the golden pollen of greece rome and italy if keats could say when he first opened chapmans homer    then felt i like some watcher of the skies   when a new planet swims into his ken   or like stout cortez when with eagle eyes   he stared at the pacific and all his men   looked at each other with a wild surmise  if keats could say this whose mind had been unconsciously fed with the results of this cultureresults that permeated all thought all literature and all talkfancy what must have been the awakening shock and impulse communicated to mens brains by the revelation of this new world of thought and fancy an unveiling gradual yet sudden like that of a great organ which discovered to them what a wondrous instrument was in the soul of man with its epic and lyric stops its deep thunders of tragedy and its passionate vox humana it might almost seem as if shakespeare had typified all this in miranda when she cries out at first sight of the king and his courtiers                         o wonder   how many goodly creatures are there here   how beauteous mankind is o brave new world   that hath such people int  the civil wars of the roses had been a barren period in english literature because they had been merely dynastic squabbles in which no great principles were involved which could shake all minds with controversy and heat them to intense conviction a conflict of opposing ambitions wears out the moral no less than the material forces of a people but the ferment of hostile ideas and convictions may realize resources of character which before were only potential may transform a merely gregarious multitude into a nation proud in its strength sensible of the dignity and duty which strength involves and groping after a common ideal some such transformation had been wrought or was going on in england for the first time a distinct image of her was disengaging itself from the tangled blur of tradition and association in the minds of her children and it was now only that her great poet could speak exultingly to an audience that would understand him with a passionate sympathy of    this happy breed of men this little world   this precious stone set in a silver sea   this blessed plot this earth this realm this england   this land of such dear souls this dear dear land   england bound in with the triumphant sea  such a period can hardly recur again but something like it something pointing back to similar producing causes is observable in the revival of english imaginative literature at the close of the last and in the early years of the present century again after long fermentation there was a war of principles again the national consciousness was heightened and stung by a danger to the national existence and again there was a crop of great poets and heroic men  spenser once more visited england bringing with him three more books of the faery queen in 1595 he is supposed to have remained there during the two following years279  in 1594 he had been married to the lady celebrated in his somewhat artificial amoretti by her he had four children he was now at the height of his felicity by universal acclaim the first poet of his age and the one obstacle to his material advancement if obstacle it was had been put out of the way by the death of lord burleigh august 1598 in the next month he was recommended in a letter from queen elizabeth for the shrievalty of the county of cork but alas for polycrates in october the wild kerns and gallowglasses rose in no mood for sparing the house of pindarus they sacked and burned his castle from which he with his wife and children barely escaped280 he sought shelter in london and died there on the 16th january 1599 at a tavern in king street westminster he was buried in the neighboring abbey next to chaucer at the cost of the earl of essex poets bearing his pall and casting verses into his grave he died poor but not in want on the whole his life may be reckoned a happy one as in the main the lives of the great poets must have commonly been if they feel more passionately the pang of the moment so also the compensations are incalculable and not the least of them this very capacity of passionate emotion the real good fortune is to be measured not by more or less of outward prosperity but by the opportunity given for the development and free play of the genius it should be remembered that the power of expression which exaggerates their griefs is also no inconsiderable consolation for them we should measure what spenser says of his worldly disappointments by the bitterness of the unavailing tears be shed for rosalind a careful analysis of these leaves no perceptible residuum of salt and we are tempted to believe that the passion itself was not much more real than the pastoral accessories of pipe and crook i very much doubt whether spenser ever felt more than one profound passion in his life and that luckily was for his faery queen he was fortunate in the friendship of the best men and women of his time in the seclusion which made him free of the still better society of the past in the loving recognition of his countrymen all that we know of him is amiable and of good report he was faithful to the friendships of his youth pure in his loves unspotted in his life above all the ideal with him was not a thing apart and unattainable but the sweetener and ennobler of the street and the fireside  there are two ways of measuring a poet either by an absolute aesthetic standard or relatively to his position in the literary history of his country and the conditions of his generation both should be borne in mind as coefficients in a perfectly fair judgment if his positive merit is to be settled irrevocably by the former yet an intelligent criticism will find its advantage not only in considering what he was but what under the given circumstances it was possible for him to be  the fact that the great poem of spenser was inspired by the orlando of ariosto and written in avowed emulation of it and that the poet almost always needs to have his fancy set agoing by the hint of some predecessor must not lead us to overlook his manifest claim to originality it is not what a poet takes but what he makes out of what he has taken that shows what native force is in him above all did his mind dwell complacently in those forms and fashions which in their very birth are already obsolescent or was it instinctively drawn to those qualities which are permanent in language and whatever is wrought in it there is much in spenser that is contemporary and evanescent but the substance of him is durable and his work was the deliberate result of intelligent purpose and ample culture the publication of his shepherds calendar in 1579 though the poem itself be of little interest is one of the epochs in our literature spenser had at least the originality to see clearly and to feel keenly that it was essential to bring poetry back again to some kind of understanding with nature his immediate predecessors seem to have conceived of it as a kind of bird of paradise born to float somewhere between heaven and earth with no very well defined relation to either it is true that the nearest approach they were able to make to this airy ideal was a shuttlecock winged with a bright plume or so from italy but after all nothing but cork and feathers which they bandied back and forth from one stanza to another with the useful ambition of keeping it up as long as they could to my mind the old comedy of gammer gurtons needle is worth the whole of them it may be coarse earthy but in reading it one feels that he is at least a man among men and not a humbug among humbugs  the form of spensers shepherds calendar it is true is artificial absurdly so if you look at it merely from the outsidenot perhaps the wisest way to look at anything unless it be a jail or a volume of the congressional globebut the spirit of it is fresh and original we have at last got over the superstition that shepherds and shepherdesses are any wiser or simpler than other people we know that wisdom can be on only by wide commerce with men and books and that simplicity whether of manners or style is the crowning result of the highest culture but the pastorals of spenser were very different things different both in the moving spirit and the resultant form from the later ones of browne or the piscatory eclogues of phinehas fletcher and why browne and fletcher wrote because spenser had written but spenser wrote from a strong inward impulsean instinct it might be calledto escape at all risks into the fresh air from that horrible atmosphere into which rhymer after rhymer had been pumping carbonicacid gas with the full force of his lungs and in which all sincerity was on the edge of suffocation his longing for something truer and better was as honest as that which led tacitus so long before to idealize the germans and rousseau so long after to make an angel of the savage  spenser himself supremely overlooks the whole chasm between himself and chaucer as dante between himself and virgil he called chaucer master as milton was afterwards to call him and even while he chose the most artificial of all forms his aimthat of getting back to nature and lifewas conscious i have no doubt to himself and must be obvious to whoever reads with anything but the ends of his fingers it is true that sannazzaro had brought the pastoral into fashion again and that two of spensers are little more than translations from marot but for manner he instinctively turned back to chaucer the first and then only great english poet he has given common instead of classic names to his personages for characters they can hardly be called above all he has gone to the provincial dialects for words wherewith to enlarge and freshen his poetical vocabulary281  i look upon the shepherds calendar as being no less a conscious and deliberate attempt at reform than thomsons seasons were in the topics and wordsworths lyrical ballads in the language of poetry but the great merit of these pastorals was not so much in their matter as their manner they show a sense of style in its larger meaning hitherto displayed by no english poet since chaucer surrey had brought back from italy a certain inkling of it so far as it is contained in decorum but here was a new language a choice and arrangement of words a variety elasticity and harmony of verse most grateful to the ears of men if not passion there was fervor which was perhaps as near it as the somewhat stately movement of spensers mind would allow him to come sidney had tried many experiments in versification which are curious and interesting especially his attempts to naturalize the sliding rhymes of sannazzaro in english but there is everywhere the uncertainty of a prentice hand spenser shows himself already a master at least in verse and we can trace the studies of milton a yet greater master in the shepherds calendar as well as in the faery queen we have seen that spenser under the misleading influence of sidney282 and harvey tried his hand at english hexameters but his great glory is that he taught his own language to sing and move to measures harmonious and noble chaucer had done much to vocalize it as i have tried to show elsewhere283 but spenser was to prove    that no tongue hath the muses utterance heired   for verse and that sweet music to the ear   struck out of rhyme so naturally as this  the shepherds calendar contains perhaps the most picturesquely imaginative verse which spenser has written it is in the eclogue for february where he tells us of the                               faded oak   whose body is sere whose branches broke   whose naked arms stretch unto the fire  it is one of those verses that joseph warton would have liked in secret that dr johnson would have proved to be untranslatable into reasonable prose and which the imagination welcomes at once without caring whether it be exactly conformable to barbara or celarent another pretty verse in the same eclogue    but gently took that ungently came  pleased coleridge so greatly that he thought it was his own but in general it is not so much the sentiments and images that are new as the modulation of the verses in which they float the cold obstruction of two centuries thaws and the stream of speech once more let loose seeks out its old windings or overflows musically in unpractised channels the service which spenser did to our literature by this exquisite sense of harmony is incalculable his fine ear abhorrent of barbarous dissonance his dainty tongue that loves to prolong the relish of a musical phrase made possible the transition from the castiron stiffness of ferrex and porrex to the damascus pliancy of fletcher and shakespeare it was he that         taught the dumb on high to sing   and heavy ignorance aloft to fly   that added feathers to the learneds wing   and gave to grace a double majesty  i do not mean that in the shepherds calendar he had already achieved that transmutation of language and metre by which he was afterwards to endow english verse with the most varied and majestic of stanzas in which the droning old alexandrine awakened for the first time to a feeling of the poetry that was in him was to wonder like m jourdain that he had been talking prose all his lifebut already he gave clear indications of the tendency and premonitions of the power which were to carry it forward to ultimate perfection a harmony and alacrity of language like this were unexampled in english verse    ye dainty nymphs that in this blessed brook        do bathe your breast   forsake your watery bowers and hither look        at my request   and eke you virgins that on parnass dwell   whence floweth helicon the learned well        help me to blaze        her worthy praise   which in her sex doth all excel  here we have the natural gait of the measure somewhat formal and slow as befits an invocation and now mark how the same feet shall be made to quicken their pace at the bidding of the tune    bring here the pink and purple columbine       with gilliflowers   bring coronations and sops in wine       worne of paramours   strow me the ground with daffadowndillies   and cowslips and kingcúps and loved lilies       the pretty paunce       and the chevisance   shall match with the fair flowërdelice284  the argument prefixed by ek to the tenth eclogue has a special interest for us as showing how high a conception spenser had of poetry and the poets office by cuddy he evidently means himself though choosing out of modesty another name instead of the familiar colin in cuddy is set forth the perfect pattern of a poet which finding no maintenance of his state and studies complaineth of the contempt of poetry and the causes thereof specially having been in all ages and even amongst the most barbarous always of singular account and honor and being indeed so worthy and commendable an art or rather no art but a divine gift and heavenly instinct not to be gotten by labor and learning but adorned with both and poured into the wit by a certain enthousiasmos and celestial inspiration as the author hereof elsewhere at large discourseth in his book called the english poet which book being lately come into my hands i mind also by gods grace upon further advisement to publish e k whoever he was never carried out his intention and the book is no doubt lost a loss to be borne with less equanimity than that of ciceros treatise de gloria once possessed by petrarch the passage i have italicized is most likely an extract and reminds one of the longbreathed periods of milton drummond of hawthornden tells us he ben jonson hath by heart some verses of spensers calendar about wine between coline and percye cuddie and piers285 these verses are in this eclogue and are worth quoting both as having the approval of dear old ben the best critic of the day and because they are a good sample of spensers earlier verse    thou kenst not percie how the rhyme should rage   o if my temples were distained with wine   and girt in garlands of wild ivytwine   how i could rear the muse on stately stage         and teach her tread aloft in buskin fine         with quaint bellona in her equipage  in this eclogue he gives hints of that spacious style which was to distinguish him and which like his own fame       with golden wings aloft doth fly   above the reach of ruinous decay   and with brave plumes doth beat the azure sky   admired of baseborn men from far away286  he was letting his wings grow as milton said and foreboding the faery queen   lift thyself up out of the lowly dust                                        to doubted knights whose woundless armor rusts   and helms unbruised waxen daily brown   there may thy muse display her fluttering wing   and stretch herself at large from east to west  verses like these especially the last which dryden would have liked were such as english ears had not yet heard and curiously prophetic of the maturer man the language and verse of spenser at his best have an ideal lift in them and there is scarce any of our poets who can so hardly help being poetical  it was this instantly felt if not easily definable charm that forthwith won for spenser his neverdisputed rank as the chief english poet of that age and gave him a popularity which during his life and in the following generation was in its select quality without a competitor it may be thought that i lay too much stress on this single attribute of diction but apart from its importance in his case as showing their way to the poets who were just then learning the accidence of their art and leaving them a material to work in already mellowed to their hands it should be remembered that it is subtle perfection of phrase and that happy coalescence of music and meaning where each reinforces the other that define a man as poet and make all ears converts and partisans spenser was an epicure in language he loved seldseen costly words perhaps too well and did not always distinguish between mere strangeness and that novelty which is so agreeable as to cheat us with some charm of seeming association he had not the concentrated power which can sometimes pack infinite riches in the little room of a single epithet for his genius is rather for dilatation than compression287 but he was with the exception of milton and possibly gray the most learned of our poets his familiarity with ancient and modern literature was easy and intimate and as he perfected himself in his art he caught the grand manner and high bred ways of the society he frequented but even to the last he did not quite shake off the blunt rusticity of phrase that was habitual with the generation that preceded him in the fifth book of the faery queen where he is describing the passion of britomart at the supposed infidelity of arthegall he descends to a tenierslike realism288he whose verses generally remind us of the dancing hours of guido where we catch but a glimpse of the real earth and that far away beneath but his habitual style is that of gracious loftiness and refined luxury  he shows his mature hand in the muiopotmos the most airily fanciful of his poems a marvel for delicate conception and treatment whose breezy verse seems to float between a blue sky and golden earth in imperishable sunshine no other english poet has found the variety and compass which enlivened the octave stanza under his sensitive touch it can hardly be doubted that in clarion the butterfly he has symbolized himself and surely never was the poetic temperament so picturesquely exemplified    over the fields in his frank lustiness   and all the champain oer he soared light   and all the country wide he did possess   feeding upon their pleasures bounteously   that none gainsaid and none did him envy    the woods the rivers and the meadows green   with his aircutting wings he measured wide   nor did he leave the mountains bare unseen   nor the rank grassy fens delights untried   but none of these however sweet they been   mote please his fancy or him cause to abide   his choiceful sense with every change doth flit   no common things may please a wavering wit    to the gay gardens his unstaid desire   him wholly carried to refresh his sprights   there lavish nature in her best attire   pours forth sweet odors and alluring sights   and art with her contending doth aspire   to excel the natural with made delights   and all that fair or pleasant may be found   in riotous excess doth there abound    there he arriving round about doth flie   from bed to bed from one to the other border   and takes survey with curious busy eye   of every flower and herb there set in order   now this now that he tasteth tenderly   yet none of them he rudely doth disorder   ne with his feet their silken leaves displace   but pastures on the pleasures of each place    and evermore with most variety   and change of sweetness for all change is sweet   he casts his glutton sense to satisfy   now sucking of the sap of herbs most meet   or of the dew which yet on them doth lie   now in the same bathing his tender feet   and then he percheth on some branch thereby   to weather him and his moist wings to dry    and then again he turneth to his play   to spoil plunder the pleasures of that paradise   the wholesome sage the lavender still gray   ranksmelling rue and cummin good for eyes   the roses reigning in the pride of may   sharp hyssop good for green wounds remedies   fair marigolds and beesalluring thyme   sweet marjoram and daisies decking prime    cool violets and orpine growing still   embathed balm and cheerful galingale   fresh costmary and breathful camomill   dull poppy and drinkquickening setuale   veinhealing vervain and headpurging dill   sound savory and basil heartyhale   fat coleworts and comforting perseline   cold lettuce and refreshing rosemarine289    and whatso else of virtue good or ill   grew in this garden fetched from far away   of every one he takes and tastes at will   and on their pleasures greedily doth prey   then when he hath both played and fed his fill   in the warm sun he doth himself embay   and there him rests in riotous suffisance   of all his gladfulness and kingly joyance    what more felicity can fall to creature   than to enjoy delight with liberty   and to be lord of all the works of nature   to reign in the air from earth to highest sky   to feed on flowers and weeds of glorious feature   to take whatever thing doth please the eye   who rests not pleased with such happiness   well worthy he to taste of wretchedness  the muiopotmos pleases us all the more that it vibrates in us a string of classical association by adding an episode to ovids story of arachne talking the other day with a friend the late mr keats about dante he observed that whenever so great a poet told us anything in addition or continuation of an ancient story he had a right to be regarded as classical authority for instance said he when he tells us of that characteristic death of ulysses  we ought to receive the information as authentic and be glad that we have more news of ulysses than we looked for290  we can hardly doubt that ovid would have been glad to admit this exquisitely fantastic illumination into his margin  no german analyzer of aesthetics has given us so convincing a definition of the artistic nature as these radiant verses to reign in the air was certainly spensers function and yet the commentators who seem never willing to let their poet be a poet pure and simple though had he not been so they would have lost their only hold upon life try to make out from his mother hubberds tale that he might have been a very sensible matter offact man if he would for my own part i am quite willing to confess that i like him none the worse for being unpractical and that my reading has convinced me that being too poetical is the rarest fault of poets practical men are not so scarce one would think and i am not sure that the tree was a gainer when the hamadryad flitted and left it nothing but shiptimber such men as spenser are not sent into the world to be part of its motive power the blind old engine would not know the difference though we got up its steam with attar of roses nor make one revolution more to the minute for it what practical man ever left such an heirloom to his countrymen as the faery queen  undoubtedly spenser wished to be useful and in the highest vocation of all that of teacher and milton calls him our sage and serious poet whom i dare be known to think a better teacher than scotus or aquinas and good dr henry more was of the same mind i fear he makes his vices so beautiful now and then that we should not be very much afraid of them if we chanced to meet them for he could not escape from his genius which if it led him as philosopher to the abstract contemplation of the beautiful left him as poet open to every impression of sensuous delight when he wrote the shepherds calendar he was certainly a puritan and probably so by conviction rather than from any social influences or thought of personal interests there is a verse it is true in the second of the two detached cantos of mutability    like that ungracious crew which feigns demurest grace  which is supposed to glance at the straiter religionists and from which it has been inferred that he drew away from them as he grew older it is very likely that years and widened experience of men may have produced in him their natural result of tolerant wisdom which revolts at the hasty destructiveness of inconsiderate zeal but with the more generous side of puritanism i think he sympathized to the last his rebukes of clerical worldliness are in the puritan tone and as severe a one as any is in mother hubberds tale published in 1591291 there is an iconoclastic relish in his account of sir guyons demolishing the bower of bliss that makes us think he would not have regretted the plundered abbeys as perhaps shakespeare did when he speaks of the winter woods as bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang    but all those pleasant bowers and palace brave   guyon broke down with rigor pitiless   ne ought their goodly workmanship might save   them from the tempest of his wrathfulness   but that their bliss he turned to balefulness   their groves he felled their gardens did deface   their arbors spoil their cabinets suppress   their banquethouses burn their buildings rase   and of the fairest late now made the foulest place  but whatever may have been spensers religious opinions which do not nearly concern us here the bent of his mind was toward a platonic mysticism a supramundane sphere where it could shape universal forms out of the primal elements of things instead of being forced to put up with their fortuitous combinations in the unwilling material of mortal clay he who when his singing robes were on could never be tempted nearer to the real world than under some subterfuge of pastoral or allegory expatiates joyously in this untrammelled ether    lifting himself out of the lowly dust   on golden plumes up to the purest sky  nowhere does his genius soar and sing with such continuous aspiration nowhere is his phrase so decorously stately though rising to an enthusiasm which reaches intensity while it stops short of vehemence as in his hymns to love and beauty especially the latter there is an exulting spurn of earth in it as of a soul just loosed from its cage i shall make no extracts from it for it is one of those intimately coherent and transcendentally logical poems that moveth altogether if it move at all the breaking off a fragment from which would maim it as it would a perfect group of crystals whatever there is of sentiment and passion is for the most part purely disembodied and without sex like that of angelsa kind of poetry which has of late gone out of fashion whether to our gain or not may be questioned perhaps one may venture to hint that the animal instincts are those that stand in least need of stimulation spensers notions of love were so nobly pure so far from those of our common ancestor who could hang by his tail as not to disqualify him for achieving the quest of the holy grail and accordingly it is not uninstructive to remember that he had drunk among others at french sources not yet deboshed with absinthe292 yet with a purity like that of thricebolted snow he had none of its coldness he is of all our poets the most truly sensuous using the word as milton probably meant it when he said that poetry should be simple sensuous and passionate  a poet is innocently sensuous when his mind permeates and illumines his senses when they on the other hand muddy the mind he becomes sensual every one of spensers senses was as exquisitely alive to the impressions of material as every organ of his soul was to those of spiritual beauty accordingly if he painted the weeds of sensuality at all he could not help making them of glorious feature it was this it may be suspected rather than his praising love that made lord burleigh shake his rugged forehead spensers gamut indeed is a wide one ranging from a purely corporeal delight in precious odors fetched from far away upward to such refinement as    upon her eyelids many graces sate   under the shadow of her even brows  where the eye shares its pleasure with the mind he is courtpainter in ordinary to each of the senses in turn and idealizes these frail favorites of his majesty king lusty juventus till they half believe themselves the innocent shepherdesses into which he travesties them293  in his great poem he had two objects in view first the ephemeral one of pleasing the court and then that of recommending himself to the permanent approval of his own and following ages as a poet and especially as a moral poet to meet the first demand he lays the scene of his poem in contemporary england and brings in all the leading personages of the day under the thin disguise of his knights and their squires and ladyloves he says this expressly in the prologue to the second book    of faery land yet if he more inquire   by certain signs here set in sundry place   he may it find    and thou o fairest princess under sky   in this fair mirror mayst behold thy face   and thine own realms in land of faery  many of his personages we can still identify and all of them were once as easily recognizable as those of mademoiselle de scudéry this no doubt added greatly to the immediate piquancy of the allusions the interest they would excite may be inferred from the fact that king james in 1596 wished to have the author prosecuted and punished for his indecent handling of his mother mary queen of scots under the name of duessa294 to suit the wider application of his plans other and more important half spenser made all his characters double their parts and appear in his allegory as the impersonations of abstract moral qualities when the cardinal and theological virtues tell dante    noi siam qui ninfe e in ciel siamo stelle  the sweetness of the verse enables the fancy by a slight gulp to swallow without solution the problem of being in two places at the same time but there is something fairly ludicrous in such a duality as that of prince arthur and the earl of leicester arthegall and lord grey and belphoebe and elizabeth    in this same interlude it doth befall   that i one snout by name present a wall  the reality seems to heighten the improbability already hard enough to manage but spenser had fortunately almost as little sense of humor as wordsworth295 or he could never have carried his poem on with enthusiastic good faith so far as he did it is evident that to him the land of faery was an unreal world of picture and illusion    the worlds sweet inn from pain and wearisome turmoil  in which he could shut himself up from the actual with its shortcomings and failures        the ways through which my weary steps i guide         in this delightful land of faery       are so exceeding spacious and wide         and sprinkled with such sweet variety         of all that pleasant is to ear and eye       that i nigh ravisht with rare thoughts delight         my tedious travail do forget thereby       and when i gin to feel decay of might   it strength to me supplies and cheers my dullëd spright  spenser seems here to confess a little weariness but the alacrity of his mind is so great that even where his invention fails a little we do not share his feeling nor suspect it charmed as we are by the variety and sweep of his measure the beauty or vigor of his similes the musical felicity of his diction and the mellow versatility of his pictures in this last quality ariosto whose emulous pupil he was is as bologna to venice in the comparison that when the personal allusions have lost their meaning and the allegory has become a burden the book should continue to be read with delight is proof enough were any wanting how full of life and light and the otherworldliness of poetry it must be as a narrative it has i think every fault of which that kind of writing is capable the characters are vague and even were they not they drop out of the story so often and remain out of it so long that we have forgotten who they are when we meet them again the episodes hinder the advance of the action instead of relieving it with variety of incident or novelty of situation the plot if plot it may be called                    that shape has none   distinguishable in member joint or limb  recalls drearily our ancient enemy the metrical romance while the fighting which in those old poems was tediously sincere is between shadow and shadow where we know that neither can harm the other though are tempted to wish he might hazlitt bids us not mind the allegory and says that it wont bite us nor meddle with us if we do not meddle with it but how if it bore us which after all is the fatal question the truth is that it is too often forced upon us against our will as people were formerly driven to church till they began to look on a day of rest as a penal institution and to transfer to the scriptures that suspicion of defective inspiration which was awakened in them by the preaching the true type of the allegory is the odyssey which we read without suspicion as pure poem and then find a new pleasure in divining its double meaning as if we somehow got a better bargain of our author than he meant to give us but this complex feeling must not be so exacting as to prevent our lapsing into the old arabian nights simplicity of interest again the moral of a poem should be suggested as when in some mediaeval church we cast down our eyes to muse over a fresco of giotto and are reminded of the transitoriness of life by the mortuary tablets under our feet the vast superiority of bunyan over spenser lies in the fact that we help make his allegory out of our own experience instead of striving to embody abstract passions and temptations he has given us his own in all their pathetic simplicity he is the ulysses of his own proseepic this is the secret of his power and his charm that while the representation of what may happen to all men comes home to none of us in particular the story of any one mans real experience finds its startling parallel in that of every one of us the very homeliness of bunyans names and the everydayness of his scenery too put us off our guard and we soon find ourselves on as easy a footing with his allegorical beings as we might be with adam or socrates in a dream indeed he has prepared us for such incongruities by telling us at setting out that the story was of a dream the long nights of bedford jail had so intensified his imagination and made the figures with which it peopled his solitude so real to him that the creatures of his mind become things as clear to the memory as if we had seen them but spensers are too often mere names with no bodies to back them entered on the muses musterroll by the specious trick of personification there is likewise in bunyan a childlike simplicity and takingforgranted which win our confidence his giant despair296 for example is by no means the ossianic figure into which artists who mistake the vague for the sublime have misconceived it he is the ogre of the fairytales with his malicious wife and he comes forth to us from those regions of early faith and wonder as something beforehand accepted by the imagination these figures of bunyans are already familiar inmates of the mind and if there be any sublimity in him it is the daring frankness of his verisimilitude spensers giants are those of the later romances except that grand figure with the balances in the second canto of book v the most original of all his conceptions yet no real giant but a pure eidolon of the mind as bunyan rises not seldom to a natural poetry so spenser sinks now and then through the fault of his topics to unmistakable prose take his description of the house of alma297 for instance    the master cook was cald concoctiön     a careful man and full of comely guise   the kitchenclerk that hight digestion     did order all the achates in seemly wise  and so on through all the organs of the body the author of ecclesiastes understood these matters better in that last pathetic chapter of his blunderingly translated as it apparently is this i admit is the worst failure of spenser in this kind though even here when he gets on to the organs of the mind the enchantments of his fancy and style come to the rescue and put us in goodhumor again hard as it is to conceive of armed knights entering the chamber of the mind and talking with such visionary damsels as ambition and shamefastness nay even in the most prosy parts unless my partiality deceive me there is an infantile confidence in the magical powers of prosopopoeia which half beguiles us as of children who play that everything is something else and are quite satisfied with the transformation  the problem for spenser was a double one how to commend poetry at all to a generation which thought it effeminate trifling298 and how he master edmund spenser of imagination all compact could commend his poetry to master john bull the most practical of mankind in his habitual mood but at that moment in a passion of religious anxiety about his soul omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci was not only an irrefragable axiom because a latin poet had said it but it exactly met the case in point he would convince the scorners that poetry might be seriously useful and show master bull his new way of making fine words butter parsnips in a rhymed moral primer allegory as then practised was imagination adapted for beginners in words of one syllable and illustrated with cuts and would thus serve both his ethical and pictorial purpose such a primer or a first instalment of it he proceeded to put forth but he so bordered it with brightcolored fancies he so often filled whole pages and crowded the text hard in others with the gay frolics of his pencil that as in the grimani missal the holy function of the book is forgotten in the ecstasy of its adornment worse than all does not his brush linger more lovingly along the rosy contours of his sirens than on the modest wimples of the wise virgins the general end of the book he tells us in his dedication to sir walter raleigh is to fashion a gentleman of noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline but a little further on he evidently has a qualm as he thinks how generously he had interpreted his promise of cuts to some i know this method will seem displeasant which had rather have good discipline delivered plainly in way of precepts or sermoned at large299 as they use than thus cloudily enwrapped in allegorical devices lord burleigh was of this way of thinking undoubtedly but how could poor clarion help it has he not said    and whatso else of virtue good or ill     grew in that garden fetcht from far away   of every one he takes and tastes at will     and on their pleasures greedily doth prey  one sometimes feels in reading him as if he were the pure sense of the beautiful incarnated to the one end that he might interpret it to our duller perceptions so exquisite was his sensibility300 that with him sensation and intellection seem identical and we can almost say his body thought this subtle interfusion of sense with spirit it is that gives his poetry a crystalline purity without lack of warmth he is full of feeling and yet of such a kind that we can neither say it is mere intellectual perception of what is fair and good nor yet associate it with that throbbing fervor which leads us to call sensibility by the physical name of heart  charles lamb made the most pithy criticism of spenser when he called him the poets poet we may fairly leave the allegory on one side for perhaps after all he adopted it only for the reason that it was in fashion and put it on as he did his ruff not because it was becoming but because it was the only wear the true use of him is as a gallery of pictures which we visit as the mood takes us and where we spend an hour or two at a time long enough to sweeten our perceptions not so long as to cloy them he makes one think always of venice for not only is his style venetian301 but as the gallery there is housed in the shell of an abandoned convent so his in that of a deserted allegory and again as at venice you swim in a gondola from gian bellini to titian and from titian to tintoret so in him where other cheer is wanting the gentle sway of his measure like the rhythmical impulse of the oar floats you lullingly along from picture to picture    if all the pens that ever poet held   had fed the feeling of their masters thoughts   and every sweetness that inspired their hearts   their minds and muses on admired themes   if all the heavenly quintessence they still   from their immortal flowers of poesy   if these had made one poems period   and all combined in beautys worthiness   yet should there hover in their restless heads   one thought one grace one wonder at the best   which into words no virtue can digest302  spenser at his best has come as near to expressing this unattainable something as any other poet he is so purely poet that with him the meaning does not so often modulate the music of the verse as the music makes great part of the meaning and leads the thought along its pleasant paths no poet is so splendidly superfluous as he none knows so well that in poetry enough is not only not so good as a feast but is a beggarly parsimony he spends himself in a careless abundance only to be justified by incomes of immortal youth    pensier canuto nè molto nè poco   si può quivi albergare in alcun cuore   non entra quivi disagio nè inopia   ma vi sta ognor col corno pien la copia303  this delicious abundance and overrunning luxury of spenser appear in the very structure of his verse he found the ottava rima too monotonously iterative so by changing the order of his rhymes he shifted the let from the end of the stave where it always seems to put on the brakes with a jar to the middle where it may serve at will as a brace or a bridge he found it not roomy enough so first ran it over into another line and then ran that added line over into an alexandrine in which the melody of one stanza seems forever longing and feeling forward after that which is to follow there is no ebb and flow in his metre more than on the shores of the adriatic but wave follows wave with equable gainings and recessions the one sliding back in fluent music to be mingled with and carried forward by the next in all this there is soothingness indeed but no slumberous monotony for spenser was no mere metrist but a great composer by the variety of his pausesnow at the close of the first or second foot now of the third and again of the fourthhe gives spirit and energy to a measure whose tendency it certainly is to become languorous he knew how to make it rapid and passionate at need as in such verses as       but he my lion and my noble lord       how does he find in cruel heart to hate       her that him loved and ever most adored   as the god of my life why hath he me abhorred304  or this    come hither come hither o come hastily305  joseph warton objects to spensers stanza that its constraint led him into many absurdities of these he instances three of which i shall notice only one since the two others which suppose him at a loss for words and rhymes will hardly seem valid to any one who knows the poet it is that it obliged him to dilate the thing to be expressed however unimportant with trifling and tedious circumlocutions namely faery queen ii ii 44   now hath fair phoebe with her silver face     thrice seen the shadows of this nether world   sith last i left that honorable place     in which her royal presence is enrolled  that is it is three months since i left her palace306 but dr warton should have remembered what he too often forgets in his own verses that in spite of dr johnsons dictum poetry is not prose and that verse only loses its advantage over the latter by invading its province307 verse itself is an absurdity except as an expression of some higher movement of the mind or as an expedient to lift other minds to the same ideal level it is the cothurnus which gives language an heroic stature i have said that one leading characteristic of spensers style was its spaciousness that he habitually dilates rather than compresses but his way of measuring time was perfectly natural in an age when everybody did not carry a dial in his poke as now he is the last of the poets who went without affectation by the great clock of the firmament dante the miser of words who goes by the same timepiece is full of these roundabout ways of telling us the hour it had nothing to do with spensers stanza and i for one should be sorry to lose these stately revolutions of the superne ruote time itself becomes more noble when so measured we never knew before of how precious a commodity we had the wasting who would prefer the plain time of day to this    now when aldebaran was mounted high   above the starry cassiopeias chair  or this    by this the northern wagoner had set     his sevenfold team behind the steadfast star   that was in oceans waves yet never wet     but firm is fixt and sendeth light from far   to all that in the wide deep wandering are  or this    at last the golden oriental gate   of greatest heaven gan to open fair   and phoebus fresh as bridegroom to his mate   came dancing forth shaking his dewy hair   and hurls his glistening beams through dewy air  the generous indefiniteness which treats an hour more or less as of no account is in keeping with that sense of endless leisures which it is one chief merit of the poem to suggest but spensers dilatation extends to thoughts as well as to phrases and images he does not love the concise yet his dilatation is not mere distension but the expansion of natural growth in the rich soil of his own mind wherein the merest stick of a verse puts forth leaves and blossoms here is one of his suggested by homer308    upon the top of all his lofty crest     a bunch of hairs discolored diversly     with sprinkled pearl and gold full richly drest     did shake and seemed to dance for jollity     like to an almondtree mounted high     on top of green selinus all alone     with blossoms brave bedeckëd daintily     whose tender locks do tremble every one   at every little breath that under heaven is blown  and this is the way he reproduces five pregnant verses of dante                         seggendo in piume   in fama non si vien nè sotto coltre   senza la qual chi sua vita consuma   cotal vestigio in terra di se lascia   qual fumo in aere ed in acqua la schiuma309    whoso in pomp of proud estate quoth she     does swim and bathes himself in courtly bliss     does waste his days in dark obscurity     and in oblivion ever buried is     where ease abounds its eath to do amiss     but who his limbs with labors and his mind     behaves with cares cannot so easy miss     abroad in arms at home in studious kind   who seeks with painful toil shall honor soonest find    in woods in waves in wars she wonts to dwell     and will be found with peril and with pain     ne can the man that moulds in idle cell     unto her happy mansiön attain     before her gate high god did sweat ordain     and wakeful watches ever to abide     but easy is the way and passage plain     to pleasures palace it may soon be spied   and day and night her doors to all stand open wide310  spensers mind always demands this large elbowroom his thoughts are never pithily expressed but with a stately and sonorous proclamation as if under the open sky that seems to me very noble for example    the noble heart that harbors virtuous thought   and is with child of gloriousgreat intent   can never rest until it forth have brought   the eternal brood of glory excellent311  ones very soul seems to dilate with that last verse and here is a passage which milton had read and remembered    and is there care in heaven and is there love     in heavenly spirits to these creatures base     that may compassion of their evils move     there is else much more wretched were the case     of men than beasts but o the exceeding grace     of highest god that loves his creatures so     and all his works with mercy doth embrace     that blessed angels he sends to and fro   to serve to wicked man to serve his wicked foe    how oft do they their silver bowers leave     to come to succor us that succor want     how oft do they with golden pinions cleave     the fleeting skies like flying pursuivant     against foul fiends to aid us militant     they for us fight they watch and duly ward     and their bright squadrons round about us plant     and all for love and nothing for reward   o why should heavenly god to men have such regard312  his natural tendency is to shun whatever is sharp and abrupt he loves to prolong emotion and lingers in his honeyed sensations like a bee in the translucent cup of a lily so entirely are beauty and delight in it the native element of spenser that whenever in the faery queen you come suddenly on the moral it gives you a shock of unpleasant surprise a kind of grit as when ones teeth close on a bit of gravel in a dish of strawberries and cream he is the most fluent of our poets sensation passing through emotion into revery is a prime quality of his manner and to read him puts one in the condition of revery a state of mind in which our thoughts and feelings float motionless as one sees fish do in a gentle stream with just enough vibration of their fins to keep themselves from going down with the current while their bodies yield indolently to all its soothing curves he chooses his language for its rich canorousness rather than for intensity of meaning to characterize his style in a single word i should call it costly none but the daintiest and nicest phrases will serve him and he allures us from one to the other with such cunning baits of alliteration and such sweet lapses of verse that never any word seems more eminent than the rest nor detains the feeling to eddy around it but you must go on to the end before you have time to stop and muse over the wealth that has been lavished on you but he has characterized and exemplified his own style better than any description could do    for round about the walls yclothed were     with goodly arras of great majesty     woven with gold and silk so close and near     that the rich metal lurked privily     as faining to be hid from envious eye     yet here and there and everywhere unwares     it showed itself and shone unwillingly     like to a discolored snake whose hidden snares   through the green grass his long brightburnished back declares313  and of the lulling quality of his verse take this as a sample    and more to lull him in his slumber soft     a trickling stream from high rock tumbling down     and ever drizzling rain upon the loft     mixt with the murmuring wind much like the soun     of swarming bees did cast him in a swoon     no other noise nor peoples troublous cries     as still are wont to annoy the walled town     might there be heard but careless quiet lies   wrapt in eternal silence far from enemies314  in the world into which spenser carries us there is neither time nor space or rather it is outside of and independent of them both and so is purely ideal or more truly imaginary yet it is full of form color and all earthly luxury and so far if not real yet apprehensible by the senses there are no men and women in it yet it throngs with airy and immortal shapes that have the likeness of men and women and hint at some kind of foregone reality now this place somewhere between mind and matter between soul and sense between the actual and the possible is precisely the region which spenser assigns if i have rightly divined him to the poetic susceptibility of impression    to reign in the air from the earth to highest sky  underneath every one of the senses lies the soul and spirit of it dormant till they are magnetized by some powerful emotion then whatever is imperishable in us recognizes for an instant and claims kindred with something outside and distinct from it yet in some inconceivable way a part of it that flashes back on it an ideal beauty which impoverishes all other companionship this exaltation with which love sometimes subtilizes the nerves of coarsest men so that they feel and see not the thing as it seems to others but the beauty of it the joy of it the soul of eternal youth that is in it would appear to have been the normal condition of spenser while the senses of most men live in the cellar his were laid in a large upper chamber which opened toward the sunrising    his birth was of the womb of morning dew   and his conception of the joyous prime  the very greatest poets and is there after all more than one of them have a way i admit of getting within our inmost consciousness and in a manner betraying us to ourselves there is in spenser a remoteness very different from this but it is also a seclusion and quite as agreeable perhaps quite as wholesome in certain moods when we are glad to get away from ourselves and those importunate trifles which we gravely call the realities of life in the warm mediterranean of his mind everything             suffers a sea change   into something rich and strange  he lifts everything not beyond recognition but to an ideal distance where no mortal i had almost said human fleck is visible instead of the ordinary bridal gifts he hallows his wife with an epithalamion fit for a conscious goddess and the savage soil315 of ireland becomes a turf of arcady under her feet where the merchants daughters of the town are no more at home than the angels and the fair shapes of pagan mythology whom they meet there he seems to have had a commonsense side to him and could look at things if we may judge by his tract on irish affairs in a practical and even hard way but the moment he turned toward poetry he fulfilled the condition which his teacher plato imposes on poets and had not a particle of prosaic understanding left his fancy habitually moving about in worlds not realized unrealizes everything at a touch the critics blame him because in his prothalamion the subjects of it enter on the thames as swans and leave it at temple gardens as noble damsels but to those who are grown familiar with his imaginary world such a transformation seems as natural as in the old legend of the knight of the swan    come now ye damsels daughters of delight         help quickly her to dight     but first come ye fair hours which were begot     in joves sweet paradise of day and night      and ye three handmaids of the cyprian queen     the which do still adorn her beautys pride     help to adorn my beautifulest bride                                            crown ye god bacchus with a coronal     and hymen also crown with wreaths of vine     and let the graces dance unto the rest       for they can do it best     the whiles the maidens do their carols sing   to which the woods shall answer and their echo ring  the whole epithalamion is very noble with an organlike roll and majesty of numbers while it is instinct with the same joyousness which must have been the familiar mood of spenser it is no superficial and tiresome merriment but a profound delight in the beauty of the universe and in that delicately surfaced nature of his which was its mirror and counterpart sadness was alien to him and at funerals he was to be sure a decorous mourner as could not fail with so sympathetic a temperament but his condolences are graduated to the unimpassioned scale of social requirement even for sir philip sidney his sighs are regulated by the official standard it was in an unreal world that his affections found their true object and vent and it is in an elegy of a lady whom he had never known that he puts into the mouth of a husband whom he has evaporated into a shepherd the two most naturally pathetic verses he ever penned    i hate the day because it lendeth light   to see all things but not my love to see316  in the epithalamion there is an epithet which has been much admired for its felicitous tenderness    behold whiles she before the altar stands   hearing the holy priest that to her speakes   and blesseth her with his two happy hands  but the purely impersonal passion of the artist had already guided him to this lucky phrase it is addressed by holinessa dame surely as far abstracted from the enthusiasms of love as we can readily conceive ofto una who like the visionary helen of dr faustus has every charm of womanhood except that of being alive as juliet and beatrice are                              o happy earth   whereon thy innocent feet do ever tread317  can we conceive of una the fall of whose foot would be as soft as that of a roseleaf upon its mates already fallencan we conceive of her treading anything so sordid no it is only on some unsubstantial floor of dream that she walks securely herself a dream and it is only when spenser has escaped thither only when this glamour of fancy has rarefied his wife till she is grown almost as purely a creature of the imagination as the other ideal images with which he converses that his feeling becomes as nearly passionateas nearly human i was on the point of sayingas with him is possible i am so far from blaming this idealizing property of his mind that i find it admirable in him it is his quality not his defect without some touch of it life would be unendurable prose if i have called the world to which he transports us a world of unreality i have wronged him it is only a world of unrealism it is from pots and pans and stocks and futile gossip and inchlong politics that he emancipates us and makes us free of that tomorrow always coming and never come where ideas shall reign supreme318 but i am keeping my readers from the sweetest idealization that love ever wrought    unto this place whenas the elfin knight     approached him seemëd that the merry sound     of a shrill pipe he playing heard on height     and many feet fast thumping the hollow ground     that through the woods their echo did rebound     he nigher drew to wit what it mote be     there he a troop of ladies dancing found     full merrily and making gladful glee   and in the midst a shepherd piping he did see    he durst not enter into the open green     for dread of them unwares to be descried     for breaking of their dance if he were seen     but in the covert of the wood did bide     beholding all yet of them unespied     there he did see that pleased so much his sight     that even he himself his eyes envied     a hundred naked maidens lilywhite   all ranged in a ring and dancing in delight    all they without were ranged in a ring     and danced round but in the midst of them     three other ladies did both dance and sing     the while the rest them round about did hem     and like a garland did in compass stem     and in the midst of these same three was placed     another damsel as a precious gem     amidst a ring most richly well enchased   that with her goodly presence all the rest much graced    look how the crown which ariadne wove     upon her ivory forehead that same day     that theseus her unto his bridal bore     when the bold centaurs made that bloody fray     with the fierce lapithes that did them dismay     being now placëd in the firmament     through the bright heaven doth her beams display     and is unto the stars an ornament   which round about her move in order excellent    such was the beauty of this goodly band     whose sundry parts were here too long to tell     but she that in the midst of them did stand     seemed all the rest in beauty to excel     crowned with a rosy garland that right well     did her beseem and ever as the crew     about her danced sweet flowers that far did smell     and fragrant odors they upon her threw   but most of all those three did her with gifts endue    those were the graces daughters of delight     handmaids of venus which are wont to haunt     upon this hill and dance there day and night     those three to men all gifts of grace do grant     and all that venus in herself doth vaunt     is borrowed of them but that fair one     that in the midst was placed paravant     was she to whom that shepherd piped alone   that made him pipe so merrily as never none    she was to weet that jolly shepherds lass     which pipëd there unto that merry rout     that jolly shepherd that there pipëd was     poor colin clout who knows not colin clout     he piped apace while they him danced about     pipe jolly shepherd pipe thou now apace     unto thy love that made thee low to lout     thy love is present there with thee in place   thy love is there advanced to be another grace319  is there any passage in any poet that so ripples and sparkles with simple delight as this it is a sky of italian april full of sunshine and the hidden ecstasy of larks and we like it all the more that it reminds us of that passage in his friend sidneys arcadia where the shepherdboy pipes as if he would never be old if we compare it with the mystical scene in dante320 of which it is a reminiscence it will seem almost like a bit of real life but taken by itself it floats as unconcerned in our cares and sorrows and vulgarities as a sunset cloud the sound of that pastoral pipe seems to come from as far away as thessaly when apollo was keeping sheep there sorrow the great idealizer had had the portrait of beatrice on her easel for years and every touch of her pencil transfigured the woman more and more into the glorified saint but elizabeth nagle was a solid thing of flesh and blood who would sit down at meat with the poet on the very day when he had thus beatified her as dante was drawn upward from heaven to heaven by the eyes of beatrice so was spenser lifted away from the actual by those of that ideal beauty whereof his mind had conceived the lineaments in its solitary musings over plato but of whose haunting presence the delicacy of his senses had already premonished him the intrusion of the real world upon this supersensual mood of his wrought an instant disenchantment    much wondered calidore at this strange sight     whose like before his eye had never seen     and standing long astonished in sprite     and rapt with pleasance wist not what to ween     whether it were the train of beautys queen     or nymphs or fairies or enchanted show     with which his eyes might have deluded been     therefore resolving what it was to know   out of the woods he rose and toward them did go    but soon as he appearëd to their view   they vanished all away out of his sight   and clean were gone which way he never knew   all save the shepherd who for fell despite   of that displeasure broke his bagpipe quite  ben jonson said that he had consumed a whole night looking to his great toe about which he had seen tartars and turks romans and carthaginians fight in his imagination and coleridge has told us how his eyes made pictures when they were shut this is not uncommon but i fancy that spenser was more habitually possessed by his imagination than is usual even with poets his visions must have accompanied him in glory and in joy along the common thoroughfares of life and seemed to him it may be suspected more real than the men and women he met there his most fine spirit of sense would have tended to keep him in this exalted mood i must give an example of the sensuousness of which i have spoken     and in the midst of all a fountain stood     of richest substance that on earth might be     so pure and shiny that the crystal flood     through every channel running one might see     most goodly it with curious imagery     was overwrought and shapes of naked boys     of which some seemed with lively jollity     to fly about playing their wanton toys   whilst others did themselves embay in liquid joys    and over all of purest gold was spread     a trail of ivy in his native hue     for the rich metal was so colorëd     that he who did not well avised it view     would surely deem it to be ivy true     low his lascivious arms adown did creep     that themselves dipping in the silver dew     their fleecy flowers they tenderly did steep   which drops of crystal seemed for wantonness to weep    infinite streams continually did well     out of this fountain sweet and fair to see     the which into an ample laver fell     and shortly grew to so great quantity     that like a little lake it seemed to be     whose depth exceeded not three cubits height     that through the waves one might the bottom see     all paved beneath with jasper shining bright   that seemed the fountain in that sea did sail upright    and all the margent round about was set     with shady laureltrees thence to defend     the sunny beams which on the billows bet     and those which therein bathed mote offend     as guyou happened by the same to wend     two naked damsels he therein espied     which therein bathing seemed to contend     and wrestle wantonly ne cared to hide   their dainty parts from view of any which them eyed    sometimes the one would lift the other quite     above the waters and then down again     her plunge as overmasterëd by might     where both awhile would coverëd remain     and each the other from to rise restrain     the whiles their snowy limbs as through a veil     so through the crystal waves appeared plain     then suddenly both would themselves unhele   and the amorous sweet spoils to greedy eyes reveal    as that fair star the messenger of morn     his dewy face out of

whom such when guyon saw he drew him near     and somewhat gan relent his earnest pace   his stubborn breast gan secret pleasance to embrace    the wanton maidens him espying stood     gazing awhile at his unwonted guise     then the one herself low duckéd in the flood     abashed that her a stranger did avise     but the other rather higher did arise     and her two lily paps aloft displayed     and all that might his melting heart entice     to her delights she unto him bewrayed   the rest hid underneath him more desirous made    with that the other likewise up arose     and her fair locks which formerly were bound     up in one knot she low adown did loose     which flowing long and thick her clothed around     and the ivory in golden mantle gowned     so that fair spectacle from him was reft     yet that which reft it no less fair was found     so hid in locks and waves from lookers theft   naught but her lovely face she for his looking left    withal she laughëd and she blushed

harvey had said why a gods name may not we as else the greeks have the kingdom of our own language this is in the tone of bellay as is also a great deal of what is said in the epistle prefixed to the shepherds calendar he would have been wiser had he followed more closely bellays advice about the introduction of novel words fear not then to innovate somewhat particularly in a long poem with modesty however with analogy and judgment of ear and trouble not thyself as to who may think it good or bad hoping that posterity will approve itshe who gives faith to doubtful light to obscure novelty to antique usage to unaccustomed and sweetness to harsh and rude things spensers innovations were by no means always happy as not always according with the genius of the language and they have therefore not prevailed he forms english words out of french or italian ones sometimes i think on a misapprehension of their true meaning nay he sometimes makes new ones by unlawfully grafting a scion of romance on a teutonic root his theory caught from bellay of rescuing good archaisms from unwarranted oblivion was excellent not so his practice of being archaic for the mere sake of escaping from the common and familiar a permissible archaism is a word or phrase that has been supplanted by something less apt but has not become unintelligible and spensers often needed a glossary even in his own day321 but he never endangers his finest passages by any experiments of this kind there his language is living if ever any and of one substance with the splendor of his fancy like all masters of speech he is fond of toying with and teasing it a little and it may readily be granted that he sometimes hunted the letter as it was called out of all cry but even where his alliteration is tempted to an excess its prolonged echoes caress the ear like the fading and gathering reverberations of an alpine horn and one can find in his heart to forgive even such a debauch of initial assonances as      eftsoones her shallow ship away did slide   more swift than swallow shears the liquid sky  generally he scatters them at adroit intervals reminding us of the arrangement of voices in an ancient catch where one voice takes up the phrase another has dropped and thus seems to give the web of harmony a firmer and more continuous texture  other poets have held their mirrors up to nature mirrors that differ very widely in the truth and beauty of the images they reflect but spensers is a magic glass in which we see few shadows cast back from actual life but visionary shapes conjured up by the wizards art from some confusedly remembered past or some impossible future it is like one of those still pools of mediaeval legend which covers some sunken city of the antique world a reservoir in which all our dreams seem to have been gathered as we float upon it we see that it pictures faithfully enough the summerclouds that drift over it the trees that grow about its margin but in the midst of these shadowy echoes of actuality we catch faint tones of bells that seem blown to us from beyond the horizon of time and looking down into the clear depths catch glimpses of towers and farshining knights and peerless dames that waver and are gone is it a world that ever was or shall be or can be or but a delusion spensers world real to him is real enough for us to take a holiday in and we may well be content with it when the earth we dwell on is so often too real to allow of such vacations it is the same kind of world that petrarcas laura has walked in for five centuries with all ears listening for the music of her footfall  the land of spenser is the land of dream but it is also the land of rest to read him is like dreaming awake without even the trouble of doing it yourself but letting it be done for you by the finest dreamer that ever lived who knows how to color his dreams like life and make them move before you in music they seem singing to you as the sirens to guyon and we linger like him    o thou fair son of gentle faery     that art in mighty arms most magnified     above all knights that ever battle tried     o turn thy rudder hitherward awhile     here may thy stormbeat vessel safely ride     this is the port of rest from troublous toil   the worlds sweet inn from pain and wearisome turmoil322    with that the rolling sea resounding swift     in his big bass them fitly answered     and on the rock the waves breaking aloft     a solemn mean unto them measured     the whiles sweet zephyrus loud whisteled     his treble a strange kind of harmony     which guyons senses softly tickeled     that he the boatman bade row easily   and let him hear some part of their rare melody  despite spensers instinctive tendency to idealize and his habit of distilling out of the actual an ethereal essence in which very little of the possible seems left yet his mind as is generally true of great poets was founded on a solid basis of goodsense i do not know where to look for a more cogent and at the same time picturesque confutation of socialism than in the second canto of the fifth book if i apprehend rightly his words and images there is not only subtile but profound thinking here the french revolution is prefigured in the wellmeaning but too theoretic giant and rousseaus fallacies exposed two centuries in advance spenser was a conscious englishman to his inmost fibre and did not lack the sound judgment in politics which belongs to his race he was the more english for living in ireland and there is something that moves us deeply in the exiles passionate cry      dear country o how dearly dear   ought thy remembrance and perpetual band   be to thy fosterchild that from thy hand   did common breath and nouriture receive   how brutish is it not to understand   how much to her we owe that all us gave   that gave unto us all whatever good we have  his race shows itself also where he tells us that          chiefly skill to ride seems a science   proper to gentle blood  which reminds one of lord herbert of cherburys saying that the finest sight god looked down on was a fine man on a fine horse  wordsworth in the supplement to his preface tells us that the faery queen faded before sylvesters translation of du bartas but wordsworth held a brief for himself in this case and is no exception to the proverb about men who are their own attorneys his statement is wholly unfounded both poems no doubt so far as popularity is concerned yielded to the graver interests of the civil war but there is an appreciation much weightier than any that is implied in mere popularity and the vitality of a poem is to be measured by the kind as well as the amount of influence it exerts spenser has coached more poets and more eminent ones than any other writer of english verse i need say nothing of milton nor of professed disciples like browne the two fletchers and more oowley tells us that he became irrecoverably a poet by reading the faery queen when a boy dryden whose case is particularly in point because he confesses having been seduced by du bartas tells us that spenser had been his master in english he regrets indeed comically enough that spenser could not have read the rules of bossu but adds that no man was ever born with a greater genius or more knowledge to support it pope says there is something in spenser that pleases one as strongly in ones old age as it did in ones youth i read the faery queen when i was about twelve with a vast deal of delight and i think it gave me as much when i read it over about a year or two ago thomson wrote the most delightful of his poems in the measure of spenser collins gray and akenside show traces of him and in our own day his influence reappears in wordsworth byron shelley and keats landor is i believe the only poet who ever found him tedious spensers mere manner has not had so many imitators as miltons but no other of our poets has given an impulse and in the right direction also to so many and so diverse minds above all no other has given to so many young souls a consciousness of their wings and a delight in the use of them he is a standing protest against the tyranny of commonplace and sows the seeds of a noble discontent with prosaic views of life and the dull uses to which it may be put  three of spensers own verses best characterize the feeling his poetry gives us          among wide waves set like a little nest         wrapt in eternal silence far from enemies   the worlds sweet inn from pain and wearisome turmoil  we are wont to apologize for the grossness of our favorite authors sometimes by saying that their age was to blame and not they and the excuse is a good one for often it is the frank word that shocks us while we tolerate the thing spenser needs no such extenuations no man can read the faery queen and be anything but the better for it through that rude age when maids of honor drank beer for breakfast and hamlet could say a gross thing to ophelia he passes serenely abstracted and high the don quixote of poets whoever can endure unmixed delight whoever can tolerate music and painting and poetry all in one whoever wishes to be rid of thought and to let the busy anvils of the brain be silent for a time let him read in the faery queen there is the land of pure hearts ease where no ache or sorrow of spirit can enter     footnotes      263 though always misapplied in quotation as if he had used the     word in that generalized meaning which is common now but which could     not without an impossible anachronism have been present to his mind     he meant merely freedom from prison       264 in his defence of poesy he condemns the archaisms and     provincialisms of the shepherds calendar       265 there is as you must have heard wordsworth point out a     language of pure intelligible english which was spoken in chaucers     time and is spoken in ours equally understood then and now and of     which the bible is the written and permanent standard as it has     undoubtedly been the great means of preserving it southeys life     and correspondence iii 193 194       266 nash who has far better claims than swift to be called the     english rabelais thus at once describes and parodies harveys     hexameters in prose that drunken staggering kind of verse which     is all up hill and down hill like the way betwixt stamford and     beechneld and goes like a horse plunging through the mire in the     deep of winter now soused up to the saddle and straight aloft on     his tiptoes it was a happy thought to satirize in this inverted     way prose written in the form of verse       267 edmund bolton in his hypercritica says the works of sam     daniel contained somewhat a flat but yet withal a very pure and     copious english and words as warrantable as any mans and fitter     perhaps for prose than measure i have italicized his second     thought which chimes curiously with the feeling daniel leaves in the     mind see haslewoods ancient crit essays vol ii wordsworth an     excellent judge much admired daniels poem to the countess of     cumberland       268 mr hales in the excellent memoir of the poet prefixed to the     globe edition of his works puts his birth a year earlier on the     strength of a line in the sixtieth sonnet but it is not established     that this sonnet was written in 1593 and even if it were a sonnet     is not upon oath and the poet would prefer the round number forty     which suited the measure of his verse to thirtynine or fortyone     which might have been truer to the measure of his days       269 this has been inferred from a passage in one of gabriel     harveys letters to him but it would seem more natural from the     many allusions in harveys pamphlets against nash that it was his     own wrongs which he had in mind and his selfabsorption would take     it for granted that spenser sympathized with him in all his grudges     harvey is a remarkable instance of the refining influence of     classical studies amid the pedantic farrago of his omnisufficiency     to borrow one of his own words we come suddenly upon passages whose     gravity of sentiment stateliness of movement and purity of diction     remind us of landor these lucid intervals in his overweening vanity     explain and justify the friendship of spenser yet the reiteration of     emphasis with which he insists on all the worlds knowing that nash     had called him an ass probably gave shakespeare the hint for one of     the most comic touches in the character of dogberry       270 the late major c g halpine in a very interesting essay     makes it extremely probable that rosalinde is the anagram of rose     daniel sister of the poet and married to john florio he leaves     little doubt also that the name of spensers wife hitherto     unknown was elizabeth nagle see atlantic monthly vol ii 674     november 1858 mr halpine informed me that he found the substance     of his essay among the papers of his father the late rev n j     halpine of dublin the latter published in the series of the     shakespeare society a sprightly little tract entitled oberon     which if not quite convincing is well worth reading for its     ingenuity and research       271 in his prose tract on ireland spenser perhaps with some     memory of ovid in his mind derives the irish mainly from the     scythians       272 compare shakespeares lxvi sonnet       273 this poem published in 1591 was spenser tells us in his     dedication long sithens composed in the raw conceit of my youth     but he had evidently retouched it the verses quoted show a firmer     hand than is generally seen in it and we are safe in assuming that     they were added after his visit to england dr johnson     epigrammatized spensers indictment into        there mark what ills the scholars life assail       toil envy want the patron and the jail      but i think it loses in pathos more than it gains in point       274 paradiso xi 412 spenser was familiar with the divina     commedia though i do not remember that his commentators have     pointed out his chief obligations to it       275 his own words as reported by lodowick bryskett todds     spenser i lx the whole passage is very interesting as giving us     the only glimpse we get of the living spenser in actual contact with     his fellowmen it shows him to us as we could wish to see him     surrounded with loving respect companionable and helpful bryskett     tells us that he was perfect in the greek tongue and also very     well read in philosophy both moral and natural he encouraged     bryskett in the study of greek and offered to help him in it     comparing the last verse of the above citation of the faery queen     with other passages in spenser i cannot help thinking that he wrote     do not love amiss       276       and know sweet prince when you shall come to know       that tis not in the power of kings to raise       a spirit for verse that is not born thereto       nor are they born in every princes days      daniels dedic trag of philotas       277 louis xiv is commonly supposed in some miraculous way to have     created french literature he may more truly be said to have     petrified it so far as his influence went the french renaissance     in the preceding century was produced by causes similar in essentials     to those which brought about that in england not long after the     grand siècle grew by natural processes of development out of that     which had preceded it and which to the impartial foreigner at     least has more flavor and more french flavor too than the     galloroman usurper that pushed it from its stool the best modern     french poetry has been forced to temper its verses in the colder     natural springs of the anteclassic period       278 in the elizabethan drama the words england and france we     constantly used to signify the kings of those countries       279 i say supposed for the names of his two sons sylvanus and     peregrine indicate that they were born in ireland and that spenser     continued to regard it as a wilderness and his abode there as exile     the two other children are added on the authority of a pedigree drawn     up by sir w betham and cited in mr haless life of spenser prefixed     to the globe edition       280 ben jonson told drummond that one child perished in the flames     but he was speaking after an interval of twentyone years and of     course from hearsay spensers misery was exaggerated by succeeding     poets who used him to point a moral and from the shelter of his     tomb launched many a shaft of sarcasm at an unappreciative public     giles fletcher in his purple island a poem which reminds us of the     faery queen by the supreme tediousness of its allegory but in     nothing else set the example in the best verse he ever wrote        poorly poor man he lived poorly poor man he died      gradually this poetical tradition established itself firmly as     authentic history spenser could never have been poor except by     comparison the whole story of his later days has a strong savor of     legend he must have had ample warning of tyrones rebellion and     would probably have sent away his wife and children to cork if he     did not go thither himself i am inclined to think that he did     carrying his papers with him and among them the two cantos of     mutability first published in 1611 these it is most likely were     the only ones he ever completed for with all his abundance he was     evidently a laborious finisher when we remember that ten years were     given to the elaboration of the first three books and that five more     elapsed before the next three were ready we shall waste no vain     regrets on the six concluding books supposed to have been lost by the     carelessness of an imaginary servant on their way from ireland       281 sir philip sidney did not approve of this that same framing     of his style to an old rustic language i dare not allow since     neither theocritus in greek virgil in latin nor sannazzaro in     italian did affect it defence of poesy ben jonson on the     other hand said that guarini kept not decorum in making shepherds     speak as well as himself could conversations with drummond i     think sidney was right for the poets arcadia is a purely ideal     world and should be treated accordingly but whoever looks into the     glossary appended to the calendar by ek will be satisfied that     spensers object was to find unhackneyed and poetical words rather     than such as should seem more on a level with the speakers see also     the epistle dedicatory i cannot help thinking that ek was     spenser himself with occasional interjections of harvey who else     could have written such english as many passages in this epistle       282 it was at penshurst that he wrote the only specimen that has     come down to us and bad enough it is i have said that some of     sidneys are pleasing       283 see my study windows 264 seqq       284 of course dillies and lilies must be read with a slight     accentuation of the last syllable permissible then in order to     chime with delice in the first line i have put here instead of     hether which like other words where th comes between two     vowels was then very often a monosyllable in order to throw the     accent back more strongly on bring where it belongs spensers     innovation lies in making his verses by ear instead of on the     fingertips and in valuing the stave more than any of the single     verses that compose it this is the secret of his easy superiority to     all others in the stanza which he composed and which bears his name     milton who got more of his schooling in these matters from spenser     than anywhere else gave this principle a greater range and applied     it with more various mastery i have little doubt that the tune of     the last stanza cited above was clinging in shakespeares ear when he     wrote those exquisite verses in midsummer nights dream i know a     bank where our grave pentameter is in like manner surprised into a     lyrical movement see also the pretty song in the eclogue for august     ben jonson too evidently caught some cadences from spenser for his     lyrics i need hardly say that in those eclogues may for example     where spenser thought he was imitating what wiseacres used to call     the ridingrhyme of chaucer he fails most lamentably he had     evidently learned to scan his masters verses better when he wrote     his mother hubberds tale       285 drummond it will be remarked speaking from memory takes     cuddy to be colin in miltons lycidas there are reminiscences of     this eclogue as well as of that for may the latter are the more     evident but i think that spensers        cuddie the praise is better than the price      suggested miltons                             but not the praise       phoebus replied and touched my trembling ears      shakespeare had read and remembered this pastoral compare        but ah mecaenas is yclad in clay       and great augustus long ago is dead       and all the worthies liggen wrapt in lead      with        king pandion he is dead       all thy friends are lapt in lead      it is odd that shakespeare in his lapt in lead is more spenserian     than spenser himself from whom he caught this hunting of the     letter       286 ruins of time it is perhaps not considering too nicely to     remark how often this image of wings recurred to spensers mind a     certain aerial latitude was essential to the large circlings of his     style       287 perhaps his most striking single epithet is the     seashouldering whales b ii 12 xxiii his ear seems to delight     in prolongations for example he makes such words as glorious     gratious joyeous havior chapelet dactyles and that not     at the end of verses where it would not have been unusual but in     the first half of them milton contrives a break a kind of heave as     it were in the uniformity of his verse by a practice exactly the     opposite of this he also shuns a hiatus which does not seem to     have been generally dipleasing to spensers ear though perhaps in     the compound epithet beesalluring he intentionally avoids it by     the plural form        288       like as a wayward child whose sounder sleep       is broken with some fearful dreams affright       with froward will doth set himself to weep       ne can be stilled for all his nurses might       but kicks and squalls and shrieks for fell despight       now scratching her and her loose locks misusing       now seeking darkness and now seeking light       then craving suck and then the suck refusing      he would doubtless have justified himself by the familiar example of     homers comparing ajax to a donkey in the eleventh book of the     illiad so also in the epithalamion it grates our nerves to hear        pour not by cups but by the bellyful       pour out to all that wull      such examples serve to show how strong a dose of spensers aurum     potabile the language needed       289 i could not bring myself to root out this odorous herbgarden     though it make my extract too long it is a pretty reminiscence of     his master chaucer but is also very characteristic of spenser     himself he could not help planting a flower or two among his     serviceable plants and after all this abundance he is not satisfied     but begins the next stanza with and whatso else       290 leigh hunts indicator xvii       291 ben jonson told drummond that in that paper sir w raleigh had     of the allegories of his faery queen by the blatant beast the     puritans were understood but this is certainly wrong there were     very different shades of puritanism according to individual     temperament that of winthrop and higginson had a mellowness of which     endicott and standish were incapable the gradual change of miltons     opinions was similar to that which i suppose in spenser the passage     in mother hubberd may have been aimed at the protestant clergy of     ireland for he says much the same thing in his view of the state of     ireland but it is general in its terms       292 two of his eclogues as i have said are from marot and his     earliest known verses are translations from bellay a poet who was     charming whenever he had the courage to play truant from a bad     school we must not suppose that an analysis of the literature of the     demimonde will give us all the elements of the french character     it has been both grave and profound nay it has even contrived to be     wise and lively at the same time a combination so incomprehensible     by the teutonic races that they have labelled it levity it puts them     out as nature did fuseli       293 taste must be partially excepted  it is remarkable how little     eating and drinking there is in the faery queen the only time he     fairly sets a table is in the house of malbecco where it is     necessary to the conduct of the story yet taste is not wholly     forgotten        in her left hand a cup of gold she held       and with her right the riper fruit did reach       whose sappy liquor that with fulness sweld       into her cup she scruzed with dainty breach       of her fine fingers without foul impeach       that so fair winepress made the wine more sweet       b ii c xii 56      taste can hardly complain of unhandsome treatment       294 had the poet lived longer he might perhaps have verified his     friend raleighs saying that whosoever in writing modern history     shall follow truth too near the heels it may haply strike out his     teeth the passage is one of the very few disgusting ones in the     faery queen spenser was copying ariosto but the italian poet     with the discreeter taste of his race keeps to generalities spenser     goes into particulars which can only be called nasty he did this no     doubt to pleasure his mistress marys rival and this gives us a     measure of the brutal coarseness of contemporary manner it becomes     only the more marvellous that the fine flower of his genius could     have transmuted the juices of such a soil into the purity and     sweetness which are its own peculiar properties       295 there is a gleam of humor in one of the couplets of mother     hubberds tale where the fox persuading the ape that they should     disguise themselves as discharged soldiers in order to beg the more     successfully says        be you the soldier for you likest

generation has now passed away since wordsworth was laid with the family in the churchyard at grasmere323 perhaps it is hardly yet time to take a perfectly impartial measure of his value as a poet to do this is especially hard for those who are old enough to remember the last shot which the foe was sullenly firing in that long war of critics which began when he published his manifesto as pretender and which came to a pause rather than end when they flung up their caps with the rest at his final coronation something of the intensity of the odium theologicum if indeed the aestheticum be not in these days the more bitter of the two entered into the conflict the wordsworthians were a sect who if they had the enthusiasm had also not a little of the exclusiveness and partiality to which sects are liable the verses of the master had for them the virtue of religious canticles stimulant of zeal and not amenable to the ordinary tests of coldblooded criticism like the hymns of the huguenots and covenanters they were songs of battle no less than of worship and the combined ardors of conviction and conflict lent them a fire that was not naturally their own as we read them now that virtue of the moment is gone out of them and whatever of dr wattsiness there is gives us a slight shock of disenchantment it is something like the difference between the marseillaise sung by armed propagandists on the edge of battle or by brissotins in the tumbrel and the words of it read coolly in the closet or recited with the factitious frenzy of thérèse it was natural in the early days of wordsworths career to dwell most fondly on those profounder qualities to appreciate which settled in some sort the measure of a mans right to judge of poetry at all but now we must admit the shortcomings the failures the defects as no less essential elements in forming a sound judgment as to whether the seer and artist were so united in him as to justify the claim first put in by himself and afterwards maintained by his sect to a place beside the few great poets who exalt mens minds and give a right direction and safe outlet to their passions through the imagination while insensibly helping them toward balance of character and serenity of judgment by stimulating their sense of proportion form and the nice adjustment of means to ends in none of our poets has the constant propulsion of an unbending will and the concentration of exclusive if i must not say somewhat narrow sympathies done so much to make the original endowment of nature effective and in none accordingly does the biography throw so much light on the works nor enter so largely into their composition as an element whether of power or of weakness wordsworth never saw and i think never wished to see beyond the limits of his own consciousness and experience he early conceived himself to be and through life was confirmed by circumstances in the faith that he was a dedicated spirit324 a state of mind likely to further an intense but at the same time onesided development of the intellectual powers the solitude in which the greater part of his mature life was passed while it doubtless ministered to the passionate intensity of his musings upon man and nature was it may be suspected harmful to him as an artist by depriving him of any standard of proportion outside himself by which to test the comparative value of his thoughts and by rendering him more and more incapable of that urbanity of mind which could be gained only by commerce with men more nearly on his own level and which gives tone without lessening individuality wordsworth never quite saw the distinction between the eccentric and the original for what we call originality seems not so much anything peculiar much less anything odd but that quality in a man which touches human nature at most points of its circumference which reinvigorates the consciousness of our own powers by recalling and confirming our own unvalued sensations and perceptions gives classic shape to our own amorphous imaginings and adequate utterance to our own stammering conceptions or emotions the poets office is to be a voice not of one crying in the wilderness to a knot of already magnetized acolytes but singing amid the throng of men and lifting their common aspirations and sympathies so first clearly revealed to themselves on the wings of his song to a purer ether and a wider reach of view we cannot if we would read the poetry of wordsworth as mere poetry at every other page we find ourselves entangled in a problem of aesthetics the worldold question of matter and form of whether nectar is of precisely the same flavor when served to us from a grecian chalice or from any jug of ruder pottery comes up for decision anew the teutonic nature has always shown a sturdy preference of the solid bone with a marrow of nutritious moral to any shadow of the same on the flowing mirror of sense wordsworth never lets us long forget the deeply rooted stock from which he sprangvien ben dà lui                                       william wordsworth was born at cockermouth in cumberland on the 7th of april 1770 the second of five children his father was john wordsworth an attorneyatlaw and agent of sir james lowther afterwards first earl of lonsdale his mother was anne cookson the daughter of a mercer in penrith his paternal ancestors had been settled immemorially at penistone in yorkshire whence his grandfather had emigrated to westmoreland his mother a woman of piety and wisdom died in march 1778 being then in her thirtysecond year his father who never entirely cast off the depression occasioned by her death survived her but five years dying in december 1783 when william was not quite fourteen years old  the poets early childhood was passed partly at cockermouth and partly with his maternal grandfather at penrith his first teacher appears to have been mrs anne birkett a kind of shenstones schoolmistress who practised the memory of her pupils teaching them chiefly by rote and not endeavoring to cultivate their reasoning faculties a process by which children are apt to be converted from natural logicians into impertinent sophists among his schoolmates here was mary hutchinson who afterwards became his wife  in 1778 he was sent to a school founded by edwin sandys archbishop of york in the year 1585 at hawkshead in lancashire hawkshead is a small markettown in the vale of esthwaite about a third of a mile northwest of the lake here wordsworth passed nine years among a people of simple habits and scenery of a sweet and pastoral dignity his earliest intimacies were with the mountains lakes and streams of his native district and the associations with which his mind was stored during its most impressible period were noble and pure the boys were boarded among the dames of the village thus enjoying a freedom from scholastic restraints which could be nothing but beneficial in a place where the temptations were only to sports that hardened the body while they fostered a love of nature in the spirit and habits of observation in the mind wordsworths ordinary amusements here were hunting and fishing rowing skating and long walks around the lake and among the hills with an occasional scamper on horseback325 his life as a schoolboy was favorable also to his poetic development in being identified with that of the people among whom he lived among men of simple habits and where there are small diversities of condition the feelings and passions are displayed with less restraint and the young poet grew acquainted with that primal human basis of character where the muse finds firm foothold and to which he ever afterward cleared his way through all the overlying drift of conventionalism the dalesmen were a primitive and hardy race who kept alive the traditions and often the habits of a more picturesque time a common level of interests and social standing fostered unconventional ways of thought and speech and friendly human sympathies solitude induced reflection a reliance of the mind on its own resources and individuality of character where everybody knew everybody and everybodys father had known everybodys father the interest of man in man was not likely to become a matter of cold hearsay and distant report when death knocked at any door in the hamlet there was an echo from every fireside and a wedding dropt its white flowers at every threshold there was not a grave in the churchyard but had its story not a crag or glen or aged tree untouched with some ideal hue of legend it was here that wordsworth learned that homely humanity which gives such depth and sincerity to his poems travel society culture nothing could obliterate the deep trace of that early training which enables him to speak directly to the primitive instincts of man he was apprenticed early to the difficult art of being himself  at school he wrote some taskverses on subjects imposed by the master and also some voluntaries of his own equally undistinguished by any peculiar merit but he seems to have made up his mind as early as in his fourteenth year to become a poet326 it is recorded says his biographer vaguely that the poets father set him very early to learn portions of the best english poets by heart so that at an early age he could repeat large portions of shakespeare milton and spenser327  the great event of wordsworths school days was the death of his father who left what may be called a hypothetical estate consisting chiefly of claims upon the first earl of lonsdale the payment of which though their justice was acknowledged that nobleman contrived in some unexplained way to elude so long as he lived in october 1787 he left school for st johns college cambridge he was already we are told a fair latin scholar and had made some progress in mathematics the earliest books we hear of his reading were don quixote gil blas gullivers travels and the tale of a tub but at school he had also become familiar with the works of some english poets particularly goldsmith and gray of whose poems he had learned many by heart what is more to the purpose he had become without knowing it a lover of nature in all her moods and the same mental necessities of a solitary life which compel men to an interest in the transitory phenomena of scenery had made him also studious of the movements of his own mind and the mutual interaction and dependence of the external and internal universe  doubtless his early orphanage was not without its effect in confirming a character naturally impatient of control and his mind left to itself clothed itself with an indigenous growth which grew fairly and freely unstinted by the shadow of exotic plantations it has become a truism that remarkable persons have remarkable mothers but perhaps this is chiefly true of such as have made themselves distinguished by their industry and by the assiduous cultivation of faculties in themselves of only an average quality it is rather to be noted how little is known of the parentage of men of the first magnitude how often they seem in some sort foundlings and how early an apparently adverse destiny begins the culture of those who are to encounter and master great intellectual or spiritual experiences  of his disposition as a child little is known but that little is characteristic he himself tells us that he was stiff moody and of violent temper his mother said of him that he was the only one of her children about whom she felt any anxietyfor she was sure that he would be remarkable for good or evil once in resentment at some fancied injury he resolved to kill himself but his heart failed him i suspect that few boys of passionate temperament have escaped these momentary suggestions of despairing helplessness on another occasion he says while i was at my grandfathers house at penrith along with my eldest brother richard we were whipping tops together in the long drawingroom on which the carpet was only laid down on particular occasions the walls were hung round with family pictures and i said to my brother dare you strike your whip through that old ladys petticoat he replied no i wont then said i here goes and i struck my lash through her hooped petticoat for which no doubt though i have forgotten it i was properly punished but possibly from some want of judgment in punishments inflicted i had become perverse and obstinate in defying chastisement and rather proud of it than otherwise this last anecdote is as happily typical as a bit of greek mythology which always prefigured the lives of heroes in the stories of their childhood just so do we find him afterward striking his defiant lash through the hooped petticoat of the artificial style of poetry and proudly unsubdued by the punishment of the reviewers  of his college life the chief record is to be found in the prelude he did not distinguish himself as a scholar and if his life had any incidents they were of that interior kind which rarely appear in biography though they may be of controlling influence upon the life he speaks of reading chaucer spenser and milton while at cambridge328 but no reflection from them is visible in his earliest published poems the greater part of his vacations was spent in his native lakecountry where his only sister dorothy was the companion of his rambles she was a woman of large natural endowments chiefly of the receptive kind and had much to do with the formation and tendency of the poets mind it was she who called forth the shyer sensibilities of his nature and taught an originally harsh and austere imagination to surround itself with fancy and feeling as the rock fringes itself with a sunspray of ferns she was his first public and belonged to that class of prophetically appreciative temperaments whose apparent office it is to cheer the early solitude of original minds with messages from the future through the greater part of his life she continued to be a kind of poetical conscience to him  wordsworths last college vacation was spent in a foot journey upon the continent 1790 in january 1791 he took his degree of ba and left cambridge during the summer of this year he visited wales and after declining to enter upon holy orders under the plea that he was not of age for ordination went over to france in november and remained during the winter at orleans here he became intimate with the republican general beaupuis with whose hopes and aspirations he ardently sympathized in the spring of 1792 he was at blois and returned thence to orleans which he finally quitted in october for paris he remained here as long as he could with safety and at the close of the year went back to england thus perhaps escaping the fate which soon after overtook his friends the brissotins  as hitherto the life of wordsworth may be called a fortunate one not less so in the training and expansion of his faculties was this period of his stay in france born and reared in a country where the homely and familiar nestles confidingly amid the most savage and sublime forms of nature he had experienced whatever impulses the creative faculty can receive from mountain and cloud and the voices of winds and waters but he had known man only as an actor in fireside histories and tragedies for which the hamlet supplied an ample stage in france he first felt the authentic beat of a nations heart he was a spectator at one of those dramas where the terrible footfall of the eumenides is heard nearer and nearer in the pauses of the action and he saw man such as he can only be when he is vibrated by the orgasm of a national emotion he sympathized with the hopes of france and of mankind deeply as was fitting in a young man and a poet and if his faith in the gregarious advancement of men was afterward shaken he only held the more firmly by his belief in the individual and his reverence for the human as something quite apart from the popular and above it wordsworth has been unwisely blamed as if he had been recreant to the liberal instincts of his youth but it was inevitable that a genius so regulated and metrical as his a mind which always compensated itself for its artistic radicalism by an involuntary leaning toward external respectability should recoil from whatever was convulsionary and destructive in politics and above all in religion he reads the poems of wordsworth without understanding who does not find in them the noblest incentives to faith in man and the grandeur of his destiny founded always upon that personal dignity and virtue the capacity for whose attainment alone makes universal liberty possible and assures its permanence he was to make men better by opening to them the sources of an inalterable wellbeing to make them free in a sense higher than political by showing them that these sources are within them and that no contrivance of man can permanently emancipate narrow natures and depraved minds his politics were always those of a poet circling in the larger orbit of causes and principles careless of the transitory oscillation of events  the change in his point of view if change there was certainly was complete soon after his return from france and was perhaps due in part to the influence of burke    while he burke forewarns denounces launches forth   against all systems built on abstract rights   keen ridicule the majesty proclaims   of institutes and laws hallowed by time   declares the vital power of social ties   endeared by custom and with high disdain   exploding upstart theory insists   upon the allegiance to which men are born    could a youth and one   in ancient story versed whose breast hath heaved   under the weight of classic eloquence   sit see and hear unthankful uninspired329  he had seen the french for a dozen years eagerly busy in tearing up whatever had roots in the past replacing the venerable trunks of tradition and orderly growth with libertypoles then striving vainly to piece together the fibres they had broken and to reproduce artificially that sense of permanence and continuity which is the main safeguard of vigorous selfconsciousness in a nation he became a tory through intellectual conviction retaining i suspect to the last a certain radicalism of temperament and instinct haydon tells us that in 1809 sir george beaumont said to him and wilkie wordsworth may perhaps walk in if he do i caution you both against his terrific democratic notions and it must have been many years later that wordsworth himself told crabb eobinson i have no respect whatever for whigs but i have a great deal of the chartist in me in 1802 during his tour in scotland he travelled on sundays as on the other days of the week330  he afterwards became a theoretical churchgoer wordsworth defended earnestly the church establishment he even said he would shed his blood for it nor was he disconcerted by a laugh raised against him on account of his having confessed that he knew not when he had been in a church in his own country all our ministers are so vile said he the mischief of allowing the clergy to depend on the caprice of the multitude he thought more than outweighed all the evils of an establishment331 in december 1792 wordsworth had returned to england and in the following year published descriptive sketches and the evening walk he did this as he says in one of his letters to show that although he had gained no honors at the university he could do something they met with no great success and he afterward corrected them so much as to destroy all their interest as juvenile productions without communicating to them any of the merits of maturity in commenting sixty years afterward on a couplet in one of these poems    and fronting the bright west the oak entwines   its darkening boughs and leaves in stronger lines  he says this is feebly and imperfectly expressed but i recollect distinctly the very spot where this first struck me the moment was important in my poetical history for i date from it my consciousness of the infinite variety of natural appearances which had been unnoticed by the poets of any age or country so far as i was acquainted with them and i made a resolution to supply in some degree the deficiency  it is plain that wordsworths memory was playing him a trick here misled by that instinct it may almost be called of consistency which leads men first to desire that their lives should have been without break or seam and then to believe that they have been such the more distant ranges of perspective are apt to run together in retrospection how far could wordsworth at fourteen have been acquainted with the poets of all ages and countrieshe who to his dying day could not endure to read goethe and knew nothing of calderon it seems to me rather that the earliest influence traceable in him is that of goldsmith and later of cowper and it is perhaps some slight indication of its having already begun that his first volume of descriptive sketches 1793 was put forth by johnson who was cowpers publisher by and by the powerful impress of burns is seen both in the topics of his verse and the form of his expression but whatever their ultimate effect upon his style certain it is that his juvenile poems were clothed in the conventional habit of the eighteenth century the first verses from which he remembered to have received great pleasure were miss carters poem on spring a poem in the sixline stanza which he was particularly fond of and had composed much infor example ruth  this is noteworthy for wordsworths lyric range especially so far as tune is concerned was always narrow his sense of melody was painfully dull and some of his lighter effusions as he would have called them are almost ludicrously wanting in grace of movement we cannot expect in a modern poet the thrushlike improvisation the impulsively bewitching cadences that charm us in our elizabethan drama and whose last warble died with herrick but shelley tennyson and browning have shown that the simple pathos of their music was not irrecoverable even if the artless poignancy of their phrase be gone beyond recall we feel this lack in wordsworth all the more keenly if we compare such verses as    like an army defeated   the snow hath retreated   and now doth fare ill   on the top of the bare hill  with goethes exquisite ueber allen gipfeln ist ruh in which the lines as if shaken down by a momentary breeze of emotion drop lingeringly one after another like blossoms upon turf  the evening walk and descriptive sketches show plainly the prevailing influence of goldsmith both in the turn of thought and the mechanism of the verse they lack altogether the temperance of tone and judgment in selection which have made the traveller and the deserted village perhaps the most truly classical poems in the language they bear here and there however the unmistakable stamp of the maturer wordsworth not only in a certain blunt realism but in the intensity and truth of picturesque epithet of this realism from which wordsworth never wholly freed himself the following verses may suffice as a specimen after describing the fate of a chamoishunter killed by falling from a crag his fancy goes back to the bereaved wife and son    haply that child in fearful doubt may gaze   passing his fathers bones in future days   start at the reliques of that very thigh   on which so oft he prattled when a boy  in these poems there is plenty of that poetic diction against which wordsworth was to lead the revolt nine years later    to wet the peaks impracticable sides   he opens of his feet the sanguine tides   weak and more weak the issuing current eyes   lapped by the panting tongue of thirsty skies  both of these passages have disappeared from the revised edition as well as some curious outbursts of that motiveless despair which byron made fashionable not long after nor are there wanting touches of fleshliness which strike us oddly as coming from wordsworth332    farewell those forms that in thy noontide shade   rest near their little plots of oaten glade   those steadfast eyes that beating breasts inspire   to throw the sultry ray of young desire   those lips whose tides of fragrance come and go   accordant to the cheeks unquiet glow   those shadowy breasts in loves soft light arrayed   and rising by the moon of passion swayed  the political tone is also mildened in the revision as where he changes despot courts into tyranny one of the alterations is interesting in the evening walk he had originally written    and bids her soldier come her wars to share   asleep on mindens charnel hill afar  an erratum at the end directs us to correct the second verse thus    asleep on bunkers charnel hill afar333  wordsworth somewhere rebukes the poets for making the owl a bodeful bird he had himself done so in the evening walk and corrects his epithets to suit his later judgment putting gladsome for boding and replacing    the tremulous sob of the complaining owl  by    the sportive outcry of the mocking owl  indeed the character of the two poems is so much changed in the revision as to make the dates appended to them a misleading anachronism but there is one truly wordsworthian passage which already gives us a glimpse of that passion with which he was the first to irradiate descriptive poetry and which sets him on a level with turner    tis storm and hid in mist from hour to hour   all day the floods a deepening murmur pour   the sky is veiled and every cheerful sight   dark is the region as with coming night   but what a sudden burst of overpowering light   triumphant on the bosom of the storm   glances the fireclad eagles wheeling form   eastward in long prospective glittering shine   the woodcrowned cliffs that oer the lake recline   those eastern cliffs a hundred streams unfold   at once to pillars turned that flame with gold   behind his sail the peasant tries to shun   the west that burns like one dilated sun   where in a mighty crucible expire   the mountains glowing hot like coals of fire  wordsworth has made only one change in these verses and that for the worse by substituting glorious which was already implied in glances and fireclad for wheeling in later life he would have found it hard to forgive the man who should have made cliffs recline over a lake on the whole what strikes us as most prophetic in these poems is their want of continuity and the purple patches of true poetry on a texture of unmistakable prose perhaps we might add the incongruous clothing of prose thoughts in the ceremonial robes of poesy  during the same year 1793 he wrote but did not publish a political tract in which he avowed himself opposed to monarchy and to the hereditary principle and desirous of a republic if it could be had without a revolution he probably continued to be all his life in favor of that ideal republic which never was on laud or sea but fortunately he gave up politics that he might devote himself to his own nobler calling to which politics are subordinate and for which he found freedom enough in england as it was334 dr wordsworth admits that his uncles opinions were democratical so late as 1802 i suspect that they remained so in an esoteric way to the end of his days he had himself suffered by the arbitrary selfishness of a great landholder and he was born and bred in a part of england where there is a greater social equality than elsewhere the look and manner of the cumberland people especially are such as recall very vividly to a newenglander the associations of fifty years ago ere the change from new england to new ireland had begun but meanwhile want which makes no distinctions of monarchist or republican was pressing upon him the debt due to his fathers estate had not been paid and wordsworth was one of those rare idealists who esteem it the first duty of a friend of humanity to live for and not on his neighbor he at first proposed establishing a periodical journal to be called the philanthropist but luckily went no further with it for the receipts from an organ of opinion which professed republicanism and at the same time discountenanced the plans of all existing or defunct republicans would have been necessarily scanty there being no appearance of any demand present or prospective for philanthropists he tried to get employment as correspondent of a newspaper here also it was impossible that he should succeed he was too great to be merged in the editorial we and had too well defined a private opinion on all subjects to be able to express that average of public opinion which constitutes able editorials but so it is that to the prophet in the wilderness the birds of ill omen are already on the wing with food from heaven and while wordsworths relatives were getting impatient at what they considered his waste of time while one thought he had gifts enough to make a good parson and another lamented the rare attorney that was lost in him335 the prescient muse guided the hand of raisley calvert while he wrote the poets name in his will for a legacy of £900 by the death of calvert in 1795 this timely help came to wordsworth at the turning point of his life and made it honest for him to write poems that will never die instead of theatrical critiques as ephemeral as play bills or leaders that led only to oblivion  in the autumn of 1795 wordsworth and his sister took up their abode at racedown lodge near crewkerne in dorsetshire here nearly two years were passed chiefly in the study of poetry and wordsworth to some extent recovered from the fierce disappointment of his political dreams and regained that equable tenor of mind which alone is consistent with a healthy productiveness here coleridge who had contrived to see something more in the descriptive sketches than the public had discovered there first made his acquaintance the sympathy and appreciation of an intellect like coleridges supplied him with that external motive to activity which is the chief use of popularity and justified to him his opinion of his own powers it was now that the tragedy of the borderers was for the most part written and that plan of the lyrical ballads suggested which gave wordsworth a clew to lead him out of the metaphysical labyrinth in which he was entangled it was agreed between the two young friends that wordsworth was to be a philosophic poet and by a good fortune uncommon to such conspiracies nature had already consented to the arrangement in july 1797 the two wordsworths removed to allfoxden in somersetshire that they might be near coleridge who in the mean while had married and settled himself at netherstowey in november the borderers was finished and wordsworth went up to london with his sister to offer it for the stage the good genius of the poet again interposing the play was decisively rejected and wordsworth went back to allfoxden himself the hero of that first tragicomedy so common to young authors  the play has fine passages but is as unreal as jane eyre it shares with many of wordsworths narrative poems the defect of being written to illustrate an abstract moral theory so that the overbearing thesis is continually thrusting the poetry to the wall applied to the drama such predestination makes all the personages puppets and disenables them for being characters wordsworth seems to have felt this when he published the borderers in 1842 and says in a note that it was at first written  without any view to its exhibition upon the stage but he was mistaken the contemporaneous letters of coleridge to cottle show that he was long in giving up the hope of getting it accepted by some theatrical manager  he now applied himself to the preparation of the first volume of the lyrical ballads for the press and it was published toward the close of 1798 the book which contained also the ancient mariner of coleridge attracted little notice and that in great part contemptuous when mr cottle the publisher shortly after sold his copyrights to mr longman that of the lyrical ballads was reckoned at zero and it was at last given up to the authors a few persons were not wanting however who discovered the dawnstreaks of a new day in that light which the critical firebrigade thought to extinguish with a few contemptuous spurts of cold water336  lord byron describes himself as waking one morning and finding himself famous and it is quite an ordinary fact that a blaze may be made with a little saltpetre that will be stared at by thousands who would have thought the sunrise tedious if we may believe his biographer wordsworth might have said that he awoke and found himself infamous for the publication of the lyrical ballads undoubtedly raised him to the distinction of being the least popular poet in england parnassus has two peaks the one where improvising poets cluster the other where the singer of deep secrets sits alonea peak veiled sometimes from the whole morning of a generation by earthborn mists and smoke of kitchen fires only to glow the more consciously at sunset and after nightfall to crown itself with imperishable stars wordsworth had that selftrust which in the man of genius is sublime and in the man of talent insufferable it mattered not to him though all the reviewers had been in a chorus of laughter or conspiracy of silence behind him he went quietly over to germany to write more lyrical ballads and to begin a poem on the growth of his own mind at a time when there were only two men in the world himself and coleridge who were aware that he had one or at least one anywise differing from those mechanically uniform ones which are stuck drearily side by side in the great pinpaper of society  in germany wordsworth dined in company with klopstock and after dinner they had a conversation of which wordsworth took notes the respectable old poet who was passing the evening of his days by the chimneycorner darby and joan like with his respectable muse seems to have been rather bewildered by the apparition of a living genius the record is of value now chiefly for the insight it gives us into wordsworths mind among other things he said that it was the province of a great poet to raise people up to his own level not to descend to theirsmemorable words the more memorable that a literary life of sixty years was in keeping with them  it would be instructive to know what were wordsworths studies during his winter in goslar de quinceys statement is mere conjecture it may be guessed fairly enough that he would seek an entrance to the german language by the easy path of the ballad a course likely to confirm him in his theories as to the language of poetry the spinosism with which he has been not unjustly charged was certainly not due to any german influence for it appears unmistakably in the lines composed at tintern abbey in july 1798 it is more likely to have been derived from his talks with coleridge in 1797337 when emerson visited him in 1833 he spoke with loathing of wilhelm meister a part of which he had read in carlyles translation apparently there was some affectation in this it should seem for he had read smollett on the whole it may be fairly concluded that the help of germany in the development of his genius may be reckoned as very small though there is certainly a marked resemblance both in form and sentiment between some of his earlier lyrics and those of goethe his poem of the thorn though vastly more imaginative may have been suggested by bürgers pfarrers tochter von taubenhain the little grave drei spannen lang in its conscientious measurement certainly recalls a famous couplet in the english poem  after spending the winter at goslar wordsworth and his sister returned to england in the spring of 1799 and settled at grasmere in westmoreland in 1800 the first edition of the lyrical ballads being exhausted it was republished with the addition of another volume mr longman paying £100 for the copyright of two editions the book passed to a second edition in 1802 and to a third in 1805338 wordsworth sent a copy of it with a manly letter to mr fox particularly recommending to his attention the poems michael and the brothers as displaying the strength and permanence among a simple and rural population of those domestic affections which were certain to decay gradually under the influence of manufactories and poor houses mr fox wrote a civil acknowledgment saying that his favorites among the poems were harry gill we are seven the mad mother and the idiot but that he was prepossessed against the use of blank verse for simple subjects any political significance in the poems he was apparently unable to see to this second edition wordsworth prefixed an argumentative preface in which he nailed to the door of the cathedral of english song the critical theses which he was to maintain against all comers in his poetry and his life it was a new thing for an author to undertake to show the goodness of his verses by the logic and learning of his prose but wordsworth carried to the reform of poetry all that fervor and faith which had lost their political object and it is another proof of the sincerity and greatness of his mind and of that heroic simplicity which is their concomitant that he could do so calmly what was sure to seem ludicrous to the greater number of his readers fifty years have since demonstrated that the true judgment of one man outweighs any counterpoise of false judgment and that the faith of mankind is guided to a man only by a wellfounded faith in himself to this defensio wordsworth afterward added a supplement and the two form a treatise of permanent value for philosophic statement and decorous english their only ill effect has been that they have encouraged many otherwise deserving young men to set a sibylline value on their verses in proportion as they were unsalable the strength of an argument for self reliance drawn from the example of a great man depends wholly on the greatness of him who uses it such arguments being like coats of mail which though they serve the strong against arrowflights and lancethrusts may only suffocate the weak or sink him the sooner in the waters of oblivion  an advertisement prefixed to the lyrical ballads as originally published in one volume warned the reader that they were written chiefly with a view to ascertain how far the language of conversation in the middle and lower classes of society is adapted to the purposes of poetic pleasure in his preface to the second edition in two volumes wordsworth already found himself forced to shift his ground a little perhaps in deference to the wider view and finer sense of coleridge and now says of the former volume that it was published as an experiment which i hoped might be of some use to ascertain how far by fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of the real language of men in a state of vivid sensation that sort of pleasure and that quantity of pleasure may be imparted which a poet may rationally endeavor to impart339 here is evidence of a retreat towards a safer position though wordsworth seems to have remained unconvinced at heart and for many years longer clung obstinately to the passages of bald prose into which his original theory had betrayed him in 1815 his opinions had undergone a still further change and an assiduous study of the qualities of his own mind and of his own poetic method the two subjects in which alone he was ever a thorough scholar had convinced him that poetry was in no sense that appeal to the understanding which is implied by the words rationally endeavor to impart in the preface of that year he says the observations prefixed to that portion of these volumes which was published many years ago under the title of lyrical ballads have so little of special application to the greater part of the present enlarged and diversified collection that they could not with propriety stand as an introduction to it it is a pity that he could not have become an earlier convert to coleridges pithy definition that prose was words in their best order and poetry the best words in the best order but idealization was something that wordsworth was obliged to learn painfully it did not come to him naturally as to spenser and shelley and to coleridge in his higher moods moreover it was in the too frequent choice of subjects incapable of being idealized without a manifest jar between theme and treatment that wordsworths great mistake lay for example in the blind highland boy he had originally the following stanzas    strong is the current but be mild   ye waves and spare the helpless child   if ye in anger fret or chafe   a beehive would be ship as safe     as that in which he sails    but say what was it thought of fear   well may ye tremble when ye hear   a household tub like one of those   which women use to wash their clothes     this carried the blind boy  in endeavoring to get rid of the downright vulgarity of phrase in the last stanza wordsworth invents an impossible tortoiseshell and thus robs his story of the reality which alone gave it a living interest any extemporized raft would have floated the boy down to immortality but wordsworth never quite learned the distinction between fact which suffocates the muse and truth which is the very breath of her nostrils study and selfculture did much for him but they never quite satisfied him that he was capable of making a mistake he yielded silently to friendly remonstrance on certain points and gave up for example the ludicrous exactness of    ive measured it from side to side   t is three feet long and two feet wide  but i doubt if he was ever really convinced and to his dying day he could never quite shake off that habit of overminute detail which renders the narratives of uncultivated people so tedious and sometimes so distasteful340 simon lee after his latest revision still contains verses like these   and he is lean and he is sick   his body dwindled and awry   rests upon ankles swollen and thick   his legs are thin and dry                                        few months of life he has in store   as he to you will tell   for still the more he works the more   do his weak ankles swell  which are not only prose but bad prose and moreover guilty of the same fault for which wordsworth condemned dr johnsons famous parody on the balladstylethat their matter is contemptible the sonorousness of conviction with which wordsworth sometimes gives utterance to commonplaces of thought and trivialities of sentiment has a ludicrous effect on the profane and even on the faithful in unguarded moments we are reminded of a passage in the excursion             list i heard   from yon huge breast of rock a solemn bleat   sent forth as if it were the mountains voice  in 1800 the friendship of wordsworth with lamb began and was thenceforward never interrupted he continued to live at grasmere conscientiously diligent in the composition of poems secure of finding the materials of glory within and around him for his genius taught him that inspiration is no product of a foreign shore and that no adventurer ever found it though he wandered as long as ulysses meanwhile the appreciation of the best minds and the gratitude of the purest hearts gradually centred more and more towards him in 1802 he made a short visit to france in company with miss wordsworth and soon after his return to england was married to mary hutchinson on the 4th of october of the same year of the good fortune of this marriage no other proof is needed than the purity and serenity of his poems and its record is to be sought nowhere else  on the 18th of june 1803 his first child john was born and on the 14th of august of the same year he set out with his sister on a foot journey into scotland coleridge was their companion during a part of this excursion of which miss wordsworth kept a full diary in scotland he made the acquaintance of scott who recited to him a part of the lay of the last minstrel then in manuscript the travellers returned to grasmere on the 25th of september it was during this year that wordsworths intimacy with the excellent sir george beaumont began sir george was an amateur painter of considerable merit and his friendship was undoubtedly of service to wordsworth in making him familiar with the laws of a sister art and thus contributing to enlarge the sympathies of his criticism the tendency of which was toward too great exclusiveness sir george beaumont dying in 1827 did not forego his regard for the poet but contrived to hold his affection in mortmain by the legacy of an annuity of £100 to defray the charges of a yearly journey  in march 1805 the poets brother john lost his life by the shipwreck of the abergavenny eastindiaman of which he was captain he was a man of great purity and integrity and sacrificed himself to his sense of duty by refusing to leave the ship till it was impossible to save him wordsworth was deeply attached to him and felt such grief at his death as only solitary natures like his are capable of though mitigated by a sense of the heroism which was the cause of it the need of mental activity as affording an outlet to intense emotion may account for the great productiveness of this and the following year he now completed the prelude wrote the wagoner and increased the number of his smaller poems enough to fill two volumes which were published in 1807  this collection which contained some of the most beautiful of his shorter pieces and among others the incomparable odes to duty and on immortality did not reach a second edition till 1815 the reviewers had another laugh and rival poets pillaged while they scoffed particularly byron among whose verses a bit of wordsworth showed as incongruously as a sacred vestment on the back of some buccaneering plunderer of an abbey341  there was a general combination to put him down but on the other hand there was a powerful party in his favor consisting of william wordsworth he not only continued in good heart himself but reversing the order usual on such occasions kept up the spirits of his friends342  wordsworth passed the winter of 18067 in a house of sir george beaumonts at coleorton in leicestershire the cottage at grasmere having become too small for his increased family on his return to the vale of grasmere he rented the house at allan bank where he lived three years during this period he appears to have written very little poetry for which his biographer assigns as a primary reason the smokiness of the allan bank chimneys this will hardly account for the failure of the summer crop especially as wordsworth composed chiefly in the open air it did not prevent him from writing a pamphlet upon the convention of cintra which was published too late to attract much attention though lamb says that its effect upon him was like that which one of miltons tracts might have had upon a contemporary343 it was at allan bank that coleridge dictated the friend and wordsworth contributed to it two essays one in answer to a letter of mathetes344 professor wilson and the other on epitaphs republished in the notes to the excursion here also he wrote his description of the scenery of the lakes perhaps a truer explanation of the comparative silence of wordsworths muse during these years is to be found in the intense interest which he took in current events whose variety picturesqueness and historical significance were enough to absorb all the energies of his imagination  in the spring of 1811 wordsworth removed to the parsonage at grasmere here he remained two years and here he had his second intimate experience of sorrow in the loss of two of his children catharine and thomas one of whom died 4th june and the other 1st december 1812345 early in 1813 he bought rydal mount and having removed thither changed his abode no more during the rest of his life in march of this year he was appointed distributor of stamps for the county of westmoreland an office whose receipts rendered him independent and whose business he was able to do by deputy thus leaving him ample leisure for nobler duties de quincey speaks of this appointment as an instance of the remarkable good luck which waited upon wordsworth through his whole life in our view it is only another illustration of that scripture which describes the righteous as never forsaken good luck is the willing handmaid of upright energetic character and conscientious observance of duty wordsworth owed his nomination to the friendly exertions of the earl of lonsdale who desired to atone as far as might be for the injustice of the first earl and who respected the honesty of the man more than he appreciated the originality of the poet346 the collectorship at whitehaven a more lucrative office was afterwards offered to wordsworth and declined he had enough for independence and wished nothing more still later on the death of the stampdistributor for cumberland a part of that district was annexed to westmoreland and wordsworths income was raised to something more than £1000 a year  in 1814 he made his second tour in scotland visiting yarrow in company with the ettrick shepherd during this year the excursion was published in an edition of five hundred copies which supplied the demand for six years another edition of the same number of copies was published in 1827 and not exhausted till 1834 in 1815 the white doe of rylstone appeared and in 1816 a letter to a friend of burns in which wordsworth gives his opinion upon the limits to be observed by the biographers of literary men it contains many valuable suggestions but allows hardly scope enough for personal details to which he was constitutionally indifferent347 nearly the same date may be ascribed to a rhymed translation of the first three books of the aeneid a specimen of which was printed in the cambridge philological museum 1832 in 1819 peter bell written twenty years before was published and perhaps in consequence of the ridicule of the reviewers found a more rapid sale than any of his previous volumes the wagoner printed in the same year was less successful his next publication was the volume of sonnets on the river duddon with some miscellaneous poems 1820 a tour on the continent in 1820 furnished the subjects for another collection published in 1822 this was followed in the same year by the volume of ecclesiastical sketches his subsequent publications were yarrow revisited 1835 and the tragedy of the borderers 1842  during all these years his fame was increasing slowly but steadily and his age gathered to itself the reverence and the troops of friends which his poems and the nobly simple life reflected in them deserved public honors followed private appreciation in 1838 the university of dublin conferred upon him the degree of dcl in 1839 oxford did the same and the reception of the poet now in his seventieth year at the university was enthusiastic in 1842 he resigned his office of stampdistributor and sir robert peel had the honor of putting him upon the civil list for a pension of £300 in 1843 he was appointed laureate with the express understanding that it was a tribute of respect involving no duties except such as might be selfimposed his only official production was an ode for the installation of prince albert as chancellor of the university of cambridge his life was prolonged yet seven years almost it should seem that he might receive that honor which he had truly conquered for himself by the unflinching bravery of a literary life of half a century unparalleled for the scorn with which its labors were received and the victorious acknowledgment which at last crowned them surviving nearly all his contemporaries he had if ever any man had a foretaste of immortality enjoying in a sort his own posthumous renown for the hardy slowness of its growth gave a safe pledge of its durability he died on the 23d of april 1850 the anniversary of the death of shakespeare  we have thus briefly sketched the life of wordswortha life uneventful even for a man of letters a life like that of an oak of quiet self development throwing out stronger roots toward the side whence the prevailing stormblasts blow and of tougher fibre in proportion to the rocky nature of the soil in which it grows the life and growth of his mind and the influences which shaped it are to be looked for even more than is the case with most poets in his works for he deliberately recorded them there  of his personal characteristics little is related he was somewhat above the middle height but according to de quincey of indifferent figure the shoulders being narrow and drooping his finest feature was the eye which was gray and full of spiritual light leigh hunt says i never beheld eyes that looked so inspired so supernatural they were like fires half burning half smouldering with a sort of acrid fixture of regard one might imagine ezekiel or isaiah to have had such eyes southey tells us that he had no sense of smell and haydon that he had none of form the best likeness of him in de quinceys judgment is the portrait of milton prefixed to richardsons notes on paradise lost he was active in his habits composing in the open air and generally dictating his poems his daily life was regular simple and frugal his manners were dignified and kindly and in his letters and recorded conversations it is remarkable how little that was personal entered into his judgment of contemporaries  the true rank of wordsworth among poets is perhaps not even yet to be fairly estimated so hard is it to escape into the quiet hall of judgment uninflamed by the tumult of partisanship which besets the doors  coming to manhood predetermined to be a great poet at a time when the artificial school of poetry was enthroned with all the authority of long succession and undisputed legitimacy it was almost inevitable that wordsworth who both by nature and judgment was a rebel against the existing order should become a partisan unfortunately he became not only the partisan of a system but of william wordsworth as its representative right in general principle he thus necessarily became wrong in particulars justly convinced that greatness only achieves its ends by implicitly obeying its own instincts he perhaps reduced the following his instincts too much to a system mistook his own resentments for the promptings of his natural genius and compelling principle to the measure of his own temperament or even of the controversial exigency of the moment fell sometimes into the error of making naturalness itself artificial if a poet resolve to be original it will end commonly in his being merely peculiar  wordsworth himself departed more and more in practice as he grew older from the theories which he had laid down in his prefaces348 but those theories undoubtedly had a great effect in retarding the growth of his fame he had carefully constructed a pair of spectacles through which his earlier poems were to be studied and the public insisted on looking through them at his mature works and were consequently unable to see fairly what required a different focus he forced his readers to come to his poetry with a certain amount of conscious preparation and thus gave them beforehand the impression of something like mechanical artifice and deprived them of the contented repose of implicit faith to the child a watch seems to be a living creature but wordsworth would not let his readers be children and did injustice to himself by giving them an uneasy doubt whether creations which really throbbed with the very heartsblood of genius and were alive with natures life of life were not contrivances of wheels and springs a naturalness which we are told to expect has lost the crowning grace of nature the men who walked in cornelius agrippas visionary gardens had probably no more pleasurable emotion than that of a shallow wonder or an equally shallow selfsatisfaction in thinking they had hit upon the secret of the thaumaturgy but to a tree that has grown as god willed we come without a theory and with no botanical predilections enjoying it simply and thankfully or the imagination recreates for us its past summers and winters the birds that have nested and sung in it the sheep that have clustered in its shade the winds that have visited it the cloudbergs that have drifted over it and the snows that have ermined it in winter the imagination is a faculty that flouts at foreordination and wordsworth seemed to do all he could to cheat his readers of her company by laying out paths with a peremptory do not step off the gravel at the opening of each and preparing pitfalls for every conceivable emotion with guideboards to tell each when and where it must be caught  but if these things stood in the way of immediate appreciation he had another theory which interferes more seriously with the total and permanent effect of his poems he was theoretically determined not only to be a philosophic poet but to be a great philosophic poet and to this end he must produce an epic leaving aside the question whether the epic be obsolete or not it may be doubted whether the history of a single mans mind is universal enough in its interest to furnish all the requirements of the epic machinery and it may be more than doubted whether a poets philosophy be ordinary metaphysics divisible into chapter and section it is rather something which is more energetic in a word than in a whole treatise and our hearts unclose themselves instinctively at its simple open sesame while they would stand firm against the reading of the whole body of philosophy in point of fact the one element of greatness which the excursion possesses indisputably is heaviness it is only the episodes that are universally read and the effect of these is diluted by the connecting and accompanying lectures on metaphysics wordsworth had his epic mould to fill and like benvenuto cellini in casting his perseus was forced to throw in everything debasing the metal lest it should run short separated from the rest the episodes are perfect poems in their kind and without example in the language  wordsworth like most solitary men of strong minds was a good critic of the substance of poetry but somewhat niggardly in the allowance he made for those subsidiary qualities which make it the charmer of leisure and the employment of minds without definite object it may be doubted indeed whether he set much store by any contemporary writing but his own and whether he did not look upon poetry too exclusively as an exercise rather of the intellect than as a nepenthe of the imagination349 he says of himself speaking of his youth                                    in fine   i was a better judge of thoughts than words   misled in estimating words not only   by common inexperience of youth   but by the trade in classic niceties   the dangerous craft of culling term and phrase   from languages that want the living voice   to carry meaning to the natural heart   to tell us what is passion what is truth   what reason what simplicity and sense350  though he here speaks in the preterite tense this was always true of him and his thought seems often to lean upon a word too weak to bear its weight no reader of adequate insight can help regretting that he did not earlier give himself to the trade of classic niceties it was precisely this which gives to the blankverse of landor the severe dignity and reserved force which alone among later poets recall the tune of milton and to which wordsworth never attained indeed wordsworths blankverse though the passion be profounder is always essentially that of cowper they were alike also in their love of outward nature and of simple things the main difference between them is one of scenery rather than of sentiment between the lifelong familiar of the mountains and the dweller on the plain  it cannot be denied that in wordsworth the very highest powers of the poetic mind were associated with a certain tendency to the diffuse and commonplace it is in the understanding always prosaic that the great golden veins of his imagination are imbedded351 he wrote too much to write always well for it is not a great xerxesarmy of words but a compact greek ten thousand that march safely down to posterity he set tasks to his divine faculty which is much the same as trying to make joves eagle do the service of a clucking hen throughout the prelude and the excursion he seems striving to bind the wizard imagination with the sandropes of dry disquisition and to have forgotten the potent spellword which would make the particles cohere there is an arenaceous quality in the style which makes progress wearisome yet with what splendors as of mountainsunsets are we rewarded what golden rounds of verse do we not see stretching heavenward with angels ascending and descending what haunting harmonies hover around us deep and eternal like the undying barytone of the sea and if we are compelled to fare through sands and desert wildernesses how often do we not hear airy shapes that syllable our names with a startling personal appeal to our highest consciousness and our noblest aspiration such as we wait for in vain in any other poet  take from wordsworth all which an honest criticism cannot but allow and what is left will show how truly great he was he had no humor no dramatic power and his temperament was of that dry and juiceless quality that in all his published correspondence you shall not find a letter but only essays if we consider carefully where he was most successful we shall find that it was not so much in description of natural scenery or delineation of character as in vivid expression of the effect produced by external objects and events upon his own mind and of the shape and hue perhaps momentary which they in turn took from his mood or temperament his finest passages are always monologues he had a fondness for particulars and there are parts of his poems which remind us of local histories in the undue relative importance given to trivial matters he was the historian of wordsworthshire this power of particularization for it is as truly a power as generalization is what gives such vigor and greatness to single lines and sentiments of wordsworth and to poems developing a single thought or sentiment it was this that made him so fond of the sonnet that sequestered nook forced upon him the limits which his fecundity if i may not say his garrulity was never selfdenying enough to impose on itself it suits his solitary and meditative temper and it was there that lamb an admirable judge of what was permanent in literature liked him best its narrow bounds but fourteen paces from end to end turn into a virtue his too common fault of giving undue prominence to every passing emotion he excels in monologue and the law of the sonnet tempers monologue with mercy in the excursion we are driven to the subterfuge of a french verdict of extenuating circumstances his mind had not that reach and elemental movement of miltons which like the tradewind gathered to itself thoughts and images like stately fleets from every quarter some deep with silks and spicery some brooding over the silent thunders of their battailous armaments but all swept forward in their destined track over the long billows of his verse every inch of canvas strained by the unifying breath of their common epic impulse it was an organ that milton mastered mighty in compass capable equally of the trumpets ardors or the slim delicacy of the flute and sometimes it bursts forth in great crashes through his prose as if he touched it for solace in the intervals of his toil if wordsworth sometimes puts the trumpet to his lips yet he lays it aside soon and willingly for his appropriate instrument the pastoral reed and it is not one that grew by any vulgar stream but that which apollo breathed through tending the flocks of admetusthat which pan endowed with every melody of the visible universethe same in which the soul of the despairing nymph took refuge and gifted with her dual natureso that ever and anon amid the notes of human joy or sorrow there comes suddenly a deeper and almost awful tone thrilling us into dim consciousness of a forgotten divinity  wordsworths absolute want of humor while it no doubt confirmed his selfconfidence by making him insensible both to the comical incongruity into which he was often led by his earlier theory concerning the language of poetry and to the not unnatural ridicule called forth by it seems to have been indicative of a certain dulness of perception in other directions352 we cannot help feeling that the material of his nature was essentially prose which in his inspired moments he had the power of transmuting but which whenever the inspiration failed or was factitious remained obstinately leaden the normal condition of many poets would seem to approach that temperature to which wordsworths mind could be raised only by the white heat of profoundly inward passion and in proportion to the intensity needful to make his nature thoroughly aglow is the very high quality of his best verses they seem rather the productions of nature than of man and have the lastingness of such delighting our age with the same startle of newness and beauty that pleased our youth is it his thought it has the shifting inward lustre of diamond is it his feeling it is as delicate as the impressions of fossil ferns he seems to have caught and fixed forever in immutable grace the most evanescent and intangible of our intuitions the very ripplemarks on the remotest shores of being but this intensity of mood which insures high quality is by its very nature incapable of prolongation and wordsworth in endeavoring it falls more below himself and is more even than many poets his inferiors in imaginative quality a poet of passages indeed one cannot help having the feeling sometimes that the poem is there for the sake of these passages rather than that these are the natural jets and elations of a mind energized by the rapidity of its own motion in other words the happy couplet or gracious image seems not to spring from the inspiration of the poem conceived as a whole but rather to have dropped of itself into the mind of the poet in one of his rambles who then in a less rapt mood has patiently built up around it a setting of verse too often ungraceful in form and of a material whose cheapness may cast a doubt on the priceless quality of the gem it encumbers353 during the most happily productive period of his life wordsworth was impatient of what may be called the mechanical portion of his art his wife and sister seem from the first to have been his scribes in later years he had learned and often insisted on the truth that poetry was an art no less than a gift and corrected his poems in cold blood sometimes to their detriment but he certainly had more of the vision than of the faculty divine and was always a little numb on the side of form and proportion perhaps his best poem in these respects is the laodamia and it is not uninstructive to learn from his own lips that it cost him more trouble than almost anything of equal length he had ever written his longer poems miscalled epical have no more intimate bond of union than their more or less immediate relation to his own personality of character other than his own he had but a faint conception and all the personages of the excursion that are not wordsworth are the merest shadows of himself upon mist for his selfconcentrated nature was incapable of projecting itself into the consciousness of other men and seeing the springs of action at their source in the recesses of individual character the best parts of these longer poems are bursts of impassioned soliloquy and his fingers were always clumsy at the callida junctura the stream of narration is sluggish if varied by times with pleasing reflections viridesque placido aequore sylvas we are forced to do our own rowing and only when the current is hemmed in by some narrow gorge of the poets personal consciousness do we feel ourselves snatched along on the smooth but impetuous rush of unmistakable inspiration the fact that what is precious in wordsworths poetry was more truly even than with some greater poets than he a gift rather than an achievement should always be borne in mind in taking the measure of his power i know not whether to call it height or depth this peculiarity of his but it certainly endows those parts of his work which we should distinguish as wordsworthian with an unexpectedness and impressiveness of originality such as we feel in the presence of nature herself he seems to have been half conscious of this and recited his own poems to all comers with an enthusiasm of wondering admiration that would have been profoundly comic354 but for its simple sincerity and for the fact that william wordsworth esquire of rydal mount was one person and the william wordsworth whom he so heartily reverenced quite another we recognize two voices in him as stephano did in caliban there are jeremiah and his scribe baruch if the prophet cease from dictating the amanuensis rather than be idle employs his pen in jotting down some anecdotes of his master how he one day went out and saw an old woman and the next day did not and so came home and dictated some verses on this ominous phenomenon and how another day he saw a cow these marginal annotations have been carelessly taken up into the text have been religiously held by the pious to be orthodox scripture and by dexterous exegesis have been made to yield deeply oracular meanings presently the real prophet takes up the word again and speaks as one divinely inspired the voice of a higher and invisible power wordsworths better utterances have the bare sincerity the absolute abstraction from time and place the immunity from decay that belong to the grand simplicities of the bible they seem not more his own than ours and every mans the word of the inalterable mind this gift of his was naturally very much a matter of temperament and accordingly by far the greater part of his finer product belongs to the period of his prime ere time had set his lumpish foot on the pedal that deadens the nerves of animal sensibility355 he did not grow as those poets do in whom the artistic sense is predominant one of the most delightful fancies of the genevese humorist toepffer is the poet albert who having had his portrait drawn by a highly idealizing hand does his best afterwards to look like it many of wordsworths later poems seem like rather unsuccessful efforts to resemble his former self they would never as sir john harrington says of poetry keep a child from play and an old man from the chimneycorner356  chief justice marshall once blandly interrupted a junior counsel who was arguing certain obvious points of law at needless length by saying brother jones there are some things which a supreme court of the united states sitting in equity may be presumed to know wordsworth has this fault of enforcing and restating obvious points till the reader feels as if his own intelligence were somewhat underrated he is overconscientious in giving us full measure and once profoundly absorbed in the sound of his own voice he knows not when to stop if he feel himself flagging he has a droll way of keeping the floor as it were by asking himself a series of questions sometimes not needing and often incapable of answer there are three stanzas of such near the close of the first part of peter bell where peter first catches a glimpse of the dead body in the water all happily incongruous and ending with one which reaches the height of comicality    is it a fiend that to a stake   of fire his desperate self is tethering   or stubborn spirit doomed to yell   in solitary ward or cell   ten thousand miles from all his brethren  the same want of humor which made him insensible to incongruity may perhaps account also for the singular unconsciousness of disproportion which so often strikes us in his poetry for example a little farther on in peter bell we find    nowlike a tempestshattered bark   that overwhelmed and prostrate lies   and in a moment to the verge   is lifted of a foaming surge   full suddenly the ass doth rise  and one cannot help thinking that the similes of the huge stone the seabeast and the cloud noble as they are in themselves are somewhat too lofty for the service to which they are put357  the movement of wordsworths mind was too slow and his mood to meditative for narrative poetry he values his own thoughts and reflections too much to sacrifice the least of them to the interests of his story moreover it is never action that interests him but the subtle motives that lead to or hinder it the wagoner involuntarily suggests a comparison with tam oshanter infinitely to its own disadvantage peter bell full though it be of profound touches and subtle analysis is lumbering and disjointed even lamb was forced to confess that he did not like it the white doe the most wordsworthian of them all in the best meaning of the epithet is also only the more truly so for being diffuse and reluctant what charms in wordsworth and will charm forever is the                  happy tone   of meditation slipping in between   the beauty coming and the beauty gone  a few poets in the exquisite adaptation of their words to the tune of our own feelings and fancies in the charm of their manner indefinable as the sympathetic grace of woman are everything to us without our being able to say that they are much in themselves they rather narcotize than fortify wordsworth must subject our mood to his own before he admits us to his intimacy but once admitted it is for life and we find ourselves in his debt not for what he has been to us in our hours of relaxation but for what he has done for us as a reinforcement of faltering purpose and personal independence of character his system of a naturecure first professed by dr jean jaques and continued by cowper certainly breaks down as a whole the solitary of the excursion who has not been cured of his scepticism by living among the medicinal mountains is so far as we can see equally proof against the lectures of pedler and parson wordsworth apparently felt that this would be so and accordingly never saw his way clear to finishing the poem but the treatment whether a panacea or not is certainly wholesome inasmuch as it inculcates abstinence exercise and uncontaminate air i am not sure indeed that the naturecure theory does not tend to foster in constitutions less vigorous than wordsworths what milton would call a fugitive and cloistered virtue at a dear expense of manlier qualities the ancients and our own elizabethans ere spiritual megrims had become fashionable perhaps made more out of life by taking a frank delight in its action and passion and by grappling with the facts of this world rather than muddling themselves over the insoluble problems of another if they had not discovered the picturesque as we understand it they found surprisingly fine scenery in man and his destiny and would have seen something ludicrous it may be suspected in the spectacle of a grown man running to hide his head in the apron of the mighty mother whenever he had an ache in his finger or got a bruise in the tussle for existence  but when as i have said our impartiality has made all those qualifications and deductions against which even the greatest poet may not plead his privilege what is left to wordsworth is enough to justify his fame even where his genius is wrapped in clouds the unconquerable lightning of imagination struggles through flashing out unexpected vistas and illuminating the humdrum pathway of our daily thought with a radiance of momentary consciousness that seems like a revelation if it be the most delightful function of the poet to set our lives to music yet perhaps he will be even more sure of our maturer gratitude if he do his part also as moralist and philosopher to purify and enlighten if he define and encourage our vacillating perceptions of duty if he piece together our fragmentary apprehensions of our own life and that larger life whose unconscious instruments we are making of the jumbled bits of our dissected map of experience a coherent chart in the great poets there is an exquisite sensibility both of soul and sense that sympathizes like gossamer seamoss with every movement of the element in which it floats but which is rooted on the solid rock of our common sympathies wordsworth shows less of this finer feminine fibre of organization than one or two of his contemporaries notably than coleridge or shelley but he was a masculine thinker and in his more characteristic poems there is always a kernel of firm conclusion from farreaching principles that stimulates thought and challenges meditation groping in the dark passages of life we come upon some axiom of his as it were a wall that gives us our bearings and enables us to find an outlet compared with goethe we feel that he lacks that serene impartiality of mind which results from breadth of culture nay he seems narrow insular almost provincial he reminds us of those saints of dante who gather brightness by revolving on their own axis but through this very limitation of range he gains perhaps in intensity and the impressiveness which results from eagerness of personal conviction if we read wordsworth through as i have just done we find ourselves changing our mind about him at every other page so uneven is he if we read our favorite poems or passages only he will seem uniformly great and even as regards the excursion we should remember how few long poems will bear consecutive reading for my part i know of but onethe odyssey  none of our great poets can be called popular in any exact sense of the word for the highest poetry deals with thoughts and emotions which inhabit like rarest seamosses the doubtful limits of that shore between our abiding divine and our fluctuating human nature rooted in the one but living in the other seldom laid bare and otherwise visible only at exceptional moments of entire calm and clearness of no other poet except shakespeare have so many phrases become household words as of wordsworth if pope has made current more epigrams of worldly wisdom to wordsworth belongs the nobler praise of having defined for us and given us for a daily possession those faint and vague suggestions of otherworldliness of whose gentle ministry with our baser nature the hurry and bustle of life scarcely ever allowed us to be conscious he has won for himself a secure immortality by a depth of intuition which makes only the best minds at their best hours worthy or indeed capable of his companionship and by a homely sincerity of human sympathy which reaches the humblest heart our language owes him gratitude for the habitual purity and abstinence of his style and we who speak it for having emboldened us to take delight in simple things and to trust ourselves to our own instincts and he hath his reward it needs not to bid    renowned chaucer lie a thought more nigh   to rare beaumond and learned beaumond lie   a little nearer spenser  for there is no fear of crowding in that little society with whom he is now enrolled as fifth in the succession of the great english poets     footnotes      323 i pay many little visits to the family in the churchyard at     grasmere writes james dixon an old servant of wordsworth to crabb     robinson with a simple one might almost say canine pathos thirteen     years after his masters death wordsworth was always considerate and     kind with his servants robinson tells us       324 in the prelude he attributes this consecreation to a sunrise     seen during a college vacation as he walked homeward from some     village festival where he had danced all night        my heart was full i made no vows but vows       were then made for me bond unknown to me       was given that i

1798       327 i think this more than doubtful for i find no traces of the     influence of any of these poets in his earlier writings goldsmith     was evidently his model in the descriptive sketches and the evening     walk i speak of them as originally printed       328 prelude book iii he studied italian also at cambridge his     teacher whose name was isola had formerly taught the poet gray it     may be pretty certainly inferred however that his first systematic     study of english poetry was due to the copy of andersens british     poets left with him by his sailor brother john on setting out for     his last voyage in 1805       329 prelude book vii written before 1805 and referring to a     still earlier date wordsworth went in powder and with cocked hat     under his arm to the marchioness of staffords rout southey to     miss barker may 1806       330 this was probably one reason for the long suppression of miss     wordsworths journal which she had evidently prepared for     publication as early as 1805       331 crabb robinson i 250 am ed       332 wordsworths purity afterwards grew sensitive almost to     prudery the late mr clough told me that he heard him at dr     arnolds table denounce the first line in keatss ode to a grecian     urn as indecent and haydon records that when he saw the group of     cupid and psyche he exclaimed the devils       333 the whole passage is omitted in the revised edition the     original a quarto pamphlet is now very rare but fortunately     charles lambs copy of it is now owned by my friend professor c e     norton       334 wordsworth showed his habitual good sense in never sharing so     far as is known the communistic dreams of his friends coleridge and     southey the latter of the two had to be sure renounced them     shortly after his marriage and before his acquaintance with     wordsworth began but coleridge seems to have clung to them longer     there is a passage in one of his letters to cottle without date but     apparently written in the spring of 1798 which would imply that     wordsworth had been accused of some kind of social heresy     wordsworth has been caballed against so long and so loudly that he     has found it impossible to prevail on the tenant of the allfoxden     estate to let him the house after their first agreement is expired     perhaps after all it was wordsworths insulation of character and     habitual want of sympathy with anything but the moods of his own mind     that rendered him incapable of this copartnery of enthusiasm he     appears to have regarded even his sister dora whom he certainly     loved as much as it was possible for him to love anything but his own     poems as a kind of tributary dependency of his genius much as a     mountain might look down on one of its ancillary spurs       335 speaking to one of his neighbors in 1845 he said that after     he had finished his college course he was in great doubt as to what     his future employment should be he did not feel himself good enough     for the church he felt that his mind was not properly disciplined     for that holy office and that the struggle between his conscience     and his impulses would have made life a torture he also shrank from     the law although southey often told him that he was well fitted for     the higher parts of the profession he had studied military history     with great interest and the strategy of war and he always fancied     that he had talents for command and he at one time thought of a     military life but then he was without connections and he felt if     he were ordered to the west indies his talents would not save him     from the yellow fever and he gave that up memoirs ii 466 it     is curious to fancy wordsworth a soldier certain points of likeness     between him and wellington have often struck me they resemble each     other in practical good sense fidelity to duty courage and also in     a kind of precise uprightness which made their personal character     somewhat uninteresting but what was decorum in wellington was piety     in woidsworth and the entire absence of imagination the great point     of dissimilarity perhaps helped as much as anything to make     wellington a great commander       336 cottle says the sale was so slow and the severity of most of     the reviews so great that its progress to oblivion seemed to be     certain but the notices in the monthly and critical reviews then     the most influential were fair and indeed favorable especially to     wordsworths share in the volume the monthly says so much genius     and originality are discovered in this publication that we wish to     see another from the same hand the critical after saying that in     the whole range of english poetry we scarcely recollect anything     superior to a passage in lines written near tintern abbey sums up     thus yet every piece discovers genius and ill as the author has     frequently employed his talents they certainly rank him with the     best of living poets such treatment cannot surely be called     discouraging       337 a very improbable story of coleridges in the biographia     literaria represents the two friends as having incurred a suspicion     of treasonable dealings with the french enemy by their constant     references to a certain spy nosey the story at least seems to show     how they pronounced the name which was exactly in accordance with     the usage of the last generation in new england       338 wordsworth found as other original minds have since done a     hearing in america sooner than in england james humphreys a     philadelphia bookseller was encouraged by a sufficient list of     subscribers to reprint the first edition of the lyrical ballads the     second english edition however having been published before he had     wholly completed his reprinting was substantially followed in the     first american which was published in 1802       339 some of the weightiest passages in this preface as it is now     printed were inserted without notice of date in the edition of 1815       340 on my alluding to the line        three feet long and two feet wide      and confessing that i dared not read them aloud in company he said     they ought to be liked crabb robinson 9th may 1815 his     ordinary answer to criticisms was that he considered the power to     appreciate the passage criticised as a test of the critics capacity     to judge of poetry at all       341 byron then in his twentieth year wrote a review of these     volumes not on the whole unfair crabb robinson is reported as     saying that wordsworth was indignant at the edinburgh reviews attack     on hours of idleness the young man will do something if he goes     on he said       342 the rev dr wordsworth has encumbered the memory of his uncle     with two volumes of memoirs which for confused dreariness are only     matched by the rev mark nobles history of the protectorate house     of cromwell it is a misfortune that his materials were not put into     the hands of professor reed whose notes to the american edition are     among the most valuable parts of it as they certainly are the     clearest the book contains however some valuable letters of     wordsworth and those relating to this part of his life should be     read by every student of his works for the light they throw upon the     principles which governed him in the composition of his poems in a     letter to lady beaumont may 21 1807 he says trouble not yourself     upon their present reception of what moment is that compared with     what i trust is their destinyto console the afflicted to add     sunshine to daylight by making the happy happier to teach the young     and the gracious of every age to see to think and feel and     therefore to become more actively and securely virtuous this is     their office which i trust they will faithfully perform long after     we that is all that is mortal of us are mouldered in our graves     to conclude my ears are stone dead to this idle buzz of hostile     criticism and my flesh as insensible as iron to these petty stings     and after what i have said i am sure yours will be the same i doubt     not that you will share with me an invincible confidence that my     writings and among them these little poems will cooperate with the     benign tendencies in human nature and society wherever found and     that they will in their degree be efficacious in making men wiser     better and happier here is an odd reversal of the ordinary     relation between an unpopular poet and his little public of admirers     it is he who keeps up their spirits and supplies them with faith     from his own inexhaustible cistern       343 wordsworths pamphlet will fail of producing any general     effect because the sentences are long and involved and his friend     de quincey who corrected the press has rendered them more obscure     by an unusual system of punctuation southey to scott 30th july     1809 the tract is as southey hints heavy       344 the first essay in the third volume of the second

chance seems properly to be the     occurrence of opportunity to one who has neither deserved nor knows     how to use it in such hands it commonly turns to ill luck moores     bermudan appointment is an instance of it wordsworth had a sound     commonsense and practical conscientiousness which enabled him to     fil his office as well as dr franklin could have done a fitter man     could not have been found in westmoreland       347       i am not one who much or oft delight       in personal talk       348 how far he swung backward toward the school under whose     influence he grew up and toward the style against which he had     protested so vigorously a few examples will show the advocate of     the language of common life has a verse in his thanksgiving ode     which if one met with it by itself he would think the achievement     of some later copyist of pope        while the tubed engine the organ feels the inspiring blast      and in the italian itinerant and the swiss goatherd we find a     thermometer or barometer called                the wellwrought scale       whose sentient tube instructs to time       a purpose to a fickle clime      still worse in the eclipse of the

instinctively felt even by his admirers miss     martineau said to crabb robinson in 1839 speaking of wordsworths     conversation sometimes he is annoying from the pertinacity with     which he dwells on trifles at other times he flows on in the utmost     grandeur leaving a strong impression of inspiration robinson tells     us that he read resolution and independence to a lady who was     affected by it even to tears and then said i have not heard     anything for years that so much delighted me but after all it is     not poetry       352 nowhere is this displayed with more comic selfcomplacency than     when he thought it needful to rewrite the ballad of helen of     kirconnela poem hardly to be matched in any language for swiftness     of movement and savage sincerity of feeling its shuddering     compression is masterly compare        curst be the heart that thought the thought       and curst the hand that fired the shot       when in my arms burd helen dropt

his brain are travelling       and starting up to bruces heart         he launched a deadly javelin       fair ellen saw it when it came       and stepping forth to meet the same       did with her body cover       the youth her chosen lover                                                and bruce as soon as he had slain       the gordon sailed away to spain       and fought with rage incessant       against the moorish crescent      these are surely the verses of an attorneys clerk penning a stanza     when he should engross it will be noticed that wordsworth here also     departs from his earlier theory of the language of poetry by     substituting a javelin for a bullet as less modern and familiar had     he written       and gordon never gave a hint       but having somewhat picked his flint       let fly the fatal bullet       that killed that lovely pullet      it would hardly have seemed more like a parody than the rest he     shows the same insensibility in a note upon the ancient mariner in     the second edition of the lyrical ballads the poem of my friend has     indeed great defects first that the principal person has no     distinct character either in his profession of mariner or as a     human being who having been long under the control of supernatural     impressions might be supposed himself to partake of something     supernatural secondly that he does not act but is continually     acted upon thirdly that the events having no necessary connection     do not produce each other and lastly that the imagery is somewhat     laboriously accumulated here is an indictment to be sure and     drawn plainly enough by the attorneys clerk aforenamed one would     think that the strange charm of coleridges most truly original poems     lay in this very emancipation from the laws of cause and effect       353       a hundred times when roving high and low       i have been harassed with the toil of verse       much pains and little progress and at

ellis yarnall who saw him in his eightieth year says these     quotations from his own works he read in a way that much impressed     me it seemed almost as if he were awed by the greatness of his own     power the gifts with which he had been endowed the italics are     mine       355 his best poetry was written when he was under the immediate     influence of coleridge coleridge seems to have felt this for it is     evidently to wordsworth that he alludes when he speaks of those who     have been so well pleased that i should year after year flow with a     hundred nameless rills into their main stream letters     conversations and recollections of stc vol i pp 56     wordsworth found fault with the repetition of the concluding sound     of the participles in shakespeares line about bees        the singing masons building roofs of gold      this he said was a line that milton never would have written keats     thought on the other hand that the repetition was in harmony with     the continued note of the singers leigh hunts autobiography     wordsworth writes to crabb robinson in 1837 my ear is susceptible     to the clashing of sounds almost to disease one cannot help     thinking that his training in these niceties was begun by coleridge       356 in the preface to his translation of the orlando furioso       357 in resolution and independence      milton358  if the biographies of literary men are to assume the bulk which mr masson is giving to that of milton their authors should send a phial of elixir vitae  with the first volume that a purchaser might have some valid assurance of surviving to see the last mr masson has already occupied thirteen hundred and seventyeight pages in getting milton to his thirtyfifth year and an interval of eleven years stretches between the dates of the first and second instalments of his published labors as miltons literary life properly begins at twentyone with the ode on the nativity and as by far the more important part of it lies between the year at which we are arrived and his death at the age of sixtysix we might seem to have the terms given us by which to make a rough reckoning of how soon we are likely to see land but when we recollect the baffling character of the winds and currents we have already encountered and the eddies that may at any time slip us back to the reformation in scotland or the settlement of new england when we consider moreover that miltons life overlapped the grand siècle of french literature with its irresistible temptations to digression and homily for a man of mr massons temperament we may be pardoned if a sigh of doubt and discouragement escape us we envy the secular leisures of methusaleh and are thankful that his biography at least if written in the same longeval proportion is irrecoverably lost to us what a subject would that have been for a person of mr massons spacious predilections even if he himself can count on patriarchal prorogations of existence let him hang a print of the countess of desmond in his study to remind him of the ambushes which fate lays for the toughest of us for myself i have not dared to climb a cherrytree since i began to read his work even with the promise of a speedy third volume before me i feel by no means sure of living to see mary powell back in her husbands house for it is just at this crisis that mr masson with the diabolical art of a practised serial writer leaves us while he goes into an exhaustive account of the westminster assembly and the political and religious notions of the massachusetts puritans one could not help thinking after having got milton fairly through college that he was never more mistaken in his life than when he wrote    how soon hath time that subtle thief of youth   stolen on his wing my threeandtwentieth year  or is it mr masson who has scotched times wheels  it is plain from the preface to the second volume that mr masson himself has an uneasy consciousness that something is wrong and that milton ought somehow to be more than a mere incident of his own biography he tells us that whatever may be thought by a hasty person looking in on the subject from the outside no one can study the life of milton as it ought to be studied without being obliged to study extensively and intimately the contemporary history of england and even incidentally of scotland and ireland too thus on the very compulsion or at least the suasion of the biography a history grew on my hands it was not in human nature to confine the historical inquiries once they were in progress within the precise limits of their demonstrable bearing on the biography even had it been possible to determine these limits beforehand and so the history assumed a coordinate importance with me was pursued often for its own sake and became though always with a sense of organic relation to the biography continuous in itself if a hasty person be one who thinks eleven years rather long to have his button held by a biographer ere he begin his next sentence i take to myself the sting of mr massons covert sarcasm i confess with shame a pusillanimity that is apt to flag if a to be continued do not redeem its promise before the lapse of a quinquennium i could scarce await the autocrat himself so long the heroic age of literature is past and even a duodecimo may often prove too heavy greek oion nun brotoi for the descendants of men to whom the folio was a pastime but what does mr masson mean by continuous to me it seems rather as if his somewhat rambling history of the seventeenth century were interrupted now and then by an unexpected apparition of milton who like paul pry just pops in and hopes he does not intrude to tell us what he has been doing in the mean while the reader immersed in scottish politics or the schemes of archbishop laud is a little puzzled at first but reconciles himself on being reminded that this fairhaired young man is the protagonist of the drama pars minima est ipsa puella sui  if goethe was right in saying that every man was a citizen of his age as well as of his country there can be no doubt that in order to understand the motives and conduct of the man we must first make ourselves intimate with the time in which he lived we have therefore no fault to find with the thoroughness of mr massons historical inquiries the more thorough the better so far as they were essential to the satisfactory performance of his task but it is only such contemporary events opinions or persons as were really operative on the character of the man we are studying that are of consequence and we are to familiarize ourselves with them not so much for the sake of explaining them as of understanding him the biographer especially of a literary man need only mark the main currents of tendency without being officious to trace out to its marshy source every runlet that has cast in its tiny pitcherful with the rest much less should he attempt an analysis of the stream and to classify every component by itself as if each were ever effectual singly and not in combination human motives cannot be thus chemically crossexamined nor do we arrive at any true knowledge of character by such minute subdivision of its ingredients nothing is so essential to a biographer as an eye that can distinguish at a glance between real events that are the levers of thought and action and what donne calls unconcerning things matters of factbetween substantial personages whose contact or even neighborhood is influential and the supernumeraries that serve first to fill up a stage and afterwards the interstices of a biographical dictionary    time hath a wallet at his back   wherein he puts alms for oblivion  let the biographer keep his fingers off that sacred and merciful deposit and not renew for us the bores of a former generation as if we had not enough of our own but if he cannot forbear that unwise inquisitiveness we may fairly complain when he insists on taking us along with him in the processes of his investigation instead of giving us the sifted results in their bearing on the life and character of his subject whether for help or hindrance we are blinded with the dust of old papers ransacked by mr masson to find out that they have no relation whatever to his hero he had been wise if he had kept constantly in view what milton himself says of those who gathered up personal traditions concerning the apostles with less fervency was studied what saint paul or saint john had written than was listened to one that could say here he taught here he stood this was his stature and thus he went habited and o happy this house that harbored him and that cold stone whereon he rested this village where he wrought such a miracle thus while all their thoughts were poured out upon circumstances and the gazing after such men as had sat at table with the apostles  by this means they lost their time and truanted on the fundamental grounds of saving knowledge as was seen shortly in their writings mr masson has so poured out his mind upon circumstances that his work reminds us of allstons picture of elijah in the wilderness where a good deal of research at last enables us to guess at the prophet absconded like a conundrum in the landscape where the very ravens could scarce have found him out except by divine commission the figure of milton becomes but a speck on the enormous canvas crowded with the scenery through which he may by any possibility be conjectured to have passed i will cite a single example of the desperate straits to which mr masson is reduced in order to hitch milton on to his own biography he devotes the first chapter of his second book to the meeting of the long parliament already he tells us in the earlier part of the day the commons had gone through the ceremony of hearing the writ for the parliament read and the names of the members that had been returned called over by thomas wyllys esq the clerk of the crown in chancery his deputy agar miltons brotherinlaw may have been in attendance on such an occasion during the preceding month or two at all events agar and his subordinates in the crown office had been unusually busy with the issue of the writs and with the other work connected with the opening of parliament vol ii p 150 mr massons resolute at all events is very amusing meanwhile    the hungry sheep look up and are not fed  augustine thierry has a great deal to answer for if to him we owe the modern fashion of writing history picturesquely at least his method leads to most unhappy results when essayed by men to whom nature has denied a sense of what the picturesque really is the historical picturesque does not consist in truth of costume and similar accessaries but in the grouping attitude and expression of the figures caught when they are unconscious that the artist is sketching them the moment they are posed for a composition unless by a man of genius the life has gone out of them in the hands of an inferior artist who fancies that imagination is something to be squeezed out of colortubes the past becomes a phantasmagoria of jackboots doublets and flaphats the mere propertyroom of a deserted theatre as if the light had been scenical and illusory the world an unreal thing that vanished with the footlights it is the power of catching the actors in great events at unawares that makes the glimpses given us by contemporaries so vivid and precious and st simon one of the great masters of the picturesque lets us into the secret of his art when he tells us how in that wonderful scene of the death of monseigneur he saw du premier coup doeil vivement porté tout ce qui leur échappoit et tout ce qui les accableroit it is the gift of producing this reality that almost makes us blush as if we had been caught peeping through a keyhole and had surprised secrets to which we had no rightit is this only that can justify the pictorial method of narration mr carlyle has this power of contemporizing himself with bygone times he cheats us to    play with our fancies and believe we see  but we find the tableaux vivants of the apprentices who deal in his command without his power and who compel us to work very hard indeed with our fancies rather wearisome the effort of weaker arms to shoot with his mighty bow has filled the air of recent literature with more than enough fruitless twanging  mr massons style at best cumbrous becomes intolerably awkward when he strives to make up for the want of st simons premier coup doeil by impertinent details of what we must call the pseudodramatic kind for example does hall profess to have traced milton from the university to a suburb sink of london mr masson fancies he hears milton saying to himself a suburb sink has hall or his son taken the trouble to walk all the way down to aldersgate here to peep up the entry where i live and so have an exact notion of my whereabouts there has been plague in the neighborhood certainly and i hope jane yates had my doorstep tidy for the visit does milton answering halls innuendo that he was courting the graces of a rich widow tell us that he would rather choose a virgin of mean fortunes honestly bred mr masson forthwith breaks forth in a paroxysm of what we suppose to be picturesqueness in this wise what have we here surely nothing less if we choose so to construe it than a marriage advertisement ho all ye virgins of england widows need not apply here is an opportunity such as seldom occurs a bachelor unattached age thirtythree years and three or four months height milton by the way would have said highth middle or a little less personal appearance unusually handsome with fair complexion and light auburn hair circumstances independent tastes intellectual and decidedly musical principles rootandbranch was there already any young maiden in whose bosom had such an advertisement come in her way it would have raised a conscious flutter if so did she live near oxford if there is anything worse than an unimaginative man trying to write imaginatively it is a heavy man when he fancies he is being facetious he tramples out the last spark of cheerfulness with the broad damp foot of a hippopotamus  i am no advocate of what is called the dignity of history when it means as it too often does that dulness has a right of sanctuary in gravity too well do i recall the sorrows of my youth when i was shipped in search of knowledge on the long johnsonian swell of the last century favorable to anything but the calm digestion of historic truth i had even then an uneasy suspicion which has ripened into certainty that thoughts were never draped in long skirts like babies if they were strong enough to go alone but surely there should be such a thing as good taste above all a sense of selfrespect in the historian himself that should not allow him to play any tricks with the dignity of his subject a halo of sacredness has hitherto invested the figure of milton and our image of him has dwelt securely in ideal remoteness from the vulgarities of life no diaries no private letters remain to give the idle curiosity of aftertimes the right to force itself on the hallowed seclusion of his reserve that a man whose familiar epistles were written in the language of cicero whose sense of personal dignity was so great that when called on in selfdefence to speak of himself he always does it with an epical stateliness of phrase and whose selfrespect even in youth was so profound that it resembles the reverence paid by other men to a faroff and idealized characterthat he should be treated in this offhand familiar fashion by his biographer seems to us a kind of desecration a violation of good manners no less than of the laws of biographic art milton is the last man in the world to be slapped on the back with impunity better the surly injustice of johnson than such presumptuous friendship as this let the seventeenth century at least be kept sacred from the insupportable foot of the interviewer  but mr masson in his desire to be shall i say idiomatic can do something worse than what has been hitherto quoted he can be even vulgar discussing the motives of miltons first marriage he says did he come seeking his £500 and did mrs powell heave a daughter at him we have heard of a woman throwing herself at a mans head and the image is a somewhat violent one but what is this to mr massons improvement on it it has been sometimes affirmed that the fitness of an image may be tested by trying whether a picture could be made of it or not mr masson has certainly offered a new and striking subject to the historical school of british art a little further on speaking of mary powell he says we have no portrait of her nor any account of her appearance but on the usual rule of the elective affinities of opposites milton being fair we will vote her to have been darkhaired i need say nothing of the good taste of this sentence but its absurdity is heightened by the fact that mr masson himself had left us in doubt whether the match was one of convenience or inclination i know not how it may be with other readers but for myself i feel inclined to resent this hailfellowwellmet manner with its jaunty we will vote in some cases mr massons indecorums in respect of style may possibly be accounted for as attempts at humor by one who has an imperfect notion of its ingredients in such experiments to judge by the effect the pensive element of the compound enters in too large an excess over the hilarious whether i have hit upon the true explanation or whether the cause lie not rather in a besetting velleity of the picturesque and vivid i shall leave the reader to judge by an example or two in the manuscript copy of miltons sonnet in which he claims for his own house the immunity which the memory of pindar and euripides secured for other walls the title had originally been on his door when the city expected an assault milton has drawn a line through this and substituted when the assault was intended to the city mr masson fancies a mood of jest or semijest in the whole affair but we think rather that miltons quiet assumption of equality with two such famous poets was as seriously characteristic as dantes ranking himself sesto tra cotanto senno mr masson takes advantage of the obliterated title to imagine one of prince ruperts troopers entering the poets study and finding some of his antiepiscopal pamphlets that had been left lying about inadvertently oho the cavalier captain might then have said pindar and euripides are all very well by g ive been at college myself and when i meet a gentleman and scholar i hope i know how to treat him but neither pindar nor euripides ever wrote pamphlets against the church of england by g it wont do mr milton this it may be supposed is mr massons way of being funny and dramatic at the same time good taste is shocked with this barbarous dissonance could not the muse defend her son again when charles i at edinburgh in the autumn and winter of 1641 fills the vacant english sees we are told it was more than an insult it was a sarcasm it was as if the king while giving alexander henderson his hand to kiss had winked his royal eye over that reverend presbyters back now one can conceive charles ii winking when he took the solemn league and covenant but never his father under any circumstances he may have been and i believe he was a bad king but surely we may take marvells word for it that    he nothing common did or mean  upon any of the memorable scenes of his life the image is therefore out of all imaginative keeping and vulgarizes the chief personage in a grand historical tragedy who if not a great was at least a decorous actor but mr masson can do worse than this speaking of a mrs katherine chidley who wrote in defence of the independents against thomas edwards he says people wondered who this shebrownist katherine chidley was and did not quite lose their interest in her when they found that she was an oldish woman and a member of some holeandcorner congregation in london indeed she put her nails into mr edwards with some effect why did he not say at once after the good old fashion that she set her ten commandments in his face in another place he speaks of satan standing with his staff around him mr massons style a little robertsonian at best naturally grows worse when forced to condescend to everyday matters he can no more dismount and walk than the man in armor on a lord mayors day it aldersgate street stretches away northwards a full fourth of a mile as one continuous thoroughfare until crossed by long lane and the barbican it parts with the name of aldersgate street and under the new names of goswell street and goswell road completes its tendency towards the suburbs and fields about islington what a noble work might not the directory be if composed on this scale the imagination even of an alderman might well be lost in that full quarter of a mile of continuous thoroughfare mr masson is very great in these passages of civic grandeur but he is more surprising on the whole where he has an image to deal with speaking of miltons twohanded engine in lycidas he says may not milton whatever else he meant have meant a coming english parliament with its two houses whatever he meant his prophecy had come true as he sat among his books in aldersgate street the twohanded engine at the door of the english church was on the swing once twice thrice it had swept its arcs to gather energy now it was on the backmost poise and the blow was to descend one cannot help wishing that mr masson would try his hand on the tenth horn of the beast in revelation or on the time and half a time of daniel there is something so consoling to a prophet in being told that no matter what he meant his prophecy had come true and that he might mean whatever else he pleased so long as he may have meant what we choose to think he did reasoning backward from the assumed fulfilment but perhaps there may be detected in mr massons swept its arcs a little of that prophetic hedgingin vagueness to which he allows so generous a latitude how if the twohanded engine after all were a broom or besom to be more dignified    sweepingvehemently sweeping   no pause admitted no design avowed  like that wielded by the awful shape which dion the syracusan saw i make the suggestion modestly though somewhat encouraged by mr massons system of exegesis which reminds one of the casuists doctrine of probables in virtue of which a man may be probabiliter obligatus and probabiliter deobligatus at the same time but perhaps the most remarkable instance of mr massons figures of speech is where we are told that the king might have established a bona fide government by giving public ascendency to the popular or parliamentary element in his council and inducing the old leaven in it either to accept the new policy or to withdraw and become inactive there is something consoling in the thought that yeast should be accessible to moral suasion it is really too bad that bread should ever be heavy for want of such an appeal to its moral sense as should induce it to accept the new policy of mr massons unhappy infection with the vivid style an instance or two shall be given in justification of what has been alleged against him in that particular he says of london that he was committed to the tower where for more than two months he lay with as near a prospect as ever prisoner had of a chop with the executioners axe on a scaffold on tower hill i may be overfastidious but the word chop offends my ears with its coarseness or if that be too strong has certainly the unpleasant effect of an emphasis unduly placed old auchinlecks saying of cromwell that he gart kings ken they had a lith in their necks is a good example of really vivid phrase suggesting the axe and the block and giving one of those dreadful hints to the imagination which are more powerful than any amount of detail and whose skilful use is the only magic employed by the masters of truly picturesque writing the sentence just quoted will serve also as an example of that tendency to surplusage which adds to the bulk of mr massons sentences at the cost of their effectiveness if he had said simply chop on tower hill if chop there must be it had been quite enough for we all know that the executioners axe and the scaffold are implied in it once more and i have done with the least agreeable part of my business mr masson after telling over again the story of strafford with needless length of detail ends thus on wednesday the 12th of may that proud curly head the casket of that brain of power rolled on the scaffold of tower hill why curly surely it is here a ludicrous impertinence this careful thrusting forward of outward and unmeaning particulars in the hope of giving that reality to a picture which genius only has the art to do is becoming a weariness in modern descriptive writing it reminds one of the mrs jarley expedient of dressing the waxen effigies of murderers in the very clothes they wore when they did the deed or with the real halter round their necks wherewith they expiated it it is probably very effective with the torpid sensibilities of the class who look upon wax figures as works of art true imaginative power works with other material lady macbeth striving to wash away from her hands the damned spot that is all the more there to the mind of the spectator because it is not there at all is a type of the methods it employs and the intensity of their action  having discharged my duty in regard to mr massons faults of manner which i should not have dwelt on so long had they not greatly marred a real enjoyment in the reading and were they not the earmark of a school which has become unhappily numerous i turn to a consideration of his work as a whole i think he made a mistake in his very plan or else was guilty of a misnomer in his title his book is not so much a life of milton as a collection of materials out of which a careful reader may sift the main facts of the poets biography his passion for minute detail is only to be equalled by his diffuseness on points mainly if not altogether irrelevant he gives us a survey of british literature occupying one hundred and twentyeight pages of his first volume written in the main with good judgment and giving the average critical opinion upon nearly every writer great and small who was in any sense a contemporary of milton i have no doubt all this would be serviceable and interesting to mr massons classes in edinburgh university and they may well be congratulated on having so competent a teacher but what it has to do with milton unless in the case of such authors as may be shown to have influenced his style or turn of thought one does not clearly see most readers of a life of milton may be presumed to have some knowledge of the general literary history of the time or at any rate to have the means of acquiring it and miltons manner his style was his own was very little affected by any of the english poets with the single exception in his earlier poems of george wither mr masson also has something to say about everybody from wentworth to the obscurest brownist fanatic who was so much as heard of in england during miltons lifetime if this theory of a biographers duty should hold our grandchildren may expect to see a life of thackeray or who was who in england france and germany during the first half of the nineteenth century these digressions of mr massons from what should have been his main topic he always seems somehow to be completing his tendency towards the suburbs of his subject give him an uneasy feeling that he must get milton in somehow or other at intervals if it were only to remind the reader that he has a certain connection with the book he is eager even to discuss a mere hypothesis though an untenable one if it will only increase the number of pages devoted specially to milton and thus lessen the apparent disproportion between the historical and the biographical matter milton tells us that his morning wont had been to read good authors or cause them to be read till the attention be weary or memory have his full fraught then with useful and generous labors preserving the bodys health and hardiness to render lightsome clear and not lumpish obedience to the mind to the cause of religion and our countrys liberty when it shall require firm hearts in sound bodies to stand and cover their stations rather than see the rum of our protestantism and the enforcement of a slavish life mr masson snatches at the hint this is interesting he says milton it seems has for some time been practising drill the city artillery ground was near did milton among others make a habit of going there of mornings of this more hereafter when mr masson returns to the subject he speaks of miltons all but positive statement  that in the spring of 1642 or a few months before the breaking out of the civil war he was in the habit of spending a part of each day in military exercise somewhere not far from his house in aldersgate street what he puts by way of query on page 402 has become downright certainty seventynine pages further on the passage from miltons tract makes no statement of the kind it pleases mr masson to assume it is merely a miltonian way of saying that he took regular exercise because he believed that moral no less than physical courage demanded a sound body and what proof does mr masson bring to confirm his theory nothing more nor less than two or three passages in paradise lost of which i shall quote only so much as is essential to his argument                                  and now   advanced in view they stand a horrid front   of dreadful length and dazzling arms in guise   of warriors old with ordered spear and shield   awaiting what command their mighty chief   had to impose359  mr masson assures us that there are touches in this description as for example the ordering of arms at the moment of halt and without word of command too exact and technical to have occurred to a mere civilian again at the same review                               he now prepared   to speak whereat their doubled ranks they bend   from wing to wing and half enclose him round   with all his peers attention held them mute360  to the present day this is the very process or one of the processes when a commander wishes to address his men they wheel inward and stand at attention but his main argument is the phrase ported spears in book fourth on which he has an interesting and valuable comment he argues the matter through a dozen pages or more seeking to prove that milton must have had some practical experience of military drill i confess a very grave doubt whether attention and ordered in the passages cited have any other than their ordinary meaning and milton could never have looked on at the pikeexercise without learning what ported meant but be this as it may i will venture to assert that there was not a boy in new england forty years ago who did not know more of the manual than is implied in miltons use of these terms mr massons object in proving milton to have been a proficient in these martial exercises is to increase our wonder at his not entering the army if there was any man in england of whom one might surely have expected that he would be in arms among the parliamentarians he says that man was milton milton may have had many an impulse to turn soldier as all men must in such times but i do not believe that he ever seriously intended it nor is it any matter of reproach that he did not it is plain from his works that he believed himself very early set apart and consecrated for tasks of a very different kind for services demanding as much selfsacrifice and of more enduring result i have no manner of doubt that he like dante believed himself divinely inspired with what he had to utter and if so why not also divinely guided in what he should do or leave undone milton wielded in the cause he loved a weapon far more effective than a sword  it is a necessary result of mr massons method that a great deal of space is devoted to what might have befallen his hero and what he might have seen this leaves a broad margin indeed for the insertion of purely hypothetical incidents nay so desperately addicted is he to what he deems the vivid style of writing that he even goes out of his way to imagine what might have happened to anybody living at the same time with milton having told us fairly enough how shakespeare on his last visit to london perhaps saw milton a fair child of six playing at his fathers door he must needs conjure up an imaginary supper at the mermaid ah what an evening  was that and how ben and shakespeare betongued each other while the others listened and wondered and how when the company dispersed the sleeping street heard their departing footsteps and the stars shone down on the old roofs certainly if we may believe the old song the stars had nothing else to do though their chance of shining in the middle of a london november may perhaps be reckoned very doubtful an author should consider how largely the art of writing consists in knowing what to leave in the inkstand  mr massons volumes contain a great deal of very valuable matter whatever one may think of its bearing upon the life of milton the chapters devoted to scottish affairs are particularly interesting to a student of the great rebellion its causes and concomitants his analyses of the two armies of the parliament and the westminster assembly are sensible additions to our knowledge a too painful thoroughness indeed is the criticism we should make on his work as a biography even as a history the reader might complain that it confuses by the multiplicity of its details while it wearies by want of continuity mr masson lacks the skill of an accomplished storyteller a fact is to him a fact never mind how unessential and he misses the breadth of truth in his devotion to accuracy the very order of his titlepage the life of milton narrated in connection with the political ecclesiastical and literary history of his time shows it should seem a misconception of the true nature of his subject miltons chief importance it might be fairly said his only importance is a literary one his place is fixed as the most classical of our poets  neither in politics theology nor social ethics did milton leave any distinguishable trace on the thought of his time or in the history of opinion in both these lines of his activity circumstances forced upon him the position of a controversialist whose aims and results are by the necessity of the case desultory and ephemeral hooker before him and hobbes after him had a far firmer grasp of fundamental principles than he his studies in these matters were perfunctory and occasional and his opinions were heated to the temper of the times and shaped to the instant exigencies of the forum sometimes to his own convenience at the moment instead of being the slow result of a deliberate judgment enlightened by intellectual and above all historical sympathy with his subject his interest was rather in the occasion than the matter of the controversy no aphorisms of political science are to be gleaned from his writings as from those of burke his intense personality could never so far dissociate itself from the question at issue as to see it in its larger scope and more universal relations he was essentially a doctrinaire ready to sacrifice everything to what at the moment seemed the abstract truth and with no regard to historical antecedents and consequences provided those of scholastic logic were carefully observed he has no respect for usage or tradition except when they count in his favor and sees no virtue in that power of the past over the minds and conduct of men which alone insures the continuity of national growth and is the great safeguard of order and progress the life of a nation was of less importance to him than that it should be conformed to certain principles of belief and conduct burke could distill political wisdom out of history because he had a profound consciousness of the soul that underlies and outlives events and of the national character that gives them meaning and coherence accordingly his words are still living and operative while miltons pamphlets are strictly occasional and no longer interesting except as they illustrate him in the latin ones especially there is an odd mixture of the pedagogue and the public orator his training so far as it was thorough so far indeed as it may be called optional was purely poetical and artistic a true attic bee he made boot on every lip where there was a trace of truly classic honey  milton indeed could hardly have been a match for some of his antagonists in theological and ecclesiastical learning but he brought into the contest a white heat of personal conviction that counted for much his selfconsciousness always active identified him with the cause he undertook i conceived myself to be now not as mine own person but as a member incorporate into that truth whereof i was persuaded and whereof i had declared myself openly to be the partaker361 accordingly it does not so much seem that he is the advocate of puritanism freedom of conscience or the people of england as that all these are he and that he is speaking for himself he was not nice in the choice of his missiles and too often borrows a dirty lump from the dunghill of luther but now and then the gnarled sticks of controversy turn to golden arrows of phoebus in his trembling hands singing as they fly and carrying their messages of doom in music then truly in his prose as in his verse his is the large utterance of the early gods and there is that in him which tramples all learning under his victorious feet from the first he looked upon himself as a man dedicated and set apart he had that sublime persuasion of a divine mission which sometimes lifts his speech from personal to cosmopolitan significance his genius unmistakably asserts itself from time to time calling down fire from heaven to kindle the sacrifice of irksome private duty and turning the hearthstone of an obscure man into an altar for the worship of mankind plainly enough here was a man who had received something other than episcopal ordination mysterious and awful powers had laid their unimaginable hands on that fair head and devoted it to a nobler service yet it must be confessed that with the single exception of the areopagitica miltons tracts are wearisome reading and going through them is like a long seavoyage whose monotony is more than compensated for the moment by a stripe of phosphorescence heaping before you in a drift of starsown snow coiling away behind in winking disks of silver as if the conscious element were giving out all the moonlight it had garnered in its loyal depths since first it gazed upon its pallid regent which being interpreted means that his prose is of value because it is miltons because it sometimes exhibits in an inferior degree the qualities of his verse and not for its power of thought of reasoning or of statement it is valuable where it is best for its inspiring quality like the fervencies of a hebrew prophet the english translation of the bible had to a very great degree judaized not the english mind but the puritan temper those fierce enthusiasts could more easily find elbowroom for their consciences in an ideal israel than in a practical england it was convenient to see amalek or philistia in the men who met them in the field and one unintelligible horn or other of the beast in their theological opponents the spiritual provincialism of the jewish race found something congenial in the english mind their national egotism quintessentialized in the prophets was especially sympathetic with the personal egotism of milton it was only as an inspired and irresponsible person that he could live on decent terms with his own selfconfident individuality there is an intolerant egotism which identifies itself with omnipotence362 and whose sublimity is its apology there is an intolerable egotism which subordinates the sun to the watch in its own fob miltons was of the former kind and accordingly the finest passages in his prose and not the least fine in his verse are autobiographic and this is the more striking that they are often unconsciously so those fallen angels in utter ruin and combustion hurled are also cavaliers fighting against the good old cause philistia is the restoration and what samson did that milton would have done if he could  the areopagitica might seem an exception but that also is a plea rather than an argument and his interest in the question is not one of abstract principle but of personal relation to himself he was far more rhetorician than thinker the sonorous amplitude of his style was better fitted to persuade the feelings than to convince the reason the only passages from his prose that may be said to have survived are emotional not argumentative or they have lived in virtue of their figurative beauty not their weight of thought miltons power lay in dilation touched by him the simplest image the most obvious thought                    dilated stood   like teneriffe or atlas    nor wanted in his grasp   what seemed both spear and shield  but the thin stiletto of macchiavelli is a more effective weapon than these fantastic arms of his he had not the secret of compression that properly belongs to the political thinker on whom as hazlitt said of himself nothing but abstract ideas makes any impression almost every aphoristic phrase that he has made current is borrowed from some one of the classics like his famous    license they mean when they cry liberty  from tacitus this is no reproach to him so far as his true function that of poet is concerned it is his peculiar glory that literature was with him so much an art an end and not a means of his political work he has himself told us i should not choose this manner of writing wherein knowing myself inferior to myself led by the genial power of nature to another task i have the use as i may account but of my left hand  mr masson has given an excellent analysis of these writings selecting with great judgment the salient passages which have an air of blankverse thinly disguised as prose like some of the corrupted passages of shakespeare we are particularly thankful to him for his extracts from the pamphlets written against milton especially for such as contain criticisms on his style it is not a little interesting to see the most stately of poets reproached for his use of vulgarisms and low words we seem to get a glimpse of the schooling of his choiceful sense to that nicety which could not be content till it had made his native tongue search all her coffers round one cannot help thinking also that his practice in prose especially in the long involutions of latin periods helped him to give that variety of pause and that majestic harmony to his blankverse which have made it so unapproachably his own landor who like milton seems to have thought in latin has caught somewhat more than others of the dignity of his gait but without his length of stride wordsworth at his finest has perhaps approached it but with how long an interval bryant has not seldom attained to its serene equanimity but never emulates its pomp keats has caught something of its large utterance but altogether fails of its nervous severity of phrase cowpers muse that moved with such graceful ease in slippers becomes stiff when in his translation of homer she buckles on her feet the cothurnus of milton thomson grows tumid wherever he assays the grandiosity of his model it is instructive to get any glimpse of the slow processes by which milton arrived at that classicism which sets him apart from if not above all our other poets  in gathering up the impressions made upon us by mr massons work as a whole we are inclined rather to regret his copiousness for his own sake than for ours the several parts though disproportionate are valuable his research has been conscientious and he has given us better means of understanding miltons time than we possessed before but how is it about milton himself here was a chance it seems to me for a fine bit of portraitpainting there is hardly a more stately figure in literary history than miltons no life in some of its aspects more tragical except dantes in both these great poets more than in any others the character of the men makes part of the singular impressiveness of what they wrote and of its vitality with after times in them the man somehow overtops the author the works of both are full of autobiographical confidences like dante milton was forced to become a party by himself he stands out in marked and solitary individuality apart from the great movement of the civil war apart from the supine acquiescence of the restoration a selfopinionated unforgiving and unforgetting man very much alive he certainly was in his day has mr masson made him alive to us again i fear not at the same time while we cannot praise either the style or the method of mr massons work we cannot refuse to be grateful for it it is not so much a book for the ordinary reader of biography as for the student and will be more likely to find its place on the libraryshelf than the centretable it does not in any sense belong to light literature but demands all the muscle of the trained and vigorous reader truly in respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is miltons life it is naught  mr massons intimacy with the facts and dates of miltons career renders him peculiarly fit in some respects to undertake an edition of the poetical works his edition accordingly has distinguished merits the introductions to the several poems are excellent and leave scarcely anything to be desired the general introduction on the other hand contains a great deal that might well have been omitted and not a little that is positively erroneous mr massons discussions of miltons english seem often to be those of a scotsman to whom english is in some sort a foreign tongue it is almost wholly inconclusive because confined to the miltonic verse while the basis of any altogether satisfactory study should surely be the miltonic prose nay should include all the poetry and prose of his own age and of that immediately preceding it the uses to which mr masson has put the concordance to miltons poems tempt one sometimes to class him with those whom the poet himself taxed with being the mousehunts and ferrets of an index for example what profits a discussion of miltons greek hapax legomena a matter in which accident is far more influential than choice363 what sensible addition is made to our stock of knowledge by learning that the word woman does not occur in any form in miltons poetry before paradise lost and that it is exactly so with the word female is it any way remarkable that such words as adam god heaven hell paradise sin satan and serpent should occur very frequently in paradise lost would it not rather have been surprising that they should not such trifles at best come under the head of what old warner would have called cumberminds it is time to protest against this minute style of editing and commenting great poets gullivers microscopic eye saw on the fair skins of the brobdignagian maids of honor a mole here and there as broad as a trencher and we shrink from a cup of the purest hippocrene after the critics solar microscope has betrayed to us the grammatical syntactical and above all hypothetical monsters that sprawl in every drop of it when a poet has been so much edited as milton the temptation of whosoever undertakes a new edition to see what is not to be seen becomes great in proportion as he finds how little there is that has not been seen before  mr masson is quite right in choosing to modernize the spelling of milton for surely the reading of our classics should be made as little difficult as possible and he is right also in making an exception of such abnormal forms as the poet may fairly be supposed to have chosen for melodic reasons his exhaustive discussion of the spelling of the original editions seems however to be the less calledfor as he himself appears to admit that the compositor not the author was supreme in these matters and that in nine hundred and ninetynine cases to the thousand milton had no system but spelt by immediate inspiration yet mr masson fills nearly four pages with an analysis of the vowel sounds in which as if to demonstrate the futility of such attempts so long as mens ears differ he tells us that the short a sound is the same in man and darby the short o sound in god and does and what he calls the long o sound in broad and wrath speaking of the apostrophe mr masson tells us that it is sometimes inserted not as a possessive mark at all but merely as a plural mark heros for heroes myrtles for myrtles gorgons and hydras etc now in books printed about the time of miltons the apostrophe was put in almost at random and in all the cases cited is a misprint except in the first where it serves to indicate that the pronunciation was not heróës as it had formerly been364 in the possessive singular of nouns already ending in s mr masson tells us miltons general practice is not to double the s thus nereus wrinkled look glaucus spell the necessities of metre would naturally constrain to such forms in a possessive followed by the word sake or the word side dislike to of the double sibilant makes us sometimes drop the inflection in addition to for righteousness sake such phrases as for thy name sake and for mercy sake are allowed to pass bedside is normal and riverside nearly so the necessities of metre need not be taken into account with a poet like milton who never was fairly in his element till he got off the soundings of prose and felt the long swell of his verse under him like a steed that knows his rider but does the dislike of the double sibilant account for the dropping of the s in these cases is it not far rather the presence of the s already in the sound satisfying an ear accustomed to the english slovenliness in the pronunciation of double consonants it was this which led to such forms as conscience sake and on justice side and which beguiled ben jonson and dryden into thinking the one that noise and the other that corps was a plural365 what does mr masson say to hillside bankside seaside cheapside spindleside spearside gospelside of a church nightside countryside wayside brookside and i know not how many more is the first half of these words a possessive or is it not rather a noun impressed into the service as an adjective how do such words differ from hilltop townend candlelight rushlight cityman and the like where no double s can be made the scapegoat certainly milton would not have avoided them for their sibilancy he who wrote    and airy tongues that syllable mens names   on sands and shores and desert wildernesses    so in his seed all nations shall be blest    and seat of salmanasser whose success  verses that hiss like medusas head in wrath and who was i think fonder of the sound than any other of our poets indeed in compounds of the kind we always make a distinction wholly independent of the doubled s nobody would boggle at mountainside no one would dream of saying on the fatherside or motherside  mr masson speaks of the miltonic forms vanquisht markt lookt etc surely he does not mean to imply that these are peculiar to milton chapman used them before milton was born and pressed them farther as in nakt and saft for naked and saved he often prefers the contracted form in his prose also showing that the full form of the past participle in ed was passing out of fashion though available in verse366 indeed i venture to affirm that there is not a single variety of spelling or accent to be found in milton which is without example in his predecessors or contemporaries even highth which is thought peculiarly miltonic is common in hakluyt for example and still often heard in new england mr masson gives an odd reason for miltons preference of it  as indicating more correctly the formation of the word by the addition of the suffix th to the adjective high is an adjective then at the base of growth earth birth truth and other words of this kind horne tooke made a better guess than this if mr masson be right in supposing that a peculiar meaning is implied in the spelling bearth paradise lost ix 624 which he interprets as collective produce though in the only other instance where it occurs it is neither more nor less than birth it should seem that milton had hit upon horne tookes etymology but it is really solemn trifling to lay any stress on the spelling of the original editions after having admitted as mr masson has honestly done that in all likelihood milton had nothing to do with it and yet he cannot refrain on the word voutsafe he hangs nearly a page of dissertation on the nicety of miltons ear mr masson thinks that milton must have had a reason for it367 and finds that reason in his dislike to of the sound ch or to of that sound combined with s his fine ear taught him not only to seek for musical effects and cadences at large but also to be fastidious as to syllables and to avoid harsh or difficult conjunctions of consonants except when there might be a musical reason for harshness or difficulty in the management of the letter s the frequency of which in english is one of the faults of the speech he will be found i believe most careful and skilful more rarely i think than in shakespeare will one word ending in s be found followed immediately in milton by another word beginning with the same letter or if he does occasionally pen such a phrase as moabs sons it will be difficult to find in him i believe such a harsher example as earths substance of which many writers would think nothing with the index to back him mr masson could safely say this the same delicacy of ear is even more apparent in his management of the sh sound he has it often of course but it may be noted that he rejects it in his verse when he can he writes basan for bashan sittim for shittim silo for shiloh asdod for ashdod still more however does he seem to have been wary of the compound sound ch as in church of his sensitiveness to this sound in excess there is a curious proof in his prose pamphlet entitled an apology against a pamphlet called a modest completion etc where having occasion to quote these lines from one of the satires368 of his opponent bishop hall    teach each hollow grove to sound his love   wearying echo with one changeless word  he adds ironically and so he well might and all his auditory besides with his teach each generalizations are always risky but when extemporized from a single hint they are maliciously so surely it needed no great sensitiveness of ear to be set on edge by halls echo of teach each did milton reject the h from bashan and the rest because he disliked the sound of sh or because he had found it already rejected by the vulgate and by some of the earlier translators of the bible into english oddly enough milton uses words beginning with sh seven hundred and fifty four times in his poetry not to speak of others in which the sound occurs as for instance those ending in tion hall had he lived long enough might have retorted on milton his own           manliest resolutest breast   as the magnetick hardest iron draws  or his              what moves thy inquisition   knowst thou not that my rising is thy fall   and my promotion thy destruction  with the playful controversial wit of the day he would have hinted that too much estest is as fatal to a blankverse as to a bishop and that danger was often incurred by those who too eagerly shunned it nay he might even have found an echo almost tallying with his own in           to begirt the almighty throne   beseeching or besieging  a pun worthy of miltons worst prose or he might have twitted him with a sequent king who seeks as for the sh sound a poet could hardly have found it ungracious to his ear who wrote    gnashing for anguish and despite and shame  or again                                 then bursting forth   afresh with conscious terrors vex me round   that rest or intermission none i find   before mine eyes in opposition sits   grim death my son  and if milton disliked the ch sound he gave his ears unnecessary pain by verses such as these    straight couches close then rising changes oft   his couchant watch as one who chose his ground  still more by such a juxtaposition as matchless chief369 the truth is that milton was a harmonist rather than a melodist there are no doubt some exquisite melodies like the sabrina fair  among his earlier poems as could hardly fail to be the case in an age which produced or trained the authors of our best english glees as ravishing in their instinctive felicity as the songs of our dramatists but he also showed from the first that larger style which was to be his peculiar distinction the strain heard in the nativity ode in the solemn music and in lycidas is of a higher mood as regards metrical construction than anything that had thrilled the english ear before giving no uncertain augury of him who was to show what sonorous metal lay silent till he touched the keys in the epical organpipes of our various language that have never since felt the strain of such prevailing breath it was in the larger movements of metre that milton was great and original i have spoken elsewhere of spensers fondness for dilatation as respects thoughts and images in milton it extends to the language also and often to the single words of which a period is composed he loved phrases of towering port in which every member dilated stands like teneriffe or atlas in those poems and passages that stamp him great the verses do not dance interweaving to soft lydian airs but march rather with resounding tread and clang of martial music it is true that he is cunning in alliterations so scattering them that they tell in his orchestra without being obvious but it is in the more scientific region of openvoweled assonances which seem to proffer rhyme and yet withhold it rhymewraiths one might call them that he is an artist and a master he even sometimes introduces rhyme with misleading intervals between and unobviously in his blankverse    there rest if any rest can harbour there   and reassembling our afflicted powers   consult how we may henceforth most offend   our enemy our own loss how repair   how overcome this dire calamity   what reinforcement we may gain from hope   if not what resolution from despair370  there is one almost perfect quatrain    before thy fellows ambitious to win   from me some plume that thy success may show   destruction to the rest this pause between   unanswered lest thou boast to let thee know  and another hardly less so of a rhyme and an assonance    if once they hear that voice their liveliest pledge   of hope in fears and dangers heard so oft   in worst extremes and on the perilous edge   of battle when it raged in all assaults  there can be little doubt that the rhymes in the first passage cited were intentional and perhaps they were so in the others but miltons ear has tolerated not a few perfectly rhyming couplets and others in which the assonance almost becomes rhyme certainly a fault in blankverse    from the asian kings and parthian among these   from india and the golden chersonese    that soon refreshed him wearied and repaired   what hunger if aught hunger had impaired    and will alike be punished whether thou   reign or reign not though to that gentle brow    of pleasure but all pleasure to destroy   save what is in destroying other joy    shall all be paradise far happier place   than this of eden and far happier days    this my long sufferance and my day of grace   they who neglect and scorn shall never taste    so far remote with diminution seen   first in his east the glorious lamp was seen371  these examples and others might be adduced serve to show that miltons ear was too busy about the larger interests of his measures to be always careful of the lesser he was a strategist rather than a drillsergeant in verse capable beyond any other english poet of putting great masses through the most complicated evolutions without clash or confusion but he was not curious that every foot should be at the same angle in reading paradise lost one has a feeling of vastness you float under an illimitable sky brimmed with sunshine or hung with constellations the abysses of space are about you you hear the cadenced surges of an unseen ocean thunders mutter round the horizon and if the scene change it is with an elemental movement like the shifting of mighty winds his imagination seldom condenses like shakespeares in the kindling flash of a single epithet but loves better to diffuse itself witness his descriptions wherein he seems to circle like an eagle bathing in the blue streams of air controlling with his eye broad sweeps of champaign or of sea and rarely fulmining in the sudden swoop of intenser expression he was fonder of the vague perhaps i should rather say the indefinite where more is meant than meets the ear than any other of our poets he loved epithets like old and far that suggest great reaches whether of space or time this bias shows itself already in his earlier poems as where he hears    the far off curfew sound   over some widewatered shore  or where he fancies the shores372 and sounding seas washing lycidas far away but it reaches its climax in the paradise lost he produces his effects by dilating our imaginations with an impalpable hint rather than by concentrating them upon too precise particulars thus in a famous comparison of his the fleet has no definite port but plies stemming nightly toward the pole in a wide ocean of conjecture he generalizes always instead of specifyingthe true secret of the ideal treatment in which he is without peer and though everywhere grandiose he is never turgid tasso begins finely with    chiama gli abitator dell ombre eterne   ii rauco suon della tartarea tromba   treman le spaziose atre caverne   e laer cieco a quel rumor rimbomba  but soon spoils all by condescending to definite comparisons with thunder and intestinal convulsions of the earth in other words he is unwary enough to give us a standard of measurement and the moment you furnish imagination with a yardstick she abdicates in favor of her statistical poorrelation commonplace milton with this passage in his memory is too wise to hamper himself with any statement for which he can be brought to book but wraps himself in a mist of looming indefiniteness    he called so loud that all the hollow deep   of hell resounded  thus amplifying more nobly by abstention from his usual method of prolonged evolution no caverns however spacious will serve his turn because they have limits he could practise this selfdenial when his artistic sense found it needful whether for variety of verse or for the greater intensity of effect to be gained by abruptness his more elaborate passages have the multitudinous roll of thunder dying away to gather a sullen force again from its own reverberations but he knew that the attention is recalled and arrested by those claps that stop short without echo and leave us listening there are no such vistas and avenues of verse as his in reading the paradise lost one has a feeling of spaciousness such as no other poet gives miltons respect for himself and for his own mind and its movements rises wellnigh to veneration he prepares the way for his thought and spreads on the ground before the sacred feet of his verse tapestries inwoven with figures of mythology and romance there is no such unfailing dignity as his observe at what a reverent distance he begins when he is about to speak of himself as at the beginning of the third book and the seventh his sustained strength is especially felt in his beginnings he seems always to start fullsail the wind and tide always serve there is never any fluttering of the canvas in this he offers a striking contrast with wordsworth who has to go through with a great deal of yoheaveohing before he gets under way and though in the didactic parts of paradise lost the wind dies away sometimes there is a long swell that will not let us forget it and ever and anon some eminent verse lifts its long ridge above its tamer peers heaped with stormy memories and the poem never becomes incoherent we feel all through it as in the symphonies of beethoven a great controlling reason in whose safeconduct we trust implicitly  mr massons discussions of miltons english are it seems to me for the most part unsatisfactory he occupies some ten pages for example with a history of the genitival form its which adds nothing to our previous knowledge on the subject and which has no relation to milton except for its bearing on the authorship of some verses attributed to him against the most overwhelming internal evidence to the contrary mr masson is altogether too resolute to find traces of what he calls oddly enough recollectiveness of latin constructions in milton and scents them sometimes in what would seem to the uninstructed reader very idiomatic english more than once at least he has fancied them by misunderstanding the passage in which they seem to occur thus in paradise lost xi 520 521    therefore so abject is their punishment   disfiguring not gods likeness but their own  has no analogy with eorum deformantium for the context shows that it is the punishment which disfigures indeed mr masson so often finds constructions difficult ellipses strange and words needing annotation that are common to all poetry nay sometimes to all english that his notes seem not seldom to have been written by a foreigner on this passage in comus   i do not think my sister so to seek   or so unprincipled in virtues book   and the sweet peace that virtue bosoms ever   as that the single want of light and noise                                        not being in danger as i trust she is not   could stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts  mr masson tells us that in very strict construction not being would cling to want as its substantive but the phrase passes for the latin ablative absolute so on the words forestalling night i e anticipating forestall is literally to anticipate the market by purchasing goods before they are brought to the stall in the verse    thou hast immanacled while heaven sees good  he explains that while here has the sense of so long as but mr massons notes on the language are his weakest he is careful to tell us for example that there are instances of the use of shine as a substantive in spenser ben jonson and other poets it is but another way of spelling sheen and if mr masson never heard a shoeblack in the street say shall i give you a shine sir his experience has been singular373 his notes in general are very good though too long those on the astronomy of milton are particularly valuable i think he is sometimes a little too scornful of parallel passages374 for if there is one thing more striking than another in this poet it is that his great and original imagination was almost wholly nourished by books perhaps i should rather say set in motion by them it is wonderful how from the most withered and juiceless hint gathered in his reading his grand images rise like an exhalation how from the most battered old lamp caught in that huge dragnet with which he swept the waters of learning he could conjure a tall genius to build his palaces whatever he touches swells and towers that wonderful passage in comus of the airy tongues perhaps the most imaginative in suggestion he ever wrote was conjured out of a dry sentence in purchass abstract of marco polo such examples help us to understand the poet when i find that sir thomas browne had said before milton that adam was the wisest of all men since i am glad to find this link between the most profound and the most stately imagination of that age such parallels sometimes give a hint also of the historical development of our poetry of its apostolical succession so to speak every one has noticed miltons fondness of sonorous proper names which have not only an acquired imaginative value by association and so serve to awaken our poetic sensibilities but have likewise a merely musical significance this he probably caught from marlowe traces of whom are frequent in him there is certainly something of what afterwards came to be called miltonic in more than one passage of tamburlaine a play in which gigantic force seems struggling from the block as in michel angelos dawn  mr massons remarks on the versification of milton are in the main judicious but when he ventures on particulars one cannot always agree with him he seems to understand that our prosody is accentual merely and yet when he comes to what he calls variations he talks of the substitution of the trochee the pyrrhic or the spondee for the regular iambus or of the anapaest the dactyl the tribrach etc for the same this is always misleading the shift of the accent in what mr masson calls dissyllabic variations is common to all pentameter verse and in the other case most of the words cited as trisyllables either were not so in miltons day375 or were so or not at choice of the poet according to their place in the verse there is not an elision of miltons without precedent in the dramatists from whom he learned to write blankverse milton was a greater metrist than any of them except marlowe and shakespeare and he employed the elision or the slur oftener than they to give a faint undulation or retardation to his verse only because his epic form demanded it more for varietys sake how milton would have read them is another question he certainly often marked them by an apostrophe in his manuscripts he doubtless composed according to quantity so far as that is possible in english and as cowper somewhat extravagantly says gives almost as many proofs of it in his paradise lost as there are lines in the poem376 but when mr masson tells us that    selffed and selfconsumed if this fail  and    dwells in all heaven charity so rare  are only nine syllables and that in    created hugest that swim the oceanstream  either the third foot must be read as an anapaest or the word hugest must be pronounced as one syllable hugst i think milton would have invoked the soul of sir john cheek of course milton read it    created hugest that swim th oceanstream  just as he wrote if we may trust mr massons facsimile    thus sang the uncouth swain to th oaks and rills  a verse in which both hiatus and elision occur precisely as in the italian poets377  gest that swim would be rather a knotty anapaest an insupportable foot indeed and why is even hugst worse than shakespeares    youngst follower of thy drum  in the same way he says of    for we have also our evening and our morn  that the metre of this line is irregular and of the rapidly fine    came flying and in mid air aloud thus cried  that it is a line of unusual metre  why more unusual than    as being the contrary to his high will  what would mr masson say to these three verses from dekkar    and knowing so much i muse thou art so poor    i fan away the dust flying in mine eyes    flowing oer with court news only of you and them  all such participles where no consonant divided the vowels were normally of one syllable permissibly of two378 if mr masson had studied the poets who preceded milton as he has studied him he would never have said that the verse    not this rock only his omnipresence fills  was peculiar as having a distinct syllable of overmeasure he retains miltons spelling of hunderd without perceiving the metrical reason for it that d t p b c followed by l or r might be either of two or of three syllables in marlowe we find it both ways in two consecutive verses    a hundred hundered and fifty thousand horse   two hundred thousand foot brave men at arms379  mr masson is especially puzzled by verses ending in one or more unaccented syllables and even argues in his introduction that some of them might be reckoned alexandrines he cites some lines of spenser as confirming his theory forgetting that rhyme wholly changes the conditions of the case by throwing the accent appreciably even now but more emphatically in spensers day on the last syllable    a spirit and judgment equal or superior  he calls a remarkably anomalous line consisting of twelve or even thirteen syllables surely miltons ear would never have tolerated a dissyllabic spirit in such a position the word was then more commonly of one syllable though it might be two and was accordingly spelt spreet still surviving in sprite sprit and even spirt as milton himself spells it in one of mr massons facsimiles380 shakespeare in the verse    hath put a spirit of youth in everything  uses the word admirably well in a position where it cannot have a metrical value of more than one syllable while it gives a dancing movement to the verse in keeping with the sense our old metrists were careful of elasticity a quality which modern verse has lost in proportion as our language has stiffened into uniformity under the benumbing fingers of pedants  this discussion of the value of syllables is not so trifling as it seems a great deal of nonsense has been written about imperfect measures in shakespeare and of the admirable dramatic effect produced by filling up the gaps of missing syllables with pauses or prolongations of the voice in reading in rapid abrupt and passionate dialogue this is possible but in passages of continuously level speech it is barbarously absurd i do not believe that any of our old dramatists has knowingly left us a single imperfect verse seeing in what a haphazard way and in how mutilated a form their plays have mostly reached us we should attribute such faults as a geologist would call them to anything rather than to the deliberate design of the poets marlowe and shakespeare the two best metrists among them have given us a standard by which to measure what licenses they took in versificationthe one in his translations the other in his poems the unmanageable verses in milton are very few and all of them occur in works printed after his blindness had lessened the chances of supervision and increased those of error there are only two indeed which seem to me wholly indigestible as they stand these are    burnt after them to the bottomless pit  and    with them from bliss to the bottomless deep  this certainly looks like a case where a word had dropped out or had been stricken out by some proofreader who limited the number of syllables in a pentameter verse by that of his fingerends mr masson notices only the first of these lines and says that to make it regular by accenting the word bottomless on the second syllable would be too horrible certainly not if milton so accented it any more than blasphémous and twenty more which sound oddly to us now however that may be milton could not have intended to close not only a period but a paragraph also with an unmusical verse and in the only other passage where the word occurs it is accented as now on the first syllable    with hideous ruin and combustion down   to bottomless perdition there to dwell  as bottom is a word which like bosom and besom may be monosyllabic or dissyllabic according to circumstances i am persuaded that the last passage quoted and all three refer to the same event gives us the word wanting in the two others and that milton wrote or meant to write    burnt after them down to the bottomless pit  which leaves in the verse precisely the kind of ripple that milton liked best381  much of what mr masson says in his introduction of the way in which the verses of milton should be read is judicious enough though some of the examples he gives of the comicality which would ensue from compressing every verse into an exact measure of ten syllables are based on a surprising ignorance of the laws which guided our poets just before and during miltons time in the structure of their verses thus he seems to think that a strict scansion would require us in the verses    so he with difficulty and labor hard  and    carnation purple azure or specked with gold  to pronounce diffikty and purp though mr masson talks of slurs and elisions his ear would seem somewhat insensible to their exact nature or office his diffikty supposes a hiatus where none is intended and his making purple of one syllable wrecks the whole verse the real slur in the latter case being on azure or382 when he asks whether milton required these pronunciations in his verse no positive answer can be given but i very much doubt whether he would have thought that some of the lines mr masson cites remain perfectly good blank verse even with the most leisurely natural enunciation of the spare syllable and i am sure he would have stared if told that the number of accents in a pentameter verse was variable it may be doubted whether elisions and compressions which would be thought in bad taste or even vulgar now were more abhorrent to the ears of miltons generation than to a cultivated italian would be the hearing dante read as prose after all what mr masson says may be reduced to the infallible axiom that poetry should be read as poetry  mr masson seems to be right in his main principles but the examples he quotes make one doubt whether he knows what a verse is for example he thinks it would be a horror if in the verse    that invincible samson far renowned  we should lay the stress on the first syllable of invincible it is hard to see why this should be worse than cónventicle or rémonstrance or súccessor or incómpatible the three latter used by the correct daniel or why mr masson should clap an accent on surfàce merely because it comes at the end of a verse and deny it to ínvincible if one read the verse just cited with those that go with it he will find that the accent must come on the first syllable of invincible or else the whole passage becomes chaos383 should we refuse to say obleeged with pope because the fashion has changed from its apparently greater freedom in skilful hands blankverse gives more scope to sciolistic theorizing and dogmatism than the rhyming pentameter couplet but it is safe to say that no verse is good in the one that would not be good in the other when handled by a master like dryden milton like other great poets wrote some bad verses and it is wiser to confess that they are so than to conjure up some unimaginable reason why the reader should accept them as the better for their badness such a bad verse is    rocks caves lakes fens bogs dens and shapes of death  which might be cited to illustrate popes    and ten low words oft creep in one dull line  milton cannot certainly be taxed with any partiality for low words he rather loved them tall as the prussian king loved men to be six feet high in their stockings and fit to go into the grenadiers he loved them as much for their music as for their meaningperhaps more his style therefore when it has to deal with commoner things is apt to grow a little cumbrous and unwieldy a persian poet says that when the owl would boast he boasts of catching mice at the edge of a hole shakespeare would have understood this milton would have made him talk like an eagle his influence is not to be left out of account as partially contributing to that decline toward poetic diction which was already beginning ere he died if it would not be fair to say that he is the most artistic he may be called in the highest sense the most scientific of our poets if to spenser younger poets have gone to be sungto they have sat at the feet of milton to be taught our language has no finer poem than samson agonistes if any so fine in the quality of austere dignity or in the skill with which the poets personal experience is generalized into a classic tragedy  gentle as miltons earlier portraits would seem to show him he had in him by nature or bred into him by fate something of the haughty and defiant selfassertion of dante and michel angelo in no other english author is the man so large a part of his works miltons haughty conception of himself enters into all he says and does always the necessity of this one man became that of the whole human race for the moment there were no walls so sacred but must go to the ground when he wanted elbowroom and he wanted a great deal did mary powell the cavaliers daughter find the abode of a roundhead schoolmaster incompatible and leave it forthwith the cry of the universe was for an easier dissolution of the marriage covenant if he is blind it is with excess of light it is a divine partiality an overshadowing with angels wings phineus and teiresias are admitted among the prophets because they too had lost their sight and the blindness of homer is of more account than his iliad after writing in rhyme till he was past fifty he finds it unsuitable for his epic and it at once becomes the invention of a barbarous age to set off wretched matter and lame metre if the structure of his mind be undramatic why then the english drama is naught learned jonson sweetest shakespeare and the rest notwithstanding and he will compose a tragedy on a greek model with the blinded samson for its hero and he will compose it partly in rhyme plainly he belongs to the intenser kind of men whose yesterdays are in no way responsible for their tomorrows and this makes him perennially interesting even to those who hate his politics despise his socinianism and find his greatest poem a bore a new edition of his poems is always welcome for as he is really great he presents a fresh side to each new student and mr masson in his three handsome volumes has given us with much that is superfluous and even erroneous much more that is a solid and permanent acquisition to our knowledge  it results from the almost scornful withdrawal of milton into the fortress of his absolute personality that no great poet is so uniformly selfconscious as he we should say of shakespeare that he had the power of transforming himself into everything of milton that he had that of transforming everything into himself dante is individual rather than selfconscious and he the castiron man grows pliable as a field of grain at the breath of beatrice and flows away in waves of sunshine but milton never let himself go for a moment as other poets are possessed by their theme so is he selfpossessed his great theme being john milton and his great duty that of interpreter between him and the world i say it with all respect for he was well worthy translation and it is out of hebrew that the version is made pope says he makes god the father reason like a school divine the criticism is witty but inaccurate he makes deity a mouthpiece for his present theology and had the poem been written a few years later the almighty would have become more heterodox since dante no one had stood on these visiting terms with heaven  now it is precisely this audacity of selfreliance i suspect which goes far toward making the sublime and which falling by a hairsbreadth short thereof makes the ridiculous puritanism showed both the strength and weakness of its prophetic nurture enough of the latter to be scoffed out of england by the very men it had conquered in the field enough of the former to intrench itself in three or four immortal memories it has left an abiding mark in politics and religion but its great monuments are the prose of bunyan and the verse of milton it is a high inspiration to be the neighbor of great events to have been a partaker in them and to have seen noble purposes by their own selfconfidence become the very means of ignoble ends if it do not wholly depress may kindle a passion of regret deepening the song which dares not tell the reason of its sorrow the grand loneliness of milton in his latter years while it makes him the most impressive figure in our literary history is reflected also in his maturer poems by a sublime independence of human sympathy like that with which mountains fascinate and rebuff us but it is idle to talk of the loneliness of one the habitual companions of whose mind were the past and future i always seem to see him leaning in his blindness a hand on the shoulder of each sure that the one will guard the song which the other had inspired     footnotes      358 the life of john milton narrated in connection with

horse for horses is another example so by a     reverse process pult and shay have been vulgarly deduced from the     supposed plurals pulse and chaise       366 chapmans spelling is presumably his own at least he looked     after his printed texts i have two copies of his byrons     conspiracy both dated 1608 but one evidently printed later than     the other for it shows corrections the more solemn ending in ed     was probably kept alive by the reading of the bible in churches     though now dropped by the clergy it is essential to the right     hearing of the more metrical passages in the old testament which are     finer and more scientiflc than anything in the language unless it be     some parts of samson agonistes i remember an old gentleman who     always used the contracted form of the participle in conversation     but always gave it back its embezzled syllable in reading sir thomas     browne seems to have preferred the more solemn form at any rate he     has the spelling empuzzeled in prose       367 he thinks the same of the variation strook and struck     though they were probably pronounced alike in marlowes faustus     two consecutive sentences in prose begin with the words cursed be     he that struck in a note on the passage mr dyce tells us that the     old editions there were three have stroke and strooke in the     first instance and all agree on strucke in the second no     inference can be drawn from such casualties       368 the lines are not from one of the satires and milton made     them worse by misquoting and bringing love jinglingly near to     grove halls verse in his satires is always vigorous and often     harmonious he long before milton spoke of rhyme almost in the very     terms of the preface to paradise lost       369 mr masson goes so far as to conceive it possible that milton     may have committed the vulgarism of leaving a t out of slepst     for ease of sound yet the poet could bear boastst andone     stares and gasps at itdoatdst there is by the way a familiar     passage in which the ch sound predominates not without a touch of     sh in a single couplet        can any mortal mixture of earths mould       breathe such divine enchanting ravishment      so        blotches and blains must all his flesh emboss      and perhaps                 i see his tents       pitched about sechem     might be added       370 i think coleridges nice ear would have blamed the nearness of     enemy and calamity in this passage mr masson leaves out the     comma after if not the pause of which is needful i think to the     sense and certainly to keep not a little farther apart from     what teach each       371 first in his east is not soothing to the ear       372 there seems to be something wrong in this word shores did     milton write shoals       373 but his etymological notes are worse for example recreant     renouncing the faith from the old french recroire which again is     from the mediaeval latin recredere to believe back or     apostatize this is pure fancy the word had no such meaning in     either language he derives serenate from sera and says that     parle means treaty negotiation though it is the same word as     parley had the same meanings and was commonly pronounced like it     as in marlowes        what shall we parlé with this christïan      it certainly never meant treaty though it may have meant     negotiation when it did it implied the meeting face to face of the     principals on the verses        and some flowers and some bays       for thy hearse to strew the ways      he has a note to tell us that hearse is not to be taken in our     sense of a carriage for the dead but in the older sense of a tomb or     framework over a tomb though the obvious meaning is to strew the     ways for thy hearse how could one do that for a tomb or the     framework over it       374 a passage from dante inferno xi 96105 with its reference     to aristotle would have given him the meaning of nature taught     art which seems to puzzle him a study of dante and of his earlier     commentators would also have been of great service in the     astronomical notes       375 almost every combination of two vowels might in those days be a     diphthong or not at will miltons practice of elision was confirmed     and sometimes perhaps modified by his study of the italians with     whose usage in this respect he closely conforms       376 letter to rev w bagot 4th january 1791       377 so dante       ma sapienza e amore e virtute     so donne       simony and sodomy in churchmens lives       378 mr masson is evidently not very familiar at first hand with     the versification to which miltons youthful ear had been trained     but seems to have learned something from abbotts shakespearian     grammar in the interval between writing his notes and his     introduction walkers shakespeares versification would have been     a great help to him in default of original knowledge       379 milton has a verse in comus where the e is elided from the     word sister by its preceding a vowel        heaven keep my sister again again and near      this would have been impossible before a consonant       380 so spirito and spirto in italian esperis and espirs in     old french       381 milton however would not have balked at th bottomless any     more than drayton at th rejected or donne at th sea mr masson     does not seem to understand this elision for he corrects i th     midst to i the midst and takes pains to mention it in a note he     might better have restored the n in i where it is no     contraction but merely indicates the pronunciation as o for of     and on       382 exactly analogous to that in treasurer when it is shortened to     two syllables       383 milton himself has ínvísible for we cannot suppose him     guilty of a verse like        shoots invisible virtue even to the deep      while if read rightly it has just one of those sweeping elisions     that he loved     keats  there are few poets whose works contain slighter hints of their personal history than those of keats yet there are perhaps even fewer whose real lives or rather the conditions upon which they lived are more clearly traceable in what they have written to write the life of a man was formerly understood to mean the cataloguing and placing of circumstances of those things which stood about the life and were more or less related to it but were not the life itself but biography from day to day holds dates cheaper and facts dearer a mans life so far as its outward events are concerned may be made for him as his clothes are by the tailor of this cut or that of finer or coarser material but the gait and gesture show through and give to trappings in themselves characterless an individuality that belongs to the man himself it is those essential facts which underlie the life and make the individual man that are of importance and it is the cropping out of these upon the surface that gives us indications by which to judge of the true nature hidden below every man has his block given him and the figure he cuts will depend very much upon the shape of thatupon the knots and twists which existed in it from the beginning we were designed in the cradle perhaps earlier and it is in finding out this design and shaping ourselves to it that our years are spent wisely it is the vain endeavor to make ourselves what we are not that has strewn history with so many broken purposes and lives left in the rough  keats hardly lived long enough to develop a welloutlined character for that results commonly from the resistance made by temperament to the many influences by which the world as it may happen then to be endeavors to mould every one in its own image what his temperament was we can see clearly and also that it subordinated itself more and more to the discipline of art                                       john keats the second of four children like chaucer and spenser was a londoner but unlike them he was certainly not of gentle blood lord houghton who seems to have had a kindly wish to create him gentleman by brevet says that he was born in the upper ranks of the middle class this shows a commendable tenderness for the nerves of english society and reminds one of northcotes story of the violinplayer who wishing to compliment his pupil george iii divided all fiddlers into three classesthose who could not play at all those who played very badly and those who played very wellassuring his majesty that he had made such commendable progress as to have already reached the second rank we shall not be too greatly shocked by knowing that the father of keats as lord houghton had told us in an earlier biography was employed in the establishment of mr jennings the proprietor of large liverystables on the pavement in moorfields nearly opposite the entrance into finsbury circus so that after all it was not so bad for first mr jennings was a proprietor second he was the proprietor of an establishment third he was the proprietor of a large establishment and fourth this large establishment was nearly opposite finsbury circusa name which vaguely dilates the imagination with all sorts of potential grandeurs it is true leigh hunt asserts that keats was a little too sensitive on the score of his origin384 but we can find no trace of such a feeling either in his poetry or in such of his letters as have been printed we suspect the fact to have been that he resented with becoming pride the vulgar blackwood and quarterly standard which measured genius by genealogies it is enough that his poetical pedigree is of the best tracing through spenser to chaucer and that pegasus does not stand at livery even in the largest establishments in moorfields  as well as we can make out then the father of keats was a groom in the service of mr jennings and married the daughter of his master thus on the mothers side at least we find a grandfather on the fathers there is no hint of such an ancestor and we must charitably take him for granted it is of more importance that the elder keats was a man of sense and energy and that his wife was a lively and intelligent woman who hastened the birth of the poet by her passionate love of amusement bringing him into the world a sevenmonths child on the 29th october 1795 instead of the 29th of december as would have been conventionally proper lord houghton describes her as tall with a large oval face and a somewhat saturnine demeanour this last circumstance does not agree very well with what he had just before told us of her liveliness but he consoles us by adding that she succeeded however in inspiring her children with the profoundest affection this was particularly true of john who once when between four and five years old mounted guard at her chamber door with an old sword when she was ill and the doctor had ordered her not to be disturbed385  in 1804 keats being in his ninth year his father was killed by a fall from his horse his mother seems to have been ambitious for her children and there was some talk of sending john to harrow fortunately this plan was thought too expensive and he was sent instead to the school of mr clarke at enfield with his brothers a maternal uncle who had distinguished himself by his courage under duncan at camperdown was the hero of his nephews and they went to school resolved to maintain the family reputation for courage john was always fighting and was chiefly noted among his schoolfellows as a strange compound of pluck and sensibility he attacked an usher who had boxed his brothers ears and when his mother died in 1810 was moodily inconsolable hiding himself for several days in a nook under the masters desk and refusing all comfort from teacher or friend  he was popular at school as boys of spirit always are and impressed his companions with a sense of his power they thought he would one day be a famous soldier this may have been owing to the stories he told them of the heroic uncle whose deeds we may be sure were properly famoused by the boy homer and whom they probably took for an admiral at the least as it would have been well for keatss literary prosperity if he had been at any rate they thought john would be a great man which is the main thing for the public opinion of the playground is truer and more discerning than that of the world and if you tell us what the boy was we will tell you what the man longs to be however he may be repressed by necessity or fear of the police reports  lord houghton has failed to discover anything else especially worthy of record in the schoollife of keats he translated the twelve books of the aeneid read robinson crusoe and the incas of peru and looked into shakespeare he left school in 1810 with little latin and no greek but he had studied spences polymetis tookes pantheon and lemprieres dictionary and knew gods nymphs and heroes which were quite as good company perhaps for him as artists and aspirates it is pleasant to fancy the horror of those respectable writers if their pages could suddenly have become alive tinder their pens with all that the young poet saw in them386  on leaving school he was apprenticed for five years to a surgeon at edmonton his master was a mr hammond of some eminence in his profession as lord houghton takes care to assure us the place was of more importance than the master for its neighborhood to enfield enabled him to keep up his intimacy with the family of his former teacher mr clarke and to borrow books of them in 1812 when he was in his seventeenth year mr charles cowden clarke lent him the faerie queene nothing that is told of orpheus or amphion is more wonderful than this miracle of spensers transforming a surgeons apprentice into a great poet keats learned at once the secret of his birth and henceforward his indentures ran to apollo instead of mr hammond thus could the muse defend her son it is the old storythe lost heir discovered by his aptitude for what is gentle and knightly haydon tells us that he used sometimes to say to his brother he feared he should never be a poet and if he was not he would destroy himself this was perhaps a halfconscious reminiscence of chatterton with whose genius and fate he had an intense sympathy it may be from an inward foreboding of the shortness of his own career387  before long we find him studying chaucer then shakespeare and afterward milton but chapmans translations had a more abiding influence on his style both for good and evil that he read wisely his comments on the paradise lost are enough to prove he now also commenced poet himself but does not appear to have neglected the study of his profession he was a youth of energy and purpose and though he no doubt penned many a stanza when he should have been anatomizing and walked the hospitals accompanied by the early gods nevertheless passed a very creditable examination in 1817 in the spring of this year also he prepared to take his first degree as poet and accordingly published a small volume containing a selection of his earlier essays in verse it attracted little attention and the rest of this year seems to have been occupied with a journey on foot in scotland and the composition of endymion which was published in 1818 miltons tetrachordon was not better abused but miltons assailants were unorganized and were obliged each to print and pay for his own dingy little quarto trusting to the natural laws of demand and supply to furnish him with readers keats was arraigned by the constituted authorities of literary justice they might be nay they were jeffrieses and scroggses but the sentence was published and the penalty inflicted before all england the difference between his fortune and miltons was that between being pelted by a mob of personal enemies and being set in the pillory in the first case the annoyance brushes off mostly with the mud in the last there is no solace but the consciousness of suffering in a great cause this solace to a certain extent keats had for his ambition was noble and he hoped not to make a great reputation but to be a great poet haydon says that wordsworth and keats were the only men he had ever seen who looked conscious of a lofty purpose  it is curious that men should resent more fiercely what they suspect to be good verses than what they know to be bad morals is it because they feel themselves incapable of the one and not of the other probably a certain amount of honest loyalty to old idols in danger of dethronement is to be taken into account and quite as much of the cruelty of criticism is due to want of thought as to deliberate injustice however it be the best poetry has been the most savagely attacked and men who scrupulously practised the ten commandments as if there were never a not in any of them felt every sentiment of their better nature outraged by the lyrical ballads it is idle to attempt to show that keats did not suffer keenly from the vulgarities of blackwood and the quarterly he suffered in proportion as his ideal was high and he was conscious of falling below it in england especially it is not pleasant to be ridiculous even if you are a lord but to be ridiculous and an apothecary at the same time is almost as bad as it was formerly to be excommunicated a priori there was something absurd in poetry written by the son of an assistant in the liverystables of mr jennings even though they were an establishment and a large establishment and nearly opposite finsbury circus mr gifford the excobbler thought so in the quarterly and mr terry the actor388 thought so even more distinctly in blackwood bidding the young apothecary back to his gallipots it is not pleasant to be talked down upon by your inferiors who happen to have the advantage of position nor to be drenched with ditchwater though you know it to be thrown by a scullion in a garret  keats as his was a temperament in which sensibility was excessive could not but be galled by this treatment he was galled the more that he was also a man of strong sense and capable of understanding clearly how hard it is to make men acknowledge solid value in a person whom they have once heartily laughed at reputation is in itself only a farthingcandle of wavering and uncertain flame and easily blown out but it is the light by which the world looks for and finds merit keats longed for fame but longed above all to deserve it to his friend taylor he writes there is but one way for me the road lies through study application and thought thrilling with the electric touch of sacred leaves he saw in vision like dante that small procession of the elder poets to which only elect centuries can add another laurelled head might he too deserve from posterity the love and reverence which he paid to those antique glories it was no unworthy ambition but everything was against himbirth health even friends since it was partly on their account that he was sneered at his very name stood in his way for fame loves best such syllables as are sweet and sonorous on the tongue like spenserian shakespearian in spite of juliet there is a great deal in names and when the fairies come with their gifts to the cradle of the selected child let one wiser than the rest choose a name for him from which wellsounding derivatives can be made and best of all with a termination in on men judge the current coin of opinion by the ring and are readier to take without question whatever is platonic baconian newtonian johnsonian washingtonian jeffersonian napoleonic and all the rest you cannot make a good adjective out of keatsthe more pityand to say a thing is keatsy is to contemn it fortune likes fine names  haydon tells us that keats was very much depressed by the fortunes of his book this was natural enough but he took it all in a manly way and determined to revenge himself by writing better poetry he knew that activity and not despondency is the true counterpoise to misfortune haydon is sure of the change in his spirits because he would come to the paintingroom and sit silent for hours but we rather think that the conversation where mr haydon was resembled that in a young authors first play where the other interlocutors are only brought in as convenient points for the hero to hitch the interminable web of his monologue upon besides keats had been continuing his education this year by a course of elgin marbles and pictures by the great italians and might very naturally have found little to say about mr haydons extensive works that he would have cared to hear lord houghton on the other hand in his eagerness to prove that keats was not killed by the article in the quarterly is carried too far toward the opposite extreme and more than hints that he was not even hurt by it this would have been true of wordsworth who by a constant companionship with mountains had acquired something of their manners but was simply impossible to a man of keatss temperament  on the whole perhaps we need not respect keats the less for having been gifted with sensibility and may even say what we believe to be true that his health was injured by the failure of his book a man cannot have a sensuous nature and be pachydermatous at the same time and if he be imaginative as well as sensuous he suffers just in proportion to the amount of his imagination it is perfectly true that what we call the world in these affairs is nothing more than a mere brocken spectre the projected shadow of ourselves but as long as we do not know it it is a very passable giant we are not without experience of natures so purely intellectual that their bodies had no more concern in their mental doings and sufferings than a house has with the good or ill fortune of its occupant but poets are not built on this plan and especially poets like keats in whom the moral seems to have so perfectly interfused the physical man that you might almost say he could feel sorrow with his hands so truly did his body like that of donnes mistress boulstred think and remember and forebode the healthiest poet of whom our civilization has been capable says that when he beholds            desert a beggar born   and strength by limping sway disabled   and art made tonguetied by authority  alluding plainly enough to the giffords of his day    and simple truth miscalled simplicity  as it was long afterward in wordsworths case    and captive good attending captain ill  that then even he the poet to whom of all others life seems to have been dearest as it was also the fullest of enjoyment tired of all these had nothing for it but to cry for restful death  keats to all appearance accepted his ill fortune courageously he certainly did not overestimate endymion and perhaps a sense of humor which was not wanting in him may have served as a buffer against the too importunate shock of disappointment he made ritchie promise says haydon he would carry his endymion to the great desert of sahara and fling it in the midst on the 9th october 1818 he writes to his publisher mr hessey i cannot but feel indebted to those gentlemen who have taken my part as for the rest i begin to get acquainted with my own strength and weakness praise or blame has but a momentary effect on the man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him a severe critic of his own works my own domestic criticism has given me pain without comparison beyond what blackwood or the quarterly could inflict and also when i feel i am right no external praise can give me such a glow as my own solitary reperception and ratification of what is fine js is perfectly right in regard to the slipshod endymion that it is so is no fault of mine no though it may sound a little paradoxical it is as good as i had power to make it by myself had i been nervous about its being a perfect piece and with that view asked advice and trembled over every page it would not have been written for it is not in my nature to fumble i will write independently i have written independently without judgment i may write independently and with judgment hereafter the genius of poetry must work out its own salvation in a man it cannot be matured by law and precept but by sensation and watchfulness in itself that which is creative must create itself in endymion i leaped headlong into the sea and thereby have become better acquainted with the soundings the quicksands and the rocks than if i had stayed upon the green shore and piped a silly pipe and took tea and comfortable advice i was never afraid of failure for i would sooner fail than not be among the greatest  this was undoubtedly true and it was naturally the side which a largeminded person would display to a friend this is what he thought but whether it was what he felt i think doubtful i look upon it rather as one of the phenomena of that multanimous nature of the poet which makes him for the moment that of which he has an intellectual perception elsewhere he says something which seems to hint at the true state of the case i must think that difficulties nerve the spirit of a man they make our prime objects a refuge as well as a passion one cannot help contrasting keats with wordsworththe one altogether poet the other essentially a wordsworth with the poetic faculty addedthe one shifting from form to form and from style to style and pouring his hot throbbing life into every mould the other remaining always the individual producing works and not so much living in his poems as memorially recording his life in them when wordsworth alludes to the foolish criticisms on his writings he speaks serenely and generously of wordsworth the poet as if he were an unbiassed third person who takes up the argument merely in the interest of literature he towers into a bald egotism which is quite above and beyond selfishness poesy was his employment it was keatss very existence and he felt the rough treatment of his verses as if it had been the wounding of a limb to wordsworth composing was a healthy exercise his slow pulse and imperturbable self trust gave him assurance of a life so long that he could wait and when we read his poems we should never suspect the existence in him of any sense but that of observation as if wordsworth the poet were a halfmad landsurveyor accompanied by mr wordsworth the distributor of stamps as a kind of keeper but every one of keatss poems was a sacrifice of vitality a virtue went away from him into every one of them even yet as we turn the leaves they seem to warm and thrill our fingers with the flush of his fine senses and the flutter of his electrical nerves and we do not wonder he felt that what he did was to be done swiftly  in the mean time his younger brother languished and died his elder seems to have been in some way unfortunate and had gone to america and keats himself showed symptoms of the hereditary disease which caused his death at last it is in october 1818 that we find the first allusion to a passion which was erelong to consume him it is plain enough beforehand that those were not moral or mental graces that should attract a man like keats his intellect was satisfied and absorbed by his art his books and his friends he could have companionship and appreciation from men what he craved of woman was only repose that luxurious nature which would have tossed uneasily on a crumpled rose leaf must have something softer to rest upon than intellect something less ethereal than culture it was his body that needed to have its equilibrium restored the waste of his nervous energy that must be repaired by deep draughts of the overflowing life and drowsy tropical force of an abundant and healthily poised womanhood writing to his sisterinlaw he says of this nameless person she is not a cleopatra but is at least a charmian she has a rich eastern look she has fine eyes and fine manners when she comes into a room she makes the same impression as the beauty of a leopardess she is too fine and too conscious of herself to repulse any man who may address her from habit she thinks that nothing particular i always find myself at ease with such a woman the picture before me always gives me a life and animation which i cannot possibly feel with anything inferior i am at such times too much occupied in admiring to be awkward or in a tremble i forget myself entirely because i live in her you will by this time think i am in love with her so before i go any farther i will tell you that i am not she kept me awake one night as a tune of mozarts might do i speak of the thing as a pastime and an amusement than which i can feel none deeper than a conversation with an imperial woman the very yes and no of whose life is to me a banquet i like her and her like because one has no sensation what we both are is taken for granted she walks across a room in such a manner that a man is drawn toward her with magnetic power i believe though she has faults the same as a cleopatra or a charmian might have had yet she is a fine thing speaking in a worldly way for there are two distinct tempers of mind in which we judge of thingsthe worldly theatrical and pantomimical and the unearthly spiritual and ethereal in the former bonaparte lord byron and this charmian hold the first place in our minds in the latter john howard bishop hooker rocking his childs cradle and you my dear sister are the conquering feelings as a man of the world i love the rich talk of a charmian as an eternal being i love the thought of you i should like her to ruin me and i should like you to save me  it is pleasant always to see love hiding his head with such pains while his whole body is so clearly visible as in this extract this lady it seems is not a cleopatra only a charmian but presently we find that she is imperial he does not love her but he would just like to be ruined by her nothing more this glimpse of her with her leopardess beauty crossing the room and drawing men after her magnetically is all we have she seems to have been still living in 1848 and as lord houghton tells us kept the memory of the poet sacred she is an eastindian keats says and ought to be her grandfathers heir her name we do not know it appears from dilkes papers of a critic that they were betrothed it is quite a settled thing between john keats and miss  god help them it is a bad thing for them the mother says she cannot prevent it and that her only hope is that it will go off he dont like any one to look at her or to speak to her alas the tropical warmth became a consuming fire    his passion cruel grown took on a hue   fierce and sanguineous  between this time and the spring of 1820 he seems to have worked assiduously of course worldly success was of more importance than ever he began hyperion but had given it up in september 1819 because as he said there were too many miltonic inversions in it he wrote lamia after an attentive study of drydens versification this period also produced the eve of st agnes isabella and the odes to the nightingale and to the grecian urn he studied italian read ariosto and wrote part of a humorous poem the cap and bells he tried his hand at tragedy and lord houghton has published among his remains otho the great and all that was ever written of king stephen we think he did unwisely for a biographer is hardly called upon to show how ill his biographee could do anything  in the winter of 1820 he was chilled in riding on the top of a stagecoach and came home in a state of feverish excitement he was persuaded to go to bed and in getting between the cold sheets coughed slightly that is blood in my mouth he said bring me the candle let me see this blood it was of a brilliant red and his medical knowledge enabled him to interpret the augury those narcotic odors that seem to breathe seaward and steep in repose the senses of the voyager who is drifting toward the shore of the mysterious other world appeared to envelop him and looking up with sudden calmness he said i know the color of that blood it is arterial blood i cannot be deceived in that color that drop is my deathwarrant i must die  there was a slight rally during the summer of that year but toward autumn he grew worse again and it was decided that he should go to italy he was accompanied thither by his friend mr severn an artist after embarking he wrote to his friend mr brown we give a part of this letter which is so deeply tragic that the sentences we take almost seem to break away from the rest with a cry of anguish like the branches of dantes lamentable wood  i wish to write on subjects that will not agitate me much there is one i must mention and have done with it even if my body would recover of itself this would prevent it the very thing which i want to live most for will be a great occasion of my death i cannot help it who can help it were i in health it would make me ill and how can i bear it in my state i dare say you will be able to guess on what subject i am harpingyou know what was my greatest pain during the first part of my illness at your house i wish for death every day and night to deliver me from these pains and then i wish death away for death would destroy even those pains which are better than nothing land and sea weakness and decline are great separators but death is the great divorcer forever when the pang of this thought has passed through my mind i may say the bitterness of death is passed i often wish for you that you might flatter me with the best i think without my mentioning it for my sake you would be a friend to miss  when i am dead you think she has many faults but for my sake think she has not one if there is anything you can do for her by word or deed i know you will do it i am in a state at present in which woman merely as woman can have no more power over me than stocks and stones and yet the difference of my sensations with respect to miss  and my sister is amazingthe one seems to absorb the other to a degree incredible i seldom think of my brother and sister in america the thought of leaving miss  is beyond everything horriblethe sense of darkness coming over mei eternally see her figure eternally vanishing some of the phrases she was in the habit of using during my last nursing at wentworth place ring in my ears is there another life shall i awake and find all this a dream there must be we cannot be created for this sort of suffering  to the same friend he writes again from naples 1st november 1820  the persuasion that i shall see her no more will kill me my dear brown i should have had her when i was in health and i should have remained well i can bear to diei cannot bear to leave her o god god god everything i have in my trunks that reminds me of her goes through me like a spear the silk lining she put in my travellingcap scalds my head my imagination is horribly vivid about heri see her i hear her there is nothing in the world of sufficient interest to divert me from her a moment this was the case when i was in england i cannot recollect without shuddering the time that i was a prisoner at hunts and used to keep my eyes fixed on hampstead all day then there was a good hope of seeing her againnowo that i could be buried near where she lives i am afraid to write to her to receive a letter from herto see her handwriting would break my heart even to hear of her anyhow to see her name written would be more than i can bear my dear brown what am i to do where can i look for consolation or ease if i had any chance of recovery this passion would kill me indeed through the whole of my illness both at your house and at kentish town this fever has never ceased wearing me out  the two friends went almost immediately from naples to rome where keats was treated with great kindness by the distinguished physician dr afterward sir james clark389 but there was no hope from the first his disease was beyond remedy as his heart was beyond comfort the very fact that life might be happy deepened his despair he might not have sunk so soon but the waves in which he was struggling looked only the blacker that they were shone upon by the signaltorch that promised safety and love and rest  it is good to know that one of keatss last pleasures was in hearing severn read aloud from a volume of jeremy taylor on first coming to rome he had bought a copy of alfieri but finding on the second page these lines    misera me sollievo a me non resta   altro che il pianto ed il pianto é delitto  he laid down the book and opened it no more on the 14th february 1821 severn speaks of a change that had taken place in him toward greater quietness and peace he talked much and fell at last into a sweet sleep in which he seemed to have happy dreams perhaps he heard the soft footfall of the angel of death pacing to and fro under his window to be his valentine that night he asked to have this epitaph inscribed upon his gravestone    here lies one whose name was writ in water  on the 23d he died without pain and as if falling asleep his last words were i am dying i shall die easy dont be frightened be firm and thank god it has come  he was buried in the protestant burialground at rome in that part of it which is now disused and secluded from the rest a short time before his death he told severn that he thought his intensest pleasure in life had been to watch the growth of flowers and once after lying peacefully awhile he said i feel the flowers growing over me his grave is marked by a little headstone on which are carved somewhat rudely his name and age and the epitaph dictated by himself no tree or shrub has been planted near it but the daisies faithful to their buried lover crowd his small mound with a galaxy of their innocent stars more prosperous than those under which he lived390 in person keats was below the middle height with a head small in proportion to the breadth of his shoulders his hair was brown and fine falling in natural ringlets about a face in which energy and sensibility were remarkably mixed every feature was delicately cut the chin was bold and about the mouth something of a pugnacious expression his eyes were mellow and glowing large dark and sensitive at the recital of a noble action or a beautiful thought they would suffuse with tears and his mouth trembled391 haydon says that his eyes had an inward delphian look that was perfectly divine  the faults of keatss poetry are obvious enough but it should be remembered that he died at twentyfive and that he offends by superabundance and not poverty that he was overlanguaged at first there can be no doubt and in this was implied the possibility of falling back to the perfect mean of diction it is only by the rich that the costly plainness which at once satisfies the taste and the imagination is attainable  whether keats was original or not i do not think it useful to discuss until it has been settled what originality is lord houghton tells us that this merit whatever it is has been denied to keats because his poems take the color of the authors he happened to be reading at the time he wrote them but men have their intellectual ancestry and the likeness of some one of them is forever unexpectedly flashing out in the features of a descendant it may be after a gap of several generations in the parliament of the present every man represents a constituency of the past it is true that keats has the accent of the men from whom he learned to speak but this is to make originality a mere question of externals and in this sense the author of a dictionary might bring an action of trover against every author who used his words it is the man behind the words that gives them value and if shakespeare help himself to a verse or a phrase it is with ears that have learned of him to listen that we feel the harmony of the one and it is the mass of his intellect that makes the other weighty with meaning enough that we recognize in keats that indefinable newness and unexpectedness which we call genius the sunset is original every evening though for thousands of years it has built out of the same light and vapor its visionary cities with domes and pinnacles and its delectable mountains which night shall utterly abase and destroy  three men almost contemporaneous with each otherwordsworth keats and byronwere the great means of bringing back english poetry from the sandy deserts of rhetoric and recovering for her her triple inheritance of simplicity sensuousness and passion of these wordsworth was the only conscious reformer and his hostility to the existing formalism injured his earlier poems by tingeing them with something of iconoclastic extravagance he was the deepest thinker keats the most essentially a poet and byron the most keenly intellectual of the three keats had the broadest mind or at least his mind was open on more sides and he was able to understand wordsworth and judge byron equally conscious through his artistic sense of the greatnesses of the one and the many littlenesses of the other while wordsworth was isolated in a feeling of his prophetic character and byron had only an uneasy and jealous instinct of contemporary merit the poems of wordsworth as he was the most individual accordingly reflect the moods of his own nature those of keats from sensitiveness of organization the moods of his own taste and feeling and those of byron who was impressible chiefly through the understanding the intellectual and moral wants of the time in which he lived wordsworth has influenced most the ideas of succeeding poets keats their forms and byron interesting to men of imagination less for his writings than for what his writings indicate reappears no more in poetry but presents an ideal to youth made restless with vague desires not yet regulated by experience nor supplied with motives by the duties of life  keats certainly had more of the penetrative and sympathetic imagination which belongs to the poet of that imagination which identifies itself with the momentary object of its contemplation than any man of these later days it is not merely that he has studied the elizabethans and caught their turn of thought but that he really sees things with their sovereign eye and feels them with their electrified senses his imagination was his bliss and bane was he cheerful he hops about the gravel with the sparrows was he morbid he would reject a petrarcal coronationon account of my dying day and because women have cancers so impressible was he as to say that he had no nature meaning character but he knew what the faculty was worth and says finely the imagination may be compared to adams dream he awoke and found it truth he had an unerring instinct for the poetic uses of things and for him they had no other use we are apt to talk of the classic renaissance as of a phenomenon long past nor ever to be renewed and to think the greeks and romans alone had the mighty magic to work such a miracle to me one of the most interesting aspects of keats is that in him we have an example of the renaissance going on almost under our own eyes and that the intellectual ferment was in him kindled by a purely english leaven he had properly no scholarship any more than shakespeare had but like him he assimilated at a touch whatever could serve his purpose his delicate senses absorbed culture at every pore of the selfdenial to which he trained himself unexampled in one so young the second draft of hyperion as compared with the first is a conclusive proof and far indeed is his lamia from the lavish indiscrimination of endymion in his odes he showed a sense of form and proportion which we seek vainly in almost any other english poet and some of his sonnets taking all qualities into consideration are the most perfect in our language no doubt there is something tropical and of strange overgrowth in his sudden maturity but it was maturity nevertheless happy the young poet who has the saving fault of exuberance if he have also the shaping faculty that sooner or later will amend it  as every young person goes through all the worldold experiences fancying them something peculiar and personal to himself so it is with every new generation whose youth always finds its representatives in its poets keats rediscovered the delight and wonder that lay enchanted in the dictionary wordsworth revolted at the poetic diction which he found in vogue but his own language rarely rises above it except when it is upborne by the thought keats had an instinct for fine words which are in themselves pictures and ideas and had more of the power of poetic expression than any modern english poet and by poetic expression i do not mean merely a vividness in particulars but the right feeling which heightens or subdues a passage or a whole poem to the proper tone and gives entireness to the effect there is a great deal more than is commonly supposed in this choice of words mens thoughts and opinions are in a great degree vassals of him who invents a new phrase or reapplies an old epithet the thought or feeling a thousand times repeated becomes his at last who utters it best this power of language is veiled in the old legends which make the invisible powers the servants of some word as soon as we have discovered the word for our joy or sorrow we are no longer its serfs but its lords we reward the discoverer of an anaesthetic for the body and make him member of all the societies but him who finds a nepenthe for the soul we elect into the small academy of the immortals  the poems of keats mark an epoch in english poetry for however often we may find traces of it in others in them found its most unconscious expression that reaction against the barrelorgan style which had been reigning by a kind of sleepy divine right for half a century the lowest point was indicated when there was such an utter confounding of the common and the uncommon sense that dr johnson wrote verse and burke prose the most profound gospel of criticism was that nothing was good poetry that could not be translated into good prose as if one should say that the test of sufficient moonlight was that tallowcandles could be made of it we find keats at first going to the other extreme and endeavoring to extract green cucumbers from the rays of tallow but we see also incontestable proof of the greatness and purity of his poetic gift in the constant return toward equilibrium and repose in his later poems and it is a repose always lofty and clearaired like that of the eagle balanced in incommunicable sunshine in him a vigorous understanding developed itself in equal measure with the divine faculty thought emancipated itself from expression without becoming its tyrant and music and meaning floated together accordant as swan and shadow on the smooth element of his verse without losing its sensuousness his poetry refined itself and grew more inward and the sensational was elevated into the typical by the control of that finer sense which underlies the senses and is the spirit of them     footnotes      384 hunts autobiography am ed vol ii p 36       385 haydon tells the story differently but i think lord houghtons     version the best       386 there is always some one willing to make himself a sort of     accessary after the fact in any success always an old woman or two     ready to remember omens of all quantities and qualities in the     childhood of persons who have become distinguished accordingly a     certain mrs grafty of craven street finsbury assures mr george     keats when he tells her that john is determined to be a poet that     this was very odd because when he could just speak instead of     answering questions put to him he would always make a rhyme to the     last word people said and then laugh the early histories of     heroes like those of nations are always more or less mythical and     i give the story for what it is worth doubtless there is a gleam of     intelligence in it for the old lady pronounces it odd that any one     should determine to be a poet and seems to have wished to hint     that the matter was determined earlier and by a higher disposing     power there are few children who do not soon discover the charm of     rhyme and perhaps fewer who can resist making fun of the mrs     graftys of craven street finsbury when they have the chance see     haydons autobiography vol i p361       387 i never saw the poet keats but once but he then read some     lines from i think the bristowe tragedy with an enthusiasm of     admiration
