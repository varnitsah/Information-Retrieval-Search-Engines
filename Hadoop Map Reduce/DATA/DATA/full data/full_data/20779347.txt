20779347	the rectorial address delivered  at st andrews university  may 3rd 1922     courage  by  j m barrie     hodder and stoughton limited toronto   to the red gowns of st andrews    canada 1922      you have had many rectors here in st andrews who will continue in bloom long after the lowly ones such as i am are dead and rotten and forgotten  they are the roses in december you remember someone said that god gave us memory so that we might have roses in december but i do not envy the great ones  in my experienceand you may find in the end it is yours alsothe people i have cared for most and who have seemed most worth caring formy december roseshave been very simple folk  yet i wish that for this hour i could swell into someone of importance so as to do you credit  i suppose you had a melting for me because i was hewn out of one of your own quarries walked similar academic groves and have trudged the road on which you will soon set forth  i would that i could put into your hands a staff for that somewhat bloody march for though there is much about myself that i conceal from other people to help you i would expose every cranny of my mind  but alas when the hour strikes for the rector to answer to his call he is unable to become the undergraduate he used to be and so the only door into you is closed  we your elders are much more interested in you than you are in us  we are not really important to you  i have utterly forgotten the address of the rector of my time and even who he was but i recall vividly climbing up a statue to tie his colours round its neck and being hurled therefrom with contumely we remember the important things  i cannot provide you with that staff for your journey but perhaps i can tell you a little about it how to use it and lose it and find it again and cling to it more than ever  you shall cut itso it is ordainedevery one of you for himself and its name is courage  you must excuse me if i talk a good deal about courage to you today  there is nothing else much worth speaking about to undergraduates or graduates or whitehaired men and women  it is the lovely virtuethe rib of himself that god sent down to his children  my special difficulty is that though you have had literary rectors here before they were the big guns the historians the philosophers you have had none i think who followed my more humble branch which may be described as playing hide and seek with angels  my puppets seem more real to me than myself and i could get on much more swingingly if i made one of them deliver this address  it is mconnachie who has brought me to this pass mconnachie i should explain as i have undertaken to open the innermost doors is the name i give to the unruly half of myself the writing half  we are complement and supplement  i am the half that is dour and practical and canny he is the fanciful half my desire is to be the family solicitor standing firm on my hearthrug among the harsh realities of the office furniture while he prefers to fly around on one wing i should not mind him doing that but he drags me with him  i have sworn that mconnachie shall not interfere with this address today but there is no telling  i might have done things worth while if it had not been for mconnachie and my first piece of advice to you at any rate shall be sound dont copy me  a good subject for a rectorial address would be the mess the rector himself has made of life  i merely cast this forth as a suggestion and leave the working of it out to my successor  i do not think it has been used yet  my own theme is courage as you should use it in the great fight that seems to me to be coming between youth and their betters by youth meaning of course you and by your betters us  i want you to take up this position that youth have for too long left exclusively in our hands the decisions in national matters that are more vital to them than to us  things about the next war for instance and why the last one ever had a beginning  i use the word fight because it must i think begin with a challenge but the aim is the reverse of antagonism it is partnership  i want you to hold that the time has arrived for youth to demand that partnership and to demand it courageously  that to gain courage is what you came to st andrews for  with some alarums and excursions into college life  that is what i propose but of course the issue lies with mconnachie  your betters had no share in the immediate cause of the war we know what nation has that blot to wipe out but for fifty years or so we heeded not the rumblings of the distant drum i do not mean by lack of military preparations and when war did come we told youth who had to get us out of it tall tales of what it really is and of the clover beds to which it leads  we were not meaning to deceive most of us were as honourable and as ignorant as the youth themselves but that does not acquit us of failings such as stupidity and jealousy the two black spots in human nature which more than love of money are at the root of all evil  if you prefer to leave things as they are we shall probably fail you again  do not be too sure that we have learned our lesson and are not at this very moment doddering down some brimstone path  i am far from implying that even worse things than war may not come to a state  there are circumstances in which nothing can so well become a land as i think this land proved when the late war did break out and there was but one thing to do  there is a form of anaemia that is more rotting than even an unjust war  the end will indeed have come to our courage and to us when we are afraid in dire mischance to refer the final appeal to the arbitrament of arms i suppose all the lusty of our race alive and dead join hands on that     and he is dead who will not fight    and who dies fighting has increase  but if you must be in the struggle the more reason you should know why before it begins and have a say in the decision whether it is to begin  the youth who went to the war had no such knowledge no such say i am sure the survivors of whom there must be a number here today want you to be wiser than they were and are certainly determined to be wiser next time themselves  if you are to get that partnership which once gained is to be for mutual benefit it will be i should say by banding yourselves with these men not defiantly but firmly not for selfish ends but for your countrys good  in the meantime they have one bulwark they have a general who is befriending them as i think never after the fighting was over has a general befriended his men before  perhaps the seemly thing would be for us their betters to elect one of these young survivors of the carnage to be our rector  he ought now to know a few things about war that are worth our hearing  if his theme were the rectors favourite diligence  i should be afraid of his advising a great many of us to be diligent in sitting still and doing no more harm  of course he would put it more suavely than that though it is not i think by gentleness that you will get your rights we are dogged ones at sticking to what we have got and so will you be at our age but avoid calling us ugly names we may be stubborn and we may be blunderers but we love you more than aught else in the world and once you have won your partnership we shall all be welcoming you i urge you not to use ugly names about anyone  in the war it was not the fighting men who were distinguished for abuse as has been well said hell hath no fury like a noncombatant  never ascribe to an opponent motives meaner than your own  there may be students here today who have decided this session to go in for immortality and would like to know of an easy way of accomplishing it  that is a way but not so easy as you think  go through life without ever ascribing to your opponents motives meaner than your own  nothing so lowers the moral currency give it up and be great  another sure way to fame is to know what you mean  it is a solemn thought that almost no oneif he is truly eminentknows what he means  look at the great ones of the earth the politicians  we do not discuss what they say but what they may have meant when they said it  in 1922 we are all wondering and so are they what they meant in 1914 and afterwards  they are publishing books trying to find out the men of action as well as the men of words  there are exceptions  it is not that our statesmen are sugared mouths with minds therefrae many of them are the best men we have got upright and anxious nothing cheaper than to miscall them  the explanation seems just to be that it is so difficult to know what you mean especially when you have become a swell  no longer apparently can you deal in russet yeas and honest kersey noes gone for ever is simplicity which is as beautiful as the divine plain face of lambs miss kelly  doubts breed suspicions a dangerous air  without suspicion there might have been no war  when you are called to downing street to discuss what you want of your betters with the prime minister he wont be suspicious not as far as you can see but remember the atmosphere of generations you are in and when he passes you the toastrack say to yourselves if you would be in the mode now i wonder what he means by that  even without striking out in the way i suggest you are already disturbing your betters considerably  i sometimes talk this over with mconnachie with whom as you may guess circumstances compel me to pass a good deal of my time  in our talks we agree that we your betters constantly find you forgetting that we are your betters your answer is that the war and other happenings have shown you that age is not necessarily another name for sapience that our avoidance of frankness in life and in the arts is often but not so often as you think a cowardly way of shirking unpalatable truths and that you have taken us off our pedestals because we look more natural on the ground  you who are at the rash age even accuse your elders sometimes not without justification of being more rash than yourselves  if youth but only knew we used to teach you to sing but now just because youth has been to the war it wants to change the next line into if age had only to do  in so far as this attitude of yours is merely passive sullen negative as it mainly is despairing of our capacity and anticipating a future of gloom it is no game for man or woman it is certainly the opposite of that for which i plead  do not stand aloof despising disbelieving but come in and helpinsist on coming in and helping  after all we have shown a good deal of courage and your part is to add a greater courage to it there are glorious years lying ahead of you if you choose to make them glorious  gods in his heaven still  so forward brave hearts  to what adventures i cannot tell but i know that your god is watching to see whether you are adventurous  i know that the great partnership is only a first step but i do not know what are to be the next and the next  the partnership is but a tool what are you to do with it  very little i warn you if you are merely thinking of yourselves much if what is at the marrow of your thoughts is a future that even you can scarcely hope to see  learn as a beginning how worldshaking situations arise and how they may be countered  doubt all your betters who would deny you that right of partnership  begin by doubting all such in high places except of course your professors  but doubt all other professors yet not conceitedly as some do with their noses in the air avoid all such physical risks  if it necessitates your pushing some of us out of our places still push you will find it needs some shoving but the things courage can do  the things that even incompetence can do if it works with singleness of purpose  the war has done at least one big thing it has taken spring out of the year  and this accomplished our leading people are amazed to find that the other seasons are not conducting themselves as usual  the spring of the year lies buried in the fields of france and elsewhere  by the time the next eruption comes it may be you who are responsible for it and your sons who are in the lava  all perhaps because this year you let things slide  we are a nice and kindly people but it is already evident that we are stealing back into the old grooves seeking cushions for our old bones rather than attempting to build up a fairer future  that is what we mean when we say that the country is settling down  make haste or you will become like us with only the thing we proudly call experience to add to your stock a poor exchange for the generous feelings that time will take away  we have no intention of giving you your share  look around and see how much share youth has now that the war is over  you got a handsome share while it lasted  i expect we shall beat you unless your fortitude be doubly girded by a desire to send a message of cheer to your brothers who fell the only message i believe for which they crave they are not worrying about their aunt jane  they want to know if you have learned wisely from what befell them if you have they will be braced in the feeling that they did not die in vain  some of them think they did  they will not take our word for it that they did not you are their living image they know you could not lie to them but they distrust our flattery and our cunning faces  to us they have passed away but are you who stepped into their heritage only yesterday whose books are scarcely cold to their hands you who still hear their cries being blown across the linksare you already relegating them to the shades  the gaps they have left in this university are among the most honourable of her wounds but we are not here to acclaim them  where they are now hero is i think a very little word  they call to you to find out in time the truth about this great game which your elders play for stakes and youth plays for its life  i do not know whether you are grown a little tired of that word hero but i am sure the heroes are  that is the subject of one of our unfinished plays mconnachie is the one who writes the plays if any one of you here proposes to be a playwright you can take this for your own and finish it  the scene is a school schoolmasters present but if you like you could make it a university professors present  they are discussing an illuminated scroll about a student fallen in the war which they have kindly presented to his parents and unexpectedly the parents enter  they are an old pair backbent they have been stalwarts in their day but have now gone small they are poor but not so poor that they could not send their boy to college  they are in black not such a rusty black either and you may be sure she is the one who knows what to do with his hat their faces are gnarled i supposebut i do not need to describe that pair to scottish students  they have come to thank the senatus for their lovely scroll and to ask them to tear it up at first they had been enamoured to read of what a scholar their son was how noble and adored by all  but soon a fog settled over them for this grand person was not the boy they knew he had many a fault well known to them he was not always so noble as a scholar he did no more than scrape through and he sometimes made his father rage and his mother grieve  they had liked to talk such memories as these together and smile over them as if they were bits of him he had left lying about the house so thank you kindly and would you please give them back their boy by tearing up the scroll  i see nothing else for our dramatist to do i think he should ask an alumna of st andrews to play the old lady indicating miss ellen terry  the loveliest of all young actresses the dearest of all old ones it seems only yesterday that all the men of imagination proposed to their beloveds in some such frenzied words as these as i cant get miss terry may i have you  this play might become historical as the opening of your propaganda in the proposed campaign  how to make a practical advance the league of nations is a very fine thing but it cannot save you because it will be run by us  beware your betters bringing presents what is wanted is something run by yourselves  you have more in common with the youth of other lands than youth and age can ever have with each other even the hostile countries sent out many a son very like ours from the same sort of homes the same sort of universities who had as little to do as our youth had with the origin of the great adventure  can we doubt that many of these on both sides who have gone over and were once opponents are now friends  you ought to have a league of youth of all countries as your beginning ready to say to all governments we will fight each other but only when we are sure of the necessity  are you equal to your job you young men  if not i call upon the redgowned women to lead the way  i sound to myself as if i were advocating a rebellion though i am really asking for a larger friendship  perhaps i may be arrested on leaving the hall  in such a cause i should think that i had at last proved myself worthy to be your rector  you will have to work harder than ever but possibly not so much at the same things more at modern languages certainly if you are to discuss that league of youth with the students of other nations when they come over to st andrews for the conference  i am far from taking a side against the classics  i should as soon argue against your having tops to your heads that way lie the best tops science too has at last come to its own in st andrews  it is the surest means of teaching you how to know what you mean when you say  so you will have to work harder  isaak walton quotes the saying that doubtless the almighty could have created a finer fruit than the strawberry but that doubtless also he never did  doubtless also he could have provided us with better fun than hard work but i dont know what it is  to be born poor is probably the next best thing  the greatest glory that has ever come to me was to be swallowed up in london not knowing a soul with no means of subsistence and the fun of working till the stars went out to have known any one would have spoilt it  i did not even quite know the language  i rang for my boots and they thought i said a glass of water so i drank the water and worked on  there was no food in the cupboard so i did not need to waste time in eating the pangs and agonies when no proof came  how courteously tolerant was i of the postman without a proof for us how mconnachie on the other hand wanted to punch his head  the magic days when our article appeared in an evening paper  the promptitude with which i counted the lines to see how much we should get for it then mconnachies superb air of dropping it into the gutter oh to be a free lance of journalism againthat darling jade those were days  too good to last  let us be grave  here comes a rector  but now on reflection a dreadful sinking assails me that this was not really work  the artistic callingsyou remember how stevenson thumped themare merely doing what you are clamorous to be at it is not real work unless you would rather be doing something else my socalled labours were just mconnachie running away with me again still i have sometimes worked for instance i feel that i am working at this moment  and the big guns are in the same plight as the little ones  carlyle the king of all rectors has always been accepted as the archapostle of toil and has registered his many woes  but it will not do  despite sickness poortith want and all he was grinding all his life at the one job he revelled in an extraordinarily happy man though there is no direct proof that he thought so  there must be many men in other callings besides the arts lauded as hard workers who are merely out for enjoyment  our chancellor indicating lord haig  if our chancellor has always a passion to be a soldier we must reconsider him as a worker  even our principal  how about the light that burns in our principals room after decent people have gone to bed  if we could climb up and look ini should like to do something of that kind for the last timeshould we find him engaged in honest toil or guiltily engrossed in chemistry  you will all fall into one of those two callings the joyous or the uncongenial and one wishes you into the first though our sympathy our esteem must go rather to the less fortunate the braver ones who turn their necessity to glorious gain after they have put away their dreams  to the others will go the easy prizes of life success which has become a somewhat odious onion nowadays chiefly because we so often give the name to the wrong thing  when you reach the evening of your days you will i think seewith i hope becoming cheerfulnessthat we are all failures at least all the best of us  the greatest scotsman that ever lived wrote himself down a failure     the poor inhabitant below    was quick to learn and wise to know    and keenly felt the friendly glow       and softer flame    but thoughtless follies laid him low       and stained his name  perhaps the saddest lines in poetry written by a man who could make things new for the gods themselves  if you want to avoid being like burns there are several possible ways thus you might copy us as we shine forth in our published memoirs practically without a flaw  no one so obscure nowadays but that he can have a book about him  happy the land that can produce such subjects for the pen  but do not put your photograph at all ages into your autobiography that may bring you to the ground  my life and what i have done with it that is the sort of title but it is the photographs that give away what you have done with it  grim things those portraits if you could read the language of them you would often find it unnecessary to read the book  the face itself of course is still more telltale for it is the record of all ones past life  there the man stands in the dock page by page we ought to be able to see each chapter of him melting into the next like the figures in the cinematograph  even the youngest of you has got through some chapters already  when you go home for the next vacation someone is sure to say john has changed a little i dont quite see in what way but he has changed  you remember they said that last vacation  perhaps it means that you look less like your father  think that out  i could say some nice things of your betters if i chose  in youth you tend to look rather frequently into a mirror not at all necessarily from vanity  you say to yourself what an interesting face i wonder what he is to be up to  your elders do not look into the mirror so often  we know what he has been up to  as yet there is unfortunately no science of reading other peoples faces i think a chair for this should be founded in st andrews  the new professor will need to be a sublime philosopher and for obvious reasons he ought to wear spectacles before his senior class it will be a gloriously optimistic chair for he can tell his students the glowing truth that what their faces are to be like presently depends mainly on themselves  mainly not altogether     i am the master of my fate    i am the captain of my soul  i found the other day an old letter from henley that told me of the circumstances in which he wrote that poem  i was a patient he writes in the old infirmary of edinburgh  i had heard vaguely of lister and went there as a sort of forlorn hope on the chance of saving my foot  the great surgeon received me as he did and does everybody with the greatest kindness and for twenty months i lay in one or other ward of the old place under his care  it was a desperate business but he saved my foot and here i am  there he was ladies and gentlemen and what he was doing during that desperate business was singing that he was master of his fate  if you want an example of courage try henley  or stevenson i could tell you some stories abut these two but they would not be dull enough for a rectorial address  for courage again take meredith whose laugh was as broad as a thousand beeves at pasture  take as i think the greatest figure literature has still left us to be added today to the roll of st andrews alumni though it must be in absence  the pomp and circumstance of war will pass and all others now alive may fade from the scene but i think the quiet figure of hardy will live on  i seem to be taking all my examples from the calling i was lately pretending to despise  i should like to read you some passages of a letter from a man of another calling which i think will hearten you i have the little filmy sheets here  i thought you might like to see the actual letter it has been a long journey it has been to the south pole  it is a letter to me from captain scott of the antarctic and was written in the tent you know of where it was found long afterwards with his body and those of some other very gallant gentlemen his comrades  the writing is in pencil still quite clear though toward the end some of the words trail away as into the great silence that was waiting for them  it begins    we are pegging out in a very comfortless spot   hoping this letter may be found and sent to you i write   you a word of farewell  i want you to think well of me   and my end after aome private instructions too   intimate to read he goes on goodbyei am not at   all afraid of the end but sad to miss many a simple   pleasure which i had planned for the future in our long   marches    we are in a desperate statefeet   frozen etc no fuel and a long way from food but it   would do your heart good to be in our tent to hear our   songs and our cheery conversation    laterit   is here that the words become difficultwe are very   near the end    we did intend to finish ourselves   when things proved like this but we have decided to die   naturally without  i think it may uplift you all to stand for a moment by that tent and listen as he says to their songs and cheery conversation  when i think of scott i remember the strange alpine story of the youth who fell down a glacier and was lost and of how a scientific companion one of several who accompanied him all young computed that the body would again appear at a certain date and place many years afterwards  when that time came round some of the survivors returned to the glacier to see if the prediction would be fulfilled all old men now and the body reappeared as young as on the day he left them so scott and his comrades emerge out of the white immensities always young  how comely a thing is affliction borne cheerfully which is not beyond the reach of the humblest of us  what is beauty  it is these hardbitten men singing courage to you from their tent it is the waves of their island home crooning of their deeds to you who are to follow them  sometimes beauty boils over and them spirits are abroad  ages may pass as we look or listen for time is annihilated  there is a very old legend told to me by nansen the exploreri like well to be in the company of explorersthe legend of a monk who had wandered into the fields and a lark began to sing he had never heard a lark before and he stood there entranced until the bird and its song had become part of the heavens  then he went back to the monastery and found there a doorkeeper whom he did not know and who did not know him  other monks came and they were all strangers to him  he told them he was father anselm but that was no help  finally they looked through the books of the monastery and these revealed that there had been a father anselm there a hundred or more years before  time had been blotted out while he listened to the lark  that i suppose was a case of beauty boiling over or a soul boiling over perhaps the same thing  then spirits walk  they must sometimes walk st andrews  i do not mean the ghosts of queens or prelates but one that keeps step as soft as snow with some poor student  he sometimes catches sight of it that is why his fellows can never quite touch him their best beloved he half knows something of which they know nothingthe secret that is hidden in the face of the monna lisa  as i see him life is so beautiful to him that its proportions are monstrous perhaps his childhood may have been overfull of gladness they dont like that  if the seekers were kind he is the one for whom the flags of his college would fly one day  but the seeker i am thinking of is unfriendly and so our student is the lad that will never be told  he often gaily forgets and thinks he has slain his foe by daring him like him who dreading water was always the first to leap into it  one can see him serene astride a scotch cliff singing to the sun the farewell thanks of a boy     throned on a cliff serene man saw the sun    hold a red torch above the farthest seas    and the fierce island pinnacles put on    in his defence their sombre panoplies    foremost the white mists eddied trailed and spun    like seekers emulous to clasp his knees    till all the beauty of the scene seemed one    led by the secret whispers of the breeze     the suns torch suddenly flashed upon his face    and died and he sat content in subject night    and dreamed of an old dead foe that had sought      and found him    a beast stirred bodly in his restingplace    and the cold came man rose to his masterheight    shivered and turned away but the mists were      round him  if there is any of you here so rare that the seekers have taken an illwill to him as to the boy who wrote those lines i ask you to be careful  henley says in that poem we were speaking of     under the bludgeonings of chance    my head is bloody but unbowed  a fine mouthful but perhaps my head is bloody and bowed is better  let us get back to that tent with its songs and cheery conversation courage  i do not think it is to be got by your becoming solemnsides before your time  you must have been warned against letting the golden hours slip by  yes but some of them are golden only because we let them slip  diligenceambition noble words but only if touched to fine issues  prizes may be dross learning lumber unless they bring you into the arena with increased understanding hanker not too much after worldly prosperitythat corpulent cigar if you became a millionaire you would probably go swimming around for more like a diseased goldfish  look to it that what you are doing is not merely toddling to a competency perhaps that must be your fate but fight it and then though you fail you may still be among the elect of whom we have spoken many a brave man has had to come to it at last  but there are the complacent toddlers from the start favour them not ladies especially now that every one of you carries a possible marechals baton under her gown  happy it has been said by a distinguished man is he who can leave college with an unreproaching conscience and an unsullied heart  i dont know he sounds to me like a sloppy watery sort of fellow happy perhaps but if there be red blood in him impossible  be not disheartened by ideals of perfection which can be achieved only by those who run away nature that thrifty goddess never gave you the smallest scruple of her excellence for that  whatever bludgeonings may be gathering for you i think one feels more poignantly at your age than ever again in life  you have not our december roses to help you but you have june coming whose roses do not wonder as do ours even while they give us their fragrancewondering most when they give us mostthat we should linger on an empty scene  it may indeed be monstrous but possibly courageous  courage is the thing  all goes if courage goes  what says our glorious johnson of courage unless a man has that virtue he has no security for preserving any other  we should thank our creator three times daily for courage instead of for our bread which if we work is surely the one thing we have a right to claim of him this courage is a proof of our immortality greater even than gardens when the eve is cool  pray for it  who rises from prayer a better man his prayer is answered  be not merely courageous but lighthearted and gay  there is an officer who was the first of our army to land at gallipoli  he was dropped overboard to light decoys on the shore so as to deceive the turks as to where the landing was to be  he pushed a raft containing these in front of him  it was a frosty night and he was naked and painted black  firing from the ships was going on all around  it was a twohours swim in pitch darkness he did it crawled through the scrub to listen to the talk of the enemy who were so near that he could have shaken hands with them lit his decoys and swam back  he seems to look on this as a gay affair  he is a vc now and you would not think to look at him that he could ever have presented such a disreputable appearance would you  indicating colonel freyberg  those men of whom i have been speaking as the kind to fill the fife could all be lighthearted on occasion  i remember scott by highland streams trying to rouse me by maintaining that haggis is boiled bagpipes henley in dispute as to whether say turgenieff or tolstoi could hang the other on his watchchain he sometimes clenched the argument by casting his crutch at you stevenson responded in the same gay spirit by giving that crutch to john silver you remember with what adequate results  you must cultivate this lightheartedness if you are to hang your betters on your watchchains  dr johnsonlet us have him again does not seem to have discovered in his travels that the scots are a lighthearted nation  boswell took him to task for saying that the death of garrick had eclipsed the gaiety of nations well sir johnson said there may be occasions when it is permissible to etc  but boswell would not let go  i cannot see sir how it could in any case have eclipsed the gaiety of nations as england was the only nation before whom he had ever played  johnson was really stymied but you would never have known it  well sir he said holing out i understand that garrick once played in scotland and if scotland has any gaiety to eclipse which sir i deny  prove johnson wrong for once at the students union and in your other societies  i much regret that there was no students union at edinburgh in my time  i hope you are fairly noisy and that members are sometimes let out  do you keep to the old topics king charless head and bacon wrote shakespeare or if he did not he missed the opportunity of his life  dont forget to speak scornfully of the victorian age there will be time for meekness when you try to better it  very soon you will be victorian or that sort of thing yourselves next session probably when the freshmen come up  afterwards if you go in for my sort of calling dont begin by thinking you are the last word in art quite possibly you are not steady yourself by remembering that there were great men before william k smith  make merry while you may  yet lightheartedness is not for ever and a day  at its best it is the gay companion of innocence and when innocence goes as it must gothey soon trip off together looking for something younger  but courage comes all the way     fight on my men says sir andrew barton    i am hurt but i am not slaine    ill lie me down and bleed awhile    and then ill rise and fight againe  another piece of advice almost my last  for reasons you may guess i must give this in a low voice  beware of mconnachie  when i look in a mirror now it is his face i see  i speak with his voice i once had a voice of my own but nowadays i hear it from far away only a melancholy lonely lost little pipe  i wanted to be an explorer but he willed otherwise  you will all have your mconnachies luring you off the high road  unless you are constantly on the watch you will find that he has slowly pushed you out of yourself and taken your place  he has rather done for me  i think in his youth he must somehow have guessed the future and been fleggit by it flichtered from the nest like a bird and so our eggs were left cold  he has clung to me less from mischief than for companionship i half like him and his penny whistle with all his faults he is as scotch as peat he whispered to me just now that you elected him not me as your rector  a final passing thought  were an old student given an hour in which to revisit the st andrews of his day would he spend more than half of it at lectures  he is more likely to be heard clattering up bare stairs in search of old companions  but if you could choose your hour from all the five hundred years of this seat of learning wandering at your will from one age to another how would you spend it  a fascinating theme so many notable shades at once astir that st leonards and st marys grow murky with them hamilton melville sharpe chalmers down to herkless that distinguished principal ripe scholar and warm friend the loss of whom i deeply deplore with you  i think if that hour were mine and though at st andrews he was but a passerby i would give a handsome part of it to a walk with doctor johnson i should like to have the time of day passed to me in twelve languages by the admirable crichton  a wave of the hand to andrew lang and then for the archery butts with the gay montrose all aruffled and ringed and in the gallant st andrews student manner continued as i understand to this present day scattering largess as he rides along     but where is now the courtly troupe      that once went riding by    i miss the curls of canteloupe      the laugh of lady di  we have still left time for a visit to a house in south street hard by st leonards  i do not mean the house you mean  i am a knox man  but little will that avail for mconnachie is a queen mary man  so after all it is at her door we chap a last futile effort to bring that woman to heel  one more house of call a students room also in south street  i have chosen my student you see and i have chosen well him that sang     life has not since been wholly vain      and now i bear    of wisdom plucked from joy and pain      some slender share     but howsoever rich the store      id lay it down    to feel upon my back once more      the old red gown  well we have at last come to an end  some of you may remember when i began this address we are all older now  i thank you for your patience  this is my first and last public appearance and i never could or would have made it except to a gathering of scottish students  if i have concealed my emotions in addressing you it is only the thrawn national way that deceives everybody except scotsmen  i have not been as dull as i could have wished to be but looking at your glowing faces cheerfulness and hope would keep breaking through  despite the imperfections of your betters we leave you a great inheritance for which others will one day call you to account  you come of a race of men the very wind of whose name has swept to the ultimate seas  remember     heaven doth with us as we with torches do    not light them for themselves     mighty are the universities of scotland and they will prevail but even in your highest exultations never forget that they are not four but five  the greatest of them is the poor proud homes you come out of which said so long ago there shall be education in this land  she not st andrews is the oldest university in scotland and all the others are her whelps  in bidding you goodbye my last words must be of the lovely virtue  courage my children and greet the unseen with a cheer fight on my men said sir andrew barton  fight onyou for the old red gown till the whistle blows
