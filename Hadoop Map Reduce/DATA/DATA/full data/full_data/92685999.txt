92685999	george walker at suez  by anthony trollope     of all the spots on the worlds surface that i george walker of friday street london have ever visited suez in egypt at the head of the red sea is by far the vilest the most unpleasant and the least interesting  there are no women there no water and no vegetation  it is surrounded and indeed often filled by a world of sand  a scorching sun is always overhead and one is domiciled in a huge cavernous hotel which seems to have been made purposely destitute of all the comforts of civilised life  nevertheless in looking back upon the week of my life which i spent there i always enjoy a certain sort of triumphor rather upon one day of that week which lends a sort of halo not only to my sojourn at suez but to the whole period of my residence in egypt  i am free to confess that i am not a great man and that at any rate in the earlier part of my career i had a hankering after the homage which is paid to greatness  i would fain have been a popular orator feeding myself on the incense tendered to me by thousands or failing that a man born to power whom those around him were compelled to respect and perhaps to fear  i am not ashamed to acknowledge this and i believe that most of my neighbours in friday street would own as much were they as candid and openhearted as myself  it is now some time since i was recommended to pass the first four months of the year in cairo because i had a sorethroat  the doctor may have been right but i shall never divest myself of the idea that my partners wished to be rid of me while they made certain changes in the management of the firm  they would not otherwise have shown such interest every time i blew my nose or relieved my huskiness by a slight coughthey would not have been so intimate with that surgeon from st bartholomews who dined with them twice at the albion nor would they have gone to work directly that my back was turned and have done those very things which they could not have done had i remained at home  be that as it may i was frightened and went to cairo and while there i made a trip to suez for a week  i was not happy at cairo for i knew nobody there and the people at the hotel were as i thought uncivil  it seemed to me as though i were allowed to go in and out merely by sufferance and yet i paid my bill regularly every week  the house was full of company but the company was made up of parties of twos and threes and they all seemed to have their own friends  i did make attempts to overcome that terrible british exclusiveness that noli me tangere with which an englishman arms himself and in which he thinks it necessary to envelop his wife but it was in vain and i found myself sitting down to breakfast and dinner day after day as much alone as i should do if i called for a chop at a separate table in the cathedral coffeehouse  and yet at breakfast and dinner i made one of an assemblage of thirty or forty people  that i thought dull  but as i stood one morning on the steps before the hotel bethinking myself that my throat was as well as ever i remembered it to be i was suddenly slapped on the back  never in my life did i feel a more pleasant sensation or turn round with more unaffected delight to return a friends greeting  it was as though a cup of water had been handed to me in the desert  i knew that a cargo of passengers for australia had reached cairo that morning and were to be passed on to suez as soon as the railway would take them and did not therefore expect that the greeting had come from any sojourner in egypt  i should perhaps have explained that the even tenor of our life at the hotel was disturbed some four times a month by a flight through cairo of a flock of travellers who like locusts eat up all that there was eatable at the inn for the day  they sat down at the same tables with us never mixing with us having their separate interests and hopes and being often as i thought somewhat loud and almost selfish in the expression of them  these flocks consisted of passengers passing and repassing by the overland route to and from india and australia and had i nothing else to tell i should delight to describe all that i watched of their habits and mannersthe outward bound being so different in their traits from their brethren on their return  but i have to tell of my own triumph at suez and must therefore hasten on to say that on turning round quickly with my outstretched hand i found it clasped by john robinson  well robinson is this you  holloa walker what are you doing here  that of course was the style of greeting  elsewhere i should not have cared much to meet john robinson for he was a man who had never done well in the world  he had been in business and connected with a fairly good house in sise lane but he had married early and things had not exactly gone well with him  i dont think the house broke but he did and so he was driven to take himself and five children off to australia  elsewhere i should not have cared to come across him but i was positively glad to be slapped on the back by anybody on that landingplace in front of shepheards hotel at cairo  i soon learned that robinson with his wife and children and indeed with all the rest of the australian cargo were to be passed on to suez that afternoon and after a while i agreed to accompany their party  i had made up my mind on coming out from england that i would see all the wonders of egypt and hitherto i had seen nothing i did ride on one day some fifteen miles on a donkey to see the petrified forest but the guide who called himself a dragoman took me wrong or cheated me in some way  we rode half the day over a stony sandy plain seeing nothing with a terrible wind that filled my mouth with grit and at last the dragoman got off  dere said he picking up a small bit of stone dis is de forest made of stone  carry that home  then we turned round and rode back to cairo  my chief observation as to the country was thisthat whichever way we went the wind blew into our teeth  the days work cost me fiveandtwenty shillings and since that i had not as yet made any other expedition  i was therefore glad of an opportunity of going to suez and of making the journey in company with an acquaintance  at that time the railway was open as far as i remember nearly half the way from cairo to suez  it did not run four or five times a day as railways do in other countries but four or five times a month  in fact it only carried passengers on the arrival of these flocks passing between england and her eastern possessions  there were trains passing backwards and forwards constantly as i perceived in walking to and from the station but as i learned they carried nothing but the labourers working on the line and the water sent into the desert for their use  it struck me forcibly at the time that i should not have liked to have money in that investment  well i went with robinson to suez  the journey like everything else in egypt was sandy hot and unpleasant  the railway carriages were pretty fair and we had room enough but even in them the dust was a great nuisance  we travelled about ten miles an hour and stopped about an hour at every ten miles  this was tedious but we had cigars with us and a trifle of brandy and water and in this manner the railway journey wore itself away  in the middle of the night however we were moved from the railway carriages into omnibuses as they were called and then i was not comfortable  these omnibuses were wooden boxes placed each upon a pair of wheels and supposed to be capable of carrying six passengers  i was thrust into one with robinson his wife and five children and immediately began to repent of my goodnature in accompanying them  to each vehicle were attached four horses or mules and i must acknowledge that as on the railway they went as slow as possible so now in these conveyances dragged through the sand they went as fast as the beasts could be made to gallop  i remember the fox tallyho coach on the birmingham road when boyce drove it but as regards pace the fox tallyho was nothing to these machines in egypt  on the first going off i was jolted right on to mrs r and her infant and for a long time that lady thought that the child had been squeezed out of its proper shape but at last we arrived at suez and the baby seemed to me to be all right when it was handed down into the boat at suez  the robinsons were allowed time to breakfast at that cavernous hotelwhich looked to me like a scheme to save the expense of the passengers meal on board the shipand then they were off  i shook hands with him heartily as i parted with him at the quay and wished him well through all his troubles  a man who takes a wife and five young children out into a colony and that with his pockets but indifferently lined certainly has his troubles before him  so he has at home no doubt but judging for myself i should always prefer sticking to the old ship as long as there is a bag of biscuits in the locker  poor robinson  i have never heard a word of him or his since that day and sincerely trust that the baby was none the worse for the little accident in the box  and now i had the prospect of a week before me at suez and the robinsons had not been gone half an hour before i began to feel that i should have been better off even at cairo  i secured a bedroom at the hoteli might have secured sixty bedrooms had i wanted them and then went out and stood at the front door or gate  it is a large house built round a quadrangle looking with one front towards the head of the red sea and with the other into and on a sandy deadlooking open square  there i stood for ten minutes and finding that it was too hot to go forth returned to the long cavernous room in which we had breakfasted  in that long cavernous room i was destined to eat all my meals for the next six days  now at cairo i could at any rate see my fellowcreatures at their food  so i lit a cigar and began to wonder whether i could survive the week  it was now clear to me that i had done a very rash thing in coming to suez with the robinsons  somebody about the place had asked me my name and i had told it plainlygeorge walker  i never was ashamed of my name yet and never had cause to be  i believe at this day it will go as far in friday street as any other  a man may be popular or he may not that depends mostly on circumstances which are in themselves trifling  but the value of his name depends on the way in which he is known at his bank  i have never dealt in tea spoons or gravy spoons but my name will go as far as another name  george walker i answered therefore in a tone of some little authority to the man who asked me and who sat inside the gate of the hotel in an old dressinggown and slippers  that was a melancholy day with me and twenty times before dinner did i wish myself back at cairo  i had been travelling all night and therefore hoped that i might get through some little time in sleeping but the mosquitoes attacked me the moment i laid myself down  in other places mosquitoes torment you only at night but at suez they buzz around you without ceasing at all hours  a scorching sun was blazing overhead and absolutely forbade me to leave the house  i stood for a while in the verandah looking down at the few small vessels which were moored to the quay but there was no life in them not a sail was set not a boatman or a sailor was to be seen and the very water looked as though it were hot  i could fancy the glare of the sun was cracking the paint on the gunwales of the boats  i was the only visitor in the house and during all the long hours of the morning it seemed as though the servants had deserted it  i dined at four not that i chose that hour but because no choice was given to me  at the hotels in egypt one has to dine at an hour fixed by the landlord and no entreaties will suffice to obtain a meal at any other  so at four i dined and after dinner was again reduced to despair  i was sitting in the cavernous chamber almost mad at the prospect of the week before me when i heard a noise as of various feet in the passage leading from the quadrangle  was it possible that other human beings were coming into the hotelchristian human beings at whom i could look whose voices i could hear whose words i could understand and with whom i might possibly associate  i did not move however for i was still hot and i knew that my chances might be better if i did not show myself over eager for companionship at the first moment  the door however was soon opened and i saw that at least in one respect i was destined to be disappointed  the strangers who were entering the room were not christiansif i might judge by the nature of the garments in which they were clothed  the door had been opened by the man in an old dressinggown and slippers whom i had seen sitting inside the gate  he was the arab porter of the hotel and as he marshalled the new visitors into the room i heard him pronounce some sound similar to my own name and perceived that he pointed me out to the most prominent person of those who then entered the apartment  this was a stout portly man dressed from head to foot in eastern costume of the brightest colours  he wore not only the red fez cap which everybody wears even i had accustomed myself to a fez capbut a turban round it of which the voluminous folds were snowy white  his face was fat but not the less grave and the lower part of it was enveloped in a magnificent beard which projected round it on all sides and touched his breast as he walked  it was a grand grizzled beard and i acknowledged at a moment that it added a singular dignity to the appearance of the stranger  his flowing robe was of bright colours and the under garment which fitted close round his breast and then descended becoming beneath his sash a pair of the loosest pantaloonsi might perhaps better describe them as bagswas a rich tawny silk  these loose pantaloons were tied close round his legs above the ankle and over a pair of scrupulously white stockings and on his feet he wore a pair of yellow slippers  it was manifest to me at a glance that the arab gentleman was got up in his best raiment and that no expense had been spared on his suit  and here i cannot but make a remark on the personal bearing of these arabs  whether they be arabs or turks or copts it is always the same  they are a mean false cowardly race i believe  they will bear blows and respect the man who gives them  fear goes further with them than love and between man and man they understand nothing of forbearance  he who does not exact from them all that he can exact is simply a fool in their estimation to the extent of that which he loses  in all this they are immeasurably inferior to us who have had christian teaching  but in one thing they beat us they always know how to maintain their personal dignity  look at my friend and partner judkins as he stands with his hands in his trousers pockets at the door of our house in friday street what can be meaner than his appearance  he is a stumpy short podgy man but then so also was my arab friend at suez  judkins is always dressed from head to foot in a decent black cloth suit his coat is ever a dress coat and is neither old nor shabby  on his head he carries a shining new silk hat such as fashion in our metropolis demands  judkins is rather a dandy than otherwise piquing himself somewhat on his apparel  and yet how mean is his appearance as compared with the appearance of that arabhow mean also is his gait how ignoble his step  judkins could buy that arab out four times over and hardly feel the loss and yet were they to enter a room together judkins would know and acknowledge by his look that he was the inferior personage  not the less should a personal quarrel arise between them would judkins punch the arabs head ay and reduce him to utter ignominy at his feet  judkins would break his heart in despair rather than not return a blow whereas the arab would put up with any indignity of that sort nevertheless judkins is altogether deficient in personal dignity  i often thought as the hours hung in egypt whether it might not be practicable to introduce an oriental costume in friday street  at this moment as the arab gentleman entered the cavernous coffee room i felt that i was greatly the inferior personage  he was followed by four or five others dressed somewhat as himself though by no means in such magnificent colours and by one gentleman in a coat and trousers  the gentleman in the coat and trousers came last and i could see that he was one of the least of the number as for myself i felt almost overawed by the dignity of the stout party in the turban and seeing that he came directly across the room to the place where i was seated i got upon my legs and made him some sign of christian obeisance  i am a little man and not podgy as is judkins and i flatter myself that i showed more deportment at any rate than he would have exhibited  i made as i have said some christian obeisance  i bobbed my head that is rubbing my hands together the while and expressed an opinion that it was a fine day  but if i was civil as i hope i was the arab was much more so  he advanced till he was about six paces from me then placed his right hand open upon his silken breast and inclining forward with his whole body made to me a bow which judkins never could accomplish  the turban and the flowing robe might be possible in friday street but of what avail would be the outer garments and mere symbols if the inner sentiment of personal dignity were wanting  i have often since tried it when alone but i could never accomplish anything like that bow  the arab with the flowing robe bowed and the other arabs all bowed also and after that the christian gentleman with the coat and trousers made a leg  i made a leg also rubbing my hands again and added to my former remarks that it was rather hot  dat berry true said the porter in the dirty dressinggown who stood by  i could see at a glance that the manner of that porter towards me was greatly altered and i began to feel comforted in my wretchedness  perhaps a christian from friday street with plenty of money in his pockets would stand in higher esteem at suez than at cairo  if so that alone would go far to atone for the apparent wretchedness of the place  at cairo i had not received that attention which had certainly been due to me as the second partner in the flourishing manchester house of grimes walker and judkins  but now as my friend with the beard again bowed to me i felt that this deficiency was to be made up  it was clear however that this new acquaintance though i liked the manner of it would be attended with considerable inconvenience for the arab gentleman commenced an address to me in french  it has always been to me a source of sorrow that my parents did not teach me the french language and this deficiency on my part has given rise to an incredible amount of supercilious overbearing pretension on the part of judkinswho after all can hardly do more than translate a correspondents letter  i do not believe that he could have understood that arabs oration but at any rate i did not  he went on to the end however speaking for some three or four minutes and then again he bowed if i could only have learned that bow i might still have been greater than judkins with all his french  i am very sorry said i but i dont exactly follow the french language when it is spoken  ah no french said the arab in very broken english dat is one sorrow  how is it that these fellows learn all languages under the sun  i afterwards found that this man could talk italian and turkish and armenian fluently and say a few words in german as he could also in english  i could not ask for my dinner in any other language than english if it were to save me from starvation  then he called to the christian gentleman in the pantaloons and as far as i could understand made over to him the duty of interpreting between us  there seemed however to be one difficulty in the way of this being carried on with efficiency  the christian gentleman could not speak english himself  he knew of it perhaps something more than did the arab but by no means enough to enable us to have a fluent conversation  and had the interpreterwho turned out to be an italian from trieste attached to the austrian consulate at alexandriahad the interpreter spoken english with the greatest ease i should have had considerable difficulty in understanding and digesting in all its bearings the proposition made to me  but before i proceed to the proposition i must describe a ceremony which took place previous to its discussion  i had hardly observed when first the procession entered the room that one of my friends followersmy friends name as i learned afterwards was mahmoud al ackbar and i will therefore call him mahmoudthat one of mahmouds followers bore in his arms a bundle of long sticks and that another carried an iron pot and a tray  such was the case and these two followers came forward to perform their services while i having been literally pressed down on to the sofa by mahmoud watched them in their progress  mahmoud also sat down and not a word was spoken while the ceremony went on  the man with the sticks first placed on the ground two little pansone at my feet and then one at the feet of his master  after that he loosed an ornamented bag which he carried round his neck and producing from it tobacco proceeded to fill two pipes  this he did with the utmost gravity and apparently with very peculiar care  the pipes had been already fixed at one end of the stick and to the other end the man had fastened two large yellow balls  these as i afterwards perceived were mouthpieces made of amber  then he lit the pipes drawing up the difficult smoke by long painful suckings at the mouthpiece and then when the work had become apparently easy he handed one pipe to me and the other to his master  the bowls he had first placed in the little pans on the ground  during all this time no word was spoken and i was left altogether in the dark as to the cause which had produced this extraordinary courtesy  there was a stationary sofathey called it there a divanwhich was fixed into the corner of the room and on one side of the angle sat mahmoud al ackbar with his feet tucked under him while i sat on the other  the remainder of the party stood around and i felt so little master of the occasion that i did not know whether it would become me to bid them be seated  i was not master of the entertainment  they were not my pipes  nor was it my coffee which i saw one of the followers preparing in a distant part of the room  and indeed i was much confused as to the management of the stick and amber mouthpiece with which i had been presented with a cigar i am as much at home as any man in the city  i can nibble off the end of it and smoke it to the last ash when i am three parts asleep  but i had never before been invited to regale myself with such an instrument as this  what was i to do with that huge yellow ball  so i watched my new friend closely  it had manifestly been a part of his urbanity not to commence till i had done so but seeing my difficulty he at last raised the ball to his mouth and sucked at it  i looked at him and envied the gravity of his countenance and the dignity of his demeanour  i sucked also but i made a sputtering noise and must confess that i did not enjoy it  the smoke curled gracefully from his mouth and nostrils as he sat there in mute composure  i was mute as regarded speech but i coughed as the smoke came from me in convulsive puffs  and then the attendant brought us coffee in little tin cupsblack coffee without sugar and full of grit of which the berries had been only bruised not ground  i took the cup and swallowed the mixture for i could not refuse but i wish that i might have asked for some milk and sugar  nevertheless there was something very pleasing in the whole ceremony and at last i began to find myself more at home with my pipe  when mahmoud had exhausted his tobacco and perceived that i also had ceased to puff forth smoke he spoke in italian to the interpreter and the interpreter forthwith proceeded to explain to me the purport of this visit  this was done with much difficulty for the interpreters stock of english was very scantybut after awhile i understood or thought i understood as follows at some previous period of my existence i had done some deed which had given infinite satisfaction to mahmoud al ackbar  whether however i had done it myself or whether my father had done it was not quite clear to me  my father then some time deceased had been a wharfinger at liverpool and it was quite possible that mahmoud might have found himself at that port  mahmoud had heard of my arrival in egypt and had been given to understand that i was coming to suezto carry myself away in the ship as the interpreter phrased it  this i could not understand but i let it pass  having heard these agreeable tidingsand mahmoud sitting in the corner bowed low to me as this was saidhe had prepared for my acceptance a slight refection for the morrow hoping that i would not carry myself away in the ship till this had been eaten  on this subject i soon made him quite at ease and he then proceeded to explain that as there was a point of interest at suez mahmoud was anxious that i should partake of the refection somewhat in the guise of a picnic at the well of moses over in asia on the other side of the head of the red sea  mahmoud would provide a boat to take across the party in the morning and camels on which we would return after sunset or else we would go and return on camels or go on camels and return in the boat  indeed any arrangement would be made that i preferred if i was afraid of the heat and disliked the open boat i could be carried round in a litter  the provisions had already been sent over to the well of moses in the anticipation that i would not refuse this little request  i did not refuse it  nothing could have been more agreeable to me than this plan of seeing something of the sights and wonders of this landand of this seeing them in good company  i had not heard of the well of moses before but now that i learned that it was in asiain another quarter of the globe to be reached by a transit of the red sea to be returned from by a journey on camels backs i burned with anxiety to visit its waters  what a story would this be for judkins  this was no doubt the point at which the israelites had passed  of those waters had they drunk  i almost felt that i had already found one of pharaohs chariot wheels  i readily gave my assent and then with much ceremony and many low salaams mahmoud and his attendant left me  i am very glad that i came to suez said i to myself  i did not sleep much that night for the mosquitoes of suez are very persevering but i was saved from the agonising despair which these animals so frequently produce by my agreeable thoughts as to mahmoud al ackbar  i will put it to any of my readers who have travelled whether it is not a painful thing to find onesself regarded among strangers without any kindness or ceremonious courtesy  i had on this account been wretched at cairo but all this was to be made up to me at suez  nothing could be more pleasant than the whole conduct of mahmoud al ackbar and i determined to take full advantage of it not caring overmuch what might be the nature of those previous favours to which he had alluded  that was his lookout and if he was satisfied why should not i be so also  on the following morning i was dressed at six and looking out of my bedroom i saw the boat in which we were to be wafted into asia being brought up to the quay close under my window  it had been arranged that we should start early so as to avoid the midday sun breakfast in the boatmahmoud in this way engaged to provide me with two refectionstake our rest at noon in a pavilion which had been built close upon the well of the patriarch and then eat our dinner and return riding upon camels in the cool of the evening nothing could sound more pleasant than such a plan and knowing as i did that the hampers of provisions had already been sent over i did not doubt that the table arrangements would be excellent  even now standing at my window i could see a basket laden with longnecked bottles going into the boat and became aware that we should not depend altogether for our morning repast on that gritty coffee which my friend mahmouds followers prepared  i had promised to be ready at six and having carefully completed my toilet and put a clean collar and comb into my pocket ready for dinner i descended to the great gateway and walked slowly round to the quay  as i passed out the porter greeted me with a low obeisance and walking on i felt that i stepped the ground with a sort of dignity of which i had before been ignorant  it is not as a rule the man who gives grace and honour to the position but the position which confers the grace and honour upon the man  i have often envied the solemn gravity and grand demeanour of the lord chancellor as i have seen him on the bench but i almost think that even judkins would look grave and dignified under such a wig mahmoud al ackbar had called upon me and done me honour and i felt myself personally capable of sustaining before the people of suez the honour which he had done me  as i walked forth with a proud step from beneath the portal i perceived looking down from the square along the street that there was already some commotion in the town  i saw the flowing robes of many arabs with their backs turned towards me and i thought that i observed the identical gown and turban of my friend mahmoud on the back and head of a stout short man who was hurrying round a corner in the distance  i felt sure that it was mahmoud  some of his servants had failed in their preparations i said to myself as i made my way round to the waters edge  this was only another testimony how anxious he was to do me honour  i stood for a while on the edge of the quay looking into the boat and admiring the comfortable cushions which were luxuriously arranged around the seats  the men who were at work did not know me and i was unnoticed but i should soon take my place upon the softest of those cushions  i walked slowly backwards and forwards on the quay listening to a hum of voices that came to me from a distance  there was clearly something stirring in the town and i felt certain that all the movement and all those distant voices were connected in some way with my expedition to the well of moses  at last there came a lad upon the walk dressed in frank costume and i asked him what was in the wind  he was a clerk attached to an english warehouse and he told me that there had been an arrival from cairo  he knew no more than that but he had heard that the omnibuses had just come in  could it be possible that mahmoud al ackbar had heard of another old acquaintance and had gone to welcome him also  at first my ideas on the subject were altogether pleasant  i by no means wished to monopolise the delights of all those cushions nor would it be to me a cause of sorrow that there should be some one to share with me the conversational powers of that interpreter  should another guest be found he might also be an englishman and i might thus form an acquaintance which would be desirable  thinking of these things i walked the quay for some minutes in a happy state of mind but by degrees i became impatient and by degrees also disturbed in my spirit  i observed that one of the arab boatmen walked round from the vessel to the front of the hotel and that on his return he looked at meas i thought not with courteous eyes then also i saw or rather heard some one in the verandah of the hotel above me and was conscious that i was being viewed from thence  i walked and walked and nobody came to me and i perceived by my watch that it was seven oclock  the noise too had come nearer and nearer and i was now aware that wheels had been drawn up before the front door of the hotel and that many voices were speaking there  it might be that mahmoud should wait for some other friend but why did he not send some one to inform me  and then as i made a sudden turn at the end of the quay i caught sight of the retreating legs of the austrian interpreter and i became aware that he had been sent down and had gone away afraid to speak to me what can i do said i to myself i can but keep my ground  i owned that i feared to go round to the front of the hotel  so i still walked slowly up and down the length of the quay and began to whistle to show that i was not uneasy  the arab sailors looked at me uncomfortably and from time to time some one peered at me round the corner  it was now fully halfpast seven and the sun was becoming hot in the heavens  why did we not hasten to place ourselves beneath the awning in that boat  i had just made up my mind that i would go round to the front and penetrate this mystery when on turning i saw approaching to me a man dressed at any rate like an english gentleman  as he came near to me he raised his hat and accosted me in our own language  mr george walker i believe said he  yes said i with some little attempt at a high demeanour of the firm of grimes walker and judkins friday street london  a most respectable house i am sure said he  i am afraid there has been a little mistake here  no mistake as to the respectability of that house said i  i felt that i was again alone in the world and that it was necessary that i should support myself  mahmoud al ackbar had separated himself from me for ever  of that i had no longer a doubt  oh none at all said he  but about this little expedition over the water and he pointed contemptuously to the boat  there has been a mistake about that mr walker i happen to be the english viceconsul here  i took off my hat and bowed  it was the first time i had ever been addressed civilly by any english consular authority  and they have made me get out of bed to come down here and explain all this to you  all what said i  you are a man of the world i know and ill just tell it you plainly  my old friend mahmoud al ackbar has mistaken you for sir george walker the new lieutenantgovernor of pegu  sir george walker is here now he has come this morning and mahmoud is ashamed to face you after what has occurred  if you wont object to withdraw with me into the hotel ill explain it all  i felt as though a thunderbolt had fallen and i must say that even up to this day i think that the consul might have been a little less abrupt  we can get in here said he evidently in a hurry and pointing to a small door which opened out from one corner of the house to the quay  what could i do but follow him  i did follow him and in a few words learned the remainder of the story  when he had once withdrawn me from the public walk he seemed but little anxious about the rest and soon left me again alone  the facts as far as i could learn them were simply these  sir george walker who was now going out to pegu as governor had been in india before commanding an army there  i had never heard of him before and had made no attempt to pass myself off as his relative  nobody could have been more innocent than i wasor have received worse usage  i have as much right to the name as he has well when he was in india before he had taken the city of begum after a terrible siegebegum i think the consul called it and mahmoud had been there having been it seems a great man at begum and sir george had spared him and his money and in this way the whole thing had come to pass  there was no further explanation than that  the rest of it was all transparent  mahmoud having heard my name from the porter had hurried down to invite me to his party so far so good  but why had he been afraid to face me in the morning  and seeing that the fault had all been his why had he not asked me to join the expedition  sir george and i may after all be cousins  but coward as he was he had been afraid of me when they found that i was on the quay they had been afraid of me not knowing how to get rid of me  i wish that i had kept the quay all day and stared them down one by one as they entered the boat but i was down in the mouth and when the consul left me i crept wearily back to my bedroom  and the consul did leave me almost immediately  a faint hope had at one time come upon me that he would have asked me to breakfast had he done so i should have felt it as a full compensation for all that i had suffered  i am not an exacting man but i own that i like civility  in friday street i can command it and in friday street for the rest of my life will i remain  from this consul i received no civility  as soon as he had got me out of the way and spoken the few words which he had to say he again raised his hat and left me  i also again raised mine and then crept up to my bed room  from my window standing a little behind the white curtain i could see the whole embarkation  there was mahmoud al ackbar looking indeed a little hot but still going through his work with all that excellence of deportment which had graced him on the preceding evening  had his foot slipped and had he fallen backwards into that shallow water my spirit would i confess have been relieved but on the contrary everything went well with him  there was the real sir george my namesake and perhaps my cousin as fresh as paint cool from the bath which he had been taking while i had been walking on that terrace  how is it that these governors and commandersinchief go through such a deal of work without fagging it was not yet two hours since he was jolting about in that omnibus box and there he had been all night  i could not have gone off to the well of moses immediately on my arrival  its the dignity of the position that does it  i have long known that the head of a firm must never count on a mere clerk to get through as much work as he could do himself  its the interest in the matter that supports the man  they went and sir george as i was well assured had never heard a word about me  had he done so is it probable that he would have requested my attendance  but mahmoud and his followers no doubt kept their own counsel as to that little mistake  there they went and the gentle rippling breeze filled their sail pleasantly as the boat moved away into the bay  i felt no spite against any of them but mahmoud  why had he avoided me with such cowardice  i could still see them when the morning tchibouk was handed to sir george and though i wished him no harm i did envy him as he lay there reclining luxuriously upon the cushions  a more wretched day than that i never spent in my life  as i went in and out the porter at the gate absolutely scoffed at me  once i made up my mind to complain within the house  but what could i have said of the dirty arab  they would have told me that it was his religion or a national observance or meant for a courtesy  what can a man do in a strange country when he is told that a native spits in his face by way of civility  i bore it i bore itlike a man and sighed for the comforts of friday street  as to one matter i made up my mind on that day and i fully carried out my purpose on the next  i would go across to the well of moses in a boat  i would visit the coasts of asia  and i would ride back into africa on a camel  though i did it alone i would have my days pleasuring  i had money in my pocket and though it might cost me 20 pounds i would see all that my namesake had seen  it did cost me the best part of 20 pounds and as for the pleasuring i cannot say much for it  i went to bed early that night having concluded my bargain for the morrow with a rapacious arab who spoke english  i went to bed early in order to escape the returning party and was again on the quay at six the next morning  on this occasion i stepped boldly into the boat the very moment that i came along the shore  there is nothing in the world like paying for what you use  i saw myself to the bottle of brandy and the cold meat and acknowledged that a cigar out of my own case would suit me better than that long stick  the long stick might do very well for a governor of pegu but would be highly inconvenient in friday street  well i am not going to give an account of my days journey here though perhaps i may do so some day  i did go to the well of moses if a small dirty pool of salt water lying high above the sands can be called a well i did eat my dinner in the miserable ruined cottage which they graced by the name of a pavilion and alas for my poor bones i did ride home upon a camel  if sir george did so early and started for pegu the next morningand i was informed such was the facthe must have been made of iron  i laid in bed the whole day suffering greviously but i was told that on such a journey i should have slakened my throat with oranges and not with brandy  i survived those four terrible days which remained to me at suez and after another month was once again in friday street  i suffered greatly on the occasion but it is some consolation to me to reflect that i smoked a pipe of peace with mahmoud al ackbar that i saw the hero of begum while journeying out to new triumphs at pegu that i sailed into asia in my own yachthired for the occasion and that i rode back into africa on a camel  nor can judkins with all his illnature rob me of these remembrances
