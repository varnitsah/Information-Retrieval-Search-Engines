5541169	the  gold of fairnilee  by andrew lang  to  jeanie lang  larra  dear jeanie  for you far away on the other side of the world i made this little tale of our own country your father and i have dug for treasure in the camp of rink with our knives when we were boys we did not find it the story will tell you why  are there fairies as well as bunyips in australia i hope so  yours always  whuppity stoories song in this tale is by the authors friend f de q m     the gold of fairnilee  illustration page 237  illustration chapter one     chapter ithe old house  you may still see the old scotch house where randal was born so long ago nobody lives there now most of the roof has fallen in there is no glass in the windows and all the doors are open they were open in the days of randals fathernearly four hundred years have passed since thenand everyone who came was welcome to his share of beef and broth and ale but now the doors are not only open they are quite gone and there is nobody within to give you a welcome  so there is nothing but emptiness in the old house where randal lived with jean three hundred and sixty years or so before you were born it is a high old house and wide with the broken slates still on the roof at the corner there are little round towers like pepperboxes with sharp peaks the stems of the ivy that covers the walls are as thick as trees there are many trees crowding all round and there are hills round it too and far below you hear the tweed whispering all day the house is called fairnilee which means the fairies field for people believed in fairies as you shall hear when randal was a boy and even when my father was a boy  randal was all alone in the house when he was a little fellowalone with his mother and nancy the old nurse and simon grieve the butler who wore a black velvet coat and a big silver chain then there were the maids and the grooms and the farm folk who were all friends of randals he was not lonely and he did not feel unhappy even before jean came as you shall be told but the grownup people were sad and silent at fairnilee randal had no father his mother lady ker was a widow she was still quite young and randal thought her the most beautiful person in the world children think these things about their mothers and randal had seen no ladies but his mother only she had brown hair and brown eyes and red lips and a grave kind face which looked serious under her great white widows cap with the black hood over it randal never saw his mother cry but when he was a very little child indeed he had heard her crying in the night this was after his father went away  illustration chapter two     chapter iihow randals father came home  randal remembered his fathers going to fight the english and how he came back again it was a windy august evening when he went away the rain had fallen since morning randal had watched the white mists driven by the gale down through the black pinewood that covers the hill opposite fairnilee the mist looked like armies of ghosts he thought marching marching through the pines with their white flags flying and streaming then the sun came out red at evening and randals father rode away with all his men he had a helmet on his head and a great axe hanging from his neck by a chain and a spear in his hand he was riding his big horse sir hugh and he caught randal up to the saddle and kissed him many times before he clattered out of the courtyard all the tenants and men about the farm rode with him all with spears and a flag embroidered with a crest in gold his mother watched them from the tower till they were out of sight and randal saw them ride away not on hard smooth roads like ours but along a green grassy track the water splashing up to their stirrups where they crossed the marshes  illustration page 240  then the sky turned as red as blood in the sunset and next it grew brown like the rust on a sword and the tweed below when they rode the ford was all red and gold and brown  then time went on that seemed a long time to randal only the women were left in the house and randal played with the shepherds children they sailed boats in the millpond and they went down to the boatpool and watched to see the big coppercoloured salmon splashing in the still water one evening randal looked up suddenly from his play it was growing dark he had been building a house with the round stones and wet sand by the river he looked up and there was his own father he was riding all alone and his horse sir hugh was very lean and lame and scarred with the spurs the spear in his fathers hand was broken and he had no sword and he looked neither to right nor to left his eyes were wide open but he seemed to see nothing  randal cried out to him father father but he never glanced at randal he did not look as if he heard him or knew he was there and suddenly he seemed to go away randal did not know how or where  randal was frightened  he ran into the house and went to his mother  oh mother he said i have seen father he was riding all alone and he would not look at me sir hugh was lame  where has he gone said lady ker in a strange voice  he went away out of sight said randal i could not see where he went  then his mother told him it could not be that his father would not have come back alone he would not leave his men behind him in the war  but randal was so sure that she did not scold him she knew he believed what he said  he saw that she was not happy  all that night which was the fourth of september in the year 1513 the day of flodden fight randals mother did not go to bed she kept moving about the house now she would look from the tower window up tweed and now she would go along the gallery and look down tweed from the other tower she had lights burning in all the windows all next day she was never still she climbed with two of her maids to the top of the hill above yair on the other side of the river and she watched the roads down ettrick and yarrow next night she slept little and rose early about noon randal saw three or four men riding wearily with tired horses they could scarcely cross the ford of tweed the horses were so tired the men were simon grieve the butler and some of the tenants they looked very pale some of them had their heads tied up and there was blood on their faces lady ker and randal ran to meet them  simon grieve lighted from his horse and whispered to randals mother  randal did not hear what he said but his mother cried i knew it i knew it and turned quite white  where is he she said  simon pointed across the hill they are bringing the corp he said randal knew the corp meant the dead body  he began to cry where is my father he said where is my father  his mother led him into the house she gave him to the old nurse who cried over him and kissed him and offered him cakes and made him a whistle with a branch of plane tree so in a short while randal only felt puzzled then he forgot and began to play he was a very little boy  lady ker shut herself up in her own roomher bower the servants called it  soon randal heard heavy steps on the stairs and whispering he wanted to run out and his nurse caught hold of him and would not have let him go but he slipped out of her hand and looked over the staircase  they were bringing up the body of a man stretched on a shield  it was randals father  he had been slain at flodden fighting for the king an arrow had gone through his brain and he had fallen beside james iv with many another brave knight all the best of scotland the flowers of the forest  what was it randal saw when he thought he met his father in the twilight three days before  he never knew his mother said he must have dreamed it all  the old nurse used to gossip about it to the maids hes an unco bairn oor randal i wush he may na be fey  she meant that randal was a strange child and that strange things would happen to him  illustration chapter three     chapter iiihow jean was brought to fairnlee  the winter went by very sadly at first the people about fairnilee expected the english to cross the border and march against them they drove their cattle out on the wild hills and into marshes where only they knew the firm paths and raised walls of earth and stonesbarmkyns they called themround the old house and made many arrows to shoot out of the narrow windows at the english randal used to like to see the arrowmaking beside the fire at night he was not afraid and said he would show the english what he could do with his little bow but weeks went on and no enemy came spring drew near the snow melted from the hills one night randal was awakened by a great noise of shouting he looked out of the window and saw bright torches moving about he heard the cows routing or bellowing and the women screaming he thought the english had come so they had not the english army but some robbers from the other side of the border at that time the people on the south side of scotland and the north side of england used to steal each others cows time about when a scotch squire or laird like randals father had been robbed by the neighbouring english he would wait his chance and drive away cattle from the english side this time most of randals mothers herds were seized by a sudden attack in the night and were driven away through the forest to england two or three of lady kers men were hurt by the english but old simon grieve took a prisoner he did this in a curious way he shot an arrow after the robbers as they rode off and the arrow pinned an englishmans leg to the saddle and even into his horse the horse was hurt and frightened and ran away right back to fairnilee where it was caught with the rider and all for of course he could not dismount  they treated him kindly at fairnilee though they laughed at him a good deal they found out from him where the english had come from he did not mind telling them for he was really a gipsy from yetholm where the gipsies live and scot or southron was all one to him  when old simon grieve knew who the people were that had taken the cows he was not long in calling the men together and trying to get back what he had lost early one april morning a grey morning with snow in the air he and his spearmen set out riding down through the forest and so into liddesdale when they came back again there were great rejoicings at fairnilee they drove most of their own cows before them and a great many other cows that they had not lost cows of the english farmers the byres and yards were soon full of cattle lowing and roaring very uneasy and some of them with marks of the spears that had goaded them across many a ford and up many a rocky pass in the hills  randal jumped downstairs to the great hall where his mother sat simon grieve was telling her all about it  sae we drave oor ain kye hame my lady he said and aiblins some orra anes that was na oor ain forbye we raikit a the plenishing oot o the ha o hardriding and a bonny burden o tapestries and plaids and gear we hae to show for our ride        we drove our own cattle home and perhaps some others      that were not ours and we took all the goods out of the      hall at hardriding and a pretty load of tapestries and      rugs and other things we have to show for our ride  then he called to some of his men who came into the hall and cast down great piles of all sorts of spoil and booty silver plate and silken hangings and a heap of rugs and carpets and plaids such as randal had never seen before for the english were much richer than the scotch  randal threw himself on the pile of rugs and began to roll on it  oh mother he cried suddenly jumping up and looking with wideopen eyes there s something living in the heap perhaps its a doggie or a rabbit or a kitten  illustration page 248  then randal tugged at the cloths and then they all heard a little shrill cry  why its a bairn said lady ker who had sat very grave all the time pleased to have done the english some harm for they had killed her husband and were all her deadly foes its a bairn she cried and pulled out of the great heap of cloaks and rugs a little beautiful child in its white nightdress with its yellow curls all tangled over its blue eyes  then lady ker and the old nurse could not make too much of the pretty english child that had come here in such a wonderful way  how did it get mixed up with all the spoil and how had it been carried so far on horseback without being hurt nobody ever knew it came as if the fairies had sent it english it was but the best scot could not hate such a pretty child old nancy dryden ran up to the old nursery with it and laid it in a great wooden tub full of hot water and was giving it warm milk to drink and dandling it almost before the men knew what had happened  yon bairn will be a bonny mate for you maister randal said old simon grieve deed i dinna think her kin will come speering after her at fairnilee the red cocks crawing ower hardriding ha this day and when the womenfolk come back frae the wood theyll hae other thing to do forbye looking for bairns        asking  when simon grieve said that the red cock was crowing over his enemies home he meant that he had set it on fire after the people who lived in it had run away  lady ker grew pale when she heard what he said she hated the english to be sure but she was a woman with a kind heart she thought of the dreadful danger that the little english girl had escaped and she went upstairs and helped the nurse to make the child happy  illustration chapter four     chapter ivrandal and jean  the little girl soon made everyone at fairnilee happy she was far too young to remember her own home and presently she was crawling up and down the long hall and making friends with randal they found out that her name was jane musgrave though she could hardly say musgrave and they called her jean with their scotch tongues or jean o the kye because she came when the cows were driven home again  soon the old nurse came to like her near as well as randal her ain bairn her own child as she called him in the summer days jean as she grew older would follow randal about like a little doggie they went fishing together and randal would pull the trout out of caddon burn or the burn of peel and jeanie would be very proud of him and very much alarmed at the big wide jaws of the yellow trout and randal would plait helmets with green rushes for her and him and make spears of bulrushes and play at tilts and tournaments there was peace in the country or if there was war it did not come near the quiet valley of the tweed and the hills that lie round fairnilee in summer they were always on the hills and by the burnsides  you cannot think if you have not tried what pleasant company a burn is it comes out of the deep black wells in the moss far away on the tops of the hills where the sheep feed and the fox peers from his hole and the ravens build in the crags the burn flows down from the lonely places cutting a way between steep green banks tumbling in white waterfalls over rocks and lying in black deep pools below the waterfalls at every turn it does something new and plays a fresh game with its brown waters the white pebbles in the water look like gold often randal would pick one out and think he had found a goldmine till he got it into the sunshine and then it was only a white stone what he called a chuckystane but he kept hoping for better luck next time in the height of summer when the streams were very low he and the shepherds boys would build dams of stones and turf across a narrow part of the burn while jean sat and watched them on a little round knoll then when plenty of water had collected in the pool they would break the dam and let it all run downhill in a little flood they called it a hurly gush and in winter they would slide on the black smooth ice of the boatpool beneath the branches of the alders  or they would go out with yarrow the shepherds dog and follow the track of wild creatures in the snow the rabbit makes marks like  and the hare makes marks like  but the foxs track is just as if you had pushed a piece of wood through the snowa number of cuts in the surface going straight along  illustration tracks of hare and fox  when it was very cold the grouse and blackcocks would come into the trees near the house and randal and jean would put out porridge for them to eat and the great white swans floated in from the frozen lochs on the hills and gathered round open reaches and streams of the tweed it was pleasant to be a boy then in the north and at hallow een they would duck for apples in tubs of water and burn nuts in the fire and look for the shadow of the lady randal was to marry in the mirror but he only saw jean looking over his shoulder  the days were very short in winter so far north and they would soon be driven into the house then they sat by the nursery fire and those were almost the pleasantest hours for the old nurse would tell them old scotch stories of elves and fairies and sing them old songs jean would crawl close to randal and hold his hand for fear the red etin or some other awful bogle should get her and in the dancing shadows of the firelight she would think she saw whuppity stoorie the wicked old witch with the spinningwheel but it was really nothing but the shadow of the wheel that the old nurse drove with her footbirr birrand that whirred and rattled as she span and told her tale  illustration page 254  for people span their cloth at home then instead of buying it from shops and the old nurse was a great woman for spinning  she was a great woman for stories too and believed in fairies and bogles as she called them had not her own cousin andrew tamson passed the cauldshiels loch one new year morning and had he not heard a dreadful roaring as if all the cattle on faldonside hill were routing at once and then did he not see a great black beast roll down the hillside like a black ball and run into the loch which grew white with foam and the waves leaped up the banks like a tide rising what could that be except the kelpie that lives in cauldshiels loch and is just a muckle big water bull and what for should there no be water kye if there s land kye  randal and jean thought it was very likely there were kye or cattle in the water and some highland people think so still and believe they have seen the great kelpie come roaring out of the lake or shellycoat whose skin is all crusted like a rock with shells sitting beside the sea  the old nurse had other tales that nobody believes any longer about brownies a brownie was a very useful creature to have in a house he was a kind of fairyman and he came out in the dark when everybody had gone to bed just as mice pop out at night  he never did anyone any harm but he sat and warmed himself at the kitchen fire if any work was unfinished he did it and made everything tidy that was left out of order it is a pity there are no such bogles now if anybody offered the brownie any payment even if it was only a silver penny or a new coat he would take offence and go away  other stories the old nurse had about hidden treasures and buried gold if you believed her there was hardly an old stone on the hillside but had gold under it the very sheep that fed upon the eildon hills which randal knew well had yellow teeth because there was so much gold under the grass randal had taken two scones or rolls in his pocket for dinner and ridden over to the eildon hills he had seen a rainbow touch one of them and there he hoped he would find the treasure that always lies at the tail of the rainbow but he got very soon tired of digging for it with his little dirk or dagger it blunted the dagger and he found nothing perhaps he had not marked quite the right place he thought but he looked at the teeth of the sheep and they were yellow so he had no doubt that there was a goldmine under the grass if he could find it  the old nurse knew that it was very difficult to dig up fairy gold generally something happened just when people heard their pickaxes clink on the iron pot that held the treasure a dreadful storm of thunder and lightning would break out or the burn would be flooded and rush down all red and roaring sweeping away the tools and drowning the digger or a strange man that nobody had ever seen before would come up waving his arms and crying out that the castle was on fire then the people would hurry up to the castle and find that it was not on fire at all when they returned all the earth would be just as it was before they began and they would give up in despair nobody could ever see the man again that gave the alarm  who could he be nurse randal asked  just one of the good folk i m thinking but its no weel to be speaking o them  randal knew that the good folk meant the fairies the old nurse called them the good folk for fear of offending them she would not speak much about them except now and then when the servants had been making merry  and is there any treasure hidden near fairnilee nursie asked little jean  treasure my bonny doo mair than a the men about the toon could carry away frae morning till nicht do ye no ken the auld rhyme       atween the wet ground and the dry      the gold of fairnilee doth lie  and theres the other auld rhyme       between the camp o rink         and tweed water clear      lie nine kings ransoms        for nine hundred year  randal and jean were very glad to hear so much gold was near them as would pay nine kings ransoms they took their small spades and dug little holes in the camp of rink which is a great old circle of stonework surrounded by a deep ditch on the top of a hill above the house but jean was not a very good digger and even randal grew tired they thought they would wait till they grew bigger and then find the gold  illustration chapter five     chapter vthe good folk  everybody knows theres fairies said the old nurse one night when she was bolder than usual what she said we will put in english not scotch as she spoke it but they do not like to be called fairies so the old rhyme runs       if ye call me imp or elf                                  i warn you look well to yourself      if ye call me fairy      ye ll find me quite contrary      if good neighbour you call me      then good neighbour i will be      but if you call me kindly sprite      i ll be your friend both day and night  so you must always call them good neighbours or good folk when you speak of them  did you ever see a fairy nurse asked randal  not myself but my mother knew a womanthey called her tibby dickson and her husband was a shepherd and she had a bairn as bonny a bairn as ever you saw and one day she went to the well to draw water and as she was coming back she heard a loud scream in her house then her heart leaped and fast she ran and flew to the cradle and there she saw an awful sightnot her own bairn but a withered imp with hands like a moles and a face like a frogs and a mouth from ear to ear and two great staring eyes  what was it asked jeanie in a trembling voice  a fairys bairn that had not thriven said nurse and when their bairns do not thrive they just steal honest folks children and carry them away to their own country  and wheres that said randal  its under the ground said nurse and there they have gold and silver and diamonds and theres the queen of them all thats as beautiful as the day she has yellow hairdown to her feet and she has blue eyes like the sky on a fine day and her voice like all the mavises singing in the spring and she is aye dressed in green and all her court in green and she rides a white horse with golden bells on the bridle  i would like to go there and see her said randal  oh never say that my bairn you never know who may hear you and if you go there how will you come back again and what will your mother do and jean here and me thats carried you many a time in weary arms when you were a babe  cant people come back again asked randal  some say yes and some say no there was tarn hislop that vanished away the day before all the lads and your own father went forth to that weary war at flodden and the english for once by guile won the day well tam hislop when the news came that all must arm and mount and ride he could nowhere be found it was as if the wind had carried him away high and low they sought him but there was his clothes and his jack and his sword and his spear but no tam hislop well no man heard more of him for seven whole years not till last year and then he came back sore tired he looked ay and older than when he was lost and i met him by the well and i was frightened and tam i said where have ye been this weary time i have been with them that i will not speak the nameof says he ye mean the good folk said i ye have said it says he then i went up to the house with my heart in my mouth and i met simon grieve simon i says heres tam hislop come home from the good folk i ll soon send him back to them says he and he takes a great rung and lays it about tarns shoulders calling him coward loon that ran away from the fighting and since then tam has never been seen about the place but the lairds man of gala knows them that say he was in perth the last seven years and not in fairyland at all but it was fairyland he told me and he would not lie to his own mothers halfbrothers cousin        jack a kind of breastplate        rung a staff  randal did not care much for the story of tam hislop a fellow who would let old simon grieve beat him could not be worthy of the fairy queen  randal was about thirteen now a tall boy with dark eyes black hair a brown face with the red on his cheeks he had grown up in a country where everything was magical and haunted where fairy knights rode on the leas after dark and challenged men to battle every castle had its tale of redcap the sly spirit or of the woman of the hairy hand every old mound was thought to cover hidden gold and all was so lonely the green hills rolling between river and river with no men on them nothing but sheep and grouse and plover no wonder that randal lived in a kind of dream he would lie and watch the long grass till it locked like a forest and he thought he could see elves dancing between the green grass stems that were like fairy trees he kept wishing that he too might meet the fairy queen and be taken into that other world where everything was beautiful  illustration chapter six     chapter vithe wishing well  jean said randal one midsummer day i am going to the wishing well  oh randal said jean it is so far away  i can walk it said randal and you must come too i want you jeanie it s not so very far  but mother says it is wrong to go to wishing wells jean answered  why is it wrong said randal switching at the tall foxgloves with a stick  oh she says it is a wicked thing and forbidden by the church people who go to wish there sacrifice to the spirits of the well and father francis told her that it was very wrong  father francis is a shaveling said randal i heard simon grieve say so  whats a shaveling randal  i dont know a man that does not fight i think i dont care what a shaveling says so i mean just to go and wish and i wont sacrifice anything there cant be any harm in that  but oh randal youve got your green doublet on  well why not  do you not know it angers the fairi mean the good folkthat anyone should wear green on the hill but themselves  i cannot help it said randal if i go in and change my doublet they will ask what i do that for i ll chance it green or grey and wish my wish for all that  and what are you going to wish  i m going to wish to meet the fairy queen just think how beautiful she must be dressed all in green with gold bells on her bridle and riding a white horse shod with gold i think i see her galloping through the woods and out across the hill over the heather  but you will go away with her and never see me any more said jean  no i wont or if i do i ll come back with such a horse and a sword with a gold handle im going to the wishing well come on  jean did not like to say no and off they went  randal and jean started without taking anything with them to eat they were afraid to go back to the house for food randal said they would be sure to find something somewhere the wishing well was on the top of a hill between yarrow and tweed so they took off their shoes and waded the tweed at the shallowest part and then they walked up the green grassy bank on the other side till they came to the burn of peel here they passed the old square tower of peel and the shepherd dogs came out and barked at them randal threw a stone at them and they ran away with their tails between their legs  illustration page 265  dont you think we had better go into peel and get some bannocks to eat on the way randal said jean  but randal said he was not hungry and besides the people at peel would tell the fairnilee people where they had gone  well wish for things to eat when we get to the wishing well said randal all sorts of good thingscold venison pasty and everything you like  so they began climbing the hill and they followed the peel burn it ran in and out winding this way and that and when they did get to the top of the hill jean was very tired and very hungry and she was very disappointed for she expected to see some wonderful new country at her feet and there was only a low strip of sunburnt grass and heather and then another hilltop so jean sat down and the hot sun blazed on her and the flies buzzed about her and tormented her  come on jean said randal it must be over the next hill  so poor jean got up and followed him but he walked far too fast for her when she reached the crest of the next hill she found a great cairn or pile of grey stones and beneath her lay far far below a deep valley covered with woods and a stream running through it that she had never seen before  that stream was the yarrow  randal was nowhere in sight and she did not know where to look for the wishing well if she had walked straight forward through the trees she would have come to it but she was so tired and so hungry and so hot that she sat down at the foot of the cairn and cried as if her heart would break  then she fell asleep  when jean woke it was as dark as it ever is on a midsummer night in scotland  it was a soft cloudy night not a clear night with a silver sky  jeanie heard a loud roaring close to her and the red light of a great fire was in her sleepy eyes  in the firelight she saw strange black beasts with horns plunging and leaping and bellowing and dark figures rushing about the flames it was the beasts that made the roaring they were bounding about close to the fire and sometimes in it and were all mixed in the smoke  jeanie was dreadfully frightened too frightened to scream  presently she heard the voices of men shouting on the hill below her the shouts and the barking of dogs came nearer and nearer  then a dog ran up to her and licked her face and jumped about her  illustration page 267  it was her own sheepdog yarrow  he ran back to the men who were following him and came again with one of them  it was old simon grieve very tired and so much out of breath that he could scarcely speak  jean was very glad to see him and not frightened any longer  oh jeanie my doo said simon where hae ye been a muckle gliff ye hae gien us and a weary spiel up the weary braes  jean told him all about it how she had come with randal to see the wishing well and how she had lost him and fallen asleep  and sic a nicht for you bairns to wander on the hill said simon its the nicht o st john when the guid folk hae power and theres a the lads burning the bel fires and driving the nowt through them nae less will serve them sic a nicht        nowt cattle  this was the cause of the fire jean saw and of the noise of the cattle on midsummers night the country people used to light these fires and drive the cattle through them it was an old old custom come down from heathen times  now the other men from fairnilee had gathered round jean lady ker had sent them out to look for randal and her on the hills they had heard from the good wife at peel that the children had gone up the burn and yarrow had tracked them till jean was found  illustration chapter seven     chapter viiwhere is randal  jean was found but where was randal she told the men who had come out to look for her that randal had gone on to look for the wishing well so they rolled her up in a big shepherds plaid and two of them carried jean home in the plaid while all the rest with lighted torches in their hands went to look for randal through the wood  jean was so tired that she fell asleep again in her plaid before they reached fairnilee she was wakened by the men shouting as they drew near the house to show that they were coming home lady ker was waiting at the gate and the old nurse ran down the grassy path to meet them  wheres my bairn she cried as soon as she was within call  the men said here s mistress jean and randal will be here soon they have gone to look for him  where are they looking cried nurse  just about the wishing well  the nurse gave a scream and hobbled back to lady ker  ma bairns tint she cried ma bairns tint they ll find him never the good folk have stolen him away from that weary wishing well        tint lost  hush nurse said lady ker do not frighten jean  she spoke to the men who had no doubt that randal would soon be found and brought home  so jean was put to bed where she forgot all her troubles and lady ker waited waited all night till the grey light began to come in about two in the morning  lady ker kept very still and quiet telling her beads and praying but the old nurse would never be still but was always wandering out down to the rivers edge listening for the shouts of the shepherds coming home then she would come back again and moan and wring her hands crying for her bairn  about six oclock when it was broad daylight and all the birds were singing the men returned from the hill  but randal did not come with them  then the old nurse set up a great cry as the country people do over the bed of someone who has just died  lady ker sent her away and called simon grieve to her own room  you have not found the boy yet she said very stately and pale he must have wandered over into yarrow perhaps he has gone as far as newark and passed the night at the castle or with the shepherd at foulshiels  no my lady said simon grieve some o the men went over to newark and some to foulshiels and other some down to sir john murrays at philiphaugh but theres never a word o randal in a the countryside  did you find no trace of him said lady ker sitting down suddenly in the great armchair  we went first through the wood my lady by the path to the wishing well and he had been there for the whip he carried in his hand was lying on the grass and we found this  he put his hand in his pouch and brought out a little silver crucifix that randal used always to wear round his neck on a chain  this was lying on the grass beside the wishing well my lady  then he stopped for lady ker had swooned away she was worn out with watching and with anxiety about randal  simon went and called the maids and they brought water and wine and soon lady ker came back to herself with the little silver crucifix in her hand  the old nurse was crying and making a great noise  the good folk have taken ma bairn she said this nicht o a the nichts in the year when the fairy folkpreserve us frae themhave power but they could nae take the blessed rood o grace it was beyond their strength if gipsies or robber folk frae the debatable land had carried away the bairn they would hae taken him cross and a but the guid folk have gotten him and randal ker will never never mair come hame to bonny fairnilee  what the old nurse said was what everybody thought even simon grieve shook his head and did not like it  but lady ker did not give up hope she sent horsemen through all the countryside up tweed to the crook and to talla up yarrow past catslack tower and on to the loch of saint mary up ettrick to thirlestane and buccleugh and over to gala and to branxholme in teviotdale and even to hermitage castle far away by liddel water  they rode far and rode fast and at every cottage and every tower they asked had anyone seen a boy in green but nobody had seen randal through all the countryside only a shepherd lad on foulshiels hill had heard bells ringing in the night and a sound of laughter go past him like a breeze of wind over the heather  days went by and all the country was out to look for randal down in yetholme they sought him among the gipsies and across the eden in merry carlisle and through the land debatable where the robber armstrongs and grahames lived and far down tweed past melrose and up jed water far into the cheviot hills  but there never came any word of randal he had vanished as if the earth had opened and swallowed him father francis came from melrose abbey and prayed with lady ker and gave her all the comfort he could he shook his head when he heard of the wishing well but he said that no spirit of earth or air could have power for ever over a christian soul but even when he spoke he remembered that once in seven years the fairy folk have to pay a dreadful tax one of themselves to the king of a terrible country of darkness and what if they had stolen randal to pay the tax with him  this was what troubled good father francis though like a wise man he said nothing about it and even put the thought away out of his own mind  but you may be sure that the old nurse had thought of this tax on the fairies too and that she did not hold her peace about it but spoke to everyone that would listen to her and would have spoken to the mistress if she had been allowed but when she tried to begin lady ker told her that she had put her own trust in heaven and in the saints and she gave the nurse such a look when she said that if ever jean heard of this she would send nurse away from fairnilee out of the country that the old woman was afraid and was quiet  as for poor jean she was perhaps the most unhappy of them all she thought to herself if she had refused to go with randal to the wishing well and had run in and told lady ker then randal would never have started to find the wishing well and she put herself in great danger as she fancied to find him she wandered alone on the hills seeking all the places that were believed to be haunted by fairies  at every fairy knowe as the country people called the little round green knolls in the midst of the heather jean would stoop her ear to the ground trying to hear the voices of the fairies within for it was believed that you might hear the sound of their speech and the trampling of their horses and the shouts of the fairy children but no sound came except the song of the burn flowing by and the hum of gnats in the air and the gock gock the cry of the grouse when you frighten him in the heather  then jeanie would try another way of meeting the fairies and finding randal she would walk nine times round a fairy knowe beginning from the left side because then it was fancied that the hillside would open like a door and show a path into fairyland but the hillside never opened and she never saw a single fairy not even old whuppity stoorie sit with her spinningwheel in a green glen spinning grass into gold and singing her fairy song       i once was young and fair      my eyes were bright and blue      as if the sun shone through      and golden was my hair       down to my feet it rolled      ruddy and ripe like corn      upon an autumn morn      in heavy waves of gold       now am i grey and old      and so i sit and spin      with trembling hand and thin      this metal bright and cold       i would give all the gain      these heaps of wealth untold      of hard and glittering gold      could i be young again  illustration chapter eight     chapter viiithe ill years  so autumn came and all the hillsides were golden with the heather and the red coral berries of the rowan trees hung from the boughs and were wet with the spray of the waterfalls in the burns and days grew shorter and winter came with snow but randal never came back to fairnilee season after season passed and year after year lady kers hair grew white like snow and her face thin and palefor she fasted often as was the rule of her church all this was before the reformation and she slept little praying half the night for randals sake and she went on pilgrimages to many shrines of the saints to st boswell and st rules hard by the great cathedral of st andrews on the sea nay she went across the border as far as the abbey of st albans and even to st thomass shrine of canterbury taking jean with her many a weary mile they rode over hill and dale and many an adventure they had and ran many dangers from robbers and soldiers disbanded from the wars  but at last they had to come back to fairnilee and a sad place it was and silent without the sound of randals voice in the hall and the noise of his huntinghorn in the woods none of the people wore mourning for him though they mourned in their hearts for to put on black would look as if they had given up all hope perhaps most of them thought they would never see him again but jeanie was not one who despaired  the years that had turned lady kers hair white had made jean a tall slim lassvery bonny everyone said and the country people called her the flower of tweed the yarrow folk had their flower of yarrow and why not the folk of tweedside it was now six years since randal had been lost and jeanie was grown a young woman about seventeen years old she had always kept a hope that if randal was with the fairy queen he would return perhaps in the seventh year people said on the countryside that many a man and woman had escaped out of fairyland after seven years imprisonment there  now the sixth year since randals disappearance began very badly and got worse as it went on just when spring should have been beginning in the end of february there came the most dreadful snowstorm it blew and snowed and blew again and the snow was as fine as the dust on a road in summer the strongest shepherds could not hold their own against the tempest and were smoored or smothered in the waste the flocks moved down from the hillsides down and down till all the sheep on a farm would be gathered together in a crowd under the shelter of a wood in some deep dip of the hills the storm seemed as if it would never cease for thirteen days the snow drifted and the wind blew there was nothing for the sheep to eat and if there had been hay enough it would have been impossible to carry it to them the poor beasts bit at the wool on each others backs and so many of them died that the shepherds built walls with the dead bodies to keep the wind and snow away from those that were left alive  there could be little work done on the farm that spring and summer came in so cold and wet that the corn could not ripen but was levelled to the ground then autumn was rainy and the green sheaves lay out in the fields and sprouted and rotted so that little corn was reaped and little flour could be made that year then in winter and as spring came on the people began to starve they had no grain and there were no potatoes in those days and no rice nor could corn be brought in from foreign countries so men and women and children might be seen in the fields with white pinched faces gathering nettles to make soup and digging for roots that were often little better than poison they ground the bark of the fir trees and mixed it with the little flour they could get and they ate such beasts as never are eaten except in time of famine  it is said that one very poor woman and her daughter always looked healthy and plump in these dreadful times till people began to suspect them of being witches and they were taken and charged before the sheriff with living by witchcraft and very likely they would have been burned so they confessed that they had fed ever since the famine beganon snails but there were not snails enough for all the countryside even if people had cared to eat them so many men and women died and more were very weak and ill  lady ker spent all her money in buying food for her people jean and she lived on as little as they could and were as careful as they could be they sold all the beautiful silver plate except the cup that randals father used to drink out of long ago but almost everything else was sold to buy corn  so the weary year went on and midsummer night came roundthe seventh since the night when randal was lost  then jean did what she had always meant to do in the afternoon she slipped out of the house of fairnilee taking a little bread in a basket and saying that she would go to see the farmers wife at peel which was on the other side of tweed but her mind was to go to the wishing well  there she would wish for randal back again to help his mother in the evil times and if she too passed away as he had passed out of sight and hearing then at least she might meet him in that land where he had been carried  illustration page 281  how strange it seemed to jean to be doing everything over again that she had done seven years before then she had been a little girl and it had been hard work for her to climb up the side of the peel burn now she walked lightly and quickly for she was tall and wellgrown soon she reached the crest of the first hill and remembered how she had sat down there and cried when she was a child and how the flies had tormented her they were buzzing and teasing still for good times or bad make no difference to them as long as the sun shines then she reached the cairn at the top of the next hill and far below her lay the forest and deep within it ran yarrow glittering like silver  illustration page 282  jean paused a few moments and then struck into a green path which led through the wood the path wound beneath dark pines their topmost branches were red in the evening light but the shade was black beneath them soon the path reached a little grassy glade and there among cold wet grasses was the wishing well it was almost hidden by the grass and looked very black and cool and deep a tiny trickle of water flowed out of it flowed down to join the yarrow the trees about it had scraps of rags and other things pinned to them offerings made by the country people to the spirits of the well  illustration chapter nine     chapter ixthe white roses  jeanie sat down beside the well she wished her three wishes to see randal to win him back from fairyland and to help the people in the famine then she knelt on the grass and looked down into the wellwater at first she saw nothing but the smooth black water with little waves trembling in it then the water began to grow bright within as if the sun was shining far far below then it grew as clear as crystal and she saw through it like a glass into a new countrya beautiful country with a wide green plain and in the midst of the plain a great castle with golden flags floating from the tops of all the towers then she heard a curious whispering noise that thrilled and murmured as if the music of all the trees that the wind blows through the world were in her ears as if the noise of all the waves of every sea and the rustling of heatherbells on every hill and the singing of all birds were sounding low and sweet far far away then she saw a great company of knights and ladies dressed in green ride up to the castle and one knight rode apart from the rest on a milkwhite steed they all went into the castle gates but this knight rode slowly and sadly behind the others with his head bowed on his breast  then the musical sounds were still and the castle and the plain seemed to wave in the water next they quite vanished and the well grew dim and then grew dark and black and smooth as it had been before still she looked and the little well bubbled up with sparkling foam and so became still again like a mirror till jeanie could see her own face in it and beside her face came the reflection of another face a young mans dark and sad and beautiful the lips smiled at her and then jeanie knew it was randal she thought he must be looking over her shoulder and she leaped up with a cry and glanced round  but she was all alone and the wood about her was empty and silent the light had gone out of the sky which was pale like silver and overhead she saw the evening star  then jeanie thought all was over she had seen randal as if it had been in a glass and she hardly knew him he was so much older and his face was so sad she sighed and turned to go away over the hills back to fairnilee  but her feet did not seem to carry her the way she wanted to go it seemed as if something within her were moving her in a kind of dream she felt herself going on through the forest she did not know where deeper into the wood she went and now it grew so dark that she saw scarce anything only she felt the fragrance of briar roses and it seemed to her that she was guided towards these roses then she knew there was a hand in her hand though she saw nobody and the hand seemed to lead her on and she came to an open place in the forest and there the silver light fell clear from the sky and she saw a great shadowy rose tree covered with white wild roses  the hand was still in her hand and jeanie began to wish for nothing so much in the world as to gather some of these roses she put out her hand and she plucked one and there before her stood a strange creaturea dwarf dressed in yellow and red with a very angry face  who are you he cried that pluck my roses without my will  and who are you said jeanie trembling and what right have you on the hills of this world  then she made the holy sign of the cross and the face of the elf grew black and the light went out of the sky  she only saw the faint glimmer of the white flowers and a kind of shadow standing where the dwarf stood  i bid you tell me said jeanie whether you are a christian man or a spirit that dreads the holy sign and she crossed him again  now all grew dark as the darkest winters night the air was warm and deadly still and heavy with the scent of the fairy flowers  in the blackness and the silence jeanie made the sacred sign for the third time then a clear fresh wind blew on her face and the forest boughs were shaken and the silver light grew and gained on the darkness and she began to see a shape standing where the dwarf had stood it was far taller than the dwarf and the light grew and grew and a star looked down out of the night and jean saw randal standing by her and she kissed him and he kissed her and he put his hand in hers and they went out of the wood together they came to the crest of the hill and the cairn far below them they saw the tweed shining through an opening among the trees and the lights in the farm of peel and they heard the nightbirds crying and the bells of the sheep ringing musically as they wandered through the fragrant heather on the hills  illustration page 287  illustration chapter ten     chapter xout of fairyland  you may fancy if you can what joy there was in fairnilee when randal came home they quite forgot the hunger and the hard times and the old nurse laughed and cried over her bairn that had grown into a tall strong young man and to lady ker it was all one as if her husband had come again as he was when first she knew him long ago for randal had his face and his eyes and the very sound of his voice they could hardly believe he was not a spirit and they clasped his hands and hung on his neck and could not keep their eyes off him this was the end of all their sorrow and it was as if randal had come back from the dead so that no people in the world were ever so happy as they were next day when the sun shone down on the tweed and the green trees that rustle in the wind round fairnilee but in the evening when the old nurse was out of the way randal sat between his mother and jean and they each held his hands as if they could not let him go for fear he should vanish away from them again and they would turn round anxiously if anything stirred for fear it should be the two white deer that sometimes were said to come for people escaped from fairyland and then these people must rise and follow them and never return any more but the white deer never came for randal  illustration page 290  so he told them all his adventures and all that had happened to him since that midsummer night seven long years ago  it had been with him as it was with jean he had gone to the wishing well and wished to see the fairy queen and fairyland and he had seen the beautiful castle in the well and a beautiful womans face had floated up to meet his on the water then he had gathered the white roses and then he heard a great sound of horses feet and of bells jingling and a lady rode up the very lady he had seen in the well she had a white horse and she was dressed in green and she beckoned to randal to mount on her horse with her before him on the pillion and the bells on the bridle rang and the horse flew faster than the wind  illustration page 291  so they rode and rode through the summer night and they came to a desert place and living lands were left far behind then the fairy queen showed him three paths one steep and narrow and beset with briars and thorns that was the road to goodness and happiness but it was little trodden or marked with the feet of people that had come and gone  and there was a wide smooth road that went through fields of lilies and that was the path of easy living and pleasure  the third path wound about the wild hillside through ferns and heather and that was the way to elfland and that way they rode and still they rode through a country of dark night and they crossed great black rivers and they saw neither sun nor moon but they heard the roaring of the sea from that country they came into the light and into the beautiful garden that lies round the castle of the fairy queen there they lived in a noble company of gallant knights and fair ladies all seemed very mirthful and they rode and hunted and danced and it was never dark night nor broad daylight but like early summer dawn before the sun has risen  there randal said that he had quite forgotten his mother and jean and the world where he was born and fairnilee  but one day he happened to see a beautiful golden bottle of a strange shape all set with diamonds and he opened it there was in it a sweetsmelling water as clear as crystal and he poured it into his hand and passed his hand over his eyes now this water had the power to destroy the glamour in fairyland and make people see it as it really was and when randal touched his eyes with it lo everything was changed in a moment he saw that nothing was what it had seemed the gold vanished from the embroidered curtains the light grew dim and wretched like a misty winter day  illustration page 293  the fairy queen that had seemed so happy and beautiful in her bright dress was a weary pale woman in black with a melancholy face and melancholy eyes she looked as if she had been there for thousands of years always longing for the sunlight and the earth and the wind and rain there were sleepy poppies twisted in her hair instead of a golden crown and the knights and ladies were changed they looked but half alive and some in place of their gay green robes were dressed in rusty mail pierced with spears and stained with blood and some were in burial robes of white and some in dresses torn or dripping with water or marked with the burning of fire all were dressed strangely in some ancient fashion their weapons were oldfashioned too unlike any that randal had ever seen on earth and their festivals were not of dainty meats but of cold tasteless flesh and of beans and pulse and such things as the old heathens before the coming of the gospel used to offer to the dead it was dreadful to see them at such feasts and dancing and riding and pretending to be merry with hollow faces and unhappy eyes  and randal wearied of fairyland which now that he saw it clearly looked like a great unending stretch of sand and barren grassy country beside a grey sea where there was no tide all the woods were of black cypress trees and poplar and a wind from the sea drove a seamist through them white and cold and it blew through the open courts of the fairy castle  so randal longed more and more for the old earth he had left and the changes of summer and autumn and the streams of tweed and the hills and his friends then the voice of jeanie had come down to him sounding from far away and he was sent up by the fairy queen in a fairy form as a hideous dwarf to frighten her away from the white roses in the enchanted forest  but her goodness and her courage had saved him for he was a christened knight and not a man of the fairy world and he had taken his own form again beneath her hand when she signed him with the cross and here he was safe and happy at home at fairnilee  illustration chapter eleven     chapter xithe fairy bottle  we soon grow used to the greatest changes and almost forget the things that we were accustomed to before in a day or two randal had nearly forgotten what a dull life he had lived in fairyland after he had touched his eyes with the strange water in the fairy bottle he remembered the long grey sands and the cold mist and the white faces of the strange people and the gloomy queen no more than you remember the dream you dreamed a week ago but he did notice that fairnilee was not the happy place it had been before he went away here too the faces were pinched and white and the people looked hungry and he missed many things that he remembered the silver cups and plates and tankards and the dinners were not like what they had been but only a little thin soup and some oatmeal cakes and trout taken from the tweed the beef and ale of old times were not to be found even in the houses of the richer people  very soon randal heard all about the famine you may be sure the old nurse was ready to tell him all the saddest stories  full many a place in evil case where joy was wont afore oh wi humes that dwell in leader braes and scotts that dwell in yarrow  and the old woman would croon her old prophecies and tell them how thomas the rhymer that lived in ercildoune had foretold all this and she would wish they could find these hidden treasures that the rhymes were full of and that maybe were lyingwho knewquite near them on their own lands  where is the gold of fairnilee she would cry and oh randal can you no dig for it and find it and buy corn out of england for the poor folk that are dying at your doors       atween the wet ground and the dry      the gold o fairnilee doth lie  there it is with the sun never glinting on it there it may bide till the judgmentday and no man the better for it       between the camp o rink      and tweed water clear      lie nine kings ransoms      for nine hundred year  i doubt its fairy gold nurse said randal and would all turn black when it saw the sun it would just be like this bottle the only thing i brought with me out of fairyland  then randal put his hand in his velvet pouch and brought out a curious small bottle it was shaped like this  illustration page 298  and was made of something that none of them had ever seen before it was black and you could see the light through it and there were green and yellow spots and streaks on it        in bottles like this the old romans used to keep their      tears for their dead friends  that ugly bottle looked like gold and diamonds when i found it in fairyland said randal and the water in it smelled as sweet as roses but when i touched my eyes with it a drop that ran into my mouth was as salt as the sea and immediately everything changed the gold bottle became this glass thing and the fairies became like folk dead and the sky grew grey and all turned waste and ugly thats the way with fairy gold nurse and if you found it even it would all be dry leaves and black bits of coal before the sun set  maybe so and maybe no said the old nurse the gold o fairnilee may no be fairy gold but just wealth o this world that folk buried here lang syne but noo randal ma bairn i maun gang out and see ma sisters sons dochter thats lying sair sick o the kincough at rink and take her some of the physic that i gae you and jean when you were bairns        kincough whooping cough  so the old nurse went out and randal and jean began to be sorry for the child she was going to visit for they remembered the taste of the physic that the old nurse made by boiling the bark of eldertree branches and i remember it too for it was the very nastiest thing that ever was tasted and did nobody any good after all  then randal and jean walked out strolling along without much noticing where they went and talking about the pleasant days when they were children  illustration chapter twelve     chapter xiiat the catrail  they had climbed up the slope of a hill and they came to a broad old ditch beneath the shade of a wood of pine trees below them was a wide marsh all yellow with marsh flowers and above them was a steep slope made of stones now the dry ditch where they sat down on the grass looking towards the tweed with their backs to the hill was called the catrail it ran all through that country and must have been made by men very long ago nobody knows who made it nor why they did not know in randals time and they do not know now they do not even know what the name catrail means but that is what it has always been called the steep slope of stone above them was named the camp of rink it is a round place like a ring and no doubt it was built by the old britons when they fought against the romans many hundreds of years ago the stones of which it is built are so large that we cannot tell how men moved them but it is a very pleasant happy place on a warm summer day like the day when randal and jean sat there with the daisies at their feet and the wild doves cooing above their heads and the rabbits running in and out among the ferns  jean and randal talked about this and that chiefly of how some money could be got to buy corn and cattle for the people randal was in favour of crossing the border at night and driving away cattle from the english side according to the usual custom  every day i expect to see a pair of spurs in a dish for all our dinner said randal  that was the sign the lady of the house in the forest used to give her men when all the beef was done and more had to be got by fighting  but jeanie would not hear of randal taking spear and jack and putting himself in danger by fighting the english they were her own people after all though she could not remember them and the days before she was carried out of england by simon grieve  then said randal am i to go back to fairyland and fetch more gold like this ugly thing and he felt in his pocket for the fairy bottle  but it was not in his pocket  what have i done with my fairy treasure cried randal jumping up then he stood still quite suddenly as if he saw something strange  he touched jean on the shoulder making a sign to her not to speak  jean rose quietly and looked where randal pointed and this was what she saw  she looked over a corner of the old grassy ditch just where the marsh and the yellow flowers came nearest to it  here there stood three tall grey stones each about as high as a man between them with her back to the single stone and between the two others facing randal and jean the old nurse was kneeling  if she had looked up she could hardly have seen randal and jean for they were within the ditch and only their eyes were on the level of the rampart  besides she did not look up she was groping in the breast of her dress for something and her eyes were on the ground  what can the old woman be doing whispered randal why she has got my fairy bottle in her hand  then he remembered how he had shown her the bottle and how she had gone out without giving it back to him  jean and he watched and kept very quiet  they saw the old nurse still kneeling take the stopper out of the black strange bottle and turn the open mouth gently on her hand then she carefully put in the stopper and rubbed her eyes with the palm of her hand then she crawled along in their direction very slowly as if she were looking for something in the grass  then she stopped still looking very closely at the grass  next she jumped to her feet with a shrill cry clapping her hands and then she turned and was actually running along the edge of the marsh towards fairnilee  nurse shouted randal and she stopped suddenly in a fright and let the fairy bottle fall  it struck on a stone and broke to pieces with a jingling sound and the few drops of strange water in it ran away into the grass  oh ma bairns ma bairns what have you made me do cried the old nurse pitifully the fairy gift is broken and maybe the gold of fairnilee that my eyes have looked on will neer be seen again  illustration chapter thirteen     chapter xiiithe gold of fairnilee  randal and jean went to the old woman and comforted her though they could not understand what she meant she cried and sobbed and threw her arms about but by degrees they found out all the story when randal had told her how all he saw in fairyland was changed after he had touched his eyes with the water from the bottle the old woman remembered many tales that she had heard about some charm known to the fairies which helped them to find things hidden and to see through walls and stones then she had got the bottle from randal and had stolen out meaning to touch her eyes with the water and try whether that was the charm and whether she could find the treasure spoken of in the old rhymes she went       between the camp o rink      and tweed water clear  and to the place which lay       between the wet land and the dry  that is between the marsh and the catrail  here she had noticed the three great stones which made a kind of chamber on the hillside and here she had anointed her eyes with the salt water of the bottle of tears  then she had seen through the grass she declared and through the upper soil and she had beheld great quantities of gold and she was running with the bottle to tell randal and to touch his eyes with the water that he might see it also but out of fairyland the strange water only had its magical power while it was still wet on the eyelashes this the old nurse soon found for she went back to the three standing stones and looked and saw nothing only grass and daisies and the fairy bottle was broken and all the water spilt  this was her story and randal did not know what to believe but so many strange things had happened to him that one more did not seem impossible so he and jean took the old nurse home and made her comfortable in her room and jean put her to bed and got her a little wine and an oatcake  then randal very quietly locked the door outside and put the key in his pocket it would have been of no use to tell the old nurse to be quiet about what she thought she had seen  by this time it was late and growing dark but that night there would be a moon  after supper of which there was very little lady ker went to bed but randal and jean slipped out into the moonlight they took a sack with them and randal carried a pickaxe and a spade they walked quickly to the three great stones and waited for a while to hear if all was quiet then jean threw a white cloak round her and stole about the edges of the camp and the wood she knew that if any wandering man came by he would not stay long where such a figure was walking the night was cool the dew lay on the deep fern there was a sweet smell from the grass and from the pine wood  in the meantime randal was digging a long trench with his pickaxe above the place where the old woman had knelt as far as he could remember it  he worked very hard and when he was in the trench up to his knees his pickaxe struck against a stone he dug round it with the spade and came to a layer of black burnt ashes of bones beneath these which he scraped away was the large flat stone on which his pick had struck it was a wide slab of red sandstone and randal soon saw that it was the lid of a great stone coffin such as the ploughshare sometimes strikes against when men are ploughing the fields in the border country  randal had seen these before when he was a boy and he knew that there was never much in them except ashes and one or two rough pots of burnt clay  he was much disappointed  it had seemed as if he was really coming to something and behold it was only an old stone coffin  however he worked on till he had cleared the whole of the stone coffinlid it was a very large stone chest and must have been made randal thought for the body of a very big man  with the point of his pickaxe he raised the lid  in the moonlight he saw something of a strange shape  he put down his hand and pulled it out  it was an image in metal about a foot high and represented a beautiful woman with wings on her shoulders sitting on a wheel  randal had never seen an image like this but in an old book which belonged to the monks of melrose he had seen when he was a boy a picture of such a woman  the monks had told him that she was fortune with her swift wings that carry her from one person to another as luck changes and with her wheel that she turns with the turning of chance in the world  the image was very heavy randal rubbed some of the dirt and red clay off and found that the metal was yellow he cut it with his knife it was soft he cleaned a piece which shone bright and unrusted in the moonlight and touched it with his tongue then he had no doubt any more the image was gold  illustration page 308  randal knew now that the old nurse had not been mistaken with the help of the fairy water she had seen the gold of fairnilee he called very softly to jeanie who came glimmering in her white robes through the wood looking herself like a fairy he put the image in her hand and set his finger on his lips to show that she must not speak  then he went back to the great stone coffin and began to grope in it with his hands there was much earth in it that had slowly sifted through during the many years that it had been buried but there was also a great round bowl of metal and a square box  randal got out the bowl first it was covered with a green rust and had a lid in short it was a large ancient kettle such as soldiers use in camp randal got the lid off and behold it was all full of very ancient gold coins not greek nor roman but like such in use in briton before julius caesar came  the box was of iron on the lid in the moonshine jeanie could read the letters s p q r but she did not know what they meant the box had been locked and chained and clamped with iron bars but all was so rusty that the bars were easily broken and the lid torn off  illustration page 309  then the moon shone on bars of gold and on great plates and dishes of gold and silver marked with letters and with what randal thought were crests many of the cups were studded with red and green and blue stones and there were beautiful plates and dishes purple gold and green and one of these fell and broke into a thousand pieces for it was of some strange kind of glass there were three gold swordhilts carved wonderfully into the figures of strange beasts with wings and heads like lions  randal and jean looked at it and marvelled and jean sang in a low sweet voice       between the camp o rink      and tweed water clear      lie nine kings ransoms      for nine hundred year  nobody ever saw so much treasure in all broad scotland  jean and randal passed the rest of the night in hiding what they had found part they hid in the secret chamber of fairnilee of which only jean and lady ker and randal knew the secret the rest they stowed away in various places then randal filled the earth into the trench and cast wood on the place and set fire to the wood so that next day there was nothing there but ashes and charred earth  you will not need to be told what randal did now that he had treasure in plenty some he sold in france to the king henry ii and some in rome to the pope and with the money which they gave him he bought corn and cattle in england enough to feed all his neighbours and stock the farms and sow the fields for next year and fairnilee became a very rich and fortunate house for randal married jean and soon their children were playing on the banks of the tweed and rolling down the grassy slope to the river to bathe on hot days and the old nurse lived long and happy among her new bairns and often she told them how it was she who really found the gold of fairnilee  illustration page 311  you may wonder what the gold was and how it came there probably father francis the good melrose monk was right he said that the iron box and the gold image of fortune and the kettle full of coins had belonged to some regiment of the roman army the kettle and the coins they must have taken from the britons the box and all the plate were their own and brought from italy then they in their turn must have been defeated by some of the fierce tribes beyond the roman wall and must have lost all their treasure that must have been buried by the victorious enemy and they again must have been driven from their strong camp at rink either by some foes from the north or by a new roman army from the south so all the gold lay at fairnilee for many hundred years never quite forgotten as the old rhyme showed but never found till it was discovered in their sore need by the old nurse and randal and jean  as for randal and jean they lived to be old and died on one day and they are buried at dryburgh in one tomb and a green tree grows over them and the tweed goes murmuring past their grave and past the grave of sir walter scott  the end
