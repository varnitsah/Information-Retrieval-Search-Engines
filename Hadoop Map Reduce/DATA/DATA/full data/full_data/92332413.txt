92332413	passages from the french and italian notebooks  of  nathaniel hawthorne    vol i    passages from hawthornes notebooks in france and italy     france   hotel de louvre january 6th 1858on tuesday morning our dozen trunks and halfdozen carpetbags being already packed and labelled we began to prepare for our journey two or three hours before light two cabs were at the door by half past six and at seven we set out for the london bridge station while it was still dark and bitterly cold  there were already many people in the streets growing more numerous as we drove cityward and in newgate street there was such a number of marketcarts that we almost came to a dead lock with some of them  at the station we found several persons who were apparently going in the same train with us sitting round the fire of the waitingroom  since i came to england there has hardly been a morning when i should have less willingly bestirred myself before daylight so sharp and inclement was the atmosphere  we started at half past eight having taken through tickets to paris by way of folkestone and boulogne  a footwarmer a long flat tin utensil full of hot water was put into the carriage just before we started but it did not make us more than half comfortable and the frost soon began to cloud the windows and shut out the prospect so that we could only glance at the green fieldsimmortally green whatever winter can do against themand at here and there a stream or pool with the ice forming on its borders  it was the first cold weather of a very mild season  the snow began to fall in scattered and almost invisible flakes and it seemed as if we had stayed our english welcome out and were to find nothing genial and hospitable there any more  at folkestone we were deposited at a railway station close upon a shingly beach on which the sea broke in foam and which j reported as strewn with shells and starfish behind was the town with an old church in the midst and close at hand the pier where lay the steamer in which we were to embark  but the air was so wintry that i had no heart to explore the town or pick up shells with j on the beach so we kept within doors during the two hours of our stay now and then looking out of the windows at a fishingboat or two as they pitched and rolled with an ugly and irregular motion such as the british channel generally communicates to the craft that navigate it  at about one oclock we went on board and were soon under steam at a rate that quickly showed a long line of the white cliffs of albion behind us  it is a very dusky white by the by and the cliffs themselves do not seem at a distance to be of imposing height and have too even an outline to be picturesque  as we increased our distance from england the french coast came more and more distinctly in sight with a low wavy outline not very well worth looking at except because it was the coast of france  indeed i looked at it but little for the wind was bleak and boisterous and i went down into the cabin where i found the fire very comfortable and several people were stretched on sofas in a state of placid wretchedness     i have never suffered from seasickness but had been somewhat apprehensive of this rough strait between england and france which seems to have more potency over peoples stomachs than ten times the extent of sea in other quarters  our passage was of two hours at the end of which we landed on french soil and found ourselves immediately in the clutches of the customhouse officers who however merely made a momentary examination of my passport and allowed us to pass without opening even one of our carpetbags  the great bulk of our luggage had been registered through to paris for examination after our arrival there  we left boulogne in about an hour after our arrival when it was already a darkening twilight  the weather had grown colder than ever since our arrival in sunny france and the night was now setting in wickedly black and dreary  the frost hardened upon the carriage windows in such thickness that i could scarcely scratch a peephole through it but from such glimpses as i could catch the aspect of the country seemed pretty much to resemble the december aspect of my dear native landbroad bare brown fields with streaks of snow at the foot of ridges and along fences or in the furrows of ploughed soil  there was ice wherever there happened to be water to form it  we had feetwarmers in the carriage but the cold crept in nevertheless and i do not remember hardly in my life a more disagreeable short journey than this my first advance into french territory  my impression of france will always be that it is an arctic region  at any season of the year the tract over which we passed yesterday must be an uninteresting one as regards its natural features and the only adornment as far as i could observe which art has given it consists in straight rows of very stifflooking and slenderstemmed trees  in the dusk they resembled poplartrees  weary and frostbittenmorally if not physicallywe reached amiens in three or four hours and here i underwent much annoyance from the french railway officials and attendants who i believe did not mean to incommode me but rather to forward my purposes as far as they well could  if they would speak slowly and distinctly i might understand them well enough being perfectly familiar with the written language and knowing the principles of its pronunciation but in their customary rapid utterance it sounds like a string of mere gabble  when left to myself therefore i got into great difficulties     it gives a taciturn personage like myself a new conception as to the value of speech even to him when he finds himself unable either to speak or understand  finally being advised on all hands to go to the hotel du rhin we were carried thither in an omnibus rattling over a rough pavement through an invisible and frozen town and on our arrival were ushered into a handsome salon as chill as a tomb  they made a little bit of a woodfire for us in a low and deep chimneyhole which let a hundred times more heat escape up the flue than it sent into the room  in the morning we sallied forth to see the cathedral  the aspect of the old french town was very different from anything english whiter infinitely cleaner higher and narrower houses the entrance to most of which seeming to be through a great gateway affording admission into a central courtyard a public square with a statue in the middle and another statue in a neighboring street  we met priests in threecornered hats long frockcoats and kneebreeches also soldiers and gendarmes and peasants and children clattering over the pavements in wooden shoes  it makes a great impression of outlandishness to see the signs over the shop doors in a foreign tongue  if the cold had not been such as to dull my sense of novelty and make all my perceptions torpid i should have taken in a set of new impressions and enjoyed them very much  as it was i cared little for what i saw but yet had life enough left to enjoy the cathedral of amiens which has many features unlike those of english cathedrals  it stands in the midst of the cold white town and has a highshouldered look to a spectator accustomed to the minsters of england which cover a great space of ground in proportion to their height  the impression the latter gives is of magnitude and mass this french cathedral strikes one as lofty  the exterior is venerable though but little timeworn by the action of the atmosphere and statues still keep their places in numerous niches almost as perfect as when first placed there in the thirteenth century  the principal doors are deep elaborately wrought pointed arches and the interior seemed to us at the moment as grand as any that we had seen and to afford as vast an idea of included space it being of such an airy height and with no screen between the chancel and nave as in all the english cathedrals  we saw the differences too betwixt a church in which the same form of worship for which it was originally built is still kept up and those of england where it has been superseded for centuries for here in the recess of every arch of the side aisles beneath each lofty window there was a chapel dedicated to some saint and adorned with great marble sculptures of the crucifixion and with pictures execrably bad in all cases and various kinds of gilding and ornamentation  immensely tall wax candles stand upon the altars of these chapels and before one sat a woman with a great supply of tapers one of which was burning  i suppose these were to be lighted as offerings to the saints by the true believers artificial flowers were hung at some of the shrines or placed under glass  in every chapel moreover there was a confessionala little oaken structure about as big as a sentrybox with a closed part for the priest to sit in and an open one for the penitent to kneel at and speak through the openwork of the priests closet  monuments mural and others to longdeparted worthies and images of the saviour the virgin and saints were numerous everywhere about the church and in the chancel there was a great deal of quaint and curious sculpture fencing in the holy of holies where the high altar stands  there is not much painted glass one or two very rich and beautiful rosewindows however that looked antique and the great eastern window which i think is modern  the pavement has probably never been renewed as one piece of work since the structure was erected and is footworn by the successive generations though still in excellent repair  i saw one of the small square stones in it bearing the date of 1597 and no doubt there are a thousand older ones  it was gratifying to find the cathedral in such good condition without any traces of recent repair and it is perhaps a mark of difference between french and english character that the revolution in the former country though all religious worship disappears before it does not seem to have caused such violence to ecclesiastical monuments as the reformation and the reign of puritanism in the latter i did not see a mutilated shrine or even a brokennosed image in the whole cathedral  but probably the very rage of the english fanatics against idolatrous tokens and their smashing blows at them were symptoms of sincerer religious faith than the french were capable of these last did not care enough about their saviour to beat down his crucified image and they preserved the works of sacred art for the sake only of what beauty there was in them  while we were in the cathedral we saw several persons kneeling at their devotions on the steps of the chancel and elsewhere  one dipped his fingers in the holy water at the entrance by the by i looked into the stone basin that held it and saw it full of ice  could not all that sanctity at least keep it thawed  priestsjolly fat meanlooking fellows in white robeswent hither and thither but did not interrupt or accost us  there were other peculiarities which i suppose i shall see more of in my visits to other churches but now we were all glad to make our stay as brief as possible the atmosphere of the cathedral being so bleak and its stone pavement so icy cold beneath our feet  we returned to the hotel and the chambermaid brought me a book in which she asked me to inscribe my name age profession country destination and the authorization under which i travelled  after the freedom of an english hotel so much greater than even that of an american one where they make you disclose your name this is not so pleasant  we left amiens at half past one and i can tell as little of the country between that place and paris as between boulogne and amiens  the windows of our railway carriage were already frosted with french breath when we got into it and the ice grew thicker and thicker continually  i tried at various times to rub a peephole through as before but the ice immediately shot its crystallized tracery over it again and indeed there was little or nothing to make it worth while to look out so bleak was the scene  now and then a chateau too far off for its characteristics to be discerned now and then a church with a tall gray tower and a little peak atop here and there a village or a town which we could not well see  at sunset there was just that clear cold wintry sky which i remember so well in america but have never seen in england  at five we reached paris and were suffered to take a carriage to the hotel de louvre without any examination of the little luggage we had with us  arriving we took a suite of apartments and the waiter immediately lighted a wax candle in each separate room  we might have dined at the table dhote but preferred the restaurant connected with and within the hotel  all the dishes were very delicate and a vast change from the simple english system with its joints shoulders beefsteaks and chops but i doubt whether english cookery for the very reason that it is so simple is not better for mens moral and spiritual nature than french  in the former case you know that you are gratifying your animal needs and propensities and are duly ashamed of it but in dealing with these french delicacies you delude yourself into the idea that you are cultivating your taste while satisfying your appetite  this last however it requires a good deal of perseverance to accomplish  in the cathedral at amiens there were printed lists of acts of devotion posted on the columns such as prayers at the shrines of certain saints whereby plenary indulgences might be gained  it is to be observed however that all these external forms were necessarily accompanied with true penitence and religious devotion   hotel de louvre january 8thit was so fearfully cold this morning that i really felt little or no curiosity to see the city     until after one oclock therefore i knew nothing of paris except the lights which i had seen beneath our window the evening before far far downward in the narrow rue st honore and the rumble of the wheels which continued later than i was awake to hear it and began again before dawn  i could see too tall houses that seemed to be occupied in every story and that had windows on the steep roofs  one of these houses is six stories high  this rue st honore is one of the old streets in paris and is that in which henry iv was assassinated but it has not in this part of it the aspect of antiquity  after one oclock we all went out and walked along the rue de rivoli     we are here right in the midst of paris and close to whatever is best known to those who hear or read about itthe louvre being across the street the palais royal but a little way off the tuileries joining to the louvre the place de la concorde just beyond verging on which is the champs elysees  we looked about us for a suitable place to dine and soon found the restaurant des echelles where we entered at a venture and were courteously received  it has a handsomely furnished saloon much set off with gilding and mirrors and appears to be frequented by english and americans its carte a bound volume being printed in english as well as french      it was now nearly four oclock and too late to visit the galleries of the louvre or to do anything else but walk a little way along the street  the splendor of paris so far as i have seen takes me altogether by surprise such stately edifices prolonging themselves in unwearying magnificence and beauty and ever and anon a long vista of a street with a column rising at the end of it or a triumphal arch wrought in memory of some grand event  the light stone or stucco wholly untarnished by smoke and soot puts london to the blush if a blush could be seen on its dingy face but indeed london is not to be mentioned nor compared even with paris  i never knew what a palace was till i had a glimpse of the louvre and the tuileries never had my idea of a city been gratified till i trod these stately streets  the life of the scene too is infinitely more picturesque than that of london with its monstrous throng of grave faces and black coats whereas here you see soldiers and priests policemen in cocked hats zonaves with turbans long mantles and bronzed halfmoorish faces and a great many people whom you perceive to be outside of your experience and know them ugly to look at and fancy them villanous  truly i have no sympathies towards the french people their eyes do not win me nor do their glances melt and mingle with mine  but they do grand and beautiful things in the architectural way and i am grateful for it  the place de la concorde is a most splendid square large enough for a nation to erect trophies in of all its triumphs and on one side of it is the tuileries on the opposite side the champs elysees and on a third the seine adown which we saw large cakes of ice floating beneath the arches of a bridge  the champs elysees so far as i saw it had not a grassy soil beneath its trees but the bare earth white and dusty  the very dust if i saw nothing else would assure me that i was out of england  we had time only to take this little walk when it began to grow dusk and being so pitilessly cold we hurried back to our hotel  thus far i think what i have seen of paris is wholly unlike what i expected but very like an imaginary picture which i had conceived of st petersburg new bright magnificent and desperately cold  a great part of this architectural splendor is due to the present emperor who has wrought a great change in the aspect of the city within a very few years  a traveller if he looks at the thing selfishly ought to wish him a long reign and arbitrary power since he makes it his policy to illustrate his capital with palatial edifices which are however better for a stranger to look at than for his own people to pay for  we have spent today chiefly in seeing some of the galleries of the louvre  i must confess that the vast and beautiful edifice struck me far more than the pictures sculpture and curiosities which it contains the shell more than the kernel inside such noble suites of rooms and halls were those through which we first passed containing egyptian and farther onward greek and roman antiquities the walls cased in variegated marbles the ceilings glowing with beautiful frescos the whole extended into infinite vistas by mirrors that seemed like vacancy and multiplied everything forever  the picturerooms are not so brilliant and the pictures themselves did not greatly win upon me in this one day  many artists were employed in copying them especially in the rooms hung with the productions of french painters  not a few of these copyists were females most of them were young men picturesquely mustached and bearded but some were elderly who it was pitiful to think had passed through life without so much success as now to paint pictures of their own  from the pictures we went into a suite of rooms where are preserved many relics of the ancient and later kings of france more relics of the elder ones indeed than i supposed had remained extant through the revolution the french seem to like to keep memorials of whatever they do and of whatever their forefathers have done even if it be ever so little to their credit and perhaps they do not take matters sufficiently to heart to detest anything that has ever happened  what surprised me most were the golden sceptre and the magnificent sword and other gorgeous relics of charlemagnea person whom i had always associated with a sheepskin cloak  there were suits of armor and weapons that had been worn and handled by a great many of the french kings and a religious book that had belonged to st louis a dressingglass most richly set with precious stones which formerly stood on the toilettable of catherine de medici and in which i saw my own face where hers had been  and there were a thousand other treasures just as well worth mentioning as these  if each monarch could have been summoned from hades to claim his own relics we should have had the halls full of the old childerics charleses bourbons and capets henrys and louises snatching with ghostly hands at sceptres swords armor and mantles and napoleon would have seen apparently almost everything that personally belonged to himhis coat his cocked hats his campdesk his fieldbed his knives forks and plates and even a lock of his hair  i must let it all go  these things cannot be reproduced by pen and ink   hotel de louvre january 9th    last evening mr fezaudie called he spoke very freely respecting the emperor and the hatred entertained against him in france but said that he is more powerful that is more firmly fixed as a ruler than ever the first napoleon was  we who look back upon the first napoleon as one of the eternal facts of the past a great bowlder in history cannot well estimate how momentary and insubstantial the great captain may have appeared to those who beheld his rise out of obscurity  they never perhaps took the reality of his career fairly into their minds before it was over  the present emperor i believe has already been as long in possession of the supreme power as his uncle was  i should like to see him and may perhaps doso as he is our neighbor across the way  this morning miss  the celebrated astronomical lady called  she had brought a letter of introduction to me while consul and her purpose now was to see if we could take her as one of our party to rome whither she likewise is bound  we readily consented for she seems to be a simple strong healthyhumored woman who will not fling herself as a burden on our shoulders and my only wonder is that a person evidently so able to take care of herself should wish to have an escort  we issued forth at about eleven and went down the rue st honore which is narrow and has houses of five or six stories on either side between which run the streets like a gully in a rock  one face of our hotel borders and looks on this street  after going a good way we came to an intersection with another street the name of which i forget but at this point ravaillac sprang at the carriage of henry iv and plunged his dagger into him  as we went down the rue st honore it grew more and more thronged and with a meaner class of people  the houses still were high and without the shabbiness of exterior that distinguishes the old part of london being of lightcolored stone but i never saw anything that so much came up to my idea of a swarming city as this narrow crowded and rambling street  thence we turned into the rue st denis which is one of the oldest streets in paris and is said to have been first marked out by the track of the saints footsteps where after his martyrdom he walked along it with his head under his arm in quest of a burialplace  this legend may account for any crookedness of the street for it could not reasonably be asked of a headless man that he should walk straight  through some other indirections we at last found the rue bergere down which i went with j in quest of hottinguer et co the bankers while the rest of us went along the boulevards towards the church of the madeleine     this business accomplished j and i threaded our way back and overtook the rest of the party still a good distance from the madeleine  i know not why the boulevards are called so  they are a succession of broad walks through broad streets and were much thronged with people most of whom appeared to be bent more on pleasure than business  the sun long before this had come out brightly and gave us the first genial and comfortable sensations which we have had in paris  approaching the madeleine we found it a most beautiful church that might have been adapted from heathenism to catholicism for on each side there is a range of magnificent pillars unequalled except by those of the parthenon  a mourningcoach arrayed in black and silver was drawn up at the steps and the front of the church was hung with black cloth which covered the whole entrance  however seeing the people going in we entered along with them  glorious and gorgeous is the madeleine  the entrance to the nave is beneath a most stately arch and three arches of equal height open from the nave to the side aisles and at the end of the nave is another great arch rising with a vaulted halfdome over the high altar  the pillars supporting these arches are corinthian with richly sculptured capitals and wherever gilding might adorn the church it is lavished like sunshine and within the sweeps of the arches there are fresco paintings of sacred subjects and a beautiful picture covers the hollow of the vault over the altar all this besides much sculpture and especially a group above and around the high altar representing the magdalen smiling down upon angels and archangels some of whom are kneeling and shadowing themselves with their heavy marble wings  there is no such thing as making my page glow with the most distant idea of the magnificence of this church in its details and in its whole  it was founded a hundred or two hundred years ago then bonaparte contemplated transforming it into a temple of victory or building it anew as one the restored bourbons remade it into a church but it still has a heathenish look and will never lose it  when we entered we saw a crowd of people all pressing forward towards the high altar before which burned a hundred wax lights some of which were six or seven feet high and altogether they shone like a galaxy of stars  in the middle of the nave moreover there was another galaxy of wax candles burning around an immense pall of black velvet embroidered with silver which seemed to cover not only a coffin but a sarcophagus or something still more huge  the organ was rumbling forth a deep lugubrious bass accompanied with heavy chanting of priests out of which sometimes rose the clear young voices of choristers like light flashing out of the gloom  the church between the arches along the nave and round the altar was hung with broad expanses of black cloth and all the priests had their sacred vestments covered with black  they looked exceedingly well i never saw anything half so well got up on the stage some of these ecclesiastical figures were very stately and noble and knelt and bowed and bore aloft the cross and swung the censers in a way that i liked to see  the ceremonies of the catholic church were a superb work of art or perhaps a true growth of mans religious nature and so long as men felt their original meaning they must have been full of awe and glory  being of another parish i looked on coldly but not irreverently and was glad to see the funeral service so well performed and very glad when it was over  what struck me as singular the person who performed the part usually performed by a verger keeping order among the audience wore a goldembroidered scarf a cocked hat and i believe a sword and had the air of a military man  before the close of the service a contributionboxor rather a black velvet bagwas handed about by this military verger and i gave j a franc to put in though i did not in the least know for what  issuing from the church we inquired of two or three persons who was the distinguished defunct at whose obsequies we had been assisting for we had some hope that it might be rachel who died last week and is still above ground  but it proved to be only a madame mentel or some such name whom nobody had ever before heard of  i forgot to say that her coffin was taken from beneath the illuminated pall and carried out of the church before us  when we left the madeleine we took our way to the place de la concorde and thence through the elysian fields which i suppose are the french idea of heaven to bonapartes triumphal arch  the champs elysees may look pretty in summer though i suspect they must be somewhat dry and artificial at whatever seasonthe trees being slender and scraggy and requiring to be renewed every few years  the soil is not genial to them the strangest peculiarity of this place however to eyes fresh from moist and verdant england is that there is not one blade of grass in all the elysian fields nothing but hard clay now covered with white dust  it gives the whole scene the air of being a contrivance of man in which nature has either not been invited to take any part or has declined to do so  there were merrygorounds wooden horses and other provision for childrens amusements among the trees and booths and tables of cakes and candywomen and restaurants on the borders of the wood but very few people there and doubtless we can form no idea of what the scene might become when alive with french gayety and vivacity  as we walked onward the triumphal arch began to loom up in the distance looking huge and massive though still a long way off  it was not however till we stood almost beneath it that we really felt the grandeur of this great arch including so large a space of the blue sky in its airy sweep  at a distance it impresses the spectator with its solidity nearer with the lofty vacancy beneath it  there is a spiral staircase within one of its immense limbs and climbing steadily upward lighted by a lantern which the doorkeepers wife gave us we had a birdseye view of paris much obscured by smoke or mist  several interminable avenues shoot with painful directness right towards it  on our way homeward we visited the place vendome in the centre of which is a tall column sculptured from top to bottom all over the pedestal and all over the shaft and with napoleon himself on the summit  the shaft is wreathed round and roundabout with representations of what as far as i could distinguish seemed to be the emperors victories  it has a very rich effect  at the foot of the column we saw wreaths of artificial flowers suspended there no doubt by some admirer of napoleon still ardent enough to expend a franc or two in this way   hotel de louvre january 10thwe had purposed going to the cathedral of notre dame today but the weather and walking were too unfavorable for a distant expedition so we merely went across the street to the louvre       our principal object this morning was to see the pencil drawings by eminent artists  of these the louvre has a very rich collection occupying many apartments and comprising sketches by annibale caracci claude raphael leonardo da vinci michel angelo rubens rembrandt and almost all the other great masters whether french italian dutch or whatever else the earliest drawings of their great pictures when they had the glory of their pristine idea directly before their minds eye that idea which inevitably became overlaid with their own handling of it in the finished painting  no doubt the painters themselves had often a happiness in these rude offhand sketches which they never felt again in the same work and which resulted in disappointment after they had done their best  to an artist the collection must be most deeply interesting to myself it was merely curious and soon grew wearisome  in the same suite of apartments there is a collection of miniatures some of them very exquisite and absolutely lifelike on their small scale  i observed two of franklin both good and picturesque one of them especially so with its cloudlike white hair  i do not think we have produced a man so interesting to contemplate in many points of view as he  most of our great men are of a character that i find it impossible to warm into life by thought or by lavishing any amount of sympathy upon them  not so franklin who had a great deal of common and uncommon human nature in him  much of the time while my wife was looking at the drawings i sat observing the crowd of sunday visitors  they were generally of a lower class than those of weekdays private soldiers in a variety of uniforms and for the most part ugly little men but decorous and well behaved i saw medals on many of their breasts denoting crimean service some wore the english medal with queen victorias head upon it  a blue coat with red baggy trousers was the most usual uniform  some had shortbreasted coats made in the same style as those of the first napoleon which we had seen in the preceding rooms  the policemen distributed pretty abundantly about the rooms themselves looked military wearing cocked hats and swords  there were many women of the middling classes some evidently of the lowest but clean and decent in colored gowns and caps and laboring men citizens sunday gentlemen young artists too no doubt looking with educated eyes at these arttreasures and i think as a general thing each man was mated with a woman  the soldiers however came in pairs or little squads accompanied by women  i did not much like any of the french faces and yet i am not sure that there is not more resemblance between them and the american physiognomy than between the latter and the english  the women are not pretty but in all ranks above the lowest they have a trained expression that supplies the place of beauty  i was wearied to death with the drawings and began to have that dreary and desperate feeling which has often come upon me when the sights last longer than my capacity for receiving them  as our time in paris however is brief and precious we next inquired our way to the galleries of sculpture and these alone are of astounding extent reaching i should think all round one quadrangle of the louvre on the basement floor  hall after hall opened interminably before us and on either side of us paved and incrusted with variegated and beautifully polished marble relieved against which stand the antique statues and groups interspersed with great urns and vases sarcophagi altars tablets busts of historic personages and all manner of shapes of marble which consummate art has transmuted into precious stones  not that i really did feel much impressed by any of this sculpture then nor saw more than two or three things which i thought very beautiful but whether it be good or no i suppose the world has nothing better unless it be a few worldrenowned statues in italy  i was even more struck by the skill and ingenuity of the french in arranging these sculptural remains than by the value of the sculptures themselves  the galleries i should judge have been recently prepared and on a magnificent systemthe adornments being yet by no means completedfor besides the floor and wallcasings of rich polished marble the vaulted ceilings of some of the apartments are painted in fresco causing them to glow as if the sky were opened it must be owned however that the statuary often timeworn and darkened from its original brilliancy by weatherstains does not suit well as furniture for such splendid rooms  when we see a perfection of modern finish around them we recognize that most of these statues have been thrown down from their pedestals hundreds of years ago and have been battered and externally degraded and though whatever spiritual beauty they ever had may still remain yet this is not made more apparent by the contrast betwixt the new gloss of modern upholstery and their tarnished even if immortal grace  i rather think the english have given really the more hospitable reception to the maimed theseus and his brokennosed brokenlegged headless companions because flouting them with no gorgeous fittings up  by this time poor j who with his taste for art yet undeveloped is the companion of all our visits to sculpture and picture galleries was wofully hungry and for bread we had given him a stonenot one stone but a thousand  we returned to the hotel and it being too damp and raw to go to our restaurant des echelles we dined at the hotel  in my opinion it would require less time to cultivate our gastronomic taste than taste of any other kind and on the whole i am not sure that a man would not be wise to afford himself a little discipline in this line  it is certainly throwing away the bounties of providence to treat them as the english do producing from better materials than the french have to work upon nothing but sirloins joints joints steaks steaks steaks chops chops chops chops  we had a soup today in which twenty kinds of vegetables were represented and manifested each its own aroma a fillet of stewed beef and a fowl in some sort of delicate fricassee we had a bottle of chablis and renewed ourselves at the close of the banquet with a plate of chateaubriand ice  it was all very good and we respected ourselves far more than if we had eaten a quantity of red roast beef but i am not quite sure that we were right      among the relics of kings and princes i do not know that there was anything more interesting than a little brass cannon two or three inches long which had been a toy of the unfortunate dauphin son of louis xvi there was a mapa hemisphere of the worldwhich his father had drawn for this poor boy very neatly done too  the sword of louis xvi a magnificent rapier with a beautifully damasked blade and a jewelled scabbard but without a hilt is likewise preserved as is the hilt of henry ivs sword  but it is useless to begin a catalogue of these things  what a collection it is including charlemagnes sword and sceptre and the last dauphins little toy cannon and so much between the two   hotel de louvre january 11ththis was another chill raw day characterized by a spitefulness of atmosphere which i do not remember ever to have experienced in my own dear country  we meant to have visited the hotel des invalides but j and i walked to the tivoli the place de la concorde the champs elysees and to the place de beaujou and to the residence of the american minister where i wished to arrange about my passport  after speaking with the secretary of legation we were ushered into the ministers private room where he received me with great kindness  mr  is an old gentleman with a white head and a large florid face which has an expression of amiability not unmingled with a certain dignity  he did not rise from his armchair to greet mea lack of ceremony which i imputed to the gout feeling it impossible that he should have willingly failed in courtesy to one of his twentyfive million sovereigns  in response to some remark of mine about the shabby way in which our government treats its officials pecuniarily he gave a detailed account of his own troubles on that score then expressed a hope that i had made a good thing out of my consulate and inquired whether i had received a hint to resign to which i replied that for various reasons i had resigned of my own accord and before mr buchanans inauguration  we agreed however in disapproving the system of periodical change in our foreign officials and i remarked that a consul or an ambassador ought to be a citizen both of his native country and of the one in which he resided and that his possibility of beneficent influence depended largely on his being so apropos to which mr  said that he had once asked a diplomatic friend of long experience what was the first duty of a minister  to love his own country and to watch over its interests answered the diplomatist  and his second duty asked mr   to love and to promote the interests of the country to which he is accredited said his friend  this is a very christian and sensible view of the matter but it can scarcely have happened once in our whole diplomatic history that a minister can have had time to overcome his first rude and ignorant prejudice against the country of his mission and if there were any suspicion of his having done so it would be held abundantly sufficient ground for his recall  i like mr  a goodhearted sensible old man  j  and i returned along the champs elysees and crossing the seine kept on our way by the rivers brink looking at the titles of books on the long lines of stalls that extend between the bridges  novels fairytales dream books treatises of behavior and etiquette collections of bonmots and of songs were interspersed with volumes in the old style of calf and gilt binding the works of the classics of french literature  a good many persons of the poor classes and of those apparently well to do stopped transitorily to look at these books on the other side of the street was a range of tall edifices with shops beneath and the quick stir of french life hurrying and babbling and swarming along the sidewalk  we passed two or three bridges occurring at short intervals and at last we recrossed the seine by a bridge which oversteps the river from a point near the national institute and reaches the other side not far from the louvre      though the day was so disagreeable we thought it best not to lose the remainder of it and therefore set out to visit the cathedral of notre dame  we took a fiacre in the place de carousel and drove to the door on entering we found the interior miserably shut off from view by the stagings erected for the purpose of repairs  penetrating from the nave towards the chancel an official personage signified to us that we must first purchase a ticket for each grown person at the price of half a franc each  this expenditure admitted us into the sacristy where we were taken in charge by a guide who came down upon us with an avalanche or cataract of french descriptive of a great many treasures reposited in this chapel  i understood hardly more than one word in ten but gathered doubtfully that a bullet which was shown us was the one that killed the late archbishop of paris on the floor of the cathedral  but this was a mistake  it was the archbishop who was killed in the insurrection of 1848  two joints of his backbone were also shown  also that some gorgeously embroidered vestments which he drew forth had been used at the coronation of napoleon i  there were two large fulllength portraits hanging aloft in the sacristy and a gold or silver gilt or at all events gilt image of the virgin as large as life standing on a pedestal  the guide had much to say about these but understanding him so imperfectly i have nothing to record  the guides supervision of us seemed not to extend beyond this sacristy on quitting which he gave us permission to go where we pleased only intimating a hope that we would not forget him so i gave him half a franc though thereby violating an inhibition on the printed ticket of entrance  we had been much disappointed at first by the apparently narrow limits of the interior of this famous church but now as we made our way round the choir gazing into chapel after chapel each with its painted window its crucifix its pictures its confessional and afterwards came back into the nave where arch rises above arch to the lofty roof we came to the conclusion that it was very sumptuous  it is the greatest of pities that its grandeur and solemnity should just now be so infinitely marred by the workmens boards timber and ladders occupying the whole centre of the edifice and screening all its best effects  it seems to have been already most richly ornamented its roof being painted and the capitals of the pillars gilded and their shafts illuminated in fresco and no doubt it will shine out gorgeously when all the repairs and adornments shall be completed  even now it gave to my actual sight what i have often tried to imagine in my visits to the english cathedrals the pristine glory of those edifices when they stood glowing with gold and picture fresh from the architects and adorners hands  the interior loftiness of notre dame moreover gives it a sublimity which would swallow up anything that might look gewgawy in its ornamentation were we to consider it window by window or pillar by pillar  it is an advantage of these vast edifices rising over us and spreading about us in such a firmamental way that we cannot spoil them by any pettiness of our own but that they receive or absorb our pettiness into their own immensity  every little fantasy finds its place and propriety in them like a flower on the earths broad bosom  when we emerged from the cathedral we found it beginning to rain or snow or both and as we had dismissed our fiacre at the door and could find no other we were at a loss what to do  we stood a few moments on the steps of the hotel dieu looking up at the front of notre dame with its twin towers and its three deeppointed arches piercing through a great thickness of stone and throwing a cavernlike gloom around these entrances  the front is very rich  though so huge and all of gray stone it is carved and fretted with statues and innumerable devices as cunningly as any ivory casket in which relics are kept but its size did not so much impress me       hotel de louvre january 12ththis has been a bright day as regards weather but i have done little or nothing worth recording  after breakfast i set out in quest of the consul and found him up a court at 51 rue caumartin in an office rather smaller i think than mine at liverpool but to say the truth a little better furnished  i was received in the outer apartment by an elderly brisklooking man in whose air respectful and subservient and yet with a kind of authority in it i recognized the viceconsul  he introduced me to mr  who sat writing in an inner room a very gentlemanly courteous cool man of the world whom i should take to be an excellent person for consul at paris  he tells me that he has resided here some years although his occupancy of the consulate dates only from november last  consulting him respecting my passport he gave me what appear good reasons why i should get all the necessary vises here for example that the vise of a minister carries more weight than that of a consul and especially that an austrian consul will never vise a passport unless he sees his ministers name upon it  mr  has travelled much in italy and ought to be able to give me sound advice  his opinion was that at this season of the year i had better go by steamer to civita veechia instead of landing at leghorn and thence journeying to rome  on this point i shall decide when the time comes  as i left the office the viceconsul informed me that there was a charge of five francs and some sous for the consuls vise a tax which surprised methe whole business of passports having been taken from consuls before i quitted office and the consular fee having been annulled even earlier  however no doubt mr  had a fair claim to my five francs but really it is not half so pleasant to pay a consular fee as it used to be to receive it  afterwards i walked to notre dame the rich front of which i viewed with more attention than yesterday  there are whole histories carved in stone figures within the vaulted arches of the three entrances in this west front and twelve apostles in a row above and as much other sculpture as would take a month to see  we then walked quite round it but i had no sense of immensity from it not even that of great height as from many of the cathedrals in england  it stands very near the seine indeed if i mistake not it is on an island formed by two branches of the river  behind it is what seems to be a small public ground or garden if a space entirely denuded of grass or other green thing except a few trees can be called so with benches and a monument in the midst  this quarter of the city looks old and appears to be inhabited by poor people and to be busied about small and petty affairs the most picturesque business that i saw being that of the old woman who sells crucifixes of pearl and of wood at the cathedral door we bought two of these yesterday  i must again speak of the horrible muddiness not only of this part of the city but of all paris so far as i have traversed it today  my ways since i came to europe have often lain through nastiness but i never before saw a pavement so universally overspread with mudpadding as that of paris  it is difficult to imagine where so much filth can come from  after dinner i walked through the gardens of the tuileries but as dusk was coming on and as i was afraid of being shut up within the iron railing i did not have time to examine them particularly  there are wide intersecting walks fountains broad basins and many statues but almost the whole surface of the gardens is barren earth instead of the verdure that would beautify an english pleasureground of this sort  in the summer it has doubtless an agreeable shade but at this season the naked branches look meagre and sprout from slender trunks  like the trees in the champs elysees those i presume in the gardens of the tuileries need renewing every few years  the same is true of the human racefamilies becoming extinct after a generation or two of residence in paris  nothing really thrives here man and vegetables have but an artificial life like flowers stuck in a little mould but never taking root  i am quite tired of paris and long for a home more than ever    marseilles   hotel dangleterre january 15thon tuesday morning 12th we took our departure from the hotel de louvre  it is a most excellent and perfectly ordered hotel and i have not seen a more magnificent hall in any palace than the diningsaloon with its profuse gilding and its ceiling painted in compartments so that when the chandeliers are all alight it looks a fit place for princes to banquet in and not very fit for the few americans whom i saw scattered at its long tables  by the by as we drove to the railway we passed through the public square where the bastille formerly stood and in the centre of it now stands a column surmounted by a golden figure of mercury i think which seems to be just on the point of casting itself from a gilt ball into the air  this statue is so buoyant that the spectator feels quite willing to trust it to the viewless element being as sure that it would be borne up as that a bird would fly  our first days journey was wholly without interest through a country entirely flat and looking wretchedly brown and barren  there were rows of trees very slender very prim and formal there was ice wherever there happened to be any water to form it there were occasional villages compact little streets or masses of stone or plastered cottages very dirty and with gable ends and earthen roofs and a succession of this same landscape was all that we saw whenever we rubbed away the congelation of our breath from the carriage windows  thus we rode on all day long from eleven oclock with hardly a five minutes stop till long after dark when we came to dijon where there was a halt of twentyfive minutes for dinner  then we set forth again and rumbled forward through cold and darkness without until we reached lyons at about ten oclock  we left our luggage at the railway station and took an omnibus for the hotel de provence which we chose at a venture among a score of other hotels  as this hotel was a little off the direct route of the omnibus the driver set us down at the corner of a street and pointed to some lights which he said designated the hotel do provence and thither we proceeded all seven of us taking along a few carpetbags and shawls our equipage for the night  the porter of the hotel met us near its doorway and ushered us through an arch into the inner quadrangle and then up some old and worn stepsvery broad and appearing to be the principal staircase  at the first landingplace an old woman and a waiter or two received us and we went up two or three more flights of the same broad and worn stone staircases  what we could see of the house looked very old and had the musty odor with which i first became acquainted at chester  after ascending to the proper level we were conducted along a corridor paved with octagonal earthen tiles on one side were windows looking into the courtyard on the other doors opening into the sleepingchambers  the corridor was of immense length and seemed still to lengthen itself before us as the glimmer of our conductors candle went farther and farther into the obscurity  our own chamber was at a vast distance along this passage those of the rest of the party were on the hither side but all this immense suite of rooms appeared to communicate by doors from one to another like the chambers through which the reader wanders at midnight in mrs radcliffes romances  and they were really splendid rooms though of an old fashion lofty spacious with floors of oak or other wood inlaid in squares and crosses and waxed till they were slippery but without carpets  our own sleepingroom had a deep fireplace in which we ordered a fire and asked if there were not some saloon already warmed where we could get a cup of tea  hereupon the waiter led us back along the endless corridor and down the old stone staircases and out into the quadrangle and journeyed with us along an exterior arcade and finally threw open the door of the salle a manger which proved to be a room of lofty height with a vaulted roof a stone floor and interior spaciousness sufficient for a baronial hall the whole bearing the same aspect of times gone by that characterized the rest of the house  there were two or three tables covered with white cloth and we sat down at one of them and had our tea  finally we wended back to our sleepingroomsa considerable journey so endless seemed the ancient hotel  i should like to know its history  the fire made our great chamber look comfortable and the fireplace threw out the heat better than the little square hole over which we cowered in our saloon at the hotel de louvre      in the morning we began our preparations for starting at ten  issuing into the corridor i found a soldier of the line pacing to and fro there as sentinel  another was posted in another corridor into which i wandered by mistake another stood in the inner courtyard and another at the portecochere  they were not there the night before and i know not whence nor why they came unless that some officer of rank may have taken up his quarters at the hotel  miss m says she heard at paris that a considerable number of troops had recently been drawn together at lyons in consequence of symptoms of disaffection that have recently shown themselves here  before breakfast i went out to catch a momentary glimpse of the city the street in which our hotel stands is near a large public square in the centre is a bronze equestrian statue of louis xiv and the square itself is called the place de louis le grand  i wonder where this statue hid itself while the revolution was raging in lyons and when the guillotine perhaps stood on that very spot  the square was surrounded by stately buildings but had what seemed to be barracks for soldiersat any rate mean little huts deforming its ample space and a soldier was on guard before the statue of louis le grand  it was a cold misty morning and a fog lay throughout the area so that i could scarcely see from one side of it to the other  returning towards our hotel i saw that it had an immense front along which ran in gigantic letters its title       hotel de provence et des ambassadeurs  the excellence of the hotel lay rather in the faded pomp of its sleepingrooms and the vastness of its salle a manger than in anything very good to eat or drink  we left it after a poor breakfast and went to the railway station looking at the mountainous heap of our luggage the night before we had missed a great carpetbag and we now found that miss ms trunk had been substituted for it and there being the proper number of packages as registered it was impossible to convince the officials that anything was wrong  we of course began to generalize forthwith and pronounce the incident to be characteristic of french morality  they love a certain system and external correctness but do not trouble themselves to be deeply in the right and miss m suggested that there used to be parallel cases in the french revolution when so long as the assigned number were sent out of prison to be guillotined the jailer did not much care whether they were the persons designated by the tribunal or not  at all events we could get no satisfaction about the carpetbag and shall very probably be compelled to leave marseilles without it  this days ride was through a far more picturesque country than that we saw yesterday  heights began to rise imminent above our way with sometimes a ruined castle wall upon them on our left the railtrack kept close to the hills on the other side there was the level bottom of a valley with heights descending upon it a mile or a few miles away farther off we could see blue hills shouldering high above the intermediate ones and themselves worthy to be called mountains  these hills arranged themselves in beautiful groups affording openings between them and vistas of what lay beyond and gorges which i suppose held a great deal of romantic scenery  by and by a river made its appearance flowing swiftly in the same direction that we were travellinga beautiful and cleanly river with white pebbly shores and itself of a peculiar blue  it rushed along very fast sometimes whitening over shallow descents and even in its calmer intervals its surface was all covered with whirls and eddies indicating that it dashed onward in haste  i do not now know the name of this river but have set it down as the arrowy rhone  it kept us company a long while and i think we did not part with it as long as daylight remained  i have seldom seen hillscenery that struck me more than some that we saw today and the old feudal towers and old villages at their feet and the old churches with spires shaped just like extinguishers gave it an interest accumulating from many centuries past  still going southward the vineyards began to border our track together with what i at first took to be orchards but soon found were plantations of olivetrees which grow to a much larger size than i supposed and look almost exactly like very crabbed and eccentric appletrees  neither they nor the vineyards add anything to the picturesqueness of the landscape  on the whole i should have been delighted with all this scenery if it had not looked so bleak barren brown and bare so like the wintry new england before the snow has fallen  it was very cold too ice along the borders of streams even among the vineyards and olives  the houses are of rather a different shape here than farther northward their roofs being not nearly so sloping  they are almost invariably covered with white plaster the farmhouses have their outbuildings in connection with the dwellingthe whole surrounding three sides of a quadrangle  we travelled far into the night swallowed a cold and hasty dinner at avignon and reached marseilles sorely wearied at about eleven oclock we took a cab to the hotel dangleterre two cabs to be quite accurate and find it a very poor place  to go back a little as the sun went down we looked out of the window of our railway carriage and saw a sky that reminded us of what we used to see day after day in america and what we have not seen since and after sunset the horizon burned and glowed with rich crimson and orange lustre looking at once warm and cold  after it grew dark the stars brightened and miss m from her window pointed out some of the planets to the children she being as familiar with them as a gardener with his flowers  they were as bright as diamonds  we had a wretched breakfast and j and i then went to the railway station to see about our luggage  on our walk back we went astray passing by a triumphal arch erected by the marseillais in honor of louis napoleon but we inquired our way of old women and soldiers who were very kind and courteousespecially the latterand were directed aright  we came to a large oblong public place set with trees but devoid of grass like all public places in france  in the middle of it was a bronze statue of an ecclesiastical personage stretching forth his hands in the attitude of addressing the people or of throwing a benediction over them  it was some archbishop who had distinguished himself by his humanity and devotedness during the plague of 1720  at the moment of our arrival the piazza was quite thronged with people who seemed to be talking amongst themselves with considerable earnestness although without any actual excitement  they were smoking cigars and we judged that they were only loitering here for the sake of the sunshine having no fires at home and nothing to do  some looked like gentlemen others like peasants most of them i should have taken for the lazzaroni of this southern citymen with cloth caps like the classic libertycap or with wideawake hats  there were one or two women of the lower classes without bonnets the elder ones with white caps the younger bareheaded  i have hardly seen a lady in marseilles and i suspect it being a commercial city and dirty to the last degree illbuilt narrowstreeted and sometimes pestilential there are few or no families of gentility resident here  returning to the hotel we found the rest of the party ready to go out so we all issued forth in a body and inquired our way to the telegraphoffice in order to send my message about the carpetbag  in a street through which we had to pass and which seemed to be the exchange or its precincts there was a crowd even denser yes much denser than that which we saw in the square of the archbishops statue and each man was talking to his neighbor in a vivid animated way as if business were very brisk today  at the telegraphoffice we discovered the cause that had brought out these many people  there had been attempts on the emperors life unsuccessful as they seem fated to be though some mischief was done to those near him  i rather think the good people of marseilles were glad of the attempt as an item of news and gossip and did not very greatly care whether it were successful or no  it seemed to have roused their vivacity rather than their interest  the only account i have seen of it was in the brief public despatch from the syndic or whatever he be of paris to the chief authority of marseilles which was printed and posted in various conspicuous places  the only chance of knowing the truth with any fulness of detail would be to come across an english paper  we have had a banner hoisted halfmast in front of our hotel today as a token the headwaiter tells me of sympathy and sorrow for the general and other persons who were slain by this treasonable attempt  j and i now wandered by ourselves along a circular line of quays having on one side of us a thick forest of masts while on the other was a sweep of shops bookstalls sailors restaurants and drinkinghouses fruitsellers candywomen and all manner of openair dealers and pedlers little children playing and jumping the rope and such a babble and bustle as i never saw or heard before the sun lying along the whole sweep very hot and evidently very grateful to those who basked in it  whenever i passed into the shade immediately from too warm i became too cold  the sunshine was like hot air the shade like the touch of cold steelsharp hard yet exhilarating  from the broad street of the quays narrow threadlike lanes pierced up between the edifices calling themselves streets yet so narrow that a person in the middle could almost touch the houses on either hand  they ascended steeply bordered on each side by long contiguous walls of high houses and from the time of their first being built could never have had a gleam of sunshine in themalways in shadow always unutterably nasty and often pestiferous  the nastiness which i saw in marseilles exceeds my heretofore experience  there is dirt in the hotel and everywhere else and it evidently troubles nobodyno more than if all the people were pigs in a pigsty      passing by all this sweep of quays j and i ascended to an elevated walk overlooking the harbor and far beyond it for here we had our first view of the mediterranean blue as heaven and bright with sunshine  it was a bay widening forth into the open deep and bordered with heights and bold picturesque headlands some of which had either fortresses or convents on them  several boats and one brig were under sail making their way towards the port  i have never seen a finer seaview  behind the town there seemed to be a mountainous landscape imperfectly visible in consequence of the intervening edifices    the mediterranean sea   steamer calabrese january 17thif i had remained at marseilles i might have found many peculiarities and characteristics of that southern city to notice but i fear that these will not be recorded if i leave them till i touch the soil of italy  indeed i doubt whether there be anything really worth recording in the little distinctions between one nation and another at any rate after the first novelty is over new things seem equally commonplace with the old  there is but one little interval when the mind is in such a state that it can catch the fleeting aroma of a new scene  and it is always so much pleasanter to enjoy this delicious newness than to attempt arresting it that it requires great force of will to insist with ones self upon sitting down to write  i can do nothing with marseilles especially here on the mediterranean long after nightfall and when the steamer is pitching in a pretty lively way  lateri walked out with j yesterday morning and reached the outskirts of the city whence we could see the bold and picturesque heights that surround marseilles as with a semicircular wall  they rise into peaks and the town being on their lower slope descends from them towards the sea with a gradual sweep  adown the streets that descend these declivities come little rivulets running along over the pavement close to the sidewalks as over a pebbly bed and though they look vastly like kennels i saw women washing linen in these streams and others dipping up the water for household purposes  the women appear very much in public at marseilles  in the squares and places you see half a dozen of them together sitting in a social circle on the bottoms of upturned baskets knitting talking and enjoying the public sunshine as if it were their own household fire  not one in a thousand of them probably ever has a household fire for the purpose of keeping themselves warm but only to do their little cookery and when there is sunshine they take advantage of it and in the short season of rain and frost they shrug their shoulders put on what warm garments they have and get through the winter somewhat as grasshoppers and butterflies dobeing summer insects like then  this certainly is a very keen and cutting air sharp as a razor and i saw ice along the borders of the little rivulets almost at noonday  to be sure it is midwinter and yet in the sunshine i found myself uncomfortably warm but in the shade the air was like the touch of death itself  i do not like the climate  there are a great number of public places in marseilles several of which are adorned with statues or fountains or triumphal arches or columns and set out with trees and otherwise furnished as a kind of drawingrooms where the populace may meet together and gossip  i never before heard from human lips anything like this bustle and babble this thousandfold talk which you hear all round about you in the crowd of a public square so entirely different is it from the dulness of a crowd in england where as a rule everybody is silent and hardly half a dozen monosyllables will come from the lips of a thousand people  in marseilles on the contrary a stream of unbroken talk seems to bubble from the lips of every individual  a great many interesting scenes take place in these squares  from the window of our hotel which looked into the place royale i saw a juggler displaying his art to a crowd who stood in a regular square about him none pretending to press nearer than the prescribed limit  while the juggler wrought his miracles his wife supplied him with his magic materials out of a box and when the exhibition was over she packed up the white cloth with which his table was covered together with cups cards balls and whatever else and they took their departure  i have been struck with the idle curiosity and at the same time the courtesy and kindness of the populace of marseilles and i meant to exemplify it by recording how miss s and i attracted their notice and became the centre of a crowd of at least fifty of them while doing no more remarkable thing than settling with a cabdriver  but really this pitch and swell is getting too bad and i shall go to bed as the best chance of keeping myself in an equable state    rome   37 palazzo larazani via porta pinciana january 24thwe left marseilles in the neapolitan steamer calabrese as noticed above a week ago this morning  there was no fault to be found with the steamer which was very clean and comfortable contrary to what we had understood beforehand except for the coolness of the air and i know not that this was greater than that of the atlantic in july our voyage would have been very pleasant but for myself i enjoyed nothing having a cold upon me or a low fever or something else that took the light and warmth out of everything  i went to bed immediately after my last record and was rocked to sleep pleasantly enough by the billows of the mediterranean and coming on deck about sunrise next morning found the steamer approaching genoa  we saw the city lying at the foot of a range of hills and stretching a little way up their slopes the hills sweeping round it in the segment of a circle and looking like an island rising abruptly out of the sea for no connection with the mainland was visible on either side  there was snow scattered on their summits and streaking their sides a good way down  they looked bold and barren and brown except where the snow whitened them  the city did not impress me with much expectation of size or splendor  shortly after coming into the port our whole party landed and we found ourselves at once in the midst of a crowd of cabdrivers hotelrunnets and coin missionaires who assaulted us with a volley of french italian and broken english which beat pitilessly about our ears for really it seemed as if all the dictionaries in the world had been torn to pieces and blown around us by a hurricane  such a pother we took a commissionaire a respectablelooking man in a cloak who said his name was salvator rosa and he engaged to show us whatever was interesting in genoa  in the first place he took us through narrow streets to an old church the name of which i have forgotten and indeed its peculiar features but i know that i found it preeminently magnificentits whole interior being incased in polished marble of various kinds and colors its ceiling painted and its chapels adorned with pictures  however this church was dazzled out of sight by the cathedral of san lorenzo to which we were afterwards conducted whose exterior front is covered with alternate slabs of black and white marble which were brought either in whole or in part from jerusalem  within there was a prodigious richness of precious marbles and a pillar if i mistake not from solomons temple and a picture of the virgin by st luke and others rather more intrinsically valuable i imagine by old masters set in superb marble frames within the arches of the chapels  i used to try to imagine how the english cathedrals must have looked in their primeval glory before the reformation and before the whitewash of cromwells time had overlaid their marble pillars but i never imagined anything at all approaching what my eyes now beheld this sheen of polished and variegated marble covering every inch of its walls this glow of brilliant frescos all over the roof and up within the domes these beautiful pictures by great masters painted for the places which they now occupied and making an actual portion of the edifice this wealth of silver gold and gems that adorned the shrines of the saints before which wax candles burned and were kept burning i suppose from years end to years end in short there is no imagining nor remembering a hundredth part of the rich details  and even the cathedral though i give it up as indescribable was nothing at all in comparison with a church to which the commissionaire afterwards led us a church that had been built four or five hundred years ago by a pirate in expiation of his sins and out of the profit of his rapine  this last edifice in its interior absolutely shone with burnished gold and glowed with pictures its walls were a quarry of precious stones so valuable were the marbles out of which they were wrought its columns and pillars were of inconceivable costliness its pavement was a mosaic of wonderful beauty and there were four twisted pillars made out of stalactites  perhaps the best way to form some dim conception of it is to fancy a little casket inlaid inside with precious stones so that there shall not a hairsbreadth be left unpreciousstoned and then to conceive this little bit of a casket iucreased to the magnitude of a great church without losing anything of the excessive glory that was compressed into its original small compass but all its pretty lustre made sublime by the consequent immensity  at any rate nobody who has not seen a church like this can imagine what a gorgeous religion it was that reared it  in the cathedral and in all the churches we saw priests and many persons kneeling at their devotions and our salvator rosa whenever we passed a chapel or shrine failed not to touch the pavement with one knee crossing himself the while and once when a priest was going through some form of devotion he stopped a few moments to share in it  he conducted us too to the balbi palace the stateliest and most sumptuous residence but not more so than another which he afterwards showed us nor perhaps than many others which exist in genoa the superb the painted ceilings in these palaces are a glorious adornment the walls of the saloons incrusted with variouscolored marbles give an idea of splendor which i never gained from anything else  the floors laid in mosaic seem too precious to tread upon  in the royal palace many of the floors were of various woods inlaid by an english artist and they looked like a magnification of some exquisite piece of tunbridge ware but in all respects this palace was inferior to others which we saw  i say nothing of the immense pictorial treasures which hung upon the walls of all the rooms through which we passed for i soon grew so weary of admirable things that i could neither enjoy nor understand them  my receptive faculty is very limited and when the utmost of its small capacity is full i become perfectly miserable and the more so the better worth seeing are the things i am forced to reject  i do not know a greater misery to see sights after such repletion is to the mind what it would be to the body to have dainties forced down the throat long after the appetite was satiated  all this while whenever we emerged into the vaultlike streets we were wretchedly cold  the commissionaire took us to a sort of pleasuregarden occupying the ascent of a hill and presenting seven different views of the city from as many stations  one of the objects pointed out to us was a large yellow house on a hillside in the outskirts of genoa which was formerly inhabited for six months by charles dickens  looking down from the elevated part of the pleasuregardens we saw orangetrees beneath us with the golden fruit hanging upon them though their trunks were muffled in straw and still lower down there was ice and snow  gladly so far as i myself was concerned we dismissed the commissionaire after he had brought us to the hotel of the cross of malta where we dined needlessly as it proved for another dinner awaited us after our return on board the boat  we set sail for leghorn before dark and i retired early feeling still more ill from my cold than the night before  the next morning we were in the crowded port of leghorn  we all went ashore with some idea of taking the rail for pisa which is within an hours distance and might have been seen in time for our departure with the steamer  but a necessary visit to a bankers and afterwards some unnecessary formalities about our passports kept us wandering through the streets nearly all day and we saw nothing in the slightest degree interesting except the tomb of smollett in the burialplace attached to the english chapel  it is surrounded by an iron railing and marked by a slender obelisk of white marble the pattern of which is many times repeated over surrounding graves  we went into a jewish synagoguethe interior cased in marbles and surrounded with galleries resting upon arches above arches  there were lights burning at the altar and it looked very like a christian church but it was dirty and had an odor not of sanctity  in leghorn as everywhere else we were chilled to the heart except when the sunshine fell directly upon us and we returned to the steamer with a feeling as if we were getting back to our home for this life of wandering makes a three days residence in one place seem like home  we found several new passengers on board and among others a monk in a long brown frock of woollen cloth with an immense cape and a little black covering over his tonsure  he was a tall figure with a gray beard and might have walked just as he stood out of a picture by one of the old masters  this holy person addressed me very affably in italian but we found it impossible to hold much conversation  the evening was beautiful with a bright young moonlight not yet sufficiently powerful to overwhelm the stars and as we walked the deck miss m showed the children the constellations and told their names  j made a slight mistake as to one of them pointing it out to me as obriens belt  elba was presently in view and we might have seen many other interesting points had it not been for our steamers practice of resting by day and only pursuing its voyage by night  the next morning we found ourselves in the harbor of civita vecchia and going ashore with our luggage went through a blind turmoil with customhouse officers inspectors of passports soldiers and vetturino people  my wife and i strayed a little through civita vecchia and found its streets narrow like clefts in a rock which seems to be the fashion of italian towns and smelling nastily  i had made a bargain with a vetturino to send us to rome in a carriage with four horses in eight hours and as soon as the customhouse and passport people would let us we started lumbering slowly along with our mountain of luggage  we had heard rumors of robberies lately committed on this route especially of a nova scotia bishop who was detained on the road an hour and a half and utterly pillaged and certainly there was not a single mile of the dreary and desolate country over which we passed where we might not have been robbed and murdered with impunity  now and then at long distances we came to a structure that was either a prison a tavern or a barn but did not look very much like either being strongly built of stone with irongrated windows and of ancient and rusty aspect  we kept along by the seashore a great part of the way and stopped to feed our horses at a village the wretched street of which stands close along the shore of the mediterranean its loose dark sand being made nasty by the vicinity the vetturino cheated us one of the horses giving out as he must have known it would do halfway on our journey and we staggered on through cold and darkness and peril too if the banditti were not a myth reaching rome not much before midnight  i perpetrated unheardof briberies on the customhouse officers at the gates and was permitted to pass through and establish myself at spillmans hotel the only one where we could gain admittance and where we have been half frozen ever since  and this is sunny italy and genial rome   palazzo larazani via porta pinciana february 3dwe have been in rome a fortnight today or rather at eleven oclock tonight and i have seldom or never spent so wretched a time anywhere  our impressions were very unfortunate arriving at midnight half frozen in the wintry rain and being received into a cold and cheerless hotel where we shivered during two or three days meanwhile seeking lodgings among the sunless dreary alleys which are called streets in rome  one cold bright day after another has pierced me to the heart and cut me in twain as with a sword keen and sharp and poisoned at point and edge  i did not think that cold weather could have made me so very miserable  having caught a feverish influenza i was really glad of being muffled up comfortably in the fever heat  the atmosphere certainly has a peculiar quality of malignity  after a day or two we settled ourselves in a suite of ten rooms comprehending one flat or what is called the second piano of this house  the rooms thus far have been very uncomfortable it being impossible to warm them by means of the deep oldfashioned inartificial fireplaces unless we had the great logs of a new england forest to burn in them so i have sat in my corner by the fireside with more clothes on than i ever wore before and my thickest greatcoat over all  in the middle of the day i generally venture out for an hour or two but have only once been warm enough even in the sunshine and out of the sun never at any time  i understand now the force of that story of diogenes when he asked the conqueror as the only favor he could do him to stand out of his sunshine there being such a difference in these southern climes of europe between sun and shade  if my wits had not been too much congealed and my fingers too numb i should like to have kept a minute journal of my feelings and impressions during the past fortnight  it would have shown modern rome in an aspect in which it has never yet been depicted  but i have now grown somewhat acclimated and the first freshness of my discomfort has worn off so that i shall never be able to express how i dislike the place and how wretched i have been in it and soon i suppose warmer weather will come and perhaps reconcile me to rome against my will  cold narrow lanes between tall ugly meanlooking whitewashed houses sour bread pavements most uncomfortable to the feet enormous prices for poor living beggars pickpockets ancient temples and broken monuments and clothes hanging to dry about them french soldiers monks and priests of every degree a shabby population smoking bad cigarsthese would have been some of the points of my description  of course there are better and truer things to be said      it would be idle for me to attempt any sketches of these famous sites and edificesst peters for examplewhich have been described by a thousand people though none of them have ever given me an idea of what sort of place rome is      the coliseum was very much what i had preconceived it though i was not prepared to find it turned into a sort of christian church with a pulpit on the verge of the open space     the french soldiers who keep guard within it as in other public places in rome have an excellent opportunity to secure the welfare of their souls   february 7thi cannot get fairly into the current of my journal since we arrived and already i perceive that the nice peculiarities of roman life are passing from my notice before i have recorded them  it is a very great pity  during the past week i have plodded daily for an hour or two through the narrow stony streets that look worse than the worst backside lanes of any other city indescribably ugly and disagreeable they are     without sidewalks but provided with a line of larger square stones set crosswise to each other along which there is somewhat less uneasy walking     ever and anon even in the meanest streets though generally speaking one can hardly be called meaner than anotherwe pass a palace extending far along the narrow way on a line with the other houses but distinguished by its architectural windows ironbarred on the basement story and by its portal arch through which we have glimpses sometimes of a dirty courtyard or perhaps of a clean ornamented one with trees a colonnade a fountain and a statue in the vista though more likely it resembles the entrance to a stable and may perhaps really be one  the lower regions of palaces come to strange uses in rome     in the basement story of the barberini palace a regiment of french soldiers or soldiers of some kind we find them to be retainers of the barberini family not french seems to be quartered while no doubt princes have magnificent domiciles above  be it palace or whatever other dwelling the inmates climb through rubbish often to the comforts such as they may be that await them above  i vainly try to get down upon paper the dreariness the ugliness shabbiness unhomelikeness of a roman street  it is also to be said that you cannot go far in any direction without coming to a piazza which is sometimes little more than a widening and enlarging of the dingy street with the lofty facade of a church or basilica on one side and a fountain in the centre where the water squirts out of some fantastic piece of sculpture into a great stone basin  these fountains are often of immense size and most elaborate design      there are a great many of these fountainshapes constructed under the orders of one pope or another in all parts of the city and only the very simplest such as a jet springing from a broad marble or porphyry vase and falling back into it again are really ornamental  if an antiquary were to accompany me through the streets no doubt he would point out ten thousand interesting objects that i now pass over unnoticed so general is the surface of plaster and whitewash but often i can see fragments of antiquity built into the walls or perhaps a church that was a roman temple or a basement of ponderous stones that were laid above twenty centuries ago  it is strange how our ideas of what antiquity is become altered here in rome the sixteenth century in which many of the churches and fountains seem to have been built or reedified seems close at hand even like our own days a thousand years or the days of the latter empire is but a modern date and scarcely interests us and nothing is really venerable of a more recent epoch than the reign of constantine  and the egyptian obelisks that stand in several of the piazzas put even the augustan or republican antiquities to shame  i remember reading in a new york newspaper an account of one of the public buildings of that citya relic of the olden time the writer called it for it was erected in 1825  i am glad i saw the castles and gothic churches and cathedrals of england before visiting rome or i never could have felt that delightful reverence for their gray and ivyhung antiquity after seeing these so much older remains  but indeed old things are not so beautiful in this dry climate and clear atmosphere as in moist england      whatever beauty there may be in a roman ruin is the remnant of what was beautiful originally whereas an english ruin is more beautiful often in its decay than even it was in its primal strength  if we ever build such noble structures as these roman ones we can have just as good ruins after two thousand years in the united states but we never can have a furness abbey or a kenilworth  the corso and perhaps some other streets does not deserve all the vituperation which i have bestowed on the generality of roman vias though the corso is narrow not averaging more than nine paces if so much from sidewalk to sidewalk  but palace after palace stands along almost its whole extentnot however that they make such architectural show on the street as palaces should  the enclosed courts were perhaps the only parts of these edifices which the founders cared to enrich architecturally  i think linlithgow palace of which i saw the ruins during my last tour in scotland was built by an architect who had studied these roman palaces  there was never any idea of domestic comfort or of what we include in the name of home at all implicated in such structures they being generally built by wifeless and childless churchmen for the display of pictures and statuary in galleries and long suites of rooms  i have not yet fairly begun the sightseeing of rome  i have been four or five times to st peters and always with pleasure because there is such a delightful summerlike warmth the moment we pass beneath the heavy padded leather curtains that protect the entrances  it is almost impossible not to believe that this genial temperature is the result of furnaceheat but really it is the warmth of last summer which will be included within those massive walls and in that vast immensity of space till six months hence this winters chill will just have made its way thither  it would be an excellent plan for a valetudinarian to lodge during the winter in st peters perhaps establishing his household in one of the papal tombs  i become i think more sensible of the size of st peters but am as yet far from being overwhelmed by it  it is not as one expects so big as all out of doors nor is its dome so immense as that of the firmament  it looked queer however the other day to see a little ragged boy the very least of human things going round and kneeling at shrine after shrine and a group of children standing on tiptoe to reach the vase of holy water      on coming out of st peters at my last visit i saw a great sheet of ice around the fountain on the right hand and some little romans awkwardly sliding on it  i too took a slide just for the sake of doing what i never thought to do in rome  this inclement weather i should suppose must make the whole city very miserable for the native romans i am told never keep any fire except for culinary purposes even in the severest winter  they flee from their cheerless houses into the open air and bring their firesides along with them in the shape of small earthen vases or pipkins with a handle by which they carry them up and down the streets and so warm at least their hands with the lighted charcoal  i have had glimpses through open doorways into interiors and saw them as dismal as tombs  wherever i pass my summers let me spend my winters in a cold country  we went yesterday to the pantheon      when i first came to rome i felt embarrassed and unwilling to pass with my heresy between a devotee and his saint for they often shoot their prayers at a shrine almost quite across the church  but there seems to be no violation of etiquette in so doing  a woman begged of us in the pantheon and accused my wife of impiety for not giving her an alms     people of very decent appearance are often unexpectedly converted into beggars as you approach them but in general they take a no at once   february 9thfor three or four days it has been cloudy and rainy which is the greater pity as this should be the gayest and merriest part of the carnival  i go out but littleyesterday only as far as pakenhams and hookers bank in the piazza de spagna where i read galignani and the american papers  at last after seeing in england more of my fellowcompatriots than ever before i really am disjoined from my country  today i walked out along the pincian hill     as the clouds still threatened rain i deemed it my safest course to go to st peters for refuge  heavy and dull as the day was the effect of this great world of a church was still brilliant in the interior as if it had a sunshine of its own as well as its own temperature and by and by the sunshine of the outward world came through the windows hundreds of feet aloft and fell upon the beautiful inlaid pavement     against a pillar on one side of the nave is a mosaic copy of raphaels transfiguration fitly framed within a great arch of gorgeous marble and no doubt the indestructible mosaic has preserved it far more completely than the fading and darkening tints in which the artist painted it  at any rate it seemed to me the one glorious picture that i have ever seen  the pillar nearest the great entrance on the left of the nave supports the monument to the stuart family where two winged figures with inverted torches stand on either side of a marble door which is closed forever it is an impressive monument for you feel as if the last of the race had passed through that door  emerging from the church i saw a french sergeant drilling his men in the piazza  these french soldiers are prominent objects everywhere about the city and make up more of its sight and sound than anything else that lives  they stroll about individually they pace as sentinels in all the public places and they march up and down in squads companies and battalions always with a very great din of drum fife and trumpet ten times the proportion of music that the same number of men would require elsewhere and it reverberates with ten times the noise between the high edifices of these lanes that it could make in broader streets nevertheless i have no quarrel with the french soldiers they are fresh healthy smart honestlooking young fellows enough in blue coats and red trousers     and at all events they serve as an efficient police making rome as safe as london whereas without them it would very likely be a den of banditti  on my way home i saw a few tokens of the carnival which is now in full progress though as it was only about one oclock its frolics had not commenced for the day     i question whether the romans themselves take any great interest in the carnival  the balconies along the corso were almost entirely taken by english and americans or other foreigners  as i approached the bridge of st angelo i saw several persons engaged as i thought in fishing in the tiber with very strong lines but on drawing nearer i found that they were trying to hook up the branches and twigs and other driftwood which the recent rains might have swept into the river  there was a little heap of what looked chiefly like willow twigs the poor result of their labor  the hook was a knot of wood with the loppedoff branches projecting in three or four prongs  the tiber has always the hue of a mudpuddle but now after a heavy rain which has washed the clay into it it looks like peasesoup  it is a broad and rapid stream eddying along as if it were in haste to disgorge its impurities into the sea  on the left side where the city mostly is situated the buildings hang directly over the stream on the other where stand the castle of st angelo and the church of st peter the town does not press so imminent upon the shore  the banks are clayey and look as if the river had been digging them away for ages but i believe its bed is higher than of yore   february 10thi went out today and going along the via felice and the via delle quattro fontane came unawares to the basilica of santa maria maggiore on the summit of the esquiline hill  i entered it without in the least knowing what church it was and found myself in a broad and noble nave both very simple and very grand  there was a long row of ionic columns of marble twenty or thereabouts on each side supporting a flat roof  there were vaulted side aisles and at the farther end a bronze canopy over the high altar and all along the length of the side aisles were shrines with pictures sculpture and burning lamps the whole church too was lined with marble the roof was gilded and yet the general effect of severe and noble simplicity triumphed over all the ornament  i should have taken it for a roman temple retaining nearly its pristine aspect but murray tells us that it was founded a d 342 by pope liberius on the spot precisely marked out by a miraculous fall of snow in the month of august and it has undergone many alterations since his time  but it is very fine and gives the beholder the idea of vastness which seems harder to attain than anything else  on the right hand approaching the high altar there is a chapel separated from the rest of the church by an iron paling and being admitted into it with another party i found it most elaborately magnificent  but one magnificence outshone another and made itself the brightest conceivable for the moment  however this chapel was as rich as the most precious marble could make it in pillars and pilasters and broad polished slabs covering the whole walls except where there were splendid and glowing frescos or where some monumental statuary or basrelief or mosaic picture filled up an arched niche its architecture was a dome resting on four great arches and in size it would alone have been a church  in the centre of the mosaic pavement there was a flight of steps down which we went and saw a group in marble representing the nativity of christ which judging by the unction with which our guide talked about it must have been of peculiar sanctity  i hate to leave this chapel and church without being able to say any one thing that may reflect a portion of their beauty or of the feeling which they excite  kneeling against many of the pillars there were persons in prayer and i stepped softly fearing lest my tread on the marble pavement should disturb thema needless precaution however for nobody seems to expect it nor to be disturbed by the lack of it  the situation of the church i should suppose is the loftiest in rome it has a fountain at one end and a column at the other but i did not pay particular attention to either nor to the exterior of the church itself  on my return i turned aside from the via delle quattro fontane into the via quirinalis and was led by it into the piazza di monte cavallo  the street through which i passed was broader cleanlier and statelier than most streets in rome and bordered by palaces and the piazza had noble edifices around it and a fountain an obelisk and two nude statues in the centre  the obelisk was as the inscription indicated a relic of egypt the basin of the fountain was an immense bowl of oriental granite into which poured a copious flood of water discolored by the rain the statues were colossaltwo beautiful young men each holding a fiery steed  on the pedestal of one was the inscription opus phidiae on the other opus praxitelis  what a city is this when one may stumble by mere chanceat a street corner as it wereon the works of two such sculptors  i do not know the authority on which these statues castor and pollux i presume are attributed to phidias and praxiteles but they impressed me as noble and godlike and i feel inclined to take them for what they purport to be  on one side of the piazza is the pontifical palace but not being aware of this at the time i did not look particularly at the edifice  i came home by way of the corso which seemed a little enlivened by carnival time though as it was not yet two oclock the fun had not begun for the day  the rain throws a dreary damper on the festivities   february 13thday before yesterday we took j and r in a carriage and went to see the carnival by driving up and down the corso it was as ugly a day as respects weather as has befallen us since we came to romecloudy with an indecisive wet which finally settled into a rain and people say that such is generally the weather in carnival time  there is very little to be said about the spectacle  sunshine would have improved it no doubt but a person must have very broad sunshine within himself to be joyous on such shallow provocation  the street at all events would have looked rather brilliant under a sunny sky the balconies being hung with brightcolored draperies which were also flung out of some of the windows     soon i had my first experience of the carnival in a handful of confetti right slap in my face     many of the ladies wore loose white dominos and some of the gentlemen had on defensive armor of blouses and wire masks over the face were a protection for both sexesnot a needless one for i received a shot in my right eye which cost me many tears  it seems to be a point of courtesy though often disregarded by americans and english not to fling confetti at ladies or at noncombatants or quiet bystanders and the engagements with these missiles were generally between open carriages manned with youths who were provided with confetti for such encounters and with bouquets for the ladies  we had one real enemy on the corso for our former friend mrs t was there and as often as we passed and repassed her she favored us with a handful of lime  two or three times somebody ran by the carriage and puffed forth a shower of winged seeds through a tube into our faces and over our clothes and in the course of the afternoon we were hit with perhaps half a dozen sugarplums  possibly we may not have received our fair share of these last salutes for j had on a black mask which made him look like an imp of satan and drew many volleys of confetti that we might otherwise have escaped  a good many bouquets were flung at our little r and at us generally     this was what is called maskingday when it is the rule to wear masks in the corso but the great majority of people appeared without them     two fantastic figures with enormous heads set round with frizzly hair came and grinned into our carriage and j tore out a handful of hair which proved to be seaweed from one of their heads rather to the discomposure of the owner who muttered his indignation in italian     on comparing notes with j and r indeed with u too i find that they all enjoyed the carnival much more than i did  only the young ought to write descriptions of such scenes  my cold criticism chills the life out of it   february 14thfriday 12th was a sunny day the first that we had had for some time and my wife and i went forth to see sights as well as to make some calls that had long been due  we went first to the church of santa maria maggiore which i have already mentioned and on our return we went to the piazza di monte cavallo and saw those admirable ancient statues of castor and pollux which seem to me sons of the morning and full of life and strength  the atmosphere in such a length of time has covered the marble surface of these statues with a gray rust that envelops both the men and horses as with a garment besides which there are strange discolorations such as patches of white moss on the elbows and reddish streaks down the sides but the glory of form overcomes all these defects of color  it is pleasant to observe how familiar some little birds are with these colossal statueshopping about on their heads and over their huge fists and very likely they have nests in their ears or among their hair  we called at the barberini palace where william story has established himself and family for the next seven years or more on the third piano in apartments that afford a very fine outlook over rome and have the sun in them through most of the day  mrs s invited us to her fancy ball but we declined  on the staircase ascending to their piano we saw the ancient greek basrelief of a lion whence canova is supposed to have taken the idea of his lions on the monument in st peters  afterwards we made two or three calls in the neighborhood of the piazza de spagna finding only mr hamilton fish and family at the hotel deurope at home and next visited the studio of mr c g thompson whom i knew in boston  he has very greatly improved since those days and being always a man of delicate mind and earnestly desiring excellence for its own sake he has won himself the power of doing beautiful and elevated works  he is now meditating a series of pictures from shakespeares tempest the sketches of one or two of which he showed us likewise a copy of a small madonna by raphael wrought with a minute faithfulness which it makes one a better man to observe     mr thompson is a true artist and whatever his pictures have of beauty comes from very far beneath the surface and this i suppose is one weighty reason why he has but moderate success  i should like his pictures for the mere color even if they represented nothing  his studio is in the via sistina and at a little distance on the other side of the same street is william storys where we likewise went and found him at work on a sitting statue of cleopatra  william story looks quite as vivid in a graver way as when i saw him last a very young man  his perplexing variety of talents and accomplishmentshe being a poet a prose writer a lawyer a painter a musician and a sculptorseems now to be concentrating itself into this latter vocation and i cannot see why he should not achieve something very good  he has a beautiful statue already finished of goethes margaret pulling a flower to pieces to discover whether faust loves her a very type of virginity and simplicity  the statue of cleopatra now only fourteen days advanced in the clay is as wide a step from the little maidenly margaret as any artist could take it is a grand subject and he is conceiving it with depth and power and working it out with adequate skill  he certainly is sensible of something deeper in his art than merely to make beautiful nudities and baptize them by classic names by the by he told me several queer stories of american visitors to his studio one of them after long inspecting cleopatra into which he has put all possible characteristics of her time and nation and of her own individuality asked have you baptized your statue yet as if the sculptor were waiting till his statue were finished before he chose the subject of itas indeed i should think many sculptors do  another remarked of a statue of hero who is seeking leander by torchlight and in momentary expectation of finding his drowned body is not the face a little sad  another time a whole party of americans filed into his studio and ranged themselves round his fathers statue and after much silent examination the spokesman of the party inquired well sir what is this intended to represent  william story in telling these little anecdotes gave the yankee twang to perfection      the statue of his father his first work is very noble as noble and fine a portraitstatue as i ever saw  in the outer room of his studio a stonecutter or whatever this kind of artisan is called was at work transferring the statue of hero from the plastercast into marble and already though still in some respects a block of stone there was a wonderful degree of expression in the face  it is not quite pleasant to think that the sculptor does not really do the whole labor on his statues but that they are all but finished to his hand by merely mechanical people  it is generally only the finishing touches that are given by his own chisel  yesterday being another bright day we went to the basilica of st john lateran which is the basilica next in rank to st peters and has the precedence of it as regards certain sacred privileges  it stands on a most noble site on the outskirts of the city commanding a view of the sabine and alban hills blue in the distance and some of them hoary with sunny snow  the ruins of the claudian aqueduct are close at hand  the church is connected with the lateran palace and museum so that the whole is one edifice but the facade of the church distinguishes it and is very lofty and grandmore so it seems to me than that of st peters under the portico is an old statue of constantine representing him as a very stout and sturdy personage  the inside of the church disappointed me though no doubt i should have been wonderstruck had i seen it a month ago  we went into one of the chapels which was very rich in colored marbles and going down a winding staircase found ourselves among the tombs and sarcophagi of the corsini family and in presence of a marble pieta very beautifully sculptured  on the other side of the church we looked into the torlonia chapel very rich and rather profusely gilded but as it seemed to me not tawdry though the white newness of the marble is not perfectly agreeable after being accustomed to the milder tint which time bestows on sculpture  the tombs and statues appeared like shapes and images of newfallen snow  the most interesting thing which we saw in this church and admitting its authenticity there can scarcely be a more interesting one anywhere was the table at which the last supper was eaten  it is preserved in a corridor on one side of the tribune or chancel and is shown by torchlight suspended upon the wall beneath a covering of glass  only the top of the table is shown presenting a broad flat surface of wood evidently very old and showing traces of dryrot in one or two places  there are nails in it and the attendant said that it had formerly been covered with bronze  as well as i can remember it may be five or six feet square and i suppose would accommodate twelve persons though not if they reclined in the roman fashion nor if they sat as they do in leonardo da vincis picture  it would be very delightful to believe in this table  there are several other sacred relics preserved in the church for instance the staircase of pilates house up which jesus went and the porphyry slab on which the soldiers cast lots for his garments  these however we did not see  there are very glowing frescos on portions of the walls but there being much whitewash instead of incrusted marble it has not the pleasant aspect which ones eye learns to demand in roman churches  there is a good deal of statuary along the columns of the nave and in the monuments of the side aisles  in reference to the interior splendor of roman churches i must say that i think it a pity that painted windows are exclusively a gothic ornament for the elaborate ornamentation of these interiors puts the ordinary daylight out of countenance so that a window with only the white sunshine coming through it or even with a glimpse of the blue italian sky looks like a portion left unfinished and therefore a blotch in the rich wall  it is like the one spot in aladdins palace which he left for the king his fatherinlaw to finish after his fairy architects had exhausted their magnificence on the rest and the sun like the king fails in the effort  it has what is called a porta santa which we saw walled up in front of the church one side of the main entrance  i know not what gives it its sanctity but it appears to be opened by the pope on a year of jubilee once every quarter of a century  after our return      i took r along the pincian hill and finally after witnessing what of the carnival could be seen in the piazza del popolo from that safe height we went down into the corso and some little distance along it  except for the sunshine the scene was much the same as i have already described perhaps fewer confetti and more bouquets  some americans and english are said to have been brought before the police authorities and fined for throwing lime  it is remarkable that the jollity such as it is of the carnival does not extend an inch beyond the line of the corso there it flows along in a narrow stream while in the nearest street we see nothing but the ordinary roman gravity   february 15thyesterday was a bright day but i did not go out till the afternoon when i took an hours walk along the pincian stopping a good while to look at the old beggar who for many years past has occupied one of the platforms of the flight of steps leading from the piazza de spagna to the triniti de monti  hillard commemorates him in his book he is an unlovely object moving about on his hands and knees principally by aid of his hands which are fortified with a sort of wooden shoes while his poor wasted lower shanks stick up in the air behind him loosely vibrating as he progresses  he is gray old ragged a pitiable sight but seems very active in his own fashion and bestirs himself on the approach of his visitors with the alacrity of a spider when a fly touches the remote circumference of his web  while i looked down at him he received alms from three persons one of whom was a young woman of the lower orders the other two were gentlemen probably either english or american  i could not quite make out the principle on which he let some people pass without molestation while he shuffled from one end of the platform to the other to intercept an occasional individual he is not persistent in his demands nor indeed is this a usual fault among italian beggars  a shake of the head will stop him when wriggling towards you from a distance  i fancy he reaps a pretty fair harvest and no doubt leads as contented and as interesting a life as most people sitting there all day on those sunny steps looking at the world and making his profit out of it  it must be pretty much such an occupation as fishing in its effect upon the hopes and apprehensions and probably he suffers no more from the many refusals he meets with than the angler does when he sees a fish smell at his bait and swim away  one success pays for a hundred disappointments and the game is all the better for not being entirely in his own favor  walking onward i found the pincian thronged with promenaders as also with carriages which drove round the verge of the gardens in an unbroken ring  today has been very rainy  i went out in the forenoon and took a sitting for my bust in one of a suite of rooms formerly occupied by canova  it was large high and dreary from the want of a carpet furniture or anything but clay and plaster  a sculptors studio has not the picturesque charm of that of a painter where there is color warmth and cheerfulness and where the artist continually turns towards you the glow of some picture which is resting against the wall     i was asked not to look at the bust at the close of the sitting and of course i obeyed though i have a vague idea of a heavybrowed physiognomy something like what i have seen in the glass but looking strangely in that guise of clay      it is a singular fascination that rome exercises upon artists  there is clay elsewhere and marble enough and heads to model and ideas may be made sensible objects at home as well as here  i think it is the peculiar mode of life that attracts and its freedom from the inthralments of society more than the artistic advantages which rome offers and no doubt though the artists care little about one anothers works yet they keep each other warm by the presence of so many of them  the carnival still continues though i hardly see how it can have withstood such a damper as this rainy day  there were several people three i thinkkilled in the corso on saturday some accounts say that they were run over by the horses in the race others that they were ridden down by the dragoons in clearing the course  after leaving canovas studio i stepped into the church of san luigi de francesi in the via di ripetta  it was built i believe by catherine de medici and is under the protection of the french government and a most shamefully dirty place of worship the beautiful marble columns looking dingy for the want of loving and pious care  there are many tombs and monuments of french people both of the past and present artists soldiers priests and others who have died in rome  it was so dusky within the church that i could hardly distinguish the pictures in the chapels and over the altar nor did i know that there were any worth looking for  nevertheless there were frescos by domenichino and oilpaintings by guido and others  i found it peculiarly touching to read the records in latin or french of persons who had died in this foreign laud though they were not my own countrypeople and though i was even less akin to them than they to italy  still there was a sort of relationship in the fact that neither they nor i belonged here   february 17thyesterday morning was perfectly sunny and we went out betimes to see churches going first to the capuchins close by the piazza barberini  the marble faun takes up this description of the church and of the dead monk which we really saw just as recounted even to the sudden stream of blood which flowed from the nostrils as we looked at him ed  we next went to the trinita de monti which stands at the head of the steps leading in several flights from the piazza de spagna  it is now connected with a convent of french nuns and when we rang at a side door one of the sisterhood answered the summons and admitted us into the church  this like that of the capuchins had a vaulted roof over the nave and no side aisles but rows of chapels instead  unlike the capuchins which was filthy and really disgraceful to behold this church was most exquisitely neat as women alone would have thought it worth while to keep it  it is not a very splendid church not rich in gorgeous marbles but pleasant to be in if it were only for the sake of its godly purity  there was only one person in the nave a young girl who sat perfectly still with her face towards the altar as long as we stayed  between the nave and the rest of the church there is a high iron railing and on the other side of it were two kneeling figures in black so motionless that i at first thought them statues but they proved to be two nuns at their devotions and others of the sisterhood came by and by and joined them  nuns at least these nuns who are french and probably ladies of refinement having the education of young girls in charge are far pleasanter objects to see and think about than monks the odor of sanctity in the latter not being an agreeable fragrance  but these holy sisters with their black crape and white muslin looked really pure and unspotted from the world  on the iron railing above mentioned was the representation of a golden heart pierced with arrows for these are nuns of the sacred heart  in the various chapels there are several paintings in fresco some by daniele da volterra and one of them the descent from the cross has been pronounced the third greatest picture in the world  i never should have had the slightest suspicion that it was a great picture at all so worn and faded it looks and so hard so difficult to be seen and so undelightful when one does see it  from the trinita we went to the santa maria del popolo a church built on a spot where nero is said to have been buried and which was afterwards made horrible by devilish phantoms  it now being past twelve and all the churches closing from twelve till two we had not time to pay much attention to the frescos oilpictures and statues by raphael and other famous men which are to be seen here  i remember dimly the magnificent chapel of the chigi family and little else for we stayed but a short time and went next to the sculptors studio where i had another sitting for my bust  after i had been moulded for about an hour we turned homeward but my wife concluded to hire a balcony for this last afternoon and evening of the carnival and she took possession of it while i went home to send to her miss s and the two elder children  for my part i took r and walked by way of the pincian to the piazza del popolo and thence along the corso where by this time the warfare of bouquets and confetti raged pretty fiercely  the sky being blue and the sun bright the scene looked much gayer and brisker than i had before found it and i can conceive of its being rather agreeable than otherwise up to the age of twenty  we got several volleys of confetti r received a bouquet and a sugarplum and i a resounding hit from something that looked more like a cabbage than a flower  little as i have enjoyed the carnival i think i could make quite a brilliant sketch of it without very widely departing from truth   february 19thday before yesterday pretty early we went to st peters expecting to see the pope cast ashes on the heads of the cardinals it being ashwednesday  on arriving however we found no more than the usual number of visitants and devotional people scattered through the broad interior of st peters and thence concluded that the ceremonies were to be performed in the sistine chapel  accordingly we went out of the cathedral through the door in the left transept and passed round the exterior and through the vast courts of the vatican seeking for the chapel  we had blundered into the carriageentrance of the palace there is an entrance from some point near the front of the church but this we did not find  the papal guards in the strangest antique and antic costume that was ever seena partycolored dress striped with blue red and yellow white and black with a doublet and ruff and trunkbreeches and armed with halberdswere on duty at the gateways but suffered us to pass without question  finally we reached a large court where some cardinals red equipages and other carriages were drawn up but were still at a loss as to the whereabouts of the chapel  at last an attendant kindly showed us the proper door and led us up flights of stairs along passages and galleries and through halls till at last we came to a spacious and lofty apartment adorned with frescos this was the sala regia and the antechamber to the sistine chapel  the attendant meanwhile had informed us that my wife could not be admitted to the chapel in her bonnet and that i myself could not enter at all for lack of a dresscoat so my wife took off her bonnet and covering her head with her black lace veil was readily let in while i remained in the sala regia with several other gentlemen who found themselves in the same predicament as i was  there was a wonderful variety of costume to be seen and studied among the persons around me comprising garbs that have been elsewhere laid aside for at least three centuriesthe broad plaited double ruff and black velvet cloak doublet trunkbreeches and sword of queen elizabeths timethe papal guard in their striped and partycolored dress as before described looking not a little like harlequins other soldiers in helmets and jackboots french officers of various uniform monks and priests attendants in oldfashioned and gorgeous livery gentlemen some in black dresscoats and pantaloons others in wideawake hats and tweed overcoats and a few ladies in the prescribed costume of black so that in any other country the scene might have been taken for a fancy ball by and by the cardinals began to arrive and added their splendid purple robes and red hats to make the picture still more brilliant  they were old men one or two very aged and infirm and generally men of bulk and substance with heavy faces fleshy about the chin  their red hats trimmed with goldlace are a beautiful piece of finery and are identical in shape with the black loosely cocked beavers worn by the catholic ecclesiastics generally  wolseys hat which i saw at the manchester exhibition might have been made on the same block but apparently was never cocked as the fashion now is  the attendants changed the upper portions of their masters attire and put a little cap of scarlet cloth on each of their heads after which the cardinals one by one or two by two as they happened to arrive went into the chapel with a page behind each holding up his purple train  in the mean while within the chapel we heard singing and chanting and whenever the voluminous curtains that hung before the entrance were slightly drawn apart we outsiders glanced through but could see only a mass of people and beyond them still another chapel divided from the hither one by a screen  when almost everybody had gone in there was a stir among the guards and attendants and a door opened apparently communicating with the inner apartments of the vatican  through this door came not the pope as i had partly expected but a bulky old lady in black with a red face who bowed towards the spectators with an aspect of dignified complaisance as she passed towards the entrance of the chapel  i took off my hat unlike certain english gentlemen who stood nearer and found that i had not done amiss for it was the queen of spain  there was nothing else to be seen so i went back through the antechambers which are noble halls richly frescoed on the walls and ceilings endeavoring to get out through the same passages that had let me in  i had already tried to descend what i now supposed to be the scala santa but had been turned back by a sentinel  after wandering to and fro a good while i at last found myself in a long long gallery on each side of which were innumerable inscriptions in greek and latin on slabs of marble built into the walls and classic altars and tablets were ranged along from end to end  at the extremity was a closed iron grating from which i was retreating but a french gentleman accosted me with the information that the custode would admit me if i chose and would accompany me through the sculpture department of the vatican  i acceded and thus took my first view of those innumerable arttreasures passing from one object to another at an easy pace pausing hardly a moment anywhere and dismissing even the apollo and the laocoon and the torso of hercules in the space of half a dozen breaths  i was well enough content to do so in order to get a general idea of the contents of the galleries before settling down upon individual objects  most of the worldfamous sculptures presented themselves to my eye with a kind of familiarity through the copies and casts which i had seen but i found the originals more different than i anticipated  the apollo for instance has a face which i have never seen in any cast or copy  i must confess however taking such transient glimpses as i did i was more impressed with the extent of the vatican and the beautiful order in which it is kept and its great sunny open courts with fountains grass and shrubs and the views of rome and the campagna from its windowsmore impressed with these and with certain vastly capacious vases and two seat sarcophagithan with the statuary  thus i went round the whole and was dismissed through the grated barrier into the gallery of inscriptions again and after a little more wandering i made my way out of the palace      yesterday i went out betimes and strayed through some portion of ancient rome to the column of trajan to the forum thence along the appian way after which i lost myself among the intricacies of the streets and finally came out at the bridge of st angelo  the first observation which a stranger is led to make in the neighborhood of roman ruins is that the inhabitants seem to be strangely addicted to the washing of clothes for all the precincts of trajans forum and of the roman forum and wherever else an iron railing affords opportunity to hang them were whitened with sheets and other linen and cotton drying in the sun  it must be that washerwomen burrow among the old temples  the second observation is not quite so favorable to the cleanly character of the modern romans indeed it is so very unfavorable that i hardly know how to express it  but the fact is that through the forum     and anywhere out of the commonest foottrack and roadway you must look well to your steps     if you tread beneath the triumphal arch of titus or constantine you had better look downward than upward whatever be the merit of the sculptures aloft      after a while the visitant finds himself getting accustomed to this horrible state of things and the associations of moral sublimity and beauty seem to throw a veil over the physical meannesses to which i allude  perhaps there is something in the mind of the people of these countries that enables them quite to dissever small ugliness from great sublimity and beauty  they spit upon the glorious pavement of st peters and wherever else they like they place paltrylooking wooden confessionals beneath its sublime arches and ornament them with cheap little colored prints of the crucifixion they hang tin hearts and other tinsel and trumpery at the gorgeous shrines of the saints in chapels that are incrusted with gems or marbles almost as precious they put pasteboard statues of saints beneath the dome of the pantheon in short they let the sublime and the ridiculous come close together and are not in the least troubled by the proximity  it must be that their sense of the beautiful is stronger than in the anglosaxon mind and that it observes only what is fit to gratify it  today which was bright and cool my wife and i set forth immediately after breakfast in search of the baths of diocletian and the church of santa maria degl angeli  we went too far along the via di porta pia and after passing by two or three convents and their high garden walls and the villa bonaparte on one side and the villa torlonia on the other at last issued through the city gate  before us far away were the alban hills the loftiest of which was absolutely silvered with snow and sunshine and set in the bluest and brightest of skies  we now retraced our steps to the fountain of the termini where is a ponderous heap of stone representing moses striking the rock a colossal figure not without a certain enormous might and dignity though rather too evidently looking his awfullest  this statue was the death of its sculptor whose heart was broken on account of the ridicule it excited  there are many more absurd aquatic devices in rome however and few better  we turned into the piazza de termini the entrance of which is at this fountain and after some inquiry of the french soldiers a numerous detachment of whom appear to be quartered in the vicinity we found our way to the portal of santa maria degl angeli  the exterior of this church has no pretensions to beauty or majesty or indeed to architectural merit of any kind or to any architecture whatever for it looks like a confused pile of ruined brickwork with a facade resembling half the inner curve of a large oven  no one would imagine that there was a church under that enormous heap of ancient rubbish  but the door admits you into a circular vestibule once an apartment of diocletians baths but now a portion of the nave of the church and surrounded with monumental busts and thence you pass into what was the central hall now with little change except of detail and ornament transformed into the body of the church  this space is so lofty broad and airy that the soul forthwith swells out and magnifies itself for the sake of filling it  it was michael angelo who contrived this miracle and i feel even more grateful to him for rescuing such a noble interior from destruction than if he had originally built it himself  in the ceiling above you see the metal fixtures whereon the old romans hung their lamps and there are eight gigantic pillars of egyptian granite standing as they stood of yore  there is a grand simplicity about the church more satisfactory than elaborate ornament but the present pope has paved and adorned one of the large chapels of the transept in very beautiful style and the pavement of the central part is likewise laid in rich marbles  in the choir there are several pictures one of which was veiled as celebrated pictures frequently are in churches  a person who seemed to be at his devotions withdrew the veil for us and we saw a martyrdom of st sebastian by domenichino originally i believe painted in fresco in st peters but since transferred to canvas and removed hither  its place at st peters is supplied by a mosaic copy i was a good deal impressed by this picturethe dying saint amid the sorrow of those who loved him and the fury of his enemies looking upward where a company of angels and jesus with them are waiting to welcome him and crown him and i felt what an influence pictures might have upon the devotional part of our nature  the nailmarks in the hands and feet of jesus ineffaceable even after he had passed into bliss and glory touched my heart with a sense of his love for us  i think this really a great picture  we walked round the church looking at other paintings and frescos but saw no others that greatly interested us  in the vestibule there are monuments to carlo maratti and salvator rosa and there is a statue of st bruno by houdon which is pronounced to be very fine  i thought it good but scarcely worthy of vast admiration  houdon was the sculptor of the first statue of washington and of the bust whence i suppose all subsequent statues have been and will be mainly modelled  after emerging from the church i looked back with wonder at the stack of shapeless old brickwork that hid the splendid interior  i must go there again and breathe freely in that noble space   february 20ththis morning after breakfast i walked across the city making a pretty straight course to the pantheon and thence to the bridge of st angelo and to st peters  it had been my purpose to go to the fontana paolina but finding that the distance was too great and being weighed down with a roman lassitude i concluded to go into st peters here i looked at michael angelos pieta a representation of the dead christ in his mothers lap  then i strolled round the great church and find that it continues to grow upon me both in magnitude and beauty by comparison with the many interiors of sacred edifices which i have lately seen  at times a single casual momentary glimpse of its magnificence gleams upon my soul as it were when i happen to glance at arch opening beyond arch and i am surprised into admiration  i have experienced that a landscape and the sky unfold the deepest beauty in a similar way not when they are gazed at of set purpose but when the spectator looks suddenly through a vista among a crowd of other thoughts  passing near the confessional for foreigners today i saw a spaniard who had just come out of the one devoted to his native tongue taking leave of his confessor with an affectionate reverence whichas well as the benign dignity of the good fatherit was good to behold      i returned home early in order to go with my wife to the barberini palace at two oclock  we entered through the gateway through the via delle quattro fontane passing one or two sentinels for there is apparently a regiment of dragoons quartered on the groundfloor of the palace and i stumbled upon a room containing their saddles the other day when seeking for mr storys staircase  the entrance to the picturegallery is by a door on the right hand affording us a sight of a beautiful spiral staircase which goes circling upward from the very basement to the very summit of the palace with a perfectly easy ascent yet confining its sweep within a moderate compass  we looked up through the interior of the spiral as through a tube from the bottom to the top  the pictures are contained in three contiguous rooms of the lower piano and are few in number comprising barely half a dozen which i should care to see again though doubtless all have value in their way one that attracted our attention was a picture of christ disputing with the doctors by albert duerer in which was represented the ugliest most evilminded stubborn pragmatical and contentious old jew that ever lived under the law of moses and he and the child jesus were arguing not only with their tongues but making hieroglyphics as it were by the motion of their hands and fingers  it is a very queer as well as a very remarkable picture  but we passed hastily by this and almost all others being eager to see the two which chiefly make the collection famousraphaels fornarina and guidos portrait of beatrice cenci  these were found in the last of the three rooms and as regards beatrice cenci i might as well not try to say anything for its spell is indefinable and the painter has wrought it in a way more like magic than anything else      it is the most profoundly wrought picture in the world no artist did it nor could do it again  guido may have held the brush but he painted better than he knew  i wish however it were possible for some spectator of deep sensibility to see the picture without knowing anything of its subject or history for no doubt we bring all our knowledge of the cenci tragedy to the interpretation of it  close beside beatrice cenci hangs the fornarina      while we were looking at these works miss m unexpectedly joined us and we went all three together to the rospigliosi palace in the piazza di monte cavallo  a porter in cocked hat and with a staff of office admitted us into a spacious court before the palace and directed us to a garden on one side raised as much as twenty feet above the level on which we stood  the gardener opened the gate for us and we ascended a beautiful stone staircase with a carved balustrade bearing many marks of time and weather  reaching the gardenlevel we found it laid out in walks bordered with box and ornamental shrubbery amid which were lemontrees and one large old exotic from some distant clime  in the centre of the garden surrounded by a stone balustrade like that of the staircase was a fishpond into which several jets of water were continually spouting and on pedestals that made part of the balusters stood eight marble statues of apollo cupid nymphs and other such sunny and beautiful people of classic mythology  there had been many more of these statues but the rest had disappeared and those which remained had suffered grievous damage here to a nose there to a hand or foot and often a fracture of the body very imperfectly mended  there was a pleasant sunshine in the garden and a springlike or rather a genial autumnal atmosphere though elsewhere it was a day of poisonous roman chill  at the end of the garden which was of no great extent was an edifice bordering on the piazza called the casino which i presume means a gardenhouse  the front is richly ornamented with basreliefs and statues in niches as if it were a place for pleasure and enjoyment and therefore ought to be beautiful  as we approached it the door swung open and we went into a large room on the groundfloor and looking up to the ceiling beheld guidos aurora  the picture is as fresh and brilliant as if he had painted it with the morning sunshine which it represents  it could not be more lustrous in its lines if he had given it the last touch an hour ago  three or four artists were copying it at that instant and positively their colors did not look brighter though a great deal newer than his  the alacrity and movement briskness and morning stir and glow of the picture are wonderful  it seems impossible to catch its glory in a copy  several artists as i said were making the attempt and we saw two other attempted copies leaning against the wall but it was easy to detect failure in just essential points  my memory i believe will be somewhat enlivened by this picture hereafter not that i remember it very distinctly even now but bright things leave a sheen and glimmer in the mind like christians tremulous glimpse of the celestial city  in two other rooms of the casino we saw pictures by domenichino rubens and other famous painters which i do not mean to speak of because i cared really little or nothing about them  returning into the garden the sunny warmth of which was most grateful after the chill air and cold pavement of the casino we walked round the laguna examining the statues and looking down at some little fishes that swarmed at the stone margin of the pool  there were two infants of the rospigliosi family one a young child playing with a maid and headservant another the very chubbiest and rosiest boy in the world sleeping on its nurses bosom  the nurse was a comely woman enough dressed in bright colors which fitly set off the deep lines of her italian face  an old painter very likely would have beautified and refined the pair into a madonna with the child jesus for an artist need not go far in italy to find a picture ready composed and tinted needing little more than to be literally copied  miss m had gone away before us but my wife and i after leaving the palazzo rospigliosi and on our way hone went into the church of st andrea which belongs to a convent of jesuits  i have long ago exhausted all my capacity of admiration for splendid interiors of churches but methinks this little little temple it is not more than fifty or sixty feet across has a more perfect and gemlike beauty than any other  its shape is oval with an oval dome and above that another little dome both of which are magnificently frescoed  around the base of the larger dome is wreathed a flight of angels and the smaller and upper one is encircled by a garland of cherubscherub and angel all of pure white marble  the oval centre of the church is walled round with precious and lustrous marble of a redveined variety interspersed with columns and pilasters of white and there are arches opening through this rich wall forming chapels which the architect seems to have striven hard to make even more gorgeous than the main body of the church  they contain beautiful pictures not dark and faded but glowing as if just from the painters hands and the shrines are adorned with whatever is most rare and in one of them was the great carbuncle at any rate a bright fiery gem as big as a turkeys egg  the pavement of the church was one star of variouscolored marble and in the centre was a mosaic covering i believe the tomb of the founder  i have not seen nor expect to see anything else so entirely and satisfactorily finished as this small oval church and i only wish i could pack it in a large box and send it home  i must not forget that on our way from the barberini palace we stopped an instant to look at the house at the corner of the street of the four fountains where milton was a guest while in rome  he seems quite a man of our own day seen so nearly at the hither extremity of the vista through which we look back from the epoch of railways to that of the oldest egyptian obelisk  the house it was then occupied by the cardinal barberini looks as if it might have been built within the present century for mediaeval houses in rome do not assume the aspect of antiquity perhaps because the italian style of architecture or something similar is the one more generally in vogue in most cities   february 21stthis morning i took my way through the porta del popolo intending to spend the forenoon in the campagna but getting weary of the straight uninteresting street that runs out of the gate i turned aside from it and soon found myself on the shores of the tiber  it looked as usual like a saturated solution of yellow mud and eddied hastily along between deep banks of clay and over a clay bed in which doubtless are hidden many a richer treasure than we now possess  the french once proposed to draw off the river for the purpose of recovering all the sunken statues and relics but the romans made strenuous objection on account of the increased virulence of malaria which would probably result  i saw a man on the immediate shore of the river fifty feet or so beneath the bank on which i stood sitting patiently with an angling rod and i waited to see what he might catch  two other persons likewise sat down to watch him but he caught nothing so long as i stayed and at last seemed to give it up  the banks and vicinity of the river are very bare and uninviting as i then saw them no shade no verdurea rough neglected aspect and a peculiar shabbiness about the few houses that were visible  farther down the stream the dome of st peters showed itself on the other side seeming to stand on the outskirts of the city  i walked along the banks with some expectation of finding a ferry by which i might cross the river but my course was soon interrupted by the wall and i turned up a lane that led me straight back again to the porta del popolo  i stopped a moment however to see some young men pitching quoits which they appeared to do with a good deal of skill  i went along the via di ripetta and through other streets stepping into two or three churches one of which was the pantheon      there are i think seven deep pillared recesses around the circumference of it each of which becomes a sufficiently capacious chapel and alternately with these chapels there is a marble structure like the architecture of a doorway beneath which is the shrine of a saint so that the whole circle of the pantheon is filled up with the seven chapels and seven shrines  a number of persons were sitting or kneeling around others came in while i was there dipping their fingers in the holy water and bending the knee as they passed the shrines and chapels until they reached the one which apparently they had selected as the particular altar for their devotions  everybody seemed so devout and in a frame of mind so suited to the day and place that it really made me feel a little awkward not to be able to kneel down along with them  unlike the worshippers in our own churches each individual here seems to do his own individual acts of devotion and i cannot but think it better so than to make an effort for united prayer as we do  it is my opinion that a great deal of devout and reverential feeling is kept alive in peoples hearts by the catholic mode of worship  soon leaving the pantheon a few minutes walk towards the corso brought me to the church of st ignazio which belongs to the college of the jesuits  it is spacious and of beautiful architecture but not strikingly distinguished in the latter particular from many others a wide and lofty nave supported upon marble columns between which arches open into the side aisles and at the junction of the nave and transept a dome resting on four great arches  the church seemed to be purposely somewhat darkened so that i could not well see the details of the ornamentation except the frescos on the ceiling of the nave which were very brilliant and done in so effectual a style that i really could not satisfy myself that some of the figures did not actually protrude from the ceilingin short that they were not colored basreliefs instead of frescos  no words can express the beautiful effect in an upholstery point of view of this kind of decoration  here as at the pantheon there were many persons sitting silent kneeling or passing from shrine to shrine  i reached home at about twelve and at one set out again with my wife towards st peters where we meant to stay till after vespers  we walked across the city and through the piazza de navona where we stopped to look at one of berninis absurd fountains of which the water makes but the smallest parta little squirt or two amid a prodigious fuss of gods and monsters  thence we passed by the poor battereddown torso of pasquin and came by devious ways to the bridge of st angelo the streets bearing pretty much their weekday aspect many of the shops open the marketstalls doing their usual business and the people brisk and gay though not indecorously so  i suppose there was hardly a man or woman who had not heard mass confessed and said their prayers a thing whichthe prayers i meanit would be absurd to predicate of london new york or any protestant city  in however adulterated a guise the catholics do get a draught of devotion to slake the thirst of their souls and methinks it must needs do them good even if not quite so pure as if it came from better cisterns or from the original fountainhead  arriving at st peters shortly after two we walked round the whole church looking at all the pictures and most of the monuments     and paused longest before guidos archangel michael overcoming lucifer this is surely one of the most beautiful things in the world one of the human conceptions that are imbued most deeply with the celestial      we then sat down in one of the aisles and awaited the beginning of vespers which we supposed would take place at half past three  four oclock came however and no vespers and as our dinnerhour is five     we at last cane away without hearing the vesper hymn   february 23dyesterday at noon we set out for the capitol and after going up the acclivity not from the forum but from the opposite direction stopped to look at the statues of castor and pollux which with other sculptures look down the ascent  castor and his brother seem to me to have heads disproportionately large and are not so striking in any respect as such great images ought to be  but we heartily admired the equestrian statue of marcus aurelius antoninus     and looked at a fountain principally composed i think of figures representing the nile and the tiber who loll upon their elbows and preside over the gushing water and between them against the facade of the senators palace there is a statue of minerva with a petticoat of red porphyry having taken note of these objects we went to the museum in an edifice on our left entering the piazza and here in the vestibule we found various old statues and relics  ascending the stairs we passed through a long gallery and turning to our left examined somewhat more carefully a suite of rooms running parallel with it  the first of these contained busts of the caesars and their kindred from the epoch of the mightiest julius downward eightythree i believe in all  i had seen a bust of julius caesar in the british museum and was surprised at its thin and withered aspect but this head is of a very ugly old man indeedwrinkled puckered shrunken lacking breadth and substance careworn grim as if he had fought hard with life and had suffered in the conflict a man of schemes and of eager effort to bring his schemes to pass  his profile is by no means good advancing from the top of his forehead to the tip of his nose and retreating at about the same angle from the latter point to the bottom of his chin which seems to be thrust forcibly down into his meagre necknot that he pokes his head forward however for it is particularly erect  the head of augustus is very beautiful and appears to be that of a meditative philosophic man saddened with the sense that it is not very much worth while to be at the summit of human greatness after all  it is a sorrowful thing to trace the decay of civilization through this series of busts and to observe how the artistic skill so requisite at first went on declining through the dreary dynasty of the caesars till at length the master of the world could not get his head carved in better style than the figurehead of a ship  in the next room there were better statues than we had yet seen but in the last room of the range we found the dying gladiator of which i had already caught a glimpse in passing by the open door  it had made all the other treasures of the gallery tedious in my eagerness to come to that  i do not believe that so much pathos is wrought into any other block of stone  like all works of the highest excellence however it makes great demands upon the spectator  he must make a generous gift of his sympathies to the sculptor and help out his skill with all his heart or else he will see little more than a skilfully wrought surface it suggests far more than it shows  i looked long at this statue and little at anything else though among other famous works a statue of antinous was in the same room  i was glad when we left the museum which by the by was piercingly chill as if the multitude of statues radiated cold out of their marble substance  we might have gone to see the pictures in the palace of the conservatori and s whose receptivity is unlimited and forever fresh would willingly have done so but i objected and we went towards the forum  i had noticed two or three times an inscription over a meanlooking door in this neighborhood stating that here was the entrance to the prison of the holy apostles peter and paul and we soon found the spot not far from the forum with two wretched frescos of the apostles above the inscription  we knocked at the door without effect but a lame beggar who sat at another door of the same house which looked exceedingly like a liquorshop desired us to follow him and began to ascend to the capitol by the causeway leading from the forum a little way upward we met a woman to whom the beggar delivered us over and she led us into a church or chapel door and pointed to a long flight of steps which descended through twilight into utter darkness  she called to somebody in the lower regions and then went away leaving us to get down this mysterious staircase by ourselves  down we went farther and farther from the daylight and found ourselves anon in a dark chamber or cell the shape or boundaries of which we could not make out though it seemed to be of stone and black and dungeonlike indistinctly and from a still farther depth in the earth we heard voicesone voice at leastapparently not addressing ourselves but some other persons and soon directly beneath our feet we saw a glimmering of light through a round irongrated hole in the bottom of the dungeon  in a few moments the glimmer and the voice came up through this hole and the light disappeared and it and the voice came glimmering and babbling up a flight of stone stairs of which we had not hitherto been aware  it was the custode with a party of visitors to whom he had been showing st peters dungeon  each visitor was provided with a wax taper and the custode gave one to each of us bidding us wait a moment while he conducted the other party to the upper air  during his absence we examined the cell as well as our dim lights would permit and soon found an indentation in the wall with an iron grate put over it for protection and an inscription above informing us that the apostle peter had here left the imprint of his visage and in truth there is a profile thereforehead nose mouth and chinplainly to be seen an intaglio in the solid rock  we touched it with the tips of our fingers as well as saw it with our eyes  the custode soon returned and led us down the darksome steps chattering in italian all the time  it is not a very long descent to the lower cell the roof of which is so low that i believe i could have reached it with my hand  we were now in the deepest and ugliest part of the old mamertine prison one of the few remains of the kingly period of rome and which served the romans as a stateprison for hundreds of years before the christian era  a multitude of criminals or innocent persons no doubt have languished here in misery and perished in darkness  here jugurtha starved here catilines adherents were strangled and methinks there cannot be in the world another such an evil den so haunted with black memories and indistinct surmises of guilt and suffering  in old rome i suppose the citizens never spoke of this dungeon above their breath  it looks just as bad as it is round only seven paces across yet so obscure that our tapers could not illuminate it from side to side the stones of which it is constructed being as black as midnight  the custode showed us a stone post at the side of the cell with the hole in the top of it into which he said st peters chain had been fastened and he uncovered a spring of water in the middle of the stone floor which he told us had miraculously gushed up to enable the saint to baptize his jailer  the miracle was perhaps the more easily wrought inasmuch as jugurtha had found the floor of the dungeon oozy with wet  however it is best to be as simple and childlike as we can in these matters and whether st peter stamped his visage into the stone and wrought this other miracle or no and whether or no he ever was in the prison at all still the belief of a thousand years and more gives a sort of reality and substance to such traditions  the custode dipped an iron ladle into the miraculous water and we each of us drank a sip and what is very remarkable to me it seemed hard water and almost brackish while many persons think it the sweetest in rome  i suspect that st peter still dabbles in this water and tempers its qualities according to the faith of those who drink it  the staircase descending into the lower dungeon is comparatively modern there having been no entrance of old except through the small circular opening in the roof  in the upper cell the custode showed us an ancient flight of stairs now built into the wall which used to lead from the capitol  the whole precincts are now consecrated and i believe the upper portion perhaps both upper and lower are a shrine or a chapel  i now left s in the forum and went to call on mr j p k at the hotel deurope  i found him just returned from a drivea gentleman of about sixty or more with gray hair a pleasant intellectual face and penetrating but not unkindly eyes  he moved infirmly being on the recovery from an illness  we went up to his saloon together and had a talkor rather he had it nearly all to himselfand particularly sensible talk too and full of the results of learning and experience in the first place he settled the whole kansas difficulty then he made havoc of st peter who came very shabbily out of his hands as regarded his early character in the church and his claims to the position he now holds in it  mr k also gave a curious illustration from something that happened to himself of the little dependence that can be placed on tradition purporting to be ancient and i capped his story by telling him how the site of my townpump so plainly indicated in the sketch itself has already been mistaken in the city council and in the public prints   february 24thyesterday i crossed the ponte sisto and took a short ramble on the other side of the river and it rather surprised me to discover pretty nearly opposite the capitoline hill a quay at which several schooners and barks of two or three hundred tons burden were moored  there was also a steamer armed with a large gun and two brass swivels on her forecastle and i know not what artillery besides probably she may have been a revenuecutter  returning i crossed the river by way of the island of st bartholomew over two bridges  the island is densely covered with buildings and is a separate small fragment of the city  it was a tradition of the ancient romans that it was formed by the aggregation of soil and rubbish brought down by the river and accumulating round the nucleus of some sunken baskets  on reaching the hither side of the river i soon struck upon the ruins of the theatre of marcellus which are very picturesque and the more so from being closely linked in indeed identified with the shops habitations and swarming life of modern rome  the most striking portion was a circular edifice which seemed to have been composed of a row of ionic columns standing upon a lower row of doric many of the antique pillars being yet perfect but the intervening arches built up with brickwork and the whole once magnificent structure now tenanted by poor and squalid people as thick as mites within the round of an old cheese from this point i cannot very clearly trace out my course but i passed i think between the circus maximus and the palace of the caesars and near the baths of caracalla and went into the cloisters of the church of san gregorio  all along i saw massive ruins not particularly picturesque or beautiful but huge mountainous piles chiefly of brickwork somewhat tweedgrown here and there but oftener bare and dreary     all the successive ages since rome began to decay have done their best to ruin the very ruins by taking away the marble and the hewn stone for their own structures and leaving only the inner filling up of brickwork which the ancient architects never designed to be seen the consequence of all this is that except for the lofty and poetical associations connected with it and except too for the immense difference in magnitude a roman ruin may be in itself not more picturesque than i have seen an old cellar with a shattered brick chimney half crumbling down into it in new england  by this time i knew not whither i was going and turned aside from a broad paved road it was the appian way into the via latina which i supposed would lead to one of the city gates  it was a lonely path on my right hand extensive piles of ruin in strange shapes or shapelessness built of the broad and thin old roman bricks such as may be traced everywhere when the stucco has fallen away from a modern roman house for i imagine there has not been a new brick made here for a thousand years  on my left i think was a high wall and before me grazing in the road     the buffalo calf of the marble fauned the road went boldly on with a wellworn track up to the very walls of the city but there it abruptly terminated at an ancient closedup gateway  from a notice posted against a door which appeared to be the entrance to the ruins on my left i found that these were the remains of columbaria where the dead used to be put away in pigeonholes  reaching the paved road again i kept on my course passing the tomb of the scipios and soon came to the gate of san sebastiano through which i entered the campagna  indeed the scene around was so rural that i had fancied myself already beyond the walls  as the afternoon was getting advanced i did not proceed any farther towards the blue hills which i saw in the distance but turned to my left following a road that runs round the exterior of the city wall  it was very dreary and solitary not a house on the whole track with the broad and shaggy campagna on one side and the high bare wall looking down over my head on the other it is not any more than the other objects of the scene a very picturesque wall but is little more than a brick gardenfence seen through a magnifyingglass with now and then a tower however and frequent buttresses to keep its height of fifty feet from toppling over the top was ragged and fringed with a few weeds there had been embrasures for guns and eyeletholes for musketry but these were plastered up with brick or stone  i passed one or two walledup gateways by the by the parts latina was the gate through which belisarius first entered rome and one of these had two high round towers and looked more gothic and venerable with antique strength than any other portion of the wall  immediately after this i came to the gate of san giovanni just within which is the basilica of st john lateran and there i was glad to rest myself upon a bench before proceeding homeward  there was a french sentinel at this gateway as at all the others for the gauls have always been a pest to rome and now gall her worse than ever  i observed too that an official in citizens dress stood there also and appeared to exercise a supervision over some carts with country produce that were entering just then   february 25thwe went this forenoon to the palazzo borghese which is situated on a street that runs at right angles with the corso and very near the latter  most of the palaces in rome and the borghese among them were built somewhere about the sixteenth century this in 1590 i believe  it is an immense edifice standing round the four sides of a quadrangle and though the suite of rooms comprising the picturegallery forms an almost interminable vista they occupy only a part of the groundfloor of one side  we enter from the street into a large court surrounded with a corridor the arches of which support a second series of arches above  the picturerooms open from one into another and have many points of magnificence being large and lofty with vaulted ceilings and beautiful frescos generally of mythological subjects in the flat central part of the vault  the cornices are gilded the deep embrasures of the windows are panelled with woodwork the doorways are of polished and variegated marble or covered with a composition as hard and seemingly as durable  the whole has a kind of splendid shabbiness thrown over it like a slight coating of rust the furniture at least the damask chairs being a good deal worn though there are marble and mosaic tables which may serve to adorn another palace when this one crumbles away with age  one beautiful hall with a ceiling more richly gilded than the rest is panelled all round with large lookingglasses on which are painted pictures both landscapes and human figures in oils so that the effect is somewhat as if you saw these objects represented in the mirrors  these glasses must be of old date perhaps coeval with the first building of the palace for they are so much dimmed that ones own figure appears indistinct in them and more difficult to be traced than the pictures which cover them half over  it was very comfortless indeed i suppose nobody ever thought of being comfortable there since the house was builtbut especially uncomfortable on a chill damp day like this  my fingers were quite numb before i got halfway through the suite of apartments in spite of a brazier of charcoal which was smouldering into ashes in two or three of the rooms  there was not so far as i remember a single fireplace in the suite  a considerable number of visitorsnot many howeverwere there and a good many artists and three or four ladies among them were making copies of the more celebrated pictures and in all or in most cases missing the especial points that made their celebrity and value  the prince borghese certainly demeans himself like a kind and liberal gentleman in throwing open this invaluable collection to the public to see and for artists to carry away with them and diffuse all over the world so far as their own power and skill will permit  it is open every day of the week except saturday and sunday without any irksome restriction or supervision and the fee which custom requires the visitor to pay to the custode has the good effect of making us feel that we are not intruders nor received in an exactly eleemosynary way  the thing could not be better managed  the collection is one of the most celebrated in the world and contains between eight and nine hundred pictures many of which are esteemed masterpieces  i think i was not in a frame for admiration today nor could achieve that free and generous surrender of myself which i have already said is essential to the proper estimate of anything excellent besides how is it possible to give ones soul or any considerable part of it to a single picture seen for the first time among a thousand others all of which set forth their own claims in an equally good light furthermore there is an external weariness and sense of a thousandfold sameness to be overcome before we can begin to enjoy a gallery of the old italian masters     i remember but one painter francia who seems really to have approached this awful class of subjects christs and madonnas in a fitting spirit his pictures are very singular and awkward if you look at them with merely an external eye but they are full of the beauty of holiness and evidently wrought out as acts of devotion with the deepest sincerity and are veritable prayers upon canvas      i was glad in the very last of the twelve rooms to come upon some dutch and flemish pictures very few but very welcome rubens rembrandt vandyke paul potter teniers and othersmen of flesh and blood and warm fists and human hearts  as compared with them these mighty italian masters seem men of polished steel not human nor addressing themselves so much to human sympathies as to a formed intellectual taste   march 1sttoday began very unfavorably but we ventured out at about eleven oclock intending to visit the gallery of the colonna palace finding it closed however on account of the illness of the custode we determined to go to the picturegallery of the capitol and on our way thither we stepped into il gesu the grand and rich church of the jesuits where we found a priest in white preaching a sermon with vast earnestness of action and variety of tones insomuch that i fancied sometimes that two priests were in the agony of sermonizing at once  he had a pretty large and seemingly attentive audience clustered round him from the entrance of the church halfway down the nave while in the chapels of the transepts and in the remoter distances were persons occupied with their own individual devotion  we sat down near the chapel of st ignazio which is adorned with a picture over the altar and with marble sculptures of the trinity aloft and of angels fluttering at the sides  what i particularly noted for the angels were not very real personages being neither earthly nor celestial was the great ball of lapis lazuli the biggest in the world at the feet of the first person in the trinity  the church is a splendid one lined with a great variety of precious marbles     but partly perhaps owing to the dusky light as well as to the want of cleanliness there was a dingy effect upon the whole  we made but a very short stay our new england breeding causing us to feel shy of moving about the church in sermon time  it rained when we reached the capitol and as the museum was not yet open we went into the palace of the conservators on the opposite side of the piazza  around the inner court of the groundfloor partly under two opposite arcades and partly under the sky are several statues and other ancient sculptures among them a statue of julius caesar said to be the only authentic one and certainly giving an impression of him more in accordance with his character than the withered old face in the museum also a statue of augustus in middle age still retaining a resemblance to the bust of him in youth some gigantic heads and hands and feet in marble and bronze a stone lion and horse which lay long at the bottom of a river broken and corroded and were repaired by michel angelo and other things which it were wearisome to set down we inquired of two or three french soldiers the way into the picturegallery but it is our experience that french soldiers in rome never know anything of what is around them not even the name of the palace or public place over which they stand guard and though invariably civil you might as well put a question to a statue of an old roman as to one of them  while we stood under the loggia however looking at the rain plashing into the court a soldier of the papal guard kindly directed us up the staircase and even took pains to go with us to the very entrance of the picturerooms  thank heaven there are but two of them and not many pictures which one cares to look at very long  italian galleries are at a disadvantage as compared with english ones inasmuch as the pictures are not nearly such splendid articles of upholstery though very likely having undergone less cleaning and varnishing they may retain more perfectly the finer touches of the masters  nevertheless i miss the mellow glow the rich and mild external lustre and even the brilliant frames of the pictures i have seen in england  you feel that they have had loving care taken of them even if spoiled it is because they have been valued so much  but these pictures in italian galleries look rusty and lustreless as far as the exterior is concerned and really the splendor of the painting as a production of intellect and feeling has a good deal of difficulty in shining through such clouds  there is a picture at the capitol the rape of europa by paul veronese that would glow with wonderful brilliancy if it were set in a magnificent frame and covered with a sunshine of varnish and it is a kind of picture that would not be desecrated as some deeper and holier ones might be by any splendor of external adornment that could be bestowed on it  it is deplorable and disheartening to see it in faded and shabby plightthis joyous exuberant warm voluptuous work  there is the head of a cow thrust into the picture and staring with wild ludicrous wonder at the godlike bull so as to introduce quite a new sentiment  here and at the borghese palace there were some pictures by garofalo an artist of whom i never heard before but who seemed to have been a man of power  a picture by marie subleyrasa miniature copy from one by her husband of the woman anointing the feet of christis most delicately and beautifully finished and would be an ornament to a drawingroom a thing that could not truly be said of one in a hundred of these grim masterpieces  when they were painted life was not what it is now and the artists had not the same ends in view     it depresses the spirits to go from picture to picture leaving a portion of your vital sympathy at every one so that you come with a kind of halftorpid desperation to the end  on our way down the staircase we saw several noteworthy basreliefs and among them a very ancient one of curtius plunging on horseback into the chasm in the forum  it seems to me however that old sculpture affects the spirits even more dolefully than old painting it strikes colder to the heart and lies heavier upon it being marble than if it were merely canvas  my wife went to revisit the museum which we had already seen on the other side of the piazza but being cold i left her there and went out to ramble in the sun for it was now brightly though fitfully shining again  i walked through the forum where a thorn thrust itself out and tore the sleeve of my talma and under the arch of titus towards the coliseum  about a score of french drummers were beating a long loud rollcall at the base of the coliseum and under its arches and a score of trumpeters responded to these from the rising ground opposite the arch of constantine and the echoes of the old roman ruins especially those of the palace of the caesars responded to this martial uproar of the barbarians  there seemed to be no cause for it but the drummers beat and the trumpeters blew as long as i was within hearing  i walked along the appian way as far as the baths of caracalla  the palace of the caesars which i have never yet explored appears to be crowned by the walls of a convent built no doubt out of some of the fragments that would suffice to build a city and i think there is another convent among the baths  the catholics have taken a peculiar pleasure in planting themselves in the very citadels of paganism whether temples or palaces  there has been a good deal of enjoyment in the destruction of old rome  i often think so when i see the elaborate pains that have been taken to smash and demolish some beautiful column for no purpose whatever except the mere delight of annihilating a noble piece of work  there is something in the impulse with which one sympathizes though i am afraid the destroyers were not sufficiently aware of the mischief they did to enjoy it fully  probably too the early christians were impelled by religious zeal to destroy the pagan temples before the happy thought occurred of converting them into churches   march 3dthis morning was us birthday and we celebrated it by taking a barouche and driving the whole family out on the appian way as far as the tomb of cecilia metella  for the first time since we came to rome the weather was really warma kind of heat producing languor and disinclination to active movement though still a little breeze which was stirring threw an occasional coolness over us and made us distrust the almost sultry atmosphere  i cannot think the roman climate healthy in any of its moods that i have experienced  close on the other side of the road are the ruins of a gothic chapel little more than a few bare walls and painted windows and some other fragmentary structures which we did not particularly examine  u and i clambered through a gap in the wall extending from the basement of the tomb and thus getting into the field beyond went quite round the mausoleum and the remains of the castle connected with it  the latter though still high and stalwart showed few or no architectural features of interest being built i think principally of large bricks and not to be compared to english ruins as a beautiful or venerable object  a little way beyond cecilia metellas tomb the road still shows a specimen of the ancient roman pavement composed of broad flat flagstones a good deal cracked and worn but sound enough probably to outlast the little cubes which make the other portions of the road so uncomfortable  we turned back from this point and soon reentered the gate of st sebastian which is flanked by two small towers and just within which is the old triumphal arch of drususa sturdy construction much dilapidated as regards its architectural beauty but rendered far more picturesque than it could have been in its best days by a crown of verdure on its head  probably so much of the dust of the highway has risen in clouds and settled there that sufficient soil for shrubbery to root itself has thus been collected by small annual contributions in the course of two thousand years  a little farther towards the city we turned aside from the appian way and came to the site of some ancient columbaria close by what seemed to partake of the character of a villa and a farmhouse  a man came out of the house and unlocked a door in a low building apparently quite modern but on entering we found ourselves looking into a large square chamber sunk entirely beneath the surface of the ground  a very narrow and steep staircase of stone and evidently ancient descended into this chamber and going down we found the walls hollowed on all sides into little semicircular niches of which i believe there were nine rows one above another and nine niches in each row  thus they looked somewhat like the little entrances to a pigeonhouse and hence the name of columbarium  each semicircular niche was about a foot in its semidiameter  in the centre of this subterranean chamber was a solid square column or pier rising to the roof and containing other niches of the same pattern besides one that was high and deep rising to the height of a man from the floor on each of the four sides  in every one of the semicircular niches were two round holes covered with an earthen plate and in each hole were ashes and little fragments of bonesthe ashes and bones of the dead whose names were inscribed in roman capitals on marble slabs inlaid into the wall over each individual niche  very likely the great ones in the central pier had contained statues or busts or large urns indeed i remember that some such things were there as well as basreliefs in the walls but hardly more than the general aspect of this strange place remains in my mind  it was the columbarium of the connections or dependants of the caesars and the impression left on me was that this mode of disposing of the dead was infinitely preferable to any which has been adopted since that day  the handful or two of dry dust and bits of dry bones in each of the small round holes had nothing disgusting in them and they are no drier now than they were when first deposited there  i would rather have my ashes scattered over the soil to help the growth of the grass and daisies but still i should not murmur much at having them decently pigeonholed in a roman tomb  after ascending out of this chamber of the dead we looked down into another similar one containing the ashes of pompeys household which was discovered only a very few years ago  its arrangement was the same as that first described except that it had no central pier with a passage round it as the former had  while we were down in the first chamber the proprietor of the spota halfgentlemanly and very affable kind of personcame to us and explained the arrangements of the columbarium though indeed we understood them better by their own aspect than by his explanation  the whole soil around his dwelling is elevated much above the level of the road and it is probable that if he chose to excavate he might bring to light many more sepulchral chambers and find his profit in them too by disposing of the urns and busts  what struck me as much as anything was the neatness of these subterranean apartments which were quite as fit to sleep in as most of those occupied by living romans and having undergone no wear and tear they were in as good condition as on the day they were built  in this columbarium measuring about twenty feet square i roughly estimate that there have been deposited together the remains of at least seven or eight hundred persons reckoning two little heaps of bones and ashes in each pigeonhole nine pigeonholes in each row and nine rows on each side besides those on the middle pier  all difficulty in finding space for the dead would be obviated by returning to the ancient fashion of reducing them to ashesthe only objection though a very serious one being the quantity of fuel that it would require  but perhaps future chemists may discover some better means of consuming or dissolving this troublesome mortality of ours  we got into the carriage again and driving farther towards the city came to the tomb of the scipios of the exterior of which i retain no very definite idea  it was close upon the appian way however though separated from it by a high fence and accessible through a gateway leading into a court  i think the tomb is wholly subterranean and that the ground above it is covered with the buildings of a farmhouse but of this i cannot be certain as we were led immediately into a dark underground passage by an elderly peasant of a cheerful and affable demeanor  as soon as he had brought us into the twilight of the tomb he lighted a long wax taper for each of us and led us groping into blacker and blacker darkness  even little r followed courageously in the procession which looked very picturesque as we glanced backward or forward and beheld a twinkling line of seven lights glimmering faintly on our faces and showing nothing beyond  the passages and niches of the tomb seem to have been hewn and hollowed out of the rock not built by any art of masonry but the walls were very dark almost black and our tapers so dim that i could not gain a sufficient breadth of view to ascertain what kind of place it was  it was very dark indeed the mammoth cave of kentucky could not be darker  the roughhewn roof was within touch and sometimes we had to stoop to avoid hitting our heads it was covered with damps which collected and fell upon us in occasional drops  the passages besides being narrow were so irregular and crooked that after going a little way it would have been impossible to return upon our steps without the help of the guide and we appeared to be taking quite an extensive ramble underground though in reality i suppose the tomb includes no great space  at several turns of our dismal way the guide pointed to inscriptions in roman capitals commemorating various members of the scipio family who were buried here among them a son of scipio africanus who himself had his death and burial in a foreign land  all these inscriptions however are copiesthe originals which were really found here having been removed to the vatican  whether any bones and ashes have been left or whether any were found i do not know  it is not at all events a particularly interesting spot being such shapeless blackness and a mere dark hole requiring a stronger illumination than that of our tapers to distinguish it from any other cellar  i did at one place see a sort of frieze rather roughly sculptured and as we returned towards the twilight of the entrancepassage i discerned a large spider who fled hastily away from our tapersthe solitary living inhabitant of the tomb of the scipios  one visit that we made and i think it was before entering the city gates i forgot to mention  it was to an old edifice formerly called the temple of bacchus but now supposed to have been the temple of virtue and honor  the interior consists of a vaulted hall which was converted from its pagan consecration into a church or chapel by the early christians and the ancient marble pillars of the temple may still be seen built in with the brick and stucco of the later occupants  there is an altar and other tokens of a catholic church and high towards the ceiling there are some frescos of saints or angels very curious specimens of mediaeval and earlier than mediaeval art  nevertheless the place impressed me as still rather pagan than christian  what is most remarkable about this spot or this vicinity lies in the fact that the fountain of egeria was formerly supposed to be close at hand indeed the custode of the chapel still claims the spot as the identical one consecrated by the legend  there is a dark grove of trees not far from the door of the temple but murray a highly essential nuisance on such excursions as this throws such overwhelming doubt or rather incredulity upon the site that i seized upon it as a pretext for not going thither  in fact my small capacity for sightseeing was already more than satisfied  on account of  i am sorry that we did not see the grotto for her enthusiasm is as fresh as the waters of egerias well can be and she has poetical faith enough to light her cheerfully through all these mists of incredulity  our visits to sepulchral places ended with scipios tomb whence we returned to our dwelling and miss m came to dine with us   march 10thon saturday last a very rainy day we went to the sciarra palace and took u with us  it is on the corso nearly opposite to the piazza colonna  it has heaven be praised but four rooms of pictures among which however are several very celebrated ones  only a few of these remain in my memoryraphaels violin player which i am willing to accept as a good picture and leonardo da vincis vanity and modesty which also i can bring up before my minds eye and find it very beautiful although one of the faces has an affected smile which i have since seen on another picture by the same artist joanna of aragon the most striking picture in the collection i think is titians bella donnathe only one of titians works that i have yet seen which makes an impression on me corresponding with his fame  it is a very splendid and very scornful lady as beautiful and as scornful as gainsboroughs lady lyndoch though of an entirely different type  there were two madonnas by guido of which i liked the least celebrated one best and several pictures by garofalo who always produces something noteworthy all the pictures lacked the charm no doubt i am a barbarian to think it one of being in brilliant frames and looked as if it were a long long while since they were cleaned or varnished  the light was so scanty too on that heavily clouded day and in those gloomy old rooms of the palace that scarcely anything could be fairly made out  i cannot refrain from observing here that mr hawthornes inexorable demand for perfection in all things leads him to complain of grimy pictures and tarnished frames and faded frescos distressing beyond measure to eyes that never failed to see everything before him with the keenest apprehension  the usual careless observation of people both of the good and the imperfect is much more comfortable in this imperfect world  but the insight which mr hawthorne possessed was only equalled by his outsight and he suffered in a way not to be readily conceived from any failure in beauty physical moral or intellectual  it is not therefore mere love of upholstery that impels him to ask for perfect settings to priceless gems of art but a native idiosyncrasy which always made me feel that the new jerusalem even like a jasper stone clear as crystal where shall in no wise enter anything that defileth neither what worketh abomination nor maketh a lie would alone satisfy him or rather alone not give him actual pain  it may give an idea of this exquisite nicety of feeling to mention that one day he took in his fingers a halfbloomed rose without blemish and smiling with an infinite joy remarked this is perfect  on earth a flower only can be perfected  the palace is about two hundred and fifty years old and looks as if it had never been a very cheerful place most shabbily and scantily furnished moreover and as chill as any cellar  there is a small balcony looking down on the corso which probably has often been filled with a merry little family party in the carnivals of days long past  it has faded frescos and tarnished gilding and green blinds and a few damask chairs still remain in it  on monday we all went to the sculpturegallery of the vatican and saw as much of the sculpture as we could in the three hours during which the public are admissible  there were a few things which i really enjoyed and a few moments during which i really seemed to see them but it is in vain to attempt giving the impression produced by masterpieces of art and most in vain when we see them best  they are a language in themselves and if they could be expressed as well any way except by themselves there would have been no need of expressing those particular ideas and sentiments by sculpture  i saw the apollo belvedere as something ethereal and godlike only for a flitting moment however and as if he had alighted from heaven or shone suddenly out of the sunlight and then had withdrawn himself again  i felt the laocoon very powerfully though very quietly an immortal agony with a strange calmness diffused through it so that it resembles the vast rage of the sea calm on account of its immensity or the tumult of niagara which does not seem to be tumult because it keeps pouring on for ever and ever  i have not had so good a day as this among works of art since we came to rome and i impute it partly to the magnificence of the arrangements of the vaticanits long vistas and beautiful courts and the aspect of immortality which marble statues acquire by being kept free from dust  a very hungry boy seeing in one of the cabinets a vast porphyry vase fortyfour feet in circumference wished that he had it full of soup  yesterday we went to the pamfili doria palace which i believe is the most splendid in rome  the entrance is from the corso into a court surrounded by a colonnade and having a space of luxuriant verdure and ornamental shrubbery in the centre  the apartments containing pictures and sculptures are fifteen in number and run quite round the court in the first pianoall the rooms halls and galleries of beautiful proportion with vaulted roofs some of which glow with frescos and all are colder and more comfortless than can possibly be imagined without having been in them  the pictures most of them interested me very little  i am of opinion that good pictures are quite as rare as good poets and i do not see why we should pique ourselves on admiring any but the very best  one in a thousand perhaps ought to live in the applause of men from generation to generation till its colors fade or blacken out of sight and its canvas rots away the rest should be put in garrets or painted over by newer artists just as tolerable poets are shelved when their little day is over  nevertheless there was one long gallery containing many pictures that i should be glad to see again under more favorable circumstances that is separately and where i might contemplate them quite undisturbed reclining in an easychair  at one end of the long vista of this gallery is a bust of the present prince doria a smooth sharpnosed rather handsome young man and at the other end his princess an english lady of the talbot family apparently a blonde with a simple and sweet expression  there is a noble and striking portrait of the old venetian admiral andrea doria by sebastian del piombo and some other portraits and busts of the family  in the whole immense range of rooms i saw but a single fireplace and that so deep in the wall that no amount of blaze would raise the atmosphere of the room ten degrees  if the builder of the palace or any of his successors have committed crimes worthy of tophet it would be a still worse punishment for him to wander perpetually through this suite of rooms on the cold floors of polished brick tiles or marble or mosaic growing a little chiller and chiller through every moment of eternity or at least till the palace crumbles down upon him  neither would it assuage his torment in the least to be compelled to gaze up at the dark old picturesthe ugly ghosts of what may once have been beautiful  i am not going to try any more to receive pleasure from a faded tarnished lustreless picture especially if it be a landscape there were two or three landscapes of claude in this palace which i doubt not would have been exquisite if they had been in the condition of those in the british national gallery but here they looked most forlorn and even their sunshine was sunless  the merits of historical painting may be quite independent of the attributes that give pleasure and a superficial ugliness may even heighten the effect but not so of landscapes   via porta palazzo larazani march 11thtoday we called at mr thompsons studio and     he had on the easel a little picture of st peter released from prison by the angel which i saw once before  it is very beautiful indeed and deeply and spiritually conceived and i wish i could afford to have it finished for myself  i looked again too at his georgian slave and admired it as much as at first view so very warm and rich it is so sensuously beautiful and with an expression of higher life and feeling within  i do not think there is a better painter than mr thompson livingamong americans at least not one so earnest faithful and religious in his worship of art  i had rather look at his pictures than at any except the very finest of the old masters and taking into consideration only the comparative pleasure to be derived i would not except more than one or two of those  in painting as in literature i suspect there is something in the productions of the day that takes the fancy more than the works of any past agenot greater merit nor nearly so great but better suited to this very present time  after leaving him we went to the piazza de termini near the baths of diocletian and found our way with some difficulty to crawfords studio it occupies several great rooms connected with the offices of the villa negroni and all these rooms were full of plaster casts and a few works in marbleprincipally portions of his huge washington monument which he left unfinished at his death  close by the door at which we entered stood a gigantic figure of mason in bagwig and the coat waistcoat breeches and knee and shoe buckles of the last century the enlargement of these unheroic matters to far more than heroic size having a very odd effect  there was a figure of jefferson on the same scale another of patrick henry besides a horses head and other portions of the equestrian group which is to cover the summit of the monument  in one of the rooms was a model of the monument itself on a scale i should think of about an inch to afoot  it did not impress me as having grown out of any great and genuine idea in the artists mind but as being merely an ingenious contrivance enough  there were also casts of statues that seemed to be intended for some other monument referring to revolutionary times and personages and with these were intermixed some ideal statues or groupsa naked boy playing marbles very beautiful a girl with flowers the cast of his orpheus of which i long ago saw the marble statue adam and eve floraall with a good deal of merit no doubt but not a single one that justifies crawfords reputation or that satisfies me of his genius  they are but commonplaces in marble and plaster such as we should not tolerate on a printed page  he seems to have been a respectable man highly respectable but no more although those who knew him seem to have rated him much higher  it is said that he exclaimed not very long before his death that he had fifteen years of good work still in him and he appears to have considered all his life and labor heretofore as only preparatory to the great things that he was to achieve hereafter  i should say on the contrary that he was a man who had done his best and had done it early for his orpheus is quite as good as anything else we saw in his studio  people were at work chiselling several statues in marble from the plaster modelsa very interesting process and which i should think a doubtful and hazardous one but the artists say that there is no risk of mischief and that the model is sure to be accurately repeated in the marble these persons who do what is considered the mechanical part of the business are often themselves sculptors and of higher reputation than those who employ them  it is rather sad to think that crawford died before he could see his ideas in the marble where they gleam with so pure and celestial a light as compared with the plaster  there is almost as much difference as between flesh and spirit  the floor of one of the rooms was burdened with immense packages containing parts of the washington monument ready to be forwarded to its destination  when finished and set up it will probably make a very splendid appearance by its height its mass its skilful execution and will produce a moral effect through its images of illustrious men and the associations that connect it with our revolutionary history but i do not think it will owe much to artistic force of thought or depth of feeling  it is certainly in one sense a very foolish and illogical piece of workwashington mounted on an uneasy steed on a very narrow space aloft in the air whence a single step of the horse backward forward or on either side must precipitate him and several of his contemporaries standing beneath him not looking up to wonder at his predicament but each intent on manifesting his own personality to the world around  they have nothing to do with one another nor with washington nor with any great purpose which all are to work out together   march 14thon friday evening i dined at mr t b reads the poet and artist with a party composed of painters and sculptorsthe only exceptions being the american banker and an american tourist who has given mr read a commission  next to me at table sat mr gibson the english sculptor who i suppose stands foremost in his profession at this day  he must be quite an old man now for it was whispered about the table that he is known to have been in rome fortytwo years ago and he himself spoke to me of spending thirtyseven years here before he once returned home  i should hardly take him to be sixty however his hair being more dark than gray his forehead unwrinkled his features unwithered his eye undimmed though his beard is somewhat venerable      he has a quiet selfcontained aspect and being a bachelor has doubtless spent a calm life among his clay and marble meddling little with the world and entangling himself with no cares beyond his studio he did not talk a great deal but enough to show that he is still an englishman in many sturdy traits though his accent has something foreign about it  his conversation was chiefly about india and other topics of the day together with a few reminiscences of people in liverpool where he once resided  there was a kind of simplicity both in his manner and matter and nothing very remarkable in the latter      the gist of what he said upon art was condemnatory of the preraphaelite modern school of painters of whom he seemed to spare none and of their works nothing though he allowed that the old preraphaelites had some exquisite merits which the moderns entirely omit in their imitations  in his own art he said the aim should be to find out the principles on which the greek sculptors wrought and to do the work of this day on those principles and in their spirit a fair doctrine enough i should think but which mr gibson can scarcely be said to practise     the difference between the preraphaelites and himself is deep and genuine they being literalists and realists in a certain sense and he a pagan idealist  methinks they have hold of the best end of the matter   march 18thtoday it being very bright and mild we set out at noon for an expedition to the temple of vesta though i did not feel much inclined for walking having been ill and feverish for two or three days past with a cold which keeps renewing itself faster than i can get rid of it  we kept along on this side of the corso and crossed the forum skirting along the capitoline hill and thence towards the circus maximus  on our way looking down a cross street we saw a heavy arch and on examination made it out to be the arch of janus quadrifrons standing in the forum boarium  its base is now considerably below the level of the surrounding soil and there is a church or basilica close by and some mean edifices looking down upon it  there is something satisfactory in this arch from the immense solidity of its structure it gives the idea in the first place of a solid mass constructed of huge blocks of marble which time can never wear away nor earthquakes shake down and then this solid mass is penetrated by two arched passages meeting in the centre  there are empty niches three in a row and i think two rows on each face but there seems to have been very little effort to make it a beautiful object  on the top is some brickwork the remains of a mediaeval fortress built by the frangipanis looking very frail and temporary being brought thus in contact with the antique strength of the arch  a few yards off across the street and close beside the basilica is what appears to be an ancient portal with carved basreliefs and an inscription which i could not make out  some romans were lying dormant in the sun on the steps of the basilica indeed now that the sun is getting warmer they seem to take advantage of every quiet nook to bask in and perhaps to go to sleep  we had gone but a little way from the arch and across the circus maximus when we saw the temple of vesta before us on the hank of the tiber which however we could not see behind it  it is a most perfectly preserved roman ruin and very beautiful though so small that in a suitable locality one would take it rather for a gardenhouse than an ancient temple  a circle of white marble pillars much timeworn and a little battered though but one of them broken surround the solid structure of the temple leaving a circular walk between it and the pillars the whole covered by a modern roof which looks like wood and disgraces and deforms the elegant little building  this roof resembles as much as anything else the round wicker cover of a basket and gives a very squat aspect to the temple  the pillars are of the corinthian order and when they were new and the marble snowwhite and sharply carved and cut there could not have been a prettier object in all rome but so small an edifice does not appear well as a ruin  within view of it and indeed a very little way off is the temple of fortuna virilis which likewise retains its antique form in better preservation than we generally find a roman ruin although the ionic pillars are now built up with blocks of stone and patches of brickwork the whole constituting a church which is fixed against the side of a tall edifice the nature of which i do not know  i forgot to say that we gained admittance into the temple of vesta and found the interior a plain cylinder of marble about ten paces across and fitted up as a chapel where the virgin takes the place of vesta  in very close vicinity we came upon the ponto rotto the old pons emilius which was broken down long ago and has recently been pieced out by connecting a suspension bridge with the old piers  we crossed by this bridge paying a toll of a baioccho each and stopped in the midst of the river to look at the temple of vesta which shows well right on the brink of the tiber  we fancied too that we could discern a little farther down the river the ruined and almost submerged piers of the sublician bridge which horatius cocles defended  the tiber here whirls rapidly along and horatius must have had a perilous swim for his life and the enemy a fair mark at his head with their arrows  i think this is the most picturesque part of the tiber in its passage through rome  after crossing the bridge we kept along the right bank of the river through the dirty and hardhearted streets of trastevere which have in no respect the advantage over those of hither rome till we reached st peters  we saw a family sitting before their door on the pavement in the narrow and sunny street engaged in their domestic avocationsthe old woman spinning with a wheel  i suppose the people now begin to live out of doors  we entered beneath the colonnade of st peters and immediately became sensible of an evil odorthe bad odor of our fallen nature which there is no escaping in any nook of rome      between the pillars of the colonnade however we had the pleasant spectacle of the two fountains sending up their lilyshaped gush with rainbows shining in their falling spray  parties of french soldiers as usual were undergoing their drill in the piazza  when we entered the church the long dusty sunbeams were falling aslantwise through the dome and through the chancel behind it       march 23don the 21st we all went to the coliseum and enjoyed ourselves there in the bright warm sunso bright and warm that we were glad to get into the shadow of the walls and under the arches though after all there was the freshness of march in the breeze that stirred now and then  j and baby found some beautiful flowers growing round about the coliseum and far up towards the top of the walls we saw tufts of yellow wallflowers and a great deal of green grass growing along the ridges between the arches  the general aspect of the place however is somewhat bare and does not compare favorably with an english ruin both on account of the lack of ivy and because the material is chiefly brick the stone and marble having been stolen away by popes and cardinals to build their palaces  while we sat within the circle many people of both sexes passed through kissing the iron cross which stands in the centre thereby gaining an indulgence of seven years i believe  in front of several churches i have seen an inscription in latin indulgentia plenaria et perpetua pro cunctis mortuis et vivis than which it seems to me nothing more could be asked or desired  the terms of this great boon are not mentioned  leaving the coliseum we went and sat down in the vicinity of the arch of constantine and j and r went in quest of lizards  j soon caught a large one with two tails one a sort of afterthought or appendix or corollary to the original tail and growing out from it instead of from the body of the lizard  these reptiles are very abundant and j has already brought home several which make their escape and appear occasionally darting to and fro on the carpet  since we have been here j has taken up various pursuits in turn  first he voted himself to gathering snailshells of which there are many sorts afterwards he had a fever for marbles pieces of which he found on the banks of the tiber just on the edge of its muddy waters and in the palace of the caesars the baths of caracalla and indeed wherever else his fancy led him verde antique rosso antico porphyry giallo antico serpentine sometimes fragments of basreliefs and mouldings bits of mosaic still firmly stuck together on which the foot of a caesar had perhaps once trodden pieces of roman glass with the iridescence glowing on them and all such things of which the soil of rome is full  it would not be difficult from the spoil of his boyish rambles to furnish what would be looked upon as a curious and valuable museum in america  yesterday we went to the sculpturegalleries of the vatican  i think i enjoy these noble galleries and their contents and beautiful arrangement better than anything else in the way of art and often i seem to have a deep feeling of something wonderful in what i look at  the laocoon on this visit impressed me not less than before it is such a type of human beings struggling with an inextricable trouble and entangled in a complication which they cannot free themselves from by their own efforts and out of which heaven alone can help them  it was a most powerful mind and one capable of reducing a complex idea to unity that imagined this group  i looked at canovas perseus and thought it exceedingly beautiful but found myself less and less contented after a moment or two though i could not tell why  afterwards looking at the apollo the recollection of the perseus disgusted me and yet really i cannot explain how one is better than the other  i was interested in looking at the busts of the triumvirs antony augustus and lepidus  the first two are men of intellect evidently though they do not recommend themselves to ones affections by their physiognomy but lepidus has the strangest most commonplace countenance that can be imaginedsmallfeatured weak such a face as you meet anywhere in a man of no mark but are amazed to find in one of the three foremost men of the world  i suppose that it is these weak and shallow men when chance raises them above their proper sphere who commit enormous crimes without any such restraint as stronger men would feel and without any retribution in the depth of their conscience  these old roman busts of which there are so many in the vatican have often a most lifelike aspect a striking individuality  one recognizes them as faithful portraits just as certainly as if the living originals were standing beside them  the arrangement of the hair and beard too in many cases is just what we see now the fashions of two thousand years ago having come round again   march 25thon tuesday we went to breakfast at william storys in the palazzo barberini  we had a very pleasant time  he is one of the most agreeable men i know in society  he showed us a note from thackeray an invitation to dinner written in hieroglyphics with great fun and pictorial merit  he spoke of an expansion of the story of blue beard which he himself had either written or thought of writing in which the contents of the several chambers which fatima opened before arriving at the fatal one were to be described  this idea has haunted my mind ever since and if it had but been my own i am pretty sure that it would develop itself into something very rich  i mean to press william story to work it out  the chamber of blue beard too and this was a part of his suggestion might be so handled as to become powerfully interesting were i to take up the story i would create an interest by suggesting a secret in the first chamber which would develop itself more and more in every successive hall of the great palace and lead the wife irresistibly to the chamber of horrors  after breakfast we went to the barberini library passing through the vast hall which occupies the central part of the palace  it is the most splendid domestic hall i have seen eighty feet in length at least and of proportionate breadth and height and the vaulted ceiling is entirely covered to its utmost edge and remotest corners with a brilliant painting in fresco looking like a whole heaven of angelic people descending towards the floor  the effect is indescribably gorgeous  on one side stands a baldacchino or canopy of state draped with scarlet cloth and fringed with gold embroidery the scarlet indicating that the palace is inhabited by a cardinal  green would be appropriate to a prince  in point of fact the palazzo barberini is inhabited by a cardinal a prince and a duke all belonging to the barberini family and each having his separate portion of the palace while their servants have a common territory and meetingground in this noble hall  after admiring it for a few minutes we made our exit by a door on the opposite side and went up the spiral staircase of marble to the library where we were received by an ecclesiastic who belongs to the barberini household and i believe was born in it  he is a gentle refined quietlooking man as well he may be having spent all his life among these books where few people intrude and few cares can come  he showed us a very old bible in parchment a specimen of the earliest printing beautifully ornamented with pictures and some monkish illuminations of indescribable delicacy and elaboration  no artist could afford to produce such work if the life that he thus lavished on one sheet of parchment had any value to him either for what could be done or enjoyed in it  there are about eight thousand volumes in this library and judging by their outward aspect the collection must be curious and valuable but having another engagement we could spend only a little time here  we had a hasty glance however of some poems of tasso in his own autograph  we then went to the palazzo galitzin where dwell the misses weston with whom we lunched and where we met a french abbe an agreeable man and an antiquarian under whose auspices two of the ladies and ourselves took carriage for the castle of st angelo  being admitted within the external gateway we found ourselves in the court of guard as i presume it is called where the french soldiers were playing with very dirty cards or lounging about in military idleness  they were well behaved and courteous and when we had intimated our wish to see the interior of the castle a soldier soon appeared with a large unlighted torch in his hand ready to guide us  there is an outer wall surrounding the solid structure of hadrians tomb to which there is access by one or two drawbridges the entrance to the tomb or castle not being at the base but near its central height  the ancient entrance by which hadrians ashes and those of other imperial personages were probably brought into this tomb has been walled upperhaps ever since the last emperor was buried here  we were now in a vaulted passage both lofty and broad which circles round the whole interior of the tomb from the base to the summit  during many hundred years the passage was filled with earth and rubbish and forgotten and it is but partly excavated even now although we found it a long long and gloomy descent by torchlight to the base of the vast mausoleum  the passage was once lined and vaulted with precious marbles which are now entirely gone and paved with fine mosaics portions of which still remain and our guide lowered his flaming torch to show them to us here and there amid the earthy dampness over which we trod  it is strange to think what splendor and costly adornment were here wasted on the dead  after we had descended to the bottom of this passage and again retraced our steps to the highest part the guide took a large cannonball and sent it with his whole force rolling down the hollow arched way rumbling and reverberating and bellowing forth long thunderous echoes and winding up with a loud distant crash that seemed to come from the very bowels of the earth  we saw the place near the centre of the mausoleum and lighted from above through an immense thickness of stone and brick where the ashes of the emperor and his fellowslumberers were found  it is as much as twelve centuries very likely since they were scattered to the winds for the tomb has been nearly or quite that space of time a fortress the tomb itself is merely the base and foundation of the castle and being so massively built it serves just as well for the purpose as if it were a solid granite rock  the mediaeval fortress with its antiquity of more than a thousand years and having dark and deep dungeons of its own is but a modern excrescence on the top of hadrians tomb  we now ascended towards the upper region and were led into the vaults which used to serve as a prison but which if i mistake not are situated above the ancient structure although they seem as damp and subterranean as if they were fifty feet under the earth  we crept down to them through narrow and ugly passages which the torchlight would not illuminate and stooping under a low square entrance we followed the guide into a small vaulted roomnot a room but an artificial cavern remote from light or air where beatrice cenci was confined before her execution  according to the abbe she spent a whole year in this dreadful pit her trial having dragged on through that length of time how ghostlike she must have looked when she came forth  guido never painted that beautiful picture from her blanched face as it appeared after this confinement  and how rejoiced she must have been to die at last having already been in a sepulchre so long  adjacent to beatrices prison but not communicating with it was that of her stepmother and next to the latter was one that interested me almost as much as beatricesthat of benvenuto cellini who was confined here i believe for an assassination  all these prison vaults are more horrible than can be imagined without seeing them but there are worse places here for the guide lifted a trapdoor in one of the passages and held his torch down into an inscrutable pit beneath our feet  it was an oubliette a dungeon where the prisoner might be buried alive and never come forth again alive or dead  groping about among these sad precincts we saw various other things that looked very dismal but at last emerged into the sunshine and ascended from one platform and battlement to another till we found ourselves right at the feet of the archangel michael  he has stood there in bronze for i know not how many hundred years in the act of sheathing a now rusty sword such being the attitude in which he appeared to one of the popes in a vision in token that a pestilence which was then desolating rome was to be stayed  there is a fine view from the lofty station over rome and the whole adjacent country and the abbe pointed out the site of ardea of corioli of veii and other places renowned in story  we were ushered too into the french commandants quarters in the castle  there is a large hall ornamented with frescos and accessible from this a drawingroom comfortably fitted up and where we saw modern furniture and a chessboard and a fire burning clear and other symptoms that the place had perhaps just been vacated by civilized and kindly people  but in one corner of the ceiling the abbe pointed out a ring by which in the times of mediaeval anarchy when popes cardinals and barons were all by the ears together a cardinal was hanged  it was not an assassination but a legal punishment and he was executed in the best apartment of the castle as an act of grace  the fortress is a straightlined structure on the summit of the immense round tower of hadrians tomb and to make out the idea of it we must throw in drawbridges esplanades piles of ancient marble balls for cannon battlements and embrasures lying high in the breeze and sunshine and opening views round the whole horizon accommodation for the soldiers and many small beds in a large room  how much mistaken was the emperor in his expectation of a stately solemn repose for his ashes through all the coming centuries as long as the world should endure  perhaps his ghost glides up and down disconsolate in that spiral passage which goes from top to bottom of the tomb while the barbarous gauls plant themselves in his very mausoleum to keep the imperial city in awe  leaving the castle of st angelo we drove still on the same side of the tiber to the villa pamfili which lies a short distance beyond the walls  as we passed through one of the gates i think it was that of san pancrazio the abbe pointed out the spot where the constable de bourbon was killed while attempting to scale the walls  if we are to believe benvenuto cellini it was he who shot the constable  the road to the villa is not very interesting lying as the roads in the vicinity of rome often do between very high walls admitting not a glimpse of the surrounding country the road itself white and dusty with no verdant margin of grass or border of shrubbery  at the portal of the villa we found many carriages in waiting for the prince doria throws open the grounds to all comers and on a pleasant day like this they are probably sure to be thronged  we left our carriage just within the entrance and rambled among these beautiful groves admiring the liveoak trees and the stonepines which latter are truly a majestic tree with tall columnar stems supporting a cloudlike density of boughs far aloft and not a straggling branch between there and the ground  they stand in straight rows but are now so ancient and venerable as to have lost the formal look of a plantation and seem like a wood that might have arranged itself almost of its own will  beneath them is a flowerstrewn turf quite free of underbrush  we found open fields and lawns moreover all abloom with anemones white and rosecolored and purple and golden and far larger than could be found out of italy except in hothouses  violets too were abundant and exceedingly fragrant  when we consider that all this floral exuberance occurs in the midst of march there does not appear much ground for complaining of the roman climate and so long ago as the first week of february i found daisies among the grass on the sunny side of the basilica of st john lateran  at this very moment i suppose the country within twenty miles of boston may be two feet deep with snow and the streams solid with ice  we wandered about the grounds and found them very beautiful indeed nature having done much for them by an undulating variety of surface and art having added a good many charms which have all the better effect now that decay and neglect have thrown a natural grace over them likewise there is an artificial ruin so picturesque that it betrays itself weatherbeaten statues and pieces of sculpture scattered here and there an artificial lake with upgushing fountains cascades and broadbosomed coves and long canallike reaches with swans taking their delight upon them  i never saw such a glorious and resplendent lustre of white as shone between the wings of two of these swans  it was really a sight to see and not to be imagined beforehand  angels no doubt have just such lustrous wings as those  english swans partake of the dinginess of the atmosphere and their plumage has nothing at all to be compared to this in fact there is nothing like it in the world unless it be the illuminated portion of a fleecy summer cloud  while we were sauntering along beside this piece of water we were surprised to see u on the other side  she had come hither with e s and her two little brothers and with our r the whole under the charge of mrs storys nurserymaids  u and e crossed not over but beneath the water through a grotto and exchanged greetings with us  then as it was getting towards sunset and cool we took our departure the abbe as we left the grounds taking me aside to give me a glimpse of a columbarium which descends into the earth to about the depth to which an ordinary house might rise above it  these grounds it is said formed the country residence of the emperor galba and he was buried here after his assassination  it is a sad thought that so much natural beauty and long refinement of picturesque culture is thrown away the villa being uninhabitable during all the most delightful season of the year on account of malaria  there is truly a curse on rome and all its neighborhood  on our way home we passed by the great paolina fountain and were assailed by many beggars during the short time we stopped to look at it it is a very copious fountain but not so beautiful as the trevi taking into view merely the watergush of the latter   march 26thyesterday between twelve and one our whole family went to the villa ludovisi the entrance to which is at the termination of a street which passes out of the piazza barberini and it is no very great distance from our own street via porta pinciana  the grounds though very extensive are wholly within the walls of the city which skirt them and comprise a part of what were formerly the gardens of sallust the villa is now the property of prince piombini a ticket from whom procured us admission  a little within the gateway to the right is a casino containing two large rooms filled with sculpture much of which is very valuable  a colossal head of juno i believe is considered the greatest treasure of the collection but i did not myself feel it to be so nor indeed did i receive any strong impression of its excellence  i admired nothing so much i think as the face of penelope if it be her face in the group supposed also to represent electra and orestes  the sitting statue of mars is very fine so is the arria and paetus so are many other busts and figures  by and by we left the casino and wandered among the grounds threading interminable alleys of cypress through the long vistas of which we could see here and there a statue an urn a pillar a temple or gardenhouse or a basrelief against the wall  it seems as if there must have been a time and not so very long agowhen it was worth while to spend money and thought upon the ornamentation of grounds in the neighborhood of rome  that time is past however and the result is very melancholy for great beauty has been produced but it can be enjoyed in its perfection only at the peril of ones life     for my part and judging from my own experience i suspect that the roman atmosphere never wholesome is always more or less poisonous  we came to another and larger casino remote from the gateway in which the prince resides during two months of the year  it was now under repair but we gained admission as did several other visitors and saw in the entrancehall the aurora of guercino painted in fresco on the ceiling  there is beauty in the design but the painter certainly was most unhappy in his black shadows and in the work before us they give the impression of a cloudy and lowering morning which is likely enough to turn to rain by and by  after viewing the fresco we mounted by a spiral staircase to a lofty terrace and found rome at our feet and far off the sabine and alban mountains some of them still capped with snow  in another direction there was a vast plain on the horizon of which could our eyes have reached to its verge we might perhaps have seen the mediterranean sea  after enjoying the view and the warm sunshine we descended and went in quest of the gardens of sallust but found no satisfactory remains of them  one of the most striking objects in the first casino was a group by berninipluto an outrageously masculine and strenuous figure heavily bearded ravishing away a little tender proserpine whom he holds aloft while his forcible gripe impresses itself into her soft virgin flesh  it is very disagreeable but it makes one feel that bernini was a man of great ability  there are some works in literature that bear an analogy to his works in sculpture when great power is lavished a little outside of nature and therefore proves to be only a fashionand not permanently adapted to the tastes of mankind   march 27thyesterday forenoon my wife and i went to st peters to see the pope pray at the chapel of the holy sacrament  we found a good many people in the church but not an inconvenient number indeed not so many as to make any remarkable show in the great nave nor even in front of the chapel  a detachment of the swiss guard in their strange picturesque harlequinlike costume were on duty before the chapel in which the wax tapers were all lighted and a priedieu was arranged near the shrine and covered with scarlet velvet  on each side along the breadth of the side aisle were placed seats covered with rich tapestry or carpeting and some gentlemen and ladiesenglish probably or americanhad comfortably deposited themselves here but were compelled to move by the guards before the popes entrance  his holiness should have appeared precisely at twelve but we waited nearly half an hour beyond that time and it seemed to me particularly illmannered in the pope who owes the courtesy of being punctual to the people if not to st peter  by and by however there was a stir the guard motioned to us to stand away from the benches against the backs of which we had been leaning the spectators in the nave looked towards the door as if they beheld something approaching and first there appeared some cardinals in scarlet skullcaps and purple robes intermixed with some of the noble guard and other attendants  it was not a very formal and stately procession but rather straggled onward with ragged edges the spectators standing aside to let it pass and merely bowing or perhaps slightly bending the knee as good catholics are accustomed to do when passing before the shrines of saints  then in the midst of the purple cardinals all of whom were grayhaired men appeared a stout old man with a white skullcap a scarlet goldembroidered cape falling over his shoulders and a white silk robe the train of which was borne up by an attendant  he walked slowly with a sort of dignified movement stepping out broadly and planting his feet on which were red shoes flat upon the pavement as if he were not much accustomed to locomotion and perhaps had known a twinge of the gout  his face was kindly and venerable but not particularly impressive  arriving at the scarletcovered priedieu he kneeled down and took off his white skullcap the cardinals also kneeled behind and on either side of him taking off their scarlet skullcaps while the noble guard remained standing six on one side of his holiness and six on the other  the pope bent his head upon the priedieu and seemed to spend three or four minutes in prayer then rose and all the purple cardinals and bishops and priests of whatever degree rose behind and beside him  next he went to kiss st peters toe at least i believe he kissed it but i was not near enough to be certain and lastly he knelt down and directed his devotions towards the high altar  this completed the ceremonies and his holiness left the church by a side door making a short passage into the vatican  i am very glad i have seen the pope because now he may be crossed out of the list of sights to be seen  his proximity impressed me kindly and favorably towards him and i did not see one face among all his cardinals in whose number doubtless is his successor which i would so soon trust as that of pio nono  this morning i walked as far as the gate of san paolo and on approaching it i saw the gray sharp pyramid of caius cestius pointing upward close to the two darkbrown battlemented gothic towers of the gateway each of these very different pieces of architecture looking the more picturesque for the contrast of the other  before approaching the gateway and pyramid i walked onward and soon came in sight of monte testaccio the artificial hill made of potsherds  there is a gate admitting into the grounds around the hill and a road encircling its base  at a distance the hill looks greener than any other part of the landscape and has all the curved outlines of a natural hill resembling in shape a headless sphinx or saddleback mountain as i used to see it from lenox  it is of very considerable heighttwo or three hundred feet at least i should sayand well entitled both by its elevation and the space it covers to be reckoned among the hills of rome  its base is almost entirely surrounded with small structures which seem to be used as farmbuildings  on the summit is a large iron cross the church having thought it expedient to redeem these shattered pipkins from the power of paganism as it has so many other roman ruins  there was a pathway up the hill but i did not choose to ascend it under the hot sun so steeply did it clamber up  there appears to be a good depth of soil on most parts of monte testaccio but on some of the sides you observe precipices bristling with fragments of red or brown earthenware or pieces of vases of white unglazed clay and it is evident that this immense pile is entirely composed of broken crockery which i should hardly have thought would have aggregated to such a heap had it all been thrown hereurns teacups porcelain or earthensince the beginning of the world  i walked quite round the hill and saw at no great distance from it the enclosure of the protestant burialground which lies so close to the pyramid of caius cestius that the latter may serve as a general monument to the dead  deferring for the present a visit to the cemetery or to the interior of the pyramid i returned to the gateway of san paolo and passing through it took a view of it from the outside of the city wall it is itself a portion of the wall having been built into it by the emperor aurelian so that about half of it lies within and half without the brick or red stone material of the wall being so unlike the marble of the pyramid the latter is as distinct and seems as insulated as if it stood alone in the centre of a plain and really i do not think there is a more striking architectural object in rome  it is in perfect condition just as little ruined or decayed as on the day when the builder put the last peak on the summit and it ascends steeply from its base with a point so sharp that it looks as if it would hardly afford foothold to a bird  the marble was once white but is now covered with a gray coating like that which has gathered upon the statues of castor and pollux on monte cavallo  not one of the great blocks is displaced nor seems likely to be through all time to come  they rest one upon another in straight and even lines and present a vast smooth triangle ascending from a base of a hundred feet and narrowing to an apex at the height of a hundred and twentyfive the junctures of the marble slabs being so close that in all these twenty centuries only a few little tufts of grass and a trailing plant or two have succeeded in rooting themselves into the interstices  it is good and satisfactory to see anything which being built for an enduring monument has endured so faithfully and has a prospect of such an interminable futurity before it  once indeed it seemed likely to be buried for three hundred years ago it had become covered to the depth of sixteen feet but the soil has since been dug away from its base which is now lower than that of the road which passes through the neighboring gate of san paolo  midway up the pyramid cut in the marble is an inscription in large roman letters still almost as legible as when first wrought  i did not return through the paolo gateway but kept onward round the exterior of the wall till i came to the gate of san sebastiano  it was a hot and not a very interesting walk with only a high bare wall of brick broken by frequent square towers on one side of the road and a bank and hedge or a garden wall on the other  roman roads are most inhospitable offering no shade and no seat and no pleasant views of rustic domiciles nothing but the wheeltrack of white dust without a foot path running by its side and seldom any grassy margin to refresh the wayfarers feet   april 3da few days ago we visited the studio of mr  an american who seems to have a good deal of vogue as a sculptor  we found a figure of pocahontas which he has repeated several times another which he calls the wept of the wishtonwish a figure of a smiling girl playing with a cat and dog and a schoolboy mending a pen  these two last were the only ones that gave me any pleasure or that really had any merit for his cleverness and ingenuity appear in homely subjects but are quite lost in attempts at a higher ideality  nevertheless he has a group of the prodigal son possessing more merit than i should have expected from mr  the son reclining his head on his fathers breast with an expression of utter weariness at length finding perfect rest while the father bends his benign countenance over him and seems to receive him calmly into himself  this group the plastercast standing beside it is now taking shape out of an immense block of marble and will be as indestructible as the laocoon an idea at once awful and ludicrous when we consider that it is at best but a respectable production  i have since been told that mr  had stolen adopted we will rather say the attitude and idea of the group from one executed by a student of the french academy and to be seen there in plaster  we afterwards saw it in the medici casino  mr  has now been ten years in italy and after all this time he is still entirely american in everything but the most external surface of his manners scarcely europeanized or much modified even in that  he is a native of  but had his early breeding in new york and might for any polish or refinement that i can discern in him still be a country shopkeeper in the interior of new york state or new england  how strange  for one expects to find the polish the close grain and white purity of marble in the artist who works in that noble material but after all he handles club and judging by the specimens i have seen here is apt to be clay not of the finest himself  mr  is sensible shrewd keen clever an ingenious workman no doubt with tact enough and not destitute of taste very agreeable and lively in his conversation talking as fast and as naturally as a brook runs without the slightest affectation  his naturalness is in fact a rather striking characteristic in view of his lack of culture while yet his life has been concerned with idealities and a beautiful art  what degree of taste he pretends to he seems really to possess nor did i hear a single idea from him that struck me as otherwise than sensible  he called to see us last evening and talked for about two hours in a very amusing and interesting style his topics being taken from his own personal experience and shrewdly treated  he spoke much of greenough whom he described as an excellent critic of art but possessed of not the slightest inventive genius  his statue of washington at the capitol is taken precisely from the plodian jupiter his chanting cherubs are copied in marble from two figures in a picture by raphael  he did nothing that was original with himself  today we took r and went to see miss  and as her studio seems to be mixed up with gibsons we had an opportunity of glancing at some of his beautiful works  we saw a venus and a cupid both of them tinted and side by side with them other statues identical with these except that the marble was left in its pure whiteness  we found miss  in a little upper room  she has a small brisk wideawake figure not ungraceful frank simple straightforward and downright  she had on a robe i think but i did not look so low my attention being chiefly drawn to a sort of mans sack of purple or plumcolored broadcloth into the sidepockets of which her hands were thrust as she came forward to greet us  she withdrew one hand however and presented it cordially to my wife whom she already knew and to myself without waiting for an introduction  she had on a shirtfront collar and cravat like a mans with a brooch of etruscan gold and on her curly head was a picturesque little cap of black velvet and her face was as bright and merry and as small of feature as a childs  it looked in one aspect youthful and yet there was something worn in it too there never was anything so jaunty as her movement and action she was very peculiar but she seemed to be her actual self and nothing affected or made up so that for my part i gave her full leave to wear what may suit her best and to behave as her inner woman prompts  i dont quite see however what she is to do when she grows older for the decorum of age will not be consistent with a costume that looks pretty and excusable enough in a young woman  miss  led us into a part of the extensive studio or collection of studios where some of her own works were to be seen beatrice cenci which did not very greatly impress me and a monumental design a female figurewholly draped even to the stockings and shoesin a quiet sleep  i liked this last  there was also a puck doubtless full of fun but i had hardly time to glance at it  miss  evidently has good gifts in her profession and doubtless she derives great advantage from her close association with a consummate artist like gibson nor yet does his influence seem to interfere with the originality of her own conceptions  in one way at least she can hardly fail to profitthat is by the opportunity of showing her works to the throngs of people who go to see gibsons own and these are just such people as an artist would most desire to meet and might never see in a lifetime if left to himself  i shook hands with this frank and pleasant little person and took leave not without purpose of seeing her again  within a few days there have been many pilgrims in rome who come hither to attend the ceremonies of holy week and to perform their vows and undergo their penances  i saw two of them near the forum yesterday with their pilgrim staves in the fashion of a thousand years ago     i sat down on a bench near one of the chapels and a woman immediately came up to me to beg  i at first refused but she knelt down by my side and instead of praying to the saint prayed to me and being thus treated as a canonized personage i thought it incumbent on me to be gracious to the extent of half a paul  my wife some time ago came in contact with a pickpocket at the entrance of a church and failing in his enterprise upon her purse he passed in dipped his thieving fingers in the holy water and paid his devotions at a shrine  missing the purse he said his prayers in the hope perhaps that the saint would send him better luck another time   april 10thi have made no entries in my journal recently being exceedingly lazy partly from indisposition as well as from an atmosphere that takes the vivacity out of everybody  not much has happened or been effected  last sunday which was easter sunday i went with j to st peters where we arrived at about nine oclock and found a multitude of people already assembled in the church  the interior was arrayed in festal guise there being a covering of scarlet damask over the pilasters of the nave from base to capital giving an effect of splendor yet with a loss as to the apparent dimensions of the interior  a guard of soldiers occupied the nave keeping open a wide space for the passage of a procession that was momently expected and soon arrived  the crowd was too great to allow of my seeing it in detail but i could perceive that there were priests cardinals swiss guards some of them with corselets on and by and by the pope himself was borne up the nave high over the heads of all sitting under a canopy crowned with his tiara  he floated slowly along and was set down in the neighborhood of the high altar and the procession being broken up some of its scattered members might be seen here and there about the churchofficials in antique spanish dresses swiss guards in polished steel breastplates servingmen in richly embroidered liveries officers in scarlet coats and military boots priests and divers other shapes of men for the papal ceremonies seem to forego little or nothing that belongs to times past while it includes everything appertaining to the present  i ought to have waited to witness the papal benediction from the balcony in front of the church or at least to hear the famous silver trumpets sounding from the dome but j grew weary to say the truth so did i and we went on a long walk out of the nearest city gate and back through the janiculum and finally homeward over the ponto rotto  standing on the bridge i saw the arch of the cloaca maxima close by the temple of vesta with the water rising within two or three feet of its keystone  the same evening we went to monte cavallo where from the gateway of the pontifical palace we saw the illumination of st peters  mr akers the sculptor had recommended this position to us and accompanied us thither as the best point from which the illumination could be witnessed at a distance without the incommodity of such a crowd as would be assembled at the pincian  the first illumination the silver one as it is called was very grand and delicate describing the outline of the great edifice and crowning dome in light while the day was not yet wholly departed  as  finally remarked it seemed like the glorified spirit of the church made visible or as i will add it looked as this famous and nevertobeforgotten structure will look to the imaginations of men through the waste and gloom of future ages after it shall have gone quite to decay and ruin the brilliant though scarcely distinct gleam of a statelier dome than ever was seen shining on the background of the night of time  this simile looked prettier in my fancy than i have made it look on paper  after we had enjoyed the silver illumination a good while and when all the daylight had given place to the constellated night the distant outline of st peters burst forth in the twinkling of an eye into a starry blaze being quite the finest effect that i ever witnessed  i stayed to see it however only a few minutes for i was quite ill and feverish with a coldwhich indeed i have seldom been free from since my first breathing of the genial atmosphere of rome  this pestilence kept me within doors all the next day and prevented me from seeing the beautiful fireworks that were exhibited in the evening from the platform on the pincian above the piazza del popolo  on thursday i paid another visit to the sculpturegallery of the capitol where i was particularly struck with a bust of cato the censor who must have been the most disagreeable stubborn uglytempered pigheaded narrowminded strongwilled old roman that ever lived  the collection of busts here and at the vatican are most interesting many of the individual heads being full of character and commending themselves by intrinsic evidence as faithful portraits of the originals  these stone people have stood face to face with caesar and all the other emperors and with statesmen soldiers philosophers and poets of the antique world and have been to them like their reflections in a mirror it is the next thing to seeing the men themselves  we went afterwards into the palace of the conservatori and saw among various other interesting things the bronze wolf suckling romulus and remus who sit beneath her dugs with open mouths to receive the milk  on friday we all went to see the popes palace on the quirinal  there was a vast hall and an interminable suite of rooms cased with marble floored with marble or mosaics or inlaid wood adorned with frescos on the vaulted ceilings and many of them lined with gobelin tapestry not wofully faded like almost all that i have hitherto seen but brilliant as pictures  indeed some of them so closely resembled paintings that i could hardly believe they were not so and the effect was even richer than that of oilpaintings  in every room there was a crucifix but i did not see a single nook or corner where anybody could have dreamed of being comfortable  nevertheless as a stately and solemn residence for his holiness it is quite a satisfactory affair  afterwards we went into the pontifical gardens connected with the palace  they are very extensive and laid out in straight avenues bordered with walls of box as impervious as if of stonenot less than twenty feet high and pierced with lofty archways cut in the living wall  some of the avenues were overshadowed with trees the tops of which bent over and joined one another from either side so as to resemble a side aisle of a gothic cathedral  marble sculptures much weatherstained and generally brokennosed stood along these stately walks there were many fountains gushing up into the sunshine we likewise found a rich flowergarden containing rare specimens of exotic flowers and gigantic cactuses and also an aviary with vultures doves and singing birds  we did not see half the garden but stiff and formal as its general arrangement is it is a beautiful placea delightful sunny and serene seclusion whatever it may be to the pope two young lovers might find the garden of eden here and never desire to stray out of its precincts  they might fancy angels standing in the long glimmering vistas of the avenues  it would suit me well enough to have my daily walk along such straight paths for i think them favorable to thought which is apt to be disturbed by variety and unexpectedness   april 12thwe all except r went today to the vatican where we found our way to the stanze of raphael these being four rooms or halls painted with frescos  no doubt they were once very brilliant and beautiful but they have encountered hard treatment since raphaels time especially when the soldiers of the constable de bourbon occupied these apartments and made fires on the mosaic floors  the entire walls and ceilings are covered with pictures but the handiwork or designs of raphael consist of paintings on the four sides of each room and include several works of art  the school of athens is perhaps the most celebrated and the longest side of the largest hall is occupied by a battlepiece of which the emperor constantine is the hero and which covers almost space enough for a real battlefield  there was a wonderful light in one of the picturesthat of st peter awakened in his prison by the angel it really seemed to throw a radiance into the hall below  i shall not pretend however to have been sensible of any particular rapture at the sight of these frescos so faded as they are so battered by the mischances of years insomuch that through all the power and glory of raphaels designs the spectator cannot but be continually sensible that the groundwork of them is an old plaster wall they have been scrubbed i supposebrushed at leasta thousand times over till the surface brilliant or soft as raphael left it must have been quite rubbed off and with it all the consummate finish and everything that made them originally delightful  the sterner features remain the skeleton of thought but not the beauty that once clothed it in truth the frescos excepting a few figures never had the real touch of raphaels own hand upon them having been merely designed by him and finished by his scholars or by other artists  the halls themselves are specimens of antique magnificence paved with elaborate mosaics and wherever there is any woodwork it is richly carved with foliage and figures  in their newness and probably for a hundred years afterwards there could not have been so brilliant a suite of rooms in the world  connected with themat any rate not far distantis the little chapel of san lorenzo the very site of which among the thousands of apartments of the vatican was long forgotten and its existence only known by tradition  after it had been walled up however beyond the memory of man there was still a rumor of some beautiful frescos by fra angelico in an old chapel of pope nicholas v that had strangely disappeared out of the palace and search at length being made it was discovered and entered through a window  it is a small lofty room quite covered over with frescos of sacred subjects both on the walls and ceiling a good deal faded yet pretty distinctly preserved  it would have been no misfortune to me if the little old chapel had remained still hidden  we next issued into the loggie which consist of a long gallery or arcade or colonnade the whole extent of which was once beautifully adorned by raphael  these pictures are almost worn away and so defaced as to be untraceable and unintelligible along the side wall of the gallery although traceries of arabesque and compartments where there seem to have been rich paintings but now only an indistinguishable waste of dull color are still to be seen  in the coved ceiling however there are still some bright frescos in better preservation than any others not particularly beautiful nevertheless  i remember to have seen indeed we ourselves possess them a series of very spirited and energetic engravings old and coarse of these frescos the subject being the creation and the early scripture history and i really think that their translation of the pictures is better than the original  on reference to murray i find that little more than the designs is attributed to raphael the execution being by giulio romano and other artists  escaping from these forlorn splendors we went into the sculpturegallery where i was able to enjoy in some small degree two or three wonderful works of art and had a perception that there were a thousand other wonders around me  it is as if the statues kept for the most part a veil about them which they sometimes withdraw and let their beauty gleam upon my sight only a glimpse or two or three glimpses or a little space of calm enjoyment and then i see nothing but a discolored marble image again  the minerva medica revealed herself today  i wonder whether other people are more fortunate than myself and can invariably find their way to the inner soul of a work of art  i doubt it they look at these things for just a minute and pass on without any pang of remorse such as i feel for quitting them so soon and so willingly  i am partly sensible that some unwritten rules of taste are making their way into my mind that all this greek beauty has done something towards refining me though i am still however a very sturdy goth       april 15thyesterday i went with j to the forum and descended into the excavations at the base of the capitol and on the site of the basilica of julia  the essential elements of old rome are there columns single or in groups of two or three still erect but battered and bruised at some forgotten time with infinite pains and labor fragments of other columns lying prostrate together with rich capitals and friezes the bust of a colossal female statue showing the bosom and upper part of the arms but headless a long winding space of pavement forming part of the ancient ascent to the capitol still as firm and solid as ever the foundation of the capitol itself wonderfully massive built of immense square blocks of stone doubtless three thousand years old and durable for whatever may be the lifetime of the world the arch of septimius severus with basreliefs of eastern wars the column of phocas with the rude series of steps ascending on four sides to its pedestal the floor of beautiful and precious marbles in the basilica of julia the slabs cracked acrossthe greater part of them torn up and removed the grass and weeds growing up through the chinks of what remain heaps of bricks shapeless bits of granite and other ancient rubbish among which old men are lazily rummaging for specimens that a stranger may be induced to buythis being an employment that suits the indolence of a modern roman  the level of these excavations is about fifteen feet i should judge below the present street which passes through the forum and only a very small part of this alien surface has been removed though there can be no doubt that it hides numerous treasures of art and monuments of history  yet these remains do not make that impression of antiquity upon me which gothic ruins do  perhaps it is so because they belong to quite another system of society and epoch of time and in view of them we forget all that has intervened betwixt them and us being morally unlike and disconnected with them and not belonging to the same train of thought so that we look across a gulf to the roman ages and do not realize how wide the gulf is  yet in that intervening valley lie christianity the dark ages the feudal system chivalry and romance and a deeper life of the human race than rome brought to the verge of the gulf  today we went to the colonna palace where we saw some fine pictures but i think no masterpieces  they did not depress and dishearten me so much as the pictures in roman palaces usually do for they were in remarkably good order as regards frames and varnish indeed i rather suspect some of them had been injured by the means adopted to preserve their beauty  the palace is now occupied by the french ambassador who probably looks upon the pictures as articles of furniture and household adornment and does not choose to have squares of black and forlorn canvas upon his walls  there were a few noble portraits by vandyke a very striking one by holbein one or two by titian also by guercino and some pictures by rubens and other forestieri painters which refreshed my weary eyes  butwhat chiefly interested me was the magnificent and stately hall of the palace fiftyfive of my paces in length besides a large apartment at either end opening into it through a pillared space as wide as the gateway of a city  the pillars are of giallo antico and there are pilasters of the same all the way up and down the walls forming a perspective of the richest aspect especially as the broad cornice flames with gilding and the spaces between the pilasters are emblazoned with heraldic achievements and emblems in gold and there are venetian lookingglasses richly decorated over the surface with beautiful pictures of flowers and cupids through which you catch the gleam of the mirror and two rows of splendid chandeliers extend from end to end of the hall which when lighted up if ever it be lighted up nowanights must be the most brilliant interior that ever mortal eye beheld  the ceiling glows with pictures in fresco representing scenes connected with the history of the colonna family and the floor is paved with beautiful marbles polished and arranged in square and circular compartments and each of the many windows is set in a great architectural frame of precious marble as large as the portal of a door the apartment at the farther end of the hall is elevated above it and is attained by several marble steps whence it must have been glorious in former days to have looked down upon a gorgeous throng of princes cardinals warriors and ladies in such rich attire as might be worn when the palace was built  it is singular how much freshness and brightness it still retains and the only objects to mar the effect were some ancient statues and busts not very good in themselves and now made dreary of aspect by their corroded surfacesthe result of long burial under ground  in the room at the entrance of the hall are two cabinets each a wonder in its wayone being adorned with precious stones the other with ivory carvings of michael angelos last judgment and of the frescos of raphaels loggie  the world has ceased to be so magnificent as it once was  men make no such marvels nowadays  the only defect that i remember in this hall was in the marble steps that ascend to the elevated apartment at the end of it a large piece had been broken out of one of them leaving a rough irregular gap in the polished marble stair  it is not easy to conceive what violence can have done this without also doing mischief to all the other splendor around it   april 16thwe went this morning to the academy of st luke the fine arts academy at rome in the via bonella close by the forum  we rang the bell at the house door and after a few moments it was unlocked or unbolted by some unseen agency from above no one making his appearance to admit us  we ascended two or three flights of stairs and entered a hall where was a young man the custode and two or three artists engaged in copying some of the pictures  the collection not being vastly large and the pictures being in more presentable condition than usual i enjoyed them more than i generally do particularly a virgin and child by vandyke where two angels are singing and playing one on a lute and the other on a violin to remind the holy infant of the strains he used to hear in heaven  it is one of the few pictures that there is really any pleasure in looking at  there were several paintings by titian mostly of a voluptuous character but not very charming also two or more by guido one of which representing fortune is celebrated  they did not impress me much nor do i find myself strongly drawn towards guido though there is no other painter who seems to achieve things so magically and inscrutably as he sometimes does  perhaps it requires a finer taste than mine to appreciate him and yet i do appreciate him so far as to see that his michael for instance is perfectly beautiful     in the gallery there are whole rows of portraits of members of the academy of st luke most of whom judging by their physiognomies were very commonplace people a fact which makes itself visible in a portrait however much the painter may try to flatter his sitter  several of the pictures by titian paul veronese and other artists now exhibited in the gallery were formerly kept in a secret cabinet in the capitol being considered of a too voluptuous character for the public eye  i did not think them noticeably indecorous as compared with a hundred other pictures that are shown and looked at without scruplecalypso and her nymphs a knot of nude women by titian is perhaps as objectionable as any  but even titians fleshtints cannot keep and have not kept their warmth through all these centuries  the illusion and lifelikeness effervesces and exhales out of a picture as it grows old and we go on talking of a charm that has forever vanished  from st lukes we went to san pietro in vincoli occupying a fine position on or near the summit of the esquiline mount  a little abortion of a man and by the by there are more diminutive and illshapen men and women in rome than i ever saw elsewhere a phenomenon to be accounted for perhaps by their custom of wrapping the newborn infant in swaddlingclothes this twofoot abortion hastened before us as we drew nigh to summon the sacristan to open the church door  it was a needless service for which we rewarded him with two baiocchi  san pietro is a simple and noble church consisting of a nave divided from the side aisles by rows of columns that once adorned some ancient temple and its wide unencumbered interior affords better breathingspace than most churches in rome  the statue of moses occupies a niche in one of the side aisles on the right not far from the high altar  i found it grand and sublime with a beard flowing down like a cataract a truly majestic figure but not so benign as it were desirable that such strength should be  the horns about which so much has been said are not a very prominent feature of the statue being merely two diminutive tips rising straight up over his forehead neither adding to the grandeur of the head nor detracting sensibly from it  the whole force of this statue is not to be felt in one brief visit but i agree with an english gentleman who with a large party entered the church while we were there in thinking that moses has very fine featuresa compliment for which the colossal hebrew ought to have made the englishman a bow  besides the moses the church contains some attractions of a pictorial kind which are reposited in the sacristy into which we passed through a side door  the most remarkable of these pictures is a face and bust of hope by guido with beautiful eyes lifted upwards it has a grace which artists are continually trying to get into their innumerable copies but always without success for indeed though nothing is more true than the existence of this charm in the picture yet if you try to analyze it or even look too intently at it it vanishes till you look again with more trusting simplicity  leaving the church we wandered to the coliseum and to the public grounds contiguous to them where a score and more of french drummers were beating each man his drum without reference to any rubadub but his own  this seems to be a daily or periodical practice and point of duty with them  after resting ourselves on one of the marble benches we came slowly home through the basilica of constantine and along the shady sides of the streets and piazzas sometimes perforce striking boldly through the white sunshine which however was not so hot as to shrivel us up bodily  it has been a most beautiful and perfect day as regards weather clear and bright very warm in the sunshine yet freshened throughout by a quiet stir in the air  still there is something in this air malevolent or at least not friendly  the romans lie down and fall asleep in it in any vacant part of the streets and wherever they can find any spot sufficiently clean and among the ruins of temples  i would not sleep in the open air for whatever my life may be worth  on our way home sitting in one of the narrow streets we saw an old woman spinning with a distaff a far more ancient implement than the spinningwheel which the housewives of other nations have long since laid aside   april 18thyesterday at noon the whole family of us set out on a visit to the villa borghese and its grounds the entrance to which is just outside of the porta del popolo  after getting within the grounds however there is a long walk before reaching the casino and we found the sun rather uncomfortably hot and the road dusty and white in the sunshine nevertheless a footpath ran alongside of it most of the way through the grass and among the young trees  it seems to me that the trees do not put forth their leaves with nearly the same magical rapidity in this southern land at the approach of summer as they do in more northerly countries  in these latter having a much shorter time to develop themselves they feel the necessity of making the most of it but the grass in the lawns and enclosures along which we passed looked already fit to be mowed and it was interspersed with many flowers  saturday being i believe the only day of the week on which visitors are admitted to the casino there were many parties in carriages artists on foot gentlemen on horseback and miscellaneous people to whom the door was opened by a custode on ringing a bell  the whole of the basement floor of the casino comprising a suite of beautiful rooms is filled with statuary  the entrance hall is a very splendid apartment brightly frescoed and paved with ancient mosaics representing the combats with beasts and gladiators in the coliseum curious though very rudely and awkwardly designed apparently after the arts had begun to decline  many of the specimens of sculpture displayed in these rooms are fine but none of them i think possess the highest merit  an apollo is beautiful a group of a fighting amazon and her enemies trampled under her horses feet is very impressive a faun copied from that of praxiteles and another who seems to be dancing were exceedingly pleasant to look at i like these strange sweet playful rustic creatures     linked so prettily without monstrosity to the lower tribes     their character has never that i know of been wrought out in literature and something quite good funny and philosophical as well as poetic might very likely be educed from them     the faun is a natural and delightful link betwixt human and brute life with something of a divine character intermingled  the gallery as it is called on the basement floor of the casino is sixty feet in length by perhaps a third as much in breadth and is after all i have seen at the colonna palace and elsewhere a more magnificent hall than i imagined to be in existence  it is floored with rich marble in beautifully arranged compartments and the walls are almost entirely eased with marble of various sorts the prevailing kind being giallo antico intermixed with verd antique and i know not what else but the splendor of the giallo antico gives the character to the room and the large and deep niches along the walls appear to be lined with the same material  without coming to italy one can have no idea of what beauty and magnificence are produced by these fittings up of polished marble  marble to an american means nothing but white limestone  this hall moreover is adorned with pillars of oriental alabaster and wherever is a space vacant of precious and richly colored marble it is frescoed with arabesque ornaments and over the whole is a coved and vaulted ceiling glowing with picture  there never can be anything richer than the whole effect  as to the sculpture here it was not very fine so far as i can remember consisting chiefly of busts of the emperors in porphyry but they served a good purpose in the upholstery way  there were also magnificent tables each composed of one great slab of porphyry and also vases of nero antico and other rarest substance it remains to be mentioned that on this almost summer day i was quite chilled in passing through these glorious halls no fireplace anywhere no possibility of comfort and in the hot season when their coolness might be agreeable it would be death to inhabit them  ascending a long winding staircase we arrived at another suite of rooms containing a good many not very remarkable pictures and a few more pieces of statuary  among the latter is canovas statue of pauline the sister of bonaparte who is represented with but little drapery and in the character of venus holding the apple in her hand  it is admirably done and i have no doubt a perfect likeness very beautiful too but it is wonderful to see how the artificial elegance of the woman of this world makes itself perceptible in spite of whatever simplicity she could find in almost utter nakedness  the statue does not afford pleasure in the contemplation  in one of these upper rooms are some works of bernini two of them aeneas and anchises and david on the point of slinging a stone at goliath have great merit and do not tear and rend themselves quite out of the laws and limits of marble like his later sculpture  here is also his apollo overtaking daphne whose feet take root whose fingertips sprout into twigs and whose tender body roughens round about with bark as he embraces her  it did not seem very wonderful to me not so good as hillards description of it made me expect and one does not enjoy these freaks in marble  we were glad to emerge from the casino into the warm sunshine and for my part i made the best of my way to a large fountain surrounded by a circular stone seat of wide sweep and sat down in a sunny segment of the circle  around grew a solemn company of old treesilexes i believe with huge contorted trunks and evergreen branches     deep groves sunny openings the airy gush of fountains marble statues dimly visible in recesses of foliage great urns and vases terminal figures temples all these works of art looking as if they had stood there long enough to feel at home and to be on friendly and familiar terms with the grass and trees  it is a most beautiful place     and the malaria is its true master and inhabitant   april 22dwe have been recently to the studio of mr brown now dead the american landscapepainter and were altogether surprised and delighted with his pictures  he is a plain homely yankee quite unpolished by his many years residence in italy he talks ungrammatically and in yankee idioms walks with a strange awkward gait and stooping shoulders is altogether unpicturesque but wins ones confidence by his very lack of grace  it is not often that we see an artist so entirely free from affectation in his aspect and deportment his pictures were views of swiss and italian scenery and were most beautiful and true  one of them a moonlight picture was really magical the moon shining so brightly that it seemed to throw a light even beyond the limits of the pictureand yet his sunrises and sunsets and noontides too were nowise inferior to this although their excellence required somewhat longer study to be fully appreciated  i seemed to receive more pleasure front mr browns pictures than from any of the landscapes by the old masters and the fact serves to strengthen me in the belief that the most delicate if not the highest charm of a picture is evanescent and that we continue to admire pictures prescriptively and by tradition after the qualities that first won them their fame have vanished  i suppose claude was a greater landscapepainter than brown but for my own pleasure i would prefer one of the latter artists picturesthose of the former being quite changed from what he intended them to be by the effect of time on his pigments mr brown showed us some drawings from nature done with incredible care and minuteness of detail as studies for his paintings  we complimented him on his patience but he said o its not patienceits love  in fact it was a patient and most successful wooing of a beloved object which at last rewarded him by yielding itself wholly  we have likewise been to mr bs now dead studio where we saw several pretty statues and busts and among them an eve with her wreath of figleaves lying across her poor nudity comely in some points but with a frightful volume of thighs and calves  i do not altogether see the necessity of ever sculpturing another nakedness  man is no longer a naked animal his clothes are as natural to him as his skin and sculptors have no more right to undress him than to flay him  also we have seen again william storys cleopatraa work of genuine thought and energy representing a terribly dangerous woman quiet enough for the moment but very likely to spring upon you like a tigress  it is delightful to escape to his creations from this universal prettiness which seems to be the highest conception of the crowd of modern sculptors and which they almost invariably attain  miss bremer called on us the other day  we find her very little changed from what she was when she came to take tea and spend an evening at our little red cottage among the berkshire hills and went away so dissatisfied with my conversational performances and so laudatory of my brow and eyes while so severely criticising my poor mouth and chin  she is the funniest little old fairy in person whom one can imagine with a huge nose to which all the rest of her is but an insufficient appendage but you feel at once that she is most gentle kind womanly sympathetic and true  she talks english fluently in a low quiet voice but with such an accent that it is impossible to understand her without the closest attention  this was the real cause of the failure of our berkshire interview for i could not guess half the time what she was saying and of course had to take an uncertain aim with my responses a more intrepid talker than myself would have shouted his ideas across the gulf but for me there must first be a close and unembarrassed contiguity with my companion or i cannot say one real word  i doubt whether i have ever really talked with half a dozen persons in my life either men or women  today my wife and i have been at the picture and sculpture galleries of the capitol  i rather enjoyed looking at several of the pictures though at this moment i particularly remember only a very beautiful face of a man one of two heads on the same canvas by vandyke  yes i did look with new admiration at paul veroneses rape of europa  it must have been in its day the most brilliant and rejoicing picture the most voluptuous the most exuberant that ever put the sunshine to shame  the bull has all jupiter in him so tender and gentle yet so passionate that you feel it indecorous to look at him and europa under her thick rich stuffs and embroideries is all a woman  what a pity that such a picture should fade and perplex the beholder with such splendor shining through such forlornness  we afterwards went into the sculpturegallery where i looked at the faun of praxiteles and was sensible of a peculiar charm in it a sylvan beauty and homeliness friendly and wild at once  the lengthened but not preposterous ears and the little tail which we infer have an exquisite effect and make the spectator smile in his very heart  this race of fauns was the most delightful of all that antiquity imagined  it seems to me that a story with all sorts of fun and pathos in it might be contrived on the idea of their species having become intermingled with the human race a family with the faun blood in them having prolonged itself from the classic era till our own days  the tail might have disappeared by dint of constant intermarriages with ordinary mortals but the pretty hairy ears should occasionally reappear in members of the family and the moral instincts and intellectual characteristics of the faun might be most picturesquely brought out without detriment to the human interest of the story  fancy this combination in the person of a young lady  i have spoken of mr gibsons colored statues  it seems at least mr nichols tells me that he stains them with tobacco juice     were he to send a cupid to america he need not trouble himself to stain it beforehand   april 25thnight before last my wife and i took a moonlight ramble through rome it being a very beautiful night warm enough for comfort and with no perceptible dew or dampness  we set out at about nine oclock and our general direction being towards the coliseum we soon came to the fountain of trevi full on the front of which the moonlight fell making berninis sculptures look stately and beautiful though the semicircular gush and fall of the cascade and the many jets of the water pouring and bubbling into the great marble basin are of far more account than neptune and his steeds and the rest of the figures      we ascended the capitoline hill and i felt a satisfaction in placing my hand on those immense blocks of stone the remains of the ancient capitol which form the foundation of the present edifice and will make a sure basis for as many edifices as posterity may choose to rear upon it till the end of the world  it is wonderful the solidity with which those old romans built one would suppose they contemplated the whole course of time as the only limit of their individual life  this is not so strange in the days of the republic when probably they believed in the permanence of their institutions but they still seemed to build for eternity in the reigns of the emperors when neither rulers nor people had any faith or moral substance or laid any earnest grasp on life  reaching the top of the capitoline hill we ascended the steps of the portal of the palace of the senator and looked down into the piazza with the equestrian statue of marcus aurelius in the centre of it  the architecture that surrounds the piazza is very ineffective and so in my opinion are all the other architectural works of michael angelo including st peters itself of which he has made as little as could possibly be made of such a vast pile of material  he balances everything in such a way that it seems but half of itself  we soon descended into the piazza and walked round and round the statue of marcus aurelius contemplating it from every point and admiring it in all     on these beautiful moonlight nights rome appears to keep awake and stirring though in a quiet and decorous way  it is in fact the pleasantest time for promenades and we both felt less wearied than by any promenade in the daytime of similar extent since our residence in rome  in future i mean to walk often after nightfall  yesterday we set out betimes and ascended the dome of st peters  the best view of the interior of the church i think is from the first gallery beneath the dome  the whole inside of the dome is set with mosaicwork the separate pieces being so far as i could see about half an inch square  emerging on the roof we had a fine view of all the surrounding rome including the mediterranean sea in the remote distance above us still rose the whole mountain of the great dome and it made an impression on me of greater height and size than i had yet been able to receive  the copper ball at the summit looked hardly bigger than a man could lift and yet a little while afterwards u j and i stood all together in that ball which could have contained a dozen more along with us  the esplanade of the roof is of course very extensive and along the front of it are ranged the statues which we see from below and which on nearer examination prove to be roughly hewn giants  there is a small house on the roof where probably the custodes of this part of the edifice reside and there is a fountain gushing abundantly into a stone trough that looked like an old sarcophagus  it is strange where the water comes from at such a height  the children tasted it and pronounced it very warm and disagreeable  after taking in the prospect on all sides we rang a bell which summoned a man who directed us towards a door in the side of the dome where a custode was waiting to admit us  hitherto the ascent had been easy along a slope without stairs up which i believe people sometimes ride on donkeys  the rest of the way we mounted steep and narrow staircases winding round within the wall or between the two walls of the dome and growing narrower and steeper till finally there is but a perpendicular iron ladder by means of which to climb into the copper ball  except through small windows and peepholes there is no external prospect of a higher point than the roof of the church  just beneath the ball there is a circular room capable of containing a large company and a door which ought to give access to a gallery on the outside but the custode informed us that this door is never opened  as i have said u j and i clambered into the copper ball which we found as hot as an oven and after putting our hands on its top and on the summit of st peters were glad to clamber down again  i have made some mistake after all in my narration  there certainly is a circular balcony at the top of the dome for i remember walking round it and looking not only across the country but downwards along the ribs of the dome to which are attached the iron contrivances for illuminating it on easter sunday      before leaving the church we went to look at the mosaic copy of the transfiguration because we were going to see the original in the vatican and wished to compare the two  going round to the entrance of the vatican we went first to the manufactory of mosaics to which we had a ticket of admission  we found it a long series of rooms in which the mosaic artists were at work chiefly in making some medallions of the heads of saints for the new church of st pauls  it was rather coarse work and it seemed to me that the mosaic copy was somewhat stiffer and more wooden than the original the bits of stone not flowing into color quite so freely as paint from a brush  there was no large picture now in process of being copied but two or three artists were employed on small and delicate subjects  one had a holy family of raphael in hand and the sibyls of guercino and domenichino were hanging on the wall apparently ready to be put into mosaic  wherever great skill and delicacy on the artists part were necessary they seemed quite adequate to the occasion but after all a mosaic of any celebrated picture is but a copy of a copy the substance employed is a stonepaste of innumerable different views and in bits of various sizes quantities of which were seen in cases along the whole series of rooms  we next ascended an amazing height of staircases and walked along i know not what extent of passages     till we reached the picturegallery of the vatican into which i had never been before  there are but three rooms all lined with red velvet on which hung about fifty pictures each one of them no doubt worthy to be considered a masterpiece  in the first room were three murillos all so beautiful that i could have spent the day happily in looking at either of them for methinks of all painters he is the tenderest and truest  i could not enjoy these pictures now however because in the next room and visible through the open door hung the transfiguration  approaching it i felt that the picture was worthy of its fame and was far better than i could at once appreciate admirably preserved too though i fully believe it must have possessed a charm when it left raphaels hand that has now vanished forever  as church furniture and an external adornment the mosaic copy is preferable to the original but no copy could ever reproduce all the life and expression which we see here  opposite to it hangs the communion of st jerome the aged dying saint half torpid with death already partaking of the sacrament and a sunny garland of cherubs in the upper part of the picture looking down upon him and quite comforting the spectator with the idea that the old man needs only to be quite dead in order to flit away with them  as for the other pictures i did but glance at and have forgotten them  the transfiguration is finished with great minuteness and detail the weeds and blades of grass in the foreground being as distinct as if they were growing in a natural soil  a partly decayed stick of wood with the bark is likewise given in close imitation of nature  the reflection of a foot of one of the apostles is seen in a pool of water at the verge of the picture  one or two heads and arms seem almost to project from the canvas  there is great lifelikeness and reality as well as higher qualities  the face of jesus being so high aloft and so small in the distance i could not well see but i am impressed with the idea that it looks too much like human flesh and blood to be in keeping with the celestial aspect of the figure or with the probabilities of the scene when the divinity and immortality of the saviour beamed from within him through the earthly features that ordinarily shaded him  as regards the composition of the picture i am not convinced of the propriety of its being in two so distinctly separate partsthe upper portion not thinking of the lower and the lower portion not being aware of the higher  it symbolizes however the spiritual shortsightedness of mankind that amid the trouble and grief of the lower picture not a single individual either of those who seek help or those who would willingly afford it lifts his eyes to that region one glimpse of which would set everything right  one or two of the disciples point upward but without really knowing what abundance of help is to be had there   april 27thtoday we have all been with mr akers to some studios of painters first to that of mr wilde an artist originally from boston his pictures are principally of scenes from venice and are miracles of color being as bright as if the light were transmitted through rubies and sapphires  and yet after contemplating them awhile we became convinced that the painter had not gone in the least beyond nature but on the contrary had fallen short of brilliancies which no palette or skill or boldness in using color could attain  i do not quite know whether it is best to attempt these things  they may be found in nature no doubt but always so tempered by what surrounds them so put out of sight even while they seem full before our eyes that we question the accuracy of a faithful reproduction of them on canvas  there was a picture of sunset the whole sky of which would have outshone any gilded frame that could have been put around it  there was a most gorgeous sketch of a handful of weeds and leaves such as may be seen strewing acres of forestground in an american autumn  i doubt whether any other man has ever ventured to paint a picture like either of these two the italian sunset or the american autumnal foliage  mr wilde who is still young talked with genuine feeling and enthusiasm of his art and is certainly a man of genius  we next went to the studio of an elderly swiss artist named mueller i believe where we looked at a great many watercolor and crayon drawings of scenes in italy greece and switzerland  the artist was a quiet respectable somewhat heavylooking old gentleman from whose aspect one would expect a plodding pertinacity of character rather than quickness of sensibility  he must have united both these qualities however to produce such pictures as these such faithful transcripts of whatever nature has most beautiful to show and which she shows only to those who love her deeply and patiently  they are wonderful pictures compressing plains seas and mountains with miles and miles of distance into the space of a foot or two without crowding anything or leaving out a feature and diffusing the free blue atmosphere throughout  the works of the english watercolor artists which i saw at the manchester exhibition seemed to me nowise equal to these  now here are three artists mr brown mr wilde and mr mueller who have smitten me with vast admiration within these few days past while i am continually turning away disappointed from the landscapes of the most famous among the old masters unable to find any charm or illusion in them  yet i suppose claude poussin and salvator rosa must have won their renown by real achievements  but the glory of a picture fades like that of a flower  contiguous to mr muellers studio was that of a young german artist not long resident in rome and mr akers proposed that we should go in there as a matter of kindness to the young man who is scarcely known at all and seldom has a visitor to look at his pictures  his studio comprised his whole establishment for there was his little bed with its white drapery in a corner of the small room and his dressingtable with its brushes and combs while the easel and the few sketches of italian scenes and figures occupied the foreground  i did not like his pictures very well but would gladly have bought them all if i could have afforded it the artist looked so cheerful patient and quiet doubtless amidst huge discouragement  he is probably stubborn of purpose and is the sort of man who will improve with every year of his life  we could not speak his language and were therefore spared the difficulty of paying him any compliments but miss shepard said a few kind words to him in german and seemed quite to win his heart insomuch that he followed her with bows and smiles a long way down the staircase  it is a terrible business this looking at pictures whether good or bad in the presence of the artists who paint them it is as great a bore as to hear a poet read his own verses  it takes away all my pleasure in seeing the pictures and even remakes me question the genuineness of the impressions which i receive from them  after this latter visit mr akers conducted us to the shop of the jeweller castellani who is a great reproducer of ornaments in the old roman and etruscan fashion  these antique styles are very fashionable just now and some of the specimens he showed us were certainly very beautiful though i doubt whether their quaintness and oldtime curiousness as patterns of gewgaws dug out of immemorial tombs be not their greatest charm  we saw the toiletcase of an etruscan ladythat is to say a modern imitation of itwith her rings for summer and winter and for every day of the week and for thumb and fingers her ivory comb her bracelets and more knickknacks than i can half remember  splendid things of our own time were likewise shown us a necklace of diamonds worth eighteen thousand scudi together with emeralds and opals and great pearls  finally we came away and my wife and miss shepard were taken up by the misses weston who drove with them to visit the villa albani  during their drive my wife happened to raise her arm and miss shepard espied a little greek cross of gold which had attached itself to the lace of her sleeve     pray heaven the jeweller may not discover his loss before we have time to restore the spoil  he is apparently so free and careless in displaying his precious waresputting inestimable genes and brooches great and small into the hands of strangers like ourselves and leaving scores of them strewn on the top of his counterthat it would seem easy enough to take a diamond or two but i suspect there must needs be a sharp eye somewhere  before we left the shop he requested me to honor him with my autograph in a large book that was full of the names of his visitors  this is probably a measure of precaution   april 30thi went yesterday to the sculpturegallery of the capitol and looked pretty thoroughly through the busts of the illustrious men and less particularly at those of the emperors and their relatives  i likewise took particular note of the faun of praxiteles because the idea keeps recurring to me of writing a little romance about it and for that reason i shall endeavor to set down a somewhat minutely itemized detail of the statue and its surroundings      we have had beautiful weather for two or three days very warm in the sun yet always freshened by the gentle life of a breeze and quite cool enough the moment you pass within the limit of the shade      in the morning there are few people there on the pincian except the gardeners lazily trimming the borders or filling their wateringpots out of the marblebrimmed basin of the fountain french soldiers in their long mixedblue surtouts and wide scarlet pantaloons chatting with here and there a nurserymaid and playing with the child in her care and perhaps a few smokers     choosing each a marble seat or wooden bench in sunshine or shade as best suits him  in the afternoon especially within an hour or two of sunset the gardens are much more populous and the seats except when the sun falls full upon them are hard to come by  ladies arrive in carriages splendidly dressed children are abundant much impeded in their frolics and rendered stiff and stately by the finery which they wear english gentlemen and americans with their wives and families the flower of the roman population too both male and female mostly dressed with great nicety but a large intermixture of artists shabbily picturesque and other persons not of the first stamp  a french band comprising a great many brass instruments by and by begins to play and what with music sunshine a delightful atmosphere flowers grass wellkept pathways bordered with boxhedges pines cypresses horsechestnuts flowering shrubs and all manner of cultivated beauty the scene is a very lively and agreeable one  the fine equipages that drive round and round through the carriagepaths are another noticeable item  the roman aristocracy are magnificent in their aspect driving abroad with beautiful horses and footmen in rich liveries sometimes as many as three behind and one sitting by the coachman   may 1stthis morning i wandered for the thousandth time through some of the narrow intricacies of rome stepping here and there into a church i do not know the name of the first one nor had it anything that in rome could be called remarkable though till i came here i was not aware that any such churches existeda marble pavement in variegated compartments a series of shrines and chapels round the whole floor each with its own adornment of sculpture and pictures its own altar with tall wax tapers before it some of which were burning a great picture over the high altar the whole interior of the church ranged round with pillars and pilasters and lined every inch of it with rich yellow marble  finally a frescoed ceiling over the nave and transepts and a dome rising high above the central part and filled with frescos brought to such perspective illusion that the edges seem to project into the air  two or three persons are kneeling at separate shrines there are several wooden confessionals placed against the walls at one of which kneels a lady confessing to a priest who sits within the tapers are lighted at the high altar and at one of the shrines an attendant is scrubbing the marble pavement with a broom and water a process i should think seldom practised in roman churches  by and by the lady finishes her confession kisses the priests hand and sits down in one of the chairs which are placed about the floor while the priest in a black robe with a short white loose jacket over his shoulders disappears by a side door out of the church  i likewise finding nothing attractive in the pictures take my departure  protestantism needs a new apostle to convert it into something positive      i now found my way to the piazza navona  it is to me the most interesting piazza in rome a large oblong space surrounded with tall shabby houses among which there are none that seem to be palaces  the sun falls broadly over the area of the piazza and shows the fountains in itone a large basin with great seamonsters probably of berninis inventions squirting very small streams of water into it another of the fountains i do not at all remember but the central one is an immense basin over which is reared an old egyptian obelisk elevated on a rock which is cleft into four arches  monstrous devices in marble i know not of what purport are clambering about the cloven rock or burrowing beneath it one and all of them are superfluous and impertinent the only essential thing being the abundant supply of water in the fountain  this whole piazza navona is usually the scene of more business than seems to be transacted anywhere else in rome in some parts of it rusty iron is offered for sale locks and keys old tools and all such rubbish in other parts vegetables comprising at this season green peas onions cauliflowers radishes artichokes and others with which i have never made acquaintance also stalls or wheelbarrows containing apples chestnuts the meats dried and taken out of the shells green almonds in their husks and squashseedssalted and dried in an ovenapparently a favorite delicacy of the romans  there are also lemons and oranges stalls of fish mostly about the size of smelts taken from the tiber cigars of various qualities the best at a baioccho and a half apiece bread in loaves or in small rings a great many of which are strung together on a long stick and thus carried round for sale  women and men sit with these things for sale or carry them about in trays or on boards on their heads crying them with shrill and hard voices  there is a shabby crowd and much babble very little picturesqueness of costume or figure however the chief exceptions being here and there an old whitebearded beggar  a few of the men have the peasant costumea short jacket and breeches of light blue cloth and white stockingsthe ugliest dress i ever saw  the women go bareheaded and seem fond of scarlet and other bright colors but are homely and clumsy in form  the piazza is dingy in its general aspect and very dirty being strewn with straw vegetabletops and the rubbish of a weeks marketing but there is more life in it than one sees elsewhere in rome  on one side of the piazza is the church of st agnes traditionally said to stand on the site of the house where that holy maiden was exposed to infamy by the roman soldiers and where her modesty and innocence were saved by miracle  i went into the church and found it very splendid with rich marble columns all as brilliant as if just built a frescoed dome above beneath a range of chapels all round the church ornamented not with pictures but basreliefs the figures of which almost step and struggle out of the marble  they did not seem very admirable as works of art none of them explaining themselves or attracting me long enough to study out their meaning but as part of the architecture of the church they had a good effect  out of the busy square two or three persons had stepped into this bright and calm seclusion to pray and be devout for a little while and between sunrise and sunset of the bustling marketday many doubtless snatch a moment to refresh their souls  in the pantheon today it was pleasant looking up to the circular opening to see the clouds flitting across it sometimes covering it quite over then permitting a glimpse of sky then showing all the circle of sunny blue  then would come the ragged edge of a cloud brightened throughout with sunshine passing and changing quicklynot that the divine smile was not always the same but continually variable through the medium of earthly influences  the great slanting beam of sunshine was visible all the way down to the pavement falling upon motes of dust or a thin smoke of incense imperceptible in the shadow  insects were playing to and fro in the beam high up toward the opening  there is a wonderful charm in the naturalness of all this and one might fancy a swarm of cherubs coming down through the opening and sporting in the broad ray to gladden the faith of worshippers on the pavement beneath or angels bearing prayers upward or bringing down responses to them visible with dim brightness as they pass through the pathway of heavens radiance even the many hues of their wings discernible by a trusting eye though as they pass into the shadow they vanish like the motes so the sunbeam would represent those rays of divine intelligence which enable us to see wonders and to know that they are natural things  consider the effect of light and shade in a church where the windows are open and darkened with curtains that are occasionally lifted by a breeze letting in the sunshine which whitens a carved tombstone on the pavement of the church disclosing perhaps the letters of the name and inscription a deathshead a crosier or other emblem then the curtain falls and the bright spot vanishes   may 8ththis morning my wife and i went to breakfast with mrs william story at the barberini palace expecting to meet mrs jameson who has been in rome for a month or two  we had a very pleasant breakfast but mrs jameson was not present on account of indisposition and the only other guests were mrs a and mrs h two sensible american ladies  mrs story however received a note from mrs jameson asking her to bring us to see her at her lodgings so in the course of the afternoon she called on us and took us thither in her carriage  mrs jameson lives on the first piano of an old palazzo on the via di ripetta nearly opposite the ferryway across the tiber and affording a pleasant view of the yellow river and the green bank and fields on the other side i had expected to see an elderly lady but not quite so venerable a one as mrs jameson proved to be a rather short round and massive personage of benign and agreeable aspect with a sort of black skullcap on her head beneath which appeared her hair which seemed once to have been fair and was now almost white  i should take her to be about seventy years old  she began to talk to us with affectionate familiarity and was particularly kind in her manifestations towards myself who on my part was equally gracious towards her  in truth i have found great pleasure and profit in her works and was glad to hear her say that she liked mine  we talked about art and she showed us a picture leaning up against the wall of the room a quaint old byzantine painting with a gilded background and two stiff figures our saviour and st catherine standing shyly at a sacred distance from one another and going through the marriage ceremony  there was a great deal of expression in their faces and figures and the spectator feels moreover that the artist must have been a devout manan impression which we seldom receive from modern pictures however awfully holy the subject or however consecrated the place they hang in  mrs jameson seems to be familiar with italy its people and life as well as with its picturegalleries  she is said to be rather irascible in her temper but nothing could be sweeter than her voice her look and all her manifestations today  when we were coming away she clasped my hand in both of hers and again expressed the pleasure of having seen me and her gratitude to me for calling on her nor did i refrain from responding amen to these effusions      taking leave of mrs jameson we drove through the city and out of the lateran gate first however waiting a long while at monaldinis bookstore in the piazza de spagna for mr story whom we finally took up in the street after losing nearly an hour  just two miles beyond the gate is a space on the green campagna where for some time past excavations have been in progress which thus far have resulted in the discovery of several tombs and the old buried and almost forgotten church or basilica of san stefano  it is a beautiful spot that of the excavations with the alban hills in the distance and some heavy sunlighted clouds hanging above or recumbent at length upon them and behind the city and its mighty dome  the excavations are an object of great interest both to the romans and to strangers and there were many carriages and a great many visitors viewing the progress of the works which are carried forward with greater energy than anything else i have seen attempted at rome  a short time ago the ground in the vicinity was a green surface level except here and there a little hillock or scarcely perceptible swell the tomb of cecilia metella showing itself a mile or two distant and other rugged ruins of great tombs rising on the plain  now the whole site of the basilica is uncovered and they have dug into the depths of several tombs bringing to light precious marbles pillars a statue and elaborately wrought sarcophagi and if they were to dig into almost every other inequality that frets the surface of the campagna i suppose the result might be the same  you cannot dig six feet downward anywhere into the soil deep enough to hollow out a grave without finding some precious relic of the past only they lose somewhat of their value when you think that you can almost spurn them out of the ground with your foot  it is a very wonderful arrangement of providence that these things should have been preserved for a long series of coming generations by that accumulation of dust and soil and grass and trees and houses over them which will keep them safe and cause their reappearance above ground to be gradual so that the rest of the worlds lifetime may have for one of its enjoyments the uncovering of old rome  the tombs were accessible by long flights of steps going steeply downward and they were thronged with so many visitors that we had to wait some little time for our own turn  in the first into which we descended we found two tombs side by side with only a partition wall between the outer tomb being as is supposed a burialplace constructed by the early christians while the adjoined and minor one was a work of pagan rome about the second century after christ  the former was much less interesting than the latter  it contained some large sarcophagi with sculpture upon them of rather heathenish aspect and in the centre of the front of each sarcophagus was a bust in basrelief the features of which had never been wrought but were left almost blank with only the faintest indications of a nose for instance  it is supposed that sarcophagi were kept on hand by the sculptors and were bought ready made and that it was customary to work out the portrait of the deceased upon the blank face in the centre but when there was a necessity for sudden burial as may have been the case in the present instance this was dispensed with  the inner tomb was found without any earth in it just as it had been left when the last old roman was buried there and it being only a week or two since it was opened there was very little intervention of persons though much of time between the departure of the friends of the dead and our own visit  it is a square room with a mosaic pavement and is six or seven paces in length and breadth and as much in height to the vaulted roof  the roof and upper walls are beautifully ornamented with frescos which were very bright when first discovered but have rapidly faded since the admission of the air though the graceful and joyous designs flowers and fruits and trees are still perfectly discernible the room must have been anything but sad and funereal on the contrary as cheerful a saloon and as brilliant if lighted up as one could desire to feast in  it contained several marble sarcophagi covering indeed almost the whole floor and each of them as much as three or four feet in length and two much longer  the longer ones i did not particularly examine and they seemed comparatively plainer but the smaller sarcophagi were covered with the most delicately wrought and beautiful basreliefs that i ever beheld a throng of glad and lovely shapes in marble clustering thickly and chasing one another round the sides of these old stone coffins  the work was as perfect as when the sculptor gave it his last touch and if he had wrought it to be placed in a frequented hall to be seen and admired by continual crowds as long as the marble should endure he could not have chiselled with better skill and care though his work was to be shut up in the depths of a tomb forever  this seems to me the strangest thing in the world the most alien from modern sympathies  if they had built their tombs above ground one could understand the arrangement better but no sooner had they adorned them so richly and furnished them with such exquisite productions of art than they annihilated them with darkness  it was an attempt no doubt to render the physical aspect of death cheerful but there was no good sense in it  we went down also into another tomb close by the walls of which were ornamented with medallions in stucco  these works presented a numerous series of graceful designs wrought by the hand in the short space of mr story said it could not have been more than five or ten minutes while the wet plaster remained capable of being moulded and it was marvellous to think of the fertility of the artists fancy and the rapidity and accuracy with which he must have given substantial existence to his ideas  these tooall of them such adornments as would have suited a festal hallwere made to be buried forthwith in eternal darkness  i saw and handled in this tomb a great thighbone and measured it with my own it was one of many such relics of the guests who were laid to sleep in these rich chambers  the sarcophagi that served them for coffins could not now be put to a more appropriate use than as winecoolers in a modern diningroom and it would heighten the enjoyment of a festival to look at them  we would gladly have stayed much longer but it was drawing towards sunset and the evening though bright was unusually cool so we drove home and on the way mr story told us of the horrible practices of the modern romans with their deadhow they place them in the church where at midnight they are stripped of their last rag of funeral attire put into the rudest wooden coffins and thrown into a trencha halfmile for instance of promiscuous corpses  this is the fate of all except those whose friends choose to pay an exorbitant sum to have them buried under the pavement of a church  the italians have an excessive dread of corpses and never meddle with those of their nearest and dearest relatives  they have a horror of death too especially of sudden death and most particularly of apoplexy and no wonder as it gives no time for the last rites of the church and so exposes them to a fearful risk of perdition forever  on the whole the ancient practice was perhaps the preferable one but nature has made it very difficult for us to do anything pleasant and satisfactory with a dead body  god knows best but i wish he had so ordered it that our mortal bodies when we have done with them might vanish out of sight and sense like bubbles  a person of delicacy hates to think of leaving such a burden as his decaying mortality to the disposal of his friends but i say again how delightful it would be and how helpful towards our faith in a blessed futurity if the dying could disappear like vanishing bubbles leaving perhaps a sweet fragrance diffused for a minute or two throughout the deathchamber  this would be the odor of sanctity  and if sometimes the evaporation of a sinful soul should leave an odor not so delightful a breeze through the open windows would soon waft it quite away  apropos of the various methods of disposing of dead bodies william story recalled a newspaper paragraph respecting a ring with a stone of a new species in it which a widower was observed to wear upon his finger being questioned as to what the gem was he answered it is my wife he had procured her body to be chemically resolved into this stone  i think i could make a story on this idea the ring should be one of the widowers bridal gifts to a second wife and of course it should have wondrous and terrible qualities symbolizing all that disturbs the quiet of a second marriageon the husbands part remorse for his inconstancy and the constant comparison between the dead wife of his youth now idealized and the grosser reality which he had now adopted into her place while on the new wifes finger it should give pressures shooting pangs into her heart jealousies of the past and all such miserable emotions  by the by the tombs which we looked at and entered may have been originally above ground like that of cecilia metella and a hundred others along the appian way though even in this case the beautiful chambers must have been shut up in darkness  had there been windows letting in the light upon the rich frescos and exquisite sculptures there would have been a satisfaction in thinking of the existence of so much visual beauty though no eye had the privilege to see it  but darkness to objects of sight is annihilation as long as the darkness lasts   may 9thmrs jameson called this forenoon to ask us to go and see her this evening     so that i had to receive her alone devolving part of the burden on miss shepard and the three children all of whom i introduced to her notice  finding that i had not been farther beyond the walls of rome than the tomb of cecilia metella she invited me to take a drive of a few miles with her this afternoon     the poor lady seems to be very lame and i am sure i was grateful to her for having taken the trouble to climb up the seventy steps of our staircase and felt pain at seeing her go down them again  it looks fearfully like the gout the affection being apparently in one foot  the hands by the way are white and must once have been perhaps now are beautiful  she must have been a perfectly pretty woman in her daya blue or gray eyed fairhaired beauty  i think that her hair is not white but only flaxen in the extreme  at half past four according to appointment i arrived at her lodgings and had not long to wait before her little onehorse carriage drove up to the door and we set out rumbling along the via scrofa and through the densest part of the city past the theatre of marcellus and thence along beneath the palatine hill and by the baths of caracalla through the gate of san sebastiano  after emerging from the gate we soon came to the little church of domine quo vadis  standing on the spot where st peter is said to have seen a vision of our saviour bearing his cross mrs jameson proposed to alight and going in we saw a cast from michael angelos statue of the saviour and not far from the threshold of the church yet perhaps in the centre of the edifice which is extremely small a circular stone is placed a little raised above the pavement and surrounded by a low wooden railing  pointing to this stone mrs jameson showed me the prints of two feet side by side impressed into its surface as if a person had stopped short while pursuing his way to rome these she informed me were supposed to be the miraculous prints of the saviours feet but on looking into murray i am mortified to find that they are merely facsimiles of the original impressions which are treasured up among the relics of the neighboring basilica of san sebastiano  the marks of sculpture seemed to me indeed very evident in these prints nor did they indicate such beautiful feet as should have belonged to the hearer of the best of glad tidings  hence we drove on a little way farther and came to the basilica of san sebastiano where also we alighted and leaning on my arm mrs jameson went in  it is a stately and noble interior with a spacious unencumbered nave and a flat ceiling frescoed and gilded  in a chapel at the left of the entrance is the tomb of st sebastiana sarcophagus containing his remains raised on high before the altar and beneath it a recumbent statue of the saint pierced with gilded arrows  the sculpture is of the school of berninidone after the design of bernini himself mrs jameson said and is more agreeable and in better taste than most of his works  we walked round the basilica glancing at the pictures in the various chapels none of which seemed to be of remarkable merit although mrs jameson pronounced rather a favorable verdict on one of st francis she says that she can read a picture like the page of a book in fact without perhaps assuming more taste and judgment than really belong to her it was impossible not to perceive that she gave her companion no credit for knowing one single simplest thing about art  nor on the whole do i think she underrated me the only mystery is how she came to be so well aware of my ignorance on artistical points  in the basilica the franciscan monks were arranging benches on the floor of the nave and some peasant children and grown people besides were assembling probably to undergo an examination in the catechism and we hastened to depart lest our presence should interfere with their arrangements  at the door a monk met us and asked for a contribution in aid of his church or some other religious purpose  boys as we drove on ran stoutly along by the side of the chaise begging as often as they could find breath but were constrained finally to give up the pursuit the great ragged bulks of the tombs along the appian way now hove in sight one with a farmhouse on its summit and all of them preposterously huge and massive  at a distance across the green campagna on our left the claudian aqueduct strode away over miles of space and doubtless reached even to that circumference of blue hills which stand afar off girdling rome about  the tomb of cecilia metella came in sight a long while before we reached it with the warm buff hue of its travertine and the gray battlemented wall which the caetanis erected on the top of its circular summit six hundred years ago  after passing it we saw an interminable line of tombs on both sides of the way each of which might for aught i know have been as massive as that of cecilia metella and some perhaps still more monstrously gigantic though now dilapidated and much reduced in size  mrs jameson had an engagement to dinner at half past six so that we could go but a little farther along this most interesting road the borders of which are strewn with broken marbles fragments of capitals and nameless rubbish that once was beautiful  methinks the appian way should be the only entrance to romethrough an avenue of tombs  the day had been cloudy chill and windy but was now grown calmer and more genial and brightened by a very pleasant sunshine though great dark clouds were still lumbering up the sky  we drove homeward looking at the distant dome of st peters and talking of many thingspainting sculpture america england spiritualism and whatever else came up she is a very sensible old lady and sees a great deal of truth a good woman too taking elevated views of matters but i doubt whether she has the highest and finest perceptions in the world  at any rate she pronounced a good judgment on the american sculptors now in rome condemning them in the mass as men with no high aims no worthy conception of the purposes of their art and desecrating marble by the things they wrought in it  william story i presume is not to be included in this censure as she had spoken highly of his sculpturesque faculty in our previous conversation  on my part i suggested that the english sculptors were little or nothing better than our own to which she acceded generally but said that gibson had produced works equal to the antiquewhich i did not dispute but still questioned whether the world needed gibson or was any the better for him  we had a great dispute about the propriety of adopting the costume of the day in modern sculpture and i contended that either the art ought to be given up which possibly would be the best course or else should be used for idealizing the man of the day to himself and that as nature makes us sensible of the fact when men and women are graceful beautiful and noble through whatever costume they wear so it ought to be the test of the sculptors genius that he should do the same  mrs jameson decidedly objected to buttons breeches and all other items of modern costume and indeed they do degrade the marble and make high sculpture utterly impossible  then let the art perish as one that the world has done with as it has done with many other beautiful things that belonged to an earlier time  it was long past the hour of mrs jamesons dinner engagement when we drove up to her door in the via ripetta  i bade her farewell with much goodfeeling on my own side and i hope on hers excusing myself however from keeping the previous engagement to spend the evening with her for in point of fact we had mutually had enough of one another for the time being  i am glad to record that she expressed a very favorable opinion of our friend mr thompsons pictures   may 12thtoday we have been to the villa albani to which we had a ticket of admission through the agency of mr cass the american minister  we set out between ten and eleven oclock and walked through the via felice the piazza barberini and a long heavy dusty range of streets beyond to the porta salara whence the road extends white and sunny between two high blank walls to the gate of the villa which is at no great distance  we were admitted by a girl and went first to the casino along an aisle of overshadowing trees the branches of which met above our heads  in the portico of the casino which extends along its whole front there are many busts and statues and among them one of julius caesar representing him at an earlier period of life than others which i have seen  his aspect is not particularly impressive there is a lack of chin though not so much as in the older statues and busts within the edifice there is a large hall not so brilliant perhaps with frescos and gilding as those at the villa borghese but lined with the most beautiful variety of marbles  but in fact each new splendor of this sort outshines the last and unless we could pass from one to another all in the same suite we cannot remember them well enough to compare the borghese with the albani the effect being more on the fancy than on the intellect  i do not recall any of the sculpture except a colossal basrelief of antinous crowned with flowers and holding flowers in his hand which was found in the ruins of hadrians villa this is said to be the finest relic of antiquity next to the apollo and the laocoon but i could not feel it to be so partly i suppose because the features of autinous do not seem to me beautiful in themselves and that heavy downward look is repeated till i am more weary of it than of anything else in sculpture  we went up stairs and down stairs and saw a good many beautiful things but none perhaps of the very best and beautifullest and secondrate statues with the corroded surface of old marble that has been dozens of centuries under the ground depress the spirits of the beholder  the basrelief of antinous has at least the merit of being almost as white and fresh and quite as smooth as if it had never been buried and dug up again  the real treasures of this villa to the number of nearly three hundred were removed to paris by napoleon and except the antinous not one of them ever came back  there are some pictures in one or two of the rooms and among them i recollect one by perugino in which is a st michael very devout and very beautiful indeed the whole picture which is in compartments representing the three principal points of the saviours history impresses the beholder as being painted devoutly and earnestly by a religious man  in one of the rooms there is a small bronze apollo supposed by winckelmann to be an original of praxiteles but i could not make myself in the least sensible of its merit  the rest of the things in the casino i shall pass over as also those in the coffeehousean edifice which stands a hundred yards or more from the casino with an ornamental garden laid out in walks and flowerplats between  the coffeehouse has a semicircular sweep of porch with a good many statues and busts beneath it chiefly of distinguished romans  in this building as in the casino there are curious mosaics large vases of rare marble and many other things worth long pauses of admiration but i think that we were all happier when we had done with the works of art and were at leisure to ramble about the grounds  the villa albani itself is an edifice separate from both the coffeehouse and casino and is not opened to strangers  it rises palacelike in the midst of the garden and it is to be hoped has some possibility of comfort amidst its splendorscomfort however would be thrown away upon it for besides that the site shares the curse that has fallen upon every pleasant place in the vicinity of rome     it really has no occupant except the servants who take care of it  the count of castelbarco its present proprietor resides at milan  the grounds are laid out in the old fashion of straight paths with borders of box which form hedges of great height and density and as even as a brick wall at the top and sides  there are also alleys forming long vistas between the trunks and beneath the boughs of oaks ilexes and olives and there are shrubberies and tangled wildernesses of palm cactus rhododendron and i know not what and a profusion of roses that bloom and wither with nobody to pluck and few to look at them  they climb about the sculpture of fountains rear themselves against pillars and porticos run brimming over the walls and strew the path with their falling leaves  we stole a few and feel that we have wronged our consciences in not stealing more  in one part of the grounds we saw a field actually ablaze with scarlet poppies there are great lagunas fountains presided over by naiads who squirt their little jets into basins sunny lawns a temple so artificially ruined that we half believed it a veritable antique and at its base a reservoir of water in which stone swans seemed positively to float groves of cypress balustrades and broad flights of stone stairs descending to lower levels of the garden beauty peace sunshine and antique repose on every side and far in the distance the blue hills that encircle the campagna of rome  the day was very fine for our purpose cheerful but not too bright and tempered by a breeze that seemed even a little too cool when we sat long in the shade  we enjoyed it till three oclock      at the capitol there is a sarcophagus with a most beautiful basrelief of the discovery of achilles by ulysses in which there is even an expression of mirth on the faces of many of the spectators  and today at the albani a sarcophagus was ornamented with the nuptials of peleus and thetis  death strides behind every man to be sure at more or less distance and sooner or later enters upon any event of his life so that in this point of view they might each and all serve for basreliefs on a sarcophagus but the romans seem to have treated death as lightly and playfully as they could and tried to cover his dart with flowers because they hated it so much   may 15thmy wife and i went yesterday to the sistine chapel it being my first visit  it is a room of noble proportions lofty and long though divided in the midst by a screen or partition of white marble which rises high enough to break the effect of spacious unity  there are six arched windows on each side of the chapel throwing down their light from the height of the walls with as much as twenty feet of space more i should think between them and the floor  the entire walls and ceiling of this stately chapel are covered with paintings in fresco except the space about ten feet in height from the floor and that portion was intended to be adorned by tapestries from pictures by raphael but the design being prevented by his premature death the projected tapestries have no better substitute than paperhangings  the roof which is flat at top and coved or vaulted at the sides is painted in compartments by michael angelo with frescos representing the whole progress of the world and of mankind from its first formation by the almighty     till after the flood  on one of the sides of the chapel are pictures by perugino and other old masters of subsequent events in sacred history and the entire wall behind the altar a vast expanse from the ceiling to the floor is taken up with michael angelos summing up of the worlds history and destinies in his last judgment  there can be no doubt that while these frescos continued in their perfection there was nothing else to be compared with the magnificent and solemn beauty of this chapel  enough of ruined splendor still remains to convince the spectator of all that has departed but methinks i have seen hardly anything else so forlorn and depressing as it is now all dusky and dim even the very lights having passed into shadows and the shadows into utter blackness so that it needs a sunshiny day under the bright italian heavens to make the designs perceptible at all  as we sat in the chapel there were clouds flitting across the sky when the clouds came the pictures vanished when the sunshine broke forth the figures sadly glimmered into something like visibilitythe almighty moving in chaosthe noble shape of adam the beautiful eve and beneath where the roof curves the mighty figures of sibyls and prophets looking as if they were necessarily so gigantic because the thought within them was so massive  in the last judgment the scene of the greater part of the picture lies in the upper sky the blue of which glows through betwixt the groups of naked figures and above sits jesus not looking in the least like the saviour of the world but with uplifted arm denouncing eternal misery on those whom he came to save  i fear i am myself among the wicked for i found myself inevitably taking their part and asking for at least a little pity some few regrets and not such a stern denunciatory spirit on the part of him who had thought us worth dying for  around him stand grim saints and far beneath people are getting up sleepily out of their graves not well knowing what is about to happen many of them however finding themselves clutched by demons before they are half awake  it would be a very terrible picture to one who should really see jesus the saviour in that inexorable judge but it seems to me very undesirable that he should ever be represented in that aspect when it is so essential to our religion to believe him infinitely kinder and better towards us than we deserve  at the last dayi presume that is in all future days when we see ourselves as we aremans only inexorable judge will be himself and the punishment of his sins will be the perception of them  in the lower corner of this great picture at the right hand of the spectator is a hideous figure of a damned person girdled about with a serpent the folds of which are carefully knotted between his thighs so as at all events to give no offence to decency  this figure represents a man who suggested to pope paul iii that the nudities of the last judgment ought to be draped for which offence michael angelo at once consigned him to hell  it shows what a debtors prison and dungeon of private torment men would make of hell if they had the control of it  as to the nudities if they were ever more nude than now i should suppose in their fresh brilliancy they might well have startled a not very squeamish eye  the effect such as it is of this picture is much injured by the high altar and its canopy which stands close against the wall and intercepts a considerable portion of the sprawl of nakedness with which michael angelo has filled his sky  however i am not unwilling to believe with faith beyond what i can actually see that the greatest pictorial miracles ever yet achieved have been wrought upon the walls and ceiling of the sistine chapel  in the afternoon i went with mr thompson to see what bargain could be made with vetturinos for taking myself and family to florence  we talked with three or four and found them asking prices of various enormity from a hundred and fifty scudi down to little more than ninety but mr thompson says that they always begin in this way and will probably come down to somewhere about seventyfive  mr thompson took me into the via portoghese and showed me an old palace above which rosenot a very customary feature of the architecture of romea tall battlemented tower  at one angle of the tower we saw a shrine of the virgin with a lamp and all the appendages of those numerous shrines which we see at the streetcorners and in hundreds of places about the city  three or four centuries ago this palace was inhabited by a nobleman who had an only son and a large pet monkey and one day the monkey caught the infant up and clambered to this lofty turret and sat there with him in his arms grinning and chattering like the devil himself  the father was in despair but was afraid to pursue the monkey lest he should fling down the child from the height of the tower and make his escape  at last he vowed that if the boy were safely restored to him he would build a shrine at the summit of the tower and cause it to be kept as a sacred place forever  by and by the monkey came down and deposited the child on the ground the father fulfilled his vow built the shrine and made it obligatory on all future possessors of the palace to keep the lamp burning before it  centuries have passed the property has changed hands but still there is the shrine on the giddy top of the tower far aloft over the street on the very spot where the monkey sat and there burns the lamp in memory of the fathers vow  this being the tenure by which the estate is held the extinguishment of that flame might yet turn the present owner out of the palace  may 21stmamma and i went yesterday forenoon to the spada palace which we found among the intricacies of central rome a dark and massive old edifice built around a court the fronts giving on which are adorned with statues in niches and sculptured ornaments  a woman led us up a staircase and ushered us into a great gloomy hall square and lofty and wearing a very gray and ancient aspect its walls being painted in chiaroscuro apparently a great many years ago  the hall was lighted by small windows high upward from the floors and admitting only a dusky light  the only furniture or ornament so far as i recollect was the colossal statue of pompey which stands on its pedestal at one side certainly the sternest and severest of figures and producing the most awful impression on the spectator  much of the effect no doubt is due to the sombre obscurity of the hall and to the loneliness in which the great naked statue stands  it is entirely nude except for a cloak that hangs down from the left shoulder in the left hand it holds a globe the right arm is extended  the whole expression is such as the statue might have assumed if during the tumult of caesars murder it had stretched forth its marble hand and motioned the conspirators to give over the attack or to be quiet now that their victim had fallen at its feet  on the left leg about midway above the ankle there is a dull red stain said to be caesars blood but of course it is just such a red stain in the marble as may be seen on the statue of antinous at the capitol  i could not see any resemblance in the face of the statue to that of the bust of pompey shown as such at the capitol in which there is not the slightest moral dignity or sign of intellectual eminence  i am glad to have seen this statue and glad to remember it in that gray dim lofty hall glad that there were no bright frescos on the walls and that the ceiling was wrought with massive beams and the floor paved with ancient brick  from this anteroom we passed through several saloons containing pictures some of which were by eminent artists the judith of guido a copy of which used to weary me to death year after year in the boston athenaeum and many portraits of cardinals in the spada family and other pictures by guido  there were some portraits also of the family by titian some good pictures by guercino and many which i should have been glad to examine more at leisure but by and by the custode made his appearance and began to close the shutters under pretence that the sunshine would injure the paintingsan effect i presume not very likely to follow after two or three centuries exposure to light air and whatever else might hurt them  however the pictures seemed to be in much better condition and more enjoyable so far as they had merit than those in most roman picturegalleries although the spada palace itself has a decayed and impoverished aspect as if the family had dwindled from its former state and grandeur and now perhaps smuggled itself into some outoftheway corner of the old edifice  if such be the case there is something touching in their still keeping possession of pompeys statue which makes their house famous and the sale of which might give them the means of building it up anew for surely it is worth the whole sculpturegallery of the vatican  in the afternoon mr thompson and i went for the third or fourth time to negotiate with vetturinos     so far as i know them they are a very tricky set of people bent on getting as much as they can by hook or by crook out of the unfortunate individual who falls into their hands  they begin as i have said by asking about twice as much as they ought to receive and anything between this exorbitant amount and the just price is what they thank heaven for as so much clear gain nevertheless i am not quite sure that the italians are worse than other people even in this matter  in other countries it is the custom of persons in trade to take as much as they can get from the public fleecing one man to exactly the same extent as another here they take what they can obtain from the individual customer  in fact roman tradesmen do not pretend to deny that they ask and receive different prices from different people taxing them according to their supposed means of payment the article supplied being the same in one case as in another  a shopkeeper looked into his books to see if we were of the class who paid two pauls or only a paul and a half for candles a charcoaldealer said that seventy baiocchi was a very reasonable sum for us to pay for charcoal and that some persons paid eighty and mr thompson recognizing the rule told the old vetturino that a hundred and fifty scudi was a very proper charge for carrying a prince to florence but not for carrying me who was merely a very good artist the result is well enough the rich man lives expensively and pays a larger share of the profits which people of a different system of trademorality would take equally from the poor man  the effect on the conscience of the vetturino however and of tradesmen of all kinds cannot be good their only intent being not to do justice between man and man but to go as deep as they can into all pockets and to the very bottom of some  we had nearly concluded a bargain a day or two ago with a vetturino to take or send us to florence via perugia in eight days for a hundred scudi but he now drew back under pretence of having misunderstood the terms though in reality no doubt he was in hopes of getting a better bargain from somebody else  we made an agreement with another man whom mr thompson knows and highly recommends and immediately made it sure and legally binding by exchanging a formal written contract in which everything is set down even to milk butter bread eggs and coffee which we are to have for breakfast the vetturino being to pay every expense for himself his horses and his passengers and include it within ninetyfive scudi and five crowns in addition for buonmano        may 22dyesterday while we were at dinner mr  called  i never saw him but once before and that was at the door of our little red cottage in lenox he sitting in a wagon with one or two of the sedgewicks merely exchanging a greeting with me from under the brim of his straw hat and driving on  he presented himself now with a long white beard such as a palmer might have worn as the growth of his long pilgrimages a brow almost entirely bald and what hair he has quite hoary a forehead impending yet not massive dark bushy eyebrows and keen eyes without much softness in them a dark and sallow complexion a slender figure bent a little with age but at once alert and infirm  it surprised me to see him so venerable for as poets are apollos kinsmen we are inclined to attribute to them his enviable quality of never growing old  there was a weary look in his face as if he were tired of seeing things and doing things though with certainly enough still to see and do if need were  my family gathered about him and he conversed with great readiness and simplicity about his travels and whatever other subject came up telling us that he had been abroad five times and was now getting a little homesick and had no more eagerness for sights though his gals as he called his daughter and another young lady dragged him out to see the wonders of rome again  his manners and whole aspect are very particularly plain though not affectedly so but it seems as if in the decline of life and the security of his position he had put off whatever artificial polish he may have heretofore had and resumed the simpler habits and deportment of his early new england breeding  not but what you discover nevertheless that he is a man of refinement who has seen the world and is well aware of his own place in it  he spoke with great pleasure of his recent visit to spain  i introduced the subject of kansas and methought his face forthwith assumed something of the bitter keenness of the editor of a political newspaper while speaking of the triumph of the administration over the freesoil opposition  i inquired whether he had seen s and he gave a very sad account of him as he appeared at their last meeting which was in paris  s he thought had suffered terribly and would never again be the man he was he was getting fat he talked continually of himself and of trifles concerning himself and seemed to have no interest for other matters and mr  feared that the shock upon his nerves had extended to his intellect and was irremediable  he said that s ought to retire from public life but had no friend true enough to tell him so  this is about as sad as anything can be  i hate to have s undergo the fate of a martyr because he was not naturally of the stuff that martyrs are made of and it is altogether by mistake that he has thrust himself into the position of one  he was merely though with excellent abilities one of the best of fellows and ought to have lived and died in good fellowship with all the world  s was not in the least degree excited about this or any other subject  he uttered neither passion nor poetry but excellent good sense and accurate information on whatever subject transpired a very pleasant man to associate with but rather cold i should imagine if one should seek to touch his heart with ones own  he shook hands kindly all round but not with any warmth of gripe although the ease of his deportment had put us all on sociable terms with him  at seven oclock we went by invitation to take tea with miss bremer after much search and lumbering painfully up two or three staircases in vain and at last going about in a strange circuity we found her in a small chamber of a large old building situated a little way from the brow of the tarpeian rock  it was the tiniest and humblest domicile that i have seen in rome just large enough to hold her narrow bed her teatable and a table covered with booksphotographs of roman ruins and some pages written by herself  i wonder whether she be poor probably so for she told us that her expense of living here is only five pauls a day  she welcomed us however with the greatest cordiality and ladylike simplicity making no allusion to the humbleness of her environment and making us also lose sight of it by the absence of all apology any more than if she were receiving us in a palace  there is not a better bred woman and yet one does not think whether she has any breeding or no  her little bit of a round table was already spread for us with her blue earthenware teacups and after she had got through an interview with the swedish minister and dismissed him with a hearty pressure of his hand between both her own she gave us our tea and some bread and a mouthful of cake  meanwhile as the day declined there had been the most beautiful view over the campagna out of one of her windows and from the other looking towards st peters the broad gleam of a mildly glorious sunset not so pompous and magnificent as many that i have seen in america but softer and sweeter in all its changes as its lovely hues died slowly away the halfmoon shone out brighter and brighter for there was not a cloud in the sky and it seemed like the moonlight of my younger days  in the garden beneath her window verging upon the tarpeian rock there was shrubbery and one large tree softening the brow of the famous precipice adown which the old romans used to fling their traitors or sometimes indeed their patriots  miss bremer talked plentifully in her strange mannergood english enough for a foreigner but so oddly intonated and accented that it is impossible to be sure of more than one word in ten  being so little comprehensible it is very singular how she contrives to make her auditors so perfectly certain as they are that she is talking the best sense and in the kindliest spirit  there is no better heart than hers and not many sounder heads and a little touch of sentiment comes delightfully in mixed up with a quick and delicate humor and the most perfect simplicity  there is also a very pleasant atmosphere of maidenhood about her we are sensible of a freshness and odor of the morning still in this little withered roseits recompense for never having been gathered and worn but only diffusing fragrance on its stem i forget mainly what we talked abouta good deal about art of course although that is a subject of which miss bremer evidently knows nothing once we spoke of fleasinsects that in rome come home to everybodys business and bosom and are so common and inevitable that no delicacy is felt about alluding to the sufferings they inflict  poor little miss bremer was tormented with one while turning out our tea     she talked among other things of the winters in sweden and said that she liked them long and severe as they are and this made me feel ashamed of dreading the winters of new england as i did before coming from home and do now still more after five or six mild english decembers  by and by two young ladies came inmiss bremens neighbors it seemedfresh from a long walk on the campagna fresh and weary at the same time  one apparently was german and the other french and they brought her an offering of flowers and chattered to her with affectionate vivacity and as we were about taking leave miss bremer asked them to accompany her and us on a visit to the edge of the tarpeian rock  before we left the room she took a bunch of roses that were in a vase and gave them to miss shepard who told her that she should make her six sisters happy by giving one to each  then we went down the intricate stairs and emerging into the garden walked round the brow of the hill which plunges headlong with exceeding abruptness but so far as i could see in the moonlight is no longer quite a precipice  then we reentered the house and went up stairs and down again through intricate passages till we got into the street which was still peopled with the ragamuffins who infest and burrow in that part of rome  we returned through an archway and descended the broad flight of steps into the piazza of the capitol and from the extremity of it just at the head of the long graded way where castor and pollux and the old milestones stand we turned to the left and followed a somewhat winding path till we came into the court of a palace  this court is bordered by a parapet leaning over which we saw the sheer precipice of the tarpeian rock about the height of a fourstory house      on the edge of this before we left the court miss bremer bade us farewell kissing my wife most affectionately on each cheek     and then turning towards myself     she pressed my hand and we parted probably never to meet again  god bless her good heart     she is a most amiable little woman worthy to be the maiden aunt of the whole human race  i suspect by the by that she does not like me half so well as i do her it is my impression that she thinks me unamiable or that there is something or other not quite right about me  i am sorry if it be so because such a good kindly clearsighted and delicate person is very apt to have reason at the bottom of her harsh thoughts when in rare cases she allows them to harbor with her  today and for some days past we have been in quest of lodgings for next winter a weary search up interminable staircases which seduce us upward to no successful result  it is very disheartening not to be able to place the slightest reliance on the integrity of the people we are to deal with not to believe in any connection between their words and their purposes to know that they are certainly telling you falsehoods while you are not in a position to catch hold of the lie and hold it up in their faces  this afternoon we called on mr and mrs  at the hotel de leurope but found only the former at home  we had a pleasant visit but i made no observations of his character save such as i have already sufficiently recorded and when we had been with him a little while mrs chapman the artists wife mr terry and my friend mr thompson came in   received them all with the same good degree of cordiality that he did ourselves not cold not very warm not annoyed not ecstatically delighted a man i should suppose not likely to have ardent individual preferences though perhaps capable of stern individual dislikes  but i take him at all events to be a very upright man and pursuing a narrow track of integrity he is a man whom i would never forgive as i would a thousand other men for the slightest moral delinquency  i would not be bound to say however that he has not the little sin of a fretful and peevish habit and yet perhaps i am a sinner myself for thinking so   may 23dthis morning i breakfasted at william storys and met there mr bryant mr t an english gentleman mr and mrs apthorp miss hosmer and one or two other ladies  bryant was very quiet and made no conversation audible to the general table  mr t talked of english politics and public men the times and other newspapers english clubs and social habits generally topics in which i could well enough bear my part of the discussion  after breakfast and aside from the ladies he mentioned an illustration of lord ellenboroughs lack of administrative abilitya proposal seriously made by his lordship in reference to the refractory sepoys      we had a very pleasant breakfast and certainly a breakfast is much preferable to a dinner not merely in the enjoyment while it is passing but afterwards  i made a good suggestion to miss hosmer for the design of a fountaina lady bursting into tears water gushing from a thousand pores in literal translation of the phrase and to call the statue niobe all tears  i doubt whether she adopts the idea but bernini would have been delighted with it  i should think the gush of water might be so arranged as to form a beautiful drapery about the figure swaying and fluttering with every breath of wind and rearranging itself in the calm in which case the lady might be said to have a habit of weeping     apart with william story he and i talked of the unluckiness of friday etc  i like him particularly well      we have been plagued today with our preparations for leaving rome tomorrow and especially with verifying the inventory of furniture before giving up the house to our landlord  he and his daughter have been examining every separate article down even to the kitchen skewers i believe and charging us to the amount of several scudi for cracks and breakages which very probably existed when we came into possession  it is very uncomfortable to have dealings with such a mean people though our landlord is germanmean in their business transactions mean even in their beggary for the beggars seldom ask for more than a mezzo baioccho though they sometimes grumble when you suit your gratuity exactly to their petition  it is pleasant to record that the italians have great faith in the honor of the english and americans and never hesitate to trust entire strangers to any reasonable extent on the strength of their being of the honest anglosaxon race  this evening u and i took a farewell walk in the pincian gardens to see the sunset and found them crowded with people promenading and listening to the music of the french baud  it was the feast of whitsunday which probably brought a greater throng than usual abroad  when the sun went down we descended into the piazza del popolo and thence into the via ripetta and emerged through a gate to the shore of the tiber along which there is a pleasant walk beneath a grove of trees we traversed it once and back again looking at the rapid river which still kept its mudpuddly aspect even in the clear twilight and beneath the brightening moon  the great bell of st peters tolled with a deep boom a grand and solemn sound the moon gleamed through the branches of the trees above us and u spoke with somewhat alarming fervor of her love for rome and regret at leaving it  we shall have done the child no good office in bringing her here if the rest of her life is to be a dream of this city of the soul and an unsatisfied yearning to come back to it  on the other hand nothing elevating and refining can be really injurious and so i hope she will always be the better for rome even if her life should be spent where there are no pictures no statues nothing but the dryness and meagreness of a new england village    journey to florence   civita castellana may 24thwe left rome this morning after troubles of various kinds and a dispute in the first place with lalla our female servant and her mother     mother and daughter exploded into a livid rage and cursed us plentifullywishing that we might never come to our journeys end and that we might all break our necks or die of apoplexythe most awful curse that an italian knows how to invoke upon his enemies because it precludes the possibility of extreme unction however as we are heretics and certain of damnation therefore anyhow it does not much matter to us and also the anathemas may have been blown back upon those who invoked them like the curses that were flung out from the balcony of st peters during holy week and wafted by heavens breezes right into the faces of some priests who stood near the pope next we had a disagreement with two men who brought down our luggage and put it on the vettura     and lastly we were infested with beggars who hung round the carriages with doleful petitions till we began to move away but the previous warfare had put me into too stern a mood for almsgiving so that they also were doubtless inclined to curse more than to bless and i am persuaded that we drove off under a perfect shower of anathemas  we passed through the porta del popolo at about eight oclock and after a moments delay while the passport was examined began our journey along the flaminian way between two such high and inhospitable walls of brick or stone as seem to shut in all the avenues to rome  we had not gone far before we heard military music in advance of us and saw the road blocked up with people and then the glitter of muskets and soon appeared the drummers fifers and trumpeters and then the first battalion of a french regiment marching into the city with two mounted officers at their head then appeared a second and then a third battalion the whole seeming to make almost an army though the number on their caps showed them all to belong to one regimentthe 1st then came a battery of artillery then a detachment of horsethese last by the crossed keys on their helmets being apparently papal troops  all were young fresh goodlooking men in excellent trim as to uniform and equipments and marched rather as if they were setting out on a campaign than returning from it the fact being i believe that they have been encamped or in barracks within a few miles of the city  nevertheless it reminded me of the military processions of various kinds which so often two thousand years ago and more entered rome over the flaminian way and over all the roads that led to the famous citytriumphs oftenest but sometimes the downcast train of a defeated army like those who retreated before hannibal  on the whole i was not sorry to see the gauls still pouring into rome but yet i begin to find that i have a strange affection for it and so did we allthe rest of the family in a greater degree than myself even  it is very singular the sad embrace with which rome takes possession of the soul  though we intend to return in a few months and for a longer residence than this has been yet we felt the city pulling at our heartstrings far more than london did where we shall probably never spend much time again  it may be because the intellect finds a home there more than in any other spot in the world and wins the heart to stay with it in spite of a good many things strewn all about to disgust us  the road in the earlier part of the way was not particularly picturesquethe country undulated but scarcely rose into hills and was destitute of trees there were a few shapeless ruins too indistinct for us to make out whether they were roman or mediaeval  nothing struck one so much in the forenoon as the spectacle of a peasantwoman riding on horseback as if she were a man  the houses were few and those of a dreary aspect built of gray stone and looking bare and desolate with not the slightest promise of comfort within doors  we passed two or three locandas or inns and finally came to the village if village it were for i remember no houses except our osteria of castel nuovo di porta where we were to take a dejeuner a la fourchette which was put upon the table between twelve and one  on this journey according to the custom of travellers in italy we pay the vetturino a certain sum and live at his expense and this meal was the first specimen of his catering on our behalf  it consisted of a beefsteak rather dry and hard but not unpalatable and a large omelette and for beverage two quart bottles of red wine which being tasted had an agreeable acid flavor     the locanda was built of stone and had what looked like an old roman altar in the basementhall and a shrine with a lamp before it on the staircase and the large public saloon in which we ate had a brick floor a ceiling with crossbeams meagrely painted in fresco and a scanty supply of chairs and settees  after lunch we wandered out into a valley or ravine near the house where we gathered some flowers and j found a nest with the young birds in it which however he put back into the bush whence he took it  our afternoon drive was more picturesque and noteworthy  soracte rose before us bulging up quite abruptly out of the plain and keeping itself entirely distinct from a whole horizon of hills  byron well compares it to a wave just on the bend and about to break over towards the spectator  as we approached it nearer and nearer it looked like the barrenest great rock that ever protruded out of the substance of the earth with scarcely a strip or a spot of verdure upon its steep and gray declivities  the road kept trending towards the mountain following the line of the old flaminian way which we could see at frequent intervals close beside the modern track  it is paved with large flagstones laid so accurately together that it is still in some places as smooth and even as the floor of a church and everywhere the tufts of grass find it difficult to root themselves into the interstices  its course is straighter than that of the road of today which often turns aside to avoid obstacles which the ancient one surmounted  much of it probably is covered with the soil and overgrowth deposited in later years and now and then we could see its flagstones partly protruding from the bank through which our road has been cut and thus showing that the thickness of this massive pavement was more than a foot of solid stone we lost it over and over again but still it reappeared now on one side of us now on the other perhaps from beneath the roots of old trees or the pastureland of a thousand years old and leading on towards the base of soracte  i forget where we finally lost it  passing through a town called rignano we found it dressed out in festivity with festoons of foliage along both sides of the street which ran beneath a triumphal arch bearing an inscription in honor of a ducal personage of the massimi family  i know no occasion for the feast except that it is whitsuntide the town was thronged with peasants in their best attire and we met others on their way thither particularly women and girls with heads bare in the sunshine but there was no tiptoe jollity nor indeed any more show of festivity than i have seen in my own country at a cattleshow or muster  really i think not half so much  the road still grew more and more picturesque and now lay along ridges at the bases of which were deep ravines and hollow valleys  woods were not wanting wilder forests than i have seen since leaving america of oaktrees chiefly and among the green foliage grew golden tufts of broom making a gay and lovely combination of hues  i must not forget to mention the poppies which burned like live coals along the wayside and lit up the landscape even a single one of them with wonderful effect at other points we saw olivetrees hiding their eccentricity of boughs under thick masses of foliage of a livid tint which is caused i believe by their turning their reverse sides to the light and to the spectator  vines were abundant but were of little account in the scene by and by we came in sight of the high flat tableland on which stands civita castellana and beheld straight downward between us and the town a deep level valley with a river winding through it it was the valley of the treja  a precipice hundreds of feet in height falls perpendicularly upon the valley from the site of civita castellana there is an equally abrupt one probably on the side from which we saw it and a modern road skilfully constructed goes winding down to the stream crosses it by a narrow stone bridge and winds upward into the town  after passing over the bridge i alighted with j and r     and made the ascent on foot along walls of natural rock in which old etruscan tombs were hollowed out  there are likewise antique remains of masonry whether roman or of what earlier period i cannot tell  at the summit of the acclivity which brought us close to the town our vetturino took us into the carriage again and quickly brought us to what appears to be really a good hotel where all of us are accommodated with sleepingchambers in a range beneath an arcade entirely secluded from the rest of the population of the hotel  after a splendid dinner that is splendid considering that it was ordered by our hospitable vetturino u miss shepard j and i walked out of the little town in the opposite direction from our entrance and crossed a bridge at the height of the tableland instead of at its base on either side we had a view down into a profound gulf with sides of precipitous rock and heaps of foliage in its lap through which ran the snowy track of a stream here snowy there dark here hidden among the foliage there quite revealed in the broad depths of the gulf  this was wonderfully fine  walking on a little farther soracte came fully into view starting with bold abruptness out of the middle of the country and before we got back the bright italian moon was throwing a shower of silver over the scene and making it so beautiful that it seemed miserable not to know how to put it into words a foolish thought however for such scenes are an expression in themselves and need not be translated into any feebler language  on our walk we met parties of laborers both men and women returning from the fields with rakes and wooden forks over their shoulders singing in chorus  it is very customary for women to be laboring in the fields    to terniborghetto   may 25thwe were aroused at four oclock this morning had some eggs and coffee and were ready to start between five and six being thus matutinary in order to get to terni in time to see the falls  the road was very striking and picturesque but i remember nothing particularly till we came to borghetto which stands on a bluff with a broad valley sweeping round it through the midst of which flows the tiber  there is an old castle on a projecting point and we saw other battlemented fortresses of mediaeval date along our way forming more beautiful ruins than any of the roman remains to which we have become accustomed this is partly i suppose owing to the fact that they have been neglected and allowed to mantle their decay with ivy instead of being cleaned propped up and restored  the antiquarian is apt to spoil the objects that interest him  sometimes we passed through wildernesses of various trees each contributing a different hue of verdure to the scene the vine also marrying itself to the figtree so that a man might sit in the shadow of both at once and temper the luscious sweetness of the one fruit with the fresh flavor of the other  the wayside incidents were such as meeting a man and woman borne along as prisoners handcuffed and in a cart two men reclining across one another asleep and lazily lifting their heads to gaze at us as we passed by a woman spinning with a distaff as she walked along the road  an old tomb or tower stood in a lonely field and several caves were hollowed in the rocks which might have been either sepulchres or habitations  soracte kept us company sometimes a little on one side sometimes behind looming up again and again when we thought that we had done with it and so becoming rather tedious at last like a person who presents himself for another and another leavetaking after the one which ought to have been final  honeysuckles sweetened the hedges along the road  after leaving borghetto we crossed the broad valley of the tiber and skirted along one of the ridges that border it looking back upon the road that we had passed lying white behind us  we saw a field covered with buttercups or some other yellow flower and poppies burned along the roadside as they did yesterday and there were flowers of a delicious blue as if the blue italian sky had been broken into little bits and scattered down upon the green earth  otricoli by and by appeared situated on a bold promontory above the valley a village of a few gray houses and huts with one edifice gaudily painted in white and pink  it looked more important at a distance than we found it on our nearer approach  as the road kept ascending and as the hills grew to be mountains we had taken two additional horses making six in all with a man and boy running beside them to keep them in motion  the boy had two club feet so inconveniently disposed that it seemed almost inevitable for him to stumble over them at every step besides which he seemed to tread upon his ankles and moved with a disjointed gait as if each of his legs and thighs had been twisted round together with his feet nevertheless he had a bright cheerful intelligent face and was exceedingly active keeping up with the horses at their trot and inciting them to better speed when they lagged  i conceived a great respect for this poor boy who had what most italian peasants would consider an enviable birthright in those two club feet as giving him a sufficient excuse to live on charity but yet took no advantage of them on the contrary putting his poor misshapen hoofs to such good use as might have shamed many a better provided biped  when he quitted us he asked no alms of the travellers but merely applied to gaetano for some slight recompense for his wellperformed service  this behavior contrasted most favorably with that of some other boys and girls who ran begging beside the carriage door keeping up a low miserable murmur like that of a kennelstream for a long long way  beggars indeed started up at every point when we stopped for a moment and whenever a hill imposed a slower pace upon us each village had its deformity or its infirmity offering his wretched petition at the step of the carriage and even a venerable whitehaired patriarch the grandfather of all the beggars seemed to grow up by the roadside but was left behind from inability to join in the race with his lightfooted juniors  no shame is attached to begging in italy  in fact i rather imagine it to be held an honorable profession inheriting some of the odor of sanctity that used to be attached to a mendicant and idle life in the days of early christianity when every saint lived upon providence and deemed it meritorious to do nothing for his support  murrays guidebook is exceedingly vague and unsatisfactory along this route and whenever we asked gaetano the name of a village or a castle he gave some one which we had never heard before and could find nothing of in the book  we made out the river nar however or what i supposed to be such though he called it nera  it flows through a most stupendous mountaingorge winding its narrow passage between high hills the broad sides of which descend steeply upon it covered with trees and shrubbery that mantle a host of rocky roughnesses and make all look smooth  here and there a precipice juts sternly forth  we saw an old castle on a hillside frowning down into the gorge and farther on the gray tower of narni stands upon a height imminent over the depths below and with its battlemented castle above now converted into a prison and therefore kept in excellent repair  a long winding street passes through narni broadening at one point into a marketplace where an old cathedral showed its venerable front and the great dial of its clock the figures on which were numbered in two semicircles of twelve points each one i suppose for noon and the other for midnight  the town has so far as its principal street is concerned a citylike aspect with large fair edifices and shops as good as most of those at rome the smartness of which contrasts strikingly with the rude and lonely scenery of mountain and stream through which we had come to reach it  we drove through narni without stopping and came out from it on the other side where a broad level valley opened before us most unlike the wild precipitous gorge which had brought us to the town  the road went winding down into the peaceful vale through the midst of which flowed the same stream that cuts its way between the impending hills as already described  we passed a monk and a soldierthe two curses of italy each in his way walking sociably side by side and from narni to terni i remember nothing that need be recorded  terni like so many other towns in the neighborhood stands in a high and commanding position chosen doubtless for its facilities of defence in days long before the mediaeval warfares of italy made such sites desirable  i suppose that like narni and otricoli it was a city of the umbrians  we reached it between eleven and twelve oclock intending to employ the afternoon on a visit to the famous falls of terni but after lowering all day it has begun to rain and we shall probably have to give them up   half past eight oclockit has rained in torrents during the afternoon and we have not seen the cascade of terni considerably to my regret for i think i felt the more interest in seeing it on account of its being artificial  methinks nothing was more characteristic of the energy and determination of the old romans than thus to take a river which they wished to be rid of and fling it over a giddy precipice breaking it into ten million pieces by the fall     we are in the hotel delle tre colonne and find it reasonably good though not so far as we are concerned justifying the rapturous commendations of previous tourists who probably travelled at their own charges  however there is nothing really to be complained of either in our accommodations or table and the only wonder is how gaetano contrives to get any profit out of our contract since the hotel bills would alone cost us more than we pay him for the journey and all  it is worth while to record as history of vetturino commissary customs that for breakfast this morning we had coffee eggs and bread and butter for lunch an omelette some stewed veal and a dessert of figs and grapes besides two decanters of a lightcolored acid wine tasting very like indifferent cider for dinner an excellent vermicelli soup two young fowls fricasseed and a hind quarter of roast lamb with fritters oranges and figs and two more decanters of the wine aforesaid  this hotel is an edifice with a gloomy front upon a narrow street and enterable through an arch which admits you into an enclosed court around the court on each story run the galleries with which the parlors and sleepingapartments communicate  the whole house is dingy probably old and seems not very clean but yet bears traces of former magnificence for instance in our bedroom the door of which is ornamented with gilding and the cornices with frescos some of which appear to represent the cascade of terni the roof is crossed with carved beams and is painted in the interstices the floor has a carpet but rough tiles underneath it which show themselves at the margin  the windows admit the wind the door shuts so loosely as to leave great cracks and during the rain today there was a heavy shower through our ceiling which made a flood upon the carpet  we see no chambermaids nothing of the comfort and neatness of an english hotel nor of the smart splendors of an american one but still this dilapidated palace affords us a better shelter than i expected to find in the decayed country towns of italy  in the album of the hotel i find the names of more english travellers than of any other nation except the americans who i think even exceed the former and the route being the favorite one for tourists between rome and florence whatever merit the inns have is probably owing to the demands of the anglosaxons  i doubt not if we chose to pay for it this hotel would supply us with any luxury we might ask for and perhaps even a gorgeous saloon and state bedchamber  after dinner j and i walked out in the dusk to see what we could of terni  we found it compact and gloomy but the latter characteristic might well enough be attributed to the dismal sky with narrow streets paved from wall to wall of the houses like those of all the towns in italy the blocks of pavingstone larger than the little square torments of rome  the houses are covered with dingy stucco and mostly low compared with those of rome and inhospitable as regards their dismal aspects and uninviting doorways  the streets are intricate as well as narrow insomuch that we quickly lost our way and could not find it again though the town is of so small dimensions that we passed through it in two directions in the course of our brief wanderings  there are no lampposts in terni and as it was growing dark and beginning to rain again we at last inquired of a person in the principal piazza and found our hotel as i expected within two minutes walk of where we stood    foligno   may 26that six oclock this morning we packed ourselves into our vettura my wife and i occupying the coupe and drove out of the city gate of terni  there are some old towers near it ruins of i know not what and care as little in the plethora of antiquities and other interesting objects  through the arched gateway as we approached we had a view of one of the great hills that surround the town looking partly bright in the early sunshine and partly catching the shadows of the clouds that floated about the sky  our way was now through the vale of terni as i believe it is called where we saw somewhat of the fertility of italy vines trained on poles or twining round mulberry and other trees ranged regularly like orchards groves of olives and fields of grain  there are interminable shrines in all sorts of situations some under arched niches or little penthouses with a bricktiled roof just large enough to cover them or perhaps in some bit of old roman masonry on the wall of a wayside inn or in a shallow cavity of the natural rock or high upward in the deep cuts of the road everywhere in short so that nobody need be at a loss when he feels the religious sentiment stir within him  our way soon began to wind among the hills which rose steep and lofty from the scanty level space that lay between they continually thrust themselves across the passage and appeared as if determined to shut us completely in  a great hill would put its foot right before us but at the last moment would grudgingly withdraw it and allow us just room enough to creep by  adown their sides we discerned the dry beds of mountain torrents which had lived too fierce a life to let it be a long one  on here and there a hillside or promontory we saw a ruined castle or a convent looking from its commanding height upon the road which very likely some robberknight had formerly infested with his banditti retreating with his booty to the security of such strongholds  we came once in a while to wretched villages where there was no token of prosperity or comfort but perhaps there may have been more than we could appreciate for the italians do not seem to have any of that sort of pride which we find in new england villages where every man according to his taste and means endeavors to make his homestead an ornament to the place  we miss nothing in italy more than the neat doorsteps and pleasant porches and thresholds and delightful lawns or grassplots which hospitably invite the imagination into a sweet domestic interior  everything however sunny and luxuriant may be the scene around is especially dreary and disheartening in the immediate vicinity of an italian home  at strettura which as the name indicates is a very narrow part of the valley we added two oxen to our horses and began to ascend the monte somma which according to murray is nearly four thousand feet high where we crossed it  when we came to the steepest part of the ascent gaetano who exercises a pretty decided control over his passengers allowed us to walk and we all with one exception alighted and began to climb the mountain on foot  i walked on briskly and soon left the rest of the party behind reaching the top of the pass in such a short time that i could not believe it and kept onward expecting still another height to climb  but the road began to descend winding among the depths of the hills as heretofore now beside the dry gravelly bed of a departed stream now crossing it by a bridge and perhaps passing through some other gorge that yet gave no decided promise of an outlet into the world beyond  a glimpse might occasionally be caught through a gap between the hilltops of a company of distant mountainpeaks pyramidal as these hills are apt to be and resembling the camp of an army of giants  the landscape was not altogether savage sometimes a hillside was covered with a rich field of grain or an orchard of olivetrees looking not unlike puffs of smoke from the peculiar line of their foliage but oftener there was a vast mantle of trees and shrubbery from top to bottom the golden tufts of the broom shining out amid the verdure and gladdening the whole  nothing was dismal except the houses those were always so whether the compact gray lines of village hovels with a narrow street between or the lonely farmhouse standing far apart from the road built of stone with windowgaps high in the wall empty of glass or the halfcastle halfdwelling of which i saw a specimen or two with what looked like a defensive rampart drawn around its court  i saw no look of comfort anywhere and continually in this wild and solitary region i met beggars just as if i were still in the streets of rome  boys and girls kept beside me till they delivered me into the hands of others like themselves hoary grandsires and grandmothers caught a glimpse of my approach and tottered as fast as they could to intercept me women came out of the cottages with rotten cherries on a plate entreating me to buy them for a mezzo baioccho a man at work on the road left his toil to beg and was grateful for the value of a cent in short i was never safe from importunity as long as there was a house or a human being in sight  we arrived at spoleto before noon and while our dejeuner was being prepared looked down from the window of the inn into the narrow street beneath which from the throng of people in it i judged to be the principal one priests papal soldiers women with no bonnets on their heads peasants in breeches and mushroom hats maids and matrons drawing water at a fountain idlers smoking on a bench under the window a talk a bustle but no genuine activity  after lunch we walked out to see the lions of spoleto and found our way up a steep and narrow street that led us to the city gate at which it is traditionally said hannibal sought to force an entrance after the battle of thrasymene and was repulsed the gateway has a double arch on the inner one of which is a tablet recording the above tradition as an unquestioned historical fact  from the gateway we went in search of the duomo or cathedral and were kindly directed thither by an officer who was descending into the town from the citadel which is an old castle now converted into a prison  the cathedral seemed small and did not much interest us either by the gothic front or its modernized interior  we saw nothing else in spoleto but went back to the inn and resumed our journey emerging from the city into the classic valley of the clitumnus which we did not view under the best of auspices because it was overcast and the wind as chill as if it had the cast in it  the valley though fertile and smilingly picturesque perhaps is not such as i should wish to celebrate either in prose or poetry  it is of such breadth and extent that its frame of mountains and ridgy hills hardly serve to shut it in sufficiently and the spectator thinks of a boundless plain rather than of a secluded vale  after passing le vene we came to the little temple which byron describes and which has been supposed to be the one immortalized by pliny  it is very small and stands on a declivity that falls immediately from the road right upon which rises the pediment of the temple while the columns of the other front find sufficient height to develop themselves in the lower ground  a little farther down than the base of the edifice we saw the clitumnus so recently from its source in the marble rock that it was still as pure as a childs heart and as transparent as truth itself  it looked airier than nothing because it had not substance enough to brighten and it was clearer than the atmosphere  i remember nothing else of the valley of clitumnus except that the beggars in this region of proverbial fertility are wellnigh profane in the urgency of their petitions they absolutely fall down on their knees as you approach in the same attitude as if they were praying to their maker and beseech you for alms with a fervency which i am afraid they seldom use before an altar or shrine  being denied they ran hastily beside the carriage but got nothing and finally gave over  i am so very tired and sleepy that i mean to mention nothing else tonight except the city of trevi which on the approach from spoleto seems completely to cover a high peaked hill from its pyramidal tip to its base  it was the strangest situation in which to build a town where i should suppose no horse can climb and whence no inhabitant would think of descending into the world after the approach of age should begin to stiffen his joints  on looking back on this most picturesque of towns which the road of course did not enter as evidently no road could i saw that the highest part of the hill was quite covered with a crown of edifices terminating in a churchtower while a part of the northern side was apparently too steep for building and a cataract of houses flowed down the western and southern slopes there seemed to be palaces churches everything that a city should have but my eyes are heavy and i can write no more about them only that i suppose the summit of the hill was artificially tenured so as to prevent its crumbling down and enable it to support the platform of edifices which crowns it   may 27thwe reached foligno in good season yesterday afternoon  our inn seemed ancient and under the same roof on one side of the entrance was the stable and on the other the coachhouse  the house is built round a narrow court with a well of water at bottom and an opening in the roof at top whence the staircases are lighted that wind round the sides of the court up to the highest story  our diningroom and bedrooms were in the latter region and were all paved with brick and without carpets and the characteristic of the whole was all exceeding plainness and antique clumsiness of fitting up  we found ourselves sufficiently comfortable however and as has been the case throughout our journey had a very fair and wellcooked dinner  it shows as perhaps i have already remarked that it is still possible to live well in italy at no great expense and that the high prices charged to the forestieri at rome and elsewhere are artificial and ought to be abated      the day had darkened since morning and was now ominous of rain but as soon as we were established we sallied out to see whatever was worth looking at  a beggarboy with one leg followed us without asking for anything apparently only for the pleasure of our company though he kept at too great a distance for conversation and indeed did not attempt to speak  we went first to the cathedral which has a gothic front and a modernized interior stuccoed and whitewashed looking as neat as a new england meetinghouse and very mean after our familiarity with the gorgeous churches in other cities  there were some pictures in the chapels but i believe all modern and i do not remember a single one of them  next we went without any guide to a church attached to a convent of dominican monks with a gothic exterior and two hideous pictures of deaththe skeleton leaning on his scythe one on each side of the door  this church likewise was whitewashed but we understood that it had been originally frescoed all over and by famous hands but these pictures having become much injured they were all obliterated as we sawall that is to say except a few specimens of the best preserved which were spared to show the world what the whole had been i thanked my stars that the obliteration of the rest had taken place before our visit for if anything is dreary and calculated to make the beholder utterly miserable it is a faded fresco with spots of the white plaster dotted over it  our onelegged boy had followed us into the church and stood near the door till he saw us ready to come out when he hurried on before us and waited a little way off to see whither we should go  we still went on at random taking the first turn that offered itself and soon came to another old churchthat of st mary within the wallsinto which we entered and found it whitewashed like the other two  this was especially fortunate for the doorkeeper informed us that two years ago the whole church except i suppose the roof which is of timber had been covered with frescos by pinturicchio all of which had been ruthlessly obliterated except a very few fragments  these he proceeded to show us poor dim ghosts of what may once have been beautifulnow so far gone towards nothingness that i was hardly sure whether i saw a glimmering of the design or not  by the by it was not pinturicchio as i have written above but giotto assisted i believe by cimabue who painted these frescos  our onelegged attendant had followed us also into this church and again hastened out of it before us and still we heard the dot of his crutch upon the pavement as we passed from street to street  by and by a sickly looking man met us and begged for qualche cosa but the boy shouted to him niente whether intimating that we would give him nothing or that he himself had a prior claim to all our charity i cannot tell  however the beggarman turned round and likewise followed our devious course  once or twice we missed him but it was only because he could not walk so fast as we for he appeared again as we emerged from the door of another church  our onelegged friend we never missed for a moment he kept pretty near usnear enough to be amused by our indecision whither to go and he seemed much delighted when it began to rain and he saw us at a loss how to find our way back to the hotel  nevertheless he did not offer to guide us but stumped on behind with a faster or slower dot of his crutch according to our pace  i began to think that he must have been engaged as a spy upon our movements by the police who had taken away my passport at the city gate  in this way he attended us to the door of the hotel where the beggar had already arrived  the latter again put in his doleful petition the onelegged boy said not a word nor seemed to expect anything and both had to go away without so much as a mezzo baioccho out of our pockets  the multitude of beggars in italy makes the heart as obdurate as a pavingstone  we left foligno this morning and all ready for us at the door of the hotel as we got into the carriage were our friends the beggarman and the onelegged boy the latter holding out his ragged hat and smiling with as confident an air as if he had done us some very particular service and were certain of being paid for it as from contract  it was so very funny so impudent so utterly absurd that i could not help giving him a trifle but the man got nothinga fact that gives me a twinge or two for he looked sickly and miserable  but where everybody begs everybody as a general rule must be denied and besides they act their misery so well that you are never sure of the genuine article    perugia   may 25thas i said last night we left foligno betimes in the morning which was bleak chill and very threatening there being very little blue sky anywhere and the clouds lying heavily on some of the mountainridges  the wind blew sharply right in us face and mine as we occupied the coupe so that there must have been a great deal of the north in it  we drove through a wide plainthe umbrian valley i supposeand soon passed the old town of spello just touching its skirts and wondering how people who had this rich and convenient plain from which to choose a site could think of covering a huge island of rock with their dwellingsfor spello tumbled its crooked and narrow streets down a steep descent and cannot well have a yard of even space within its walls  it is said to contain some rare treasures of ancient pictorial art  i do not remember much that we saw on our route  the plains and the lower hillsides seemed fruitful of everything that belongs to italy especially the olive and the vine  as usual there were a great many shrines and frequently a cross by the wayside  hitherto it had been merely a plain wooden cross but now almost every cross was hung with various instruments represented in wood apparently symbols of the crucifixion of our saviourthe spear the sponge the crown of thorns the hammer a pair of pincers and always st peters cock made a prominent figure generally perched on the summit of the cross  from our first start this morning we had seen mists in various quarters betokening that there was rain in those spots and now it began to spatter in our own faces although within the wide extent of our prospect we could see the sunshine falling on portions of the valley  a rainbow too shone out and remained so long visible that it appeared to have made a permanent stain in the sky  by and by we reached assisi which is magnificently situated for pictorial purposes with a gray castle above it and a gray wall around it itself on a mountain and looking over the great plain which we had been traversing and through which lay our onward way  we drove through the piazza grande to an ancient house a little beyond where a hospitable old lady receives travellers for a consideration without exactly keeping an inn  in the piazza we saw the beautiful front of a temple of minerva consisting of several marble pillars fluted and with rich capitals supporting a pediment  it was as fine as anything i had seen at rome and is now of course converted into a catholic church  i ought to have said that instead of driving straight to the old ladys we alighted at the door of a church near the city gate and went in to inspect some melancholy frescos and thence clambered up a narrow street to the cathedral which has a gothic front old enough but not very impressive  i really remember not a single object that we saw within but am pretty certain that the interior had been stuccoed and whitewashed  the ecclesiastics of old time did an excellent thing in covering the interiors of their churches with brilliant frescos thus filling the holy places with saints and angels and almost with the presence of the divinity  the modern ecclesiastics do the next best thing in obliterating the wretched remnants of what has had its day and done its office  these frescos might be looked upon as the symbol of the living spirit that made catholicism a true religion and glorified it as long as it did live now the glory and beauty have departed from one and the other  my wife u and miss shepard now set out with a cicerone to visit the great franciscan convent in the church of which are preserved some miraculous specimens in fresco and in oils of early italian art but as i had no mind to suffer any further in this way i stayed behind with j and r who were equally weary of these things  after they were gone we took a ramble through the city but were almost swept away by the violence of the wind which struggled with me for my hat and whirled r before it like a feather  the people in the public square seemed much diverted at our predicament being i suppose accustomed to these rude blasts in their mountainhome  however the wind blew in momentary gusts and then became more placable till another fit of fury came and passed as suddenly as before  we walked out of the same gate through which we had enteredan ancient gate but recently stuccoed and whitewashed in wretched contrast to the gray venerable wall through which it affords ingressand i stood gazing at the magnificent prospect of the wide valley beneath  it was so vast that there appeared to be all varieties of weather in it at the same instant fields of sunshine tracts of stormhere the coming tempest there the departing one  it was a picture of the world on a vast canvas for there was rural life and city life within the great expanse and the whole set in a frame of mountainsthe nearest bold and dustnet with the rocky ledges showing through their sides the distant ones blue and dimso far stretched this broad valley  when i had looked long enoughno not long enough for it would take a great while to read that pagewe returned within the gate and we clambered up past the cathedral and into the narrow streets above it the aspect of everything was immeasurably old a thousand years would be but a middle age for one of those houses built so massively with huge stones and solid arches that i do not see how they are ever to tumble down or to be less fit for human habitation than they are now  the streets crept between them and beneath arched passages and up and down steps of stone or ancient brick for it would be altogether impossible for a carriage to ascend above the grand piazza though possibly a donkey or a chairmans mule might find foothold  the city seems like a stony growth out of the hillside or a fossilized cityso old and singular it is without enough life and juiciness in it to be susceptible of decay an earthquake is the only chance of its ever being ruined beyond its present ruin  nothing is more strange than to think that this now dead citydead as regards the purposes for which men live nowadayswas centuries ago the seat and birthplace almost of art the only art in which the beautiful part of the human mind then developed itself  how came that flower to grow among these wild mountains  i do not conceive however that the people of assisi were ever much more enlightened or cultivated on the side of art than they are at present  the ecclesiastics were then the only patrons and the flower grew here because there was a great ecclesiastical garden in which it was sheltered and fostered  but it is very curious to think of assisi a school of art within and mountain and wilderness without  my wife and the rest of the party returned from the convent before noon delighted with what they had seen as i was delighted not to have seen it  we ate our dejeuner and resumed our journey passing beneath the great convent after emerging from the gate opposite to that of our entrance  the edifice made a very good spectacle being of great extent and standing on a double row of high and narrow arches on which it is built up from the declivity of the hill  we soon reached the church of st mary of the angels which is a modern structure and very spacious built in place of one destroyed by an earthquake  it is a fine church opening out a magnificent space in its nave and aisles and beneath the great dome stands the small old chapel with its rude stone walls in which st francis founded his order  this chapel and the dome appear to have been the only portions of the ancient church that were not destroyed by the earthquake  the dwelling of st francis is said to be also preserved within the church but we did not see it unless it were a little dark closet into which we squeezed to see some frescos by la spagna  it had an old wooden door of which u picked off a little bit of a chip to serve as a relic  there is a fresco in the church on the pediment of the chapel by overbeck representing the assumption of the virgin  it did not strike me as wonderfully fine  the other pictures of which there were many were modern and of no great merit  we pursued our way and came by and by to the foot of the high hill on which stands perugia and which is so long and steep that gaetano took a yoke of oxen to aid his horses in the ascent  we all except my wife walked a part of the way up and i myself with j for my companion kept on even to the city gatea distance i should think of two or three miles at least  the lower part of the road was on the edge of the hill with a narrow valley on our left and as the sun had now broken out its verdure and fertility its foliage and cultivation shone forth in miraculous beauty as green as england as bright as only italy perugia appeared above us crowning a mighty hill the most picturesque of cities and the higher we ascended the more the view opened before us as we looked back on the course that we had traversed and saw the wide valley sweeping down and spreading out bounded afar by mountains and sleeping in sun and shadow  no language nor any art of the pencil can give an idea of the scene  when god expressed himself in the landscape to mankind he did not intend that it should be translated into any tongue save his own immediate one  j meanwhile whose heart is now wholly in snailshells was rummaging for them among the stones and hedges by the roadside yet doubtless enjoyed the prospect more than he knew  the coach lagged far behind us and when it came up we entered the gate where a soldier appeared and demanded my passport  we drove to the grand hotel de france which is near the gate and two fine little boys ran beside the carriage well dressed and well looking enough to have been a gentlemans sons but claiming gaetano for their father  he is an inhabitant of perugia and has therefore reached his own home though we are still little more than midway to our journeys end  our hotel proves thus far to be the best that we have yet met with  we are only in the outskirts of perugia the bulk of the city where the most interesting churches and the public edifices are situated being far above us on the hill  my wife u miss shepard and r streamed forth immediately and saw a church but j who hates them and i remained behind and for my part i added several pages to this volume of scribble  this morning was as bright as morning could be even in italy and in this transparent mountain atmosphere  we at first declined the services of a cicerone and went out in the hopes of finding our way to whatever we wished to see by our own instincts  this proved to be a mistaken hope however and we wandered about the upper city much persecuted by a shabby old man who wished to guide us so at last miss shepard went back in quest of the cicerone at the hotel and meanwhile we climbed to the summit of the hill of perugia and leaning over a wall looked forth upon a most magnificent view of mountain and valley terminating in some peaks lofty and dim which surely must be the apennines  there again a young man accosted us offering to guide us to the cambio or exchange and as this was one of the places which we especially wished to see we accepted his services  by the by i ought to have mentioned that we had already entered a church san luigi i believe the interior of which we found very impressive dim with the light of stained and painted windows insomuch that it at first seemed almost dark and we could only see the bright twinkling of the tapers at the shrines but after a few minutes we discerned the tall octagonal pillars of the nave marble and supporting a beautiful roof of crossed arches  the church was neither gothic nor classic but a mixture of both and most likely barbarous yet it had a grand effect in its tinted twilight and convinced me more than ever how desirable it is that religious edifices should have painted windows  the door of the cambio proved to be one that we had passed several times while seeking for it and was very near the church just mentioned which fronts on one side of the same piazza  we were received by an old gentleman who appeared to be a public officer and found ourselves in a small room wainscoted with beautifully carved oak roofed with a coved ceiling painted with symbols of the planets and arabesqued in rich designs by raphael and lined with splendid frescos of subjects scriptural and historical by perugino  when the room was in its first glory i can conceive that the world had not elsewhere to show within so small a space such magnificence and beauty as were then displayed here even now i enjoyed to the best of my belief for we can never feel sure that we are not bamboozling ourselves in such matters some real pleasure in what i saw and especially seemed to feel after all these ages the old painters devout sentiment still breathing forth from the religious pictures the work of a hand that had so long been dust  when we had looked long at these the old gentleman led us into a chapel of the same size as the former room and built in the same fashion wainscoted likewise with old oak  the walls were also frescoed entirely frescoed and retained more of their original brightness than those we had already seen although the pictures were the production of a somewhat inferior hand a pupil of perugino  they seemed to be very striking however not the less so that one of them provoked an unseasonable smile  it was the decapitation of john the baptist and this holy personage was represented as still on his knees with his hands clasped in prayer although the executioner was already depositing the head in a charger and the blood was spouting from the headless trunk directly as it were into the face of the spectator  while we were in the outer room the cicerone who first offered his services at the hotel had come in so we paid our chance guide and expected him to take his leave  it is characteristic of this idle country however that if you once speak to a person or connect yourself with him by the slightest possible tie you will hardly get rid of him by anything short of main force  he still lingered in the room and was still there when i came away for having had as many pictures as i could digest i left my wife and u with the cicerone and set out on a ramble with j  we plunged from the upper city down through some of the strangest passages that ever were called streets some of them indeed being arched all over and going down into the unknown darkness looked like caverns and we followed one of them doubtfully till it opened out upon the light  the houses on each side were divided only by a pace or two and communicated with one another here and there by arched passages  they looked very ancient and may have been inhabited by etruscan princes judging from the massiveness of some of the foundation stones  the present inhabitants nevertheless are by no means princelyshabby men and the careworn wives and mothers of the peopleone of whom was guiding a child in leadingstrings through these antique alleys where hundreds of generations have trod before those little feet  finally we came out through a gateway the same gateway at which we entered last night  i ought to have mentioned in the narrative of yesterday that we crossed the tiber shortly before reaching perugia already a broad and rapid stream and already distinguished by the same turbid and mudpuddly quality of water that we see in it at rome  i think it will never be so disagreeable to me hereafter now that i find this turbidness to be its native color and not like that of the thames accruing from city sewers or any impurities of the lowlands  as i now remember the small chapel of santa maria degl angeli seems to have been originally the house of st francis   may 29ththis morning we visited the church of the dominicans where we saw some quaint pictures by fra angelico with a good deal of religious sincerity in them also a picture of st columba by perugino which unquestionably is very good  to confess the truth i took more interest in a fair gothic monument in white marble of pope benedict xii representing him reclining under a canopy while two angels draw aside the curtain the canopy being supported by twisted columns richly ornamented  i like this overflow and gratuity of device with which gothic sculpture works out its designs after seeing so much of the simplicity of classic art in marble  we then tried to find the church of san pietro in martire but without success although every person of whom we inquired immediately attached himself or herself to us and could hardly be got rid of by any efforts on our part  nobody seemed to know the church we wished for but all directed us to another church of san pietro which contains nothing of interest whereas the right church is supposed to contain a celebrated picture by perugino  finally we ascended the hill and the city proper of perugia for our hotel is in one of the suburbs and j and i set out on a ramble about the city  it was marketday and the principal piazza with the neighboring streets was crowded with people      the best part of perugia that in which the grand piazzas and the principal public edifices stand seems to be a nearly level plateau on the summit of the hill but it is of no very great extent and the streets rapidly run downward on either side  j and i followed one of these descending streets and were led a long way by it till we at last emerged from one of the gates of the city and had another view of the mountains and valleys the fertile and sunny wilderness in which this ancient civilization stands  on the right of the gate there was a rude countrypath partly overgrown with grass bordered by a hedge on one side and on the other by the gray city wall at the base of which the track kept onward  we followed it hoping that it would lead us to some other gate by which we might reenter the city but it soon grew so indistinct and broken that it was evidently on the point of melting into somebodys oliveorchard or wheatfields or vineyards all of which lay on the other side of the hedge and a kindly old woman of whom i inquired told me if i rightly understood her italian that i should find no further passage in that direction  so we turned back much broiled in the hot sun and only now and then relieved by the shadow of an angle or a tower  a lame beggarman sat by the gate and as we passed him j gave him two baiocchi which he himself had begged of me to buy an orange with and was loaded with the paupers prayers and benedictions as we entered the city  a great many blessings can be bought for very little money anywhere in italy and whether they avail anything or no it is pleasant to see that the beggars have gratitude enough to bestow them in such abundance  of all beggars i think a little fellow who rode beside our carriage on a stick his bare feet scampering merrily while he managed his steed with one hand and held out the other for charity howling piteously the while amused me most    passignano   may 29thwe left perugia at about three oclock today and went down a pretty steep descent but i have no particular recollection of the road till it again began to descend before reaching the village of magione we all except my wife walked up the long hill while the vettura was dragged after us with the aid of a yoke of oxen  arriving first at the village i leaned over the wall to admire the beautiful paese le bel piano as a peasant called it who made acquaintance with me that lay at the foot of the hill so level so bounded within moderate limits by a frame of hills and ridges that it looked like a green lake  in fact i think it was once a real lake which made its escape from its bed as i have known some lakes to have done in america  passing through and beyond the village i saw on a height above the road a halfruinous tower with great cracks running down its walls halfway from top to bottom  some little children had mounted the hill with us begging all the way they were recruited with additional members in the village and here beneath the ruinous tower a madman as it seemed assaulted us and ran almost under the carriagewheels in his earnestness to get a baioccho  ridding ourselves of these annoyances we drove on and between five and six oclock came in sight of the lake of thrasymene obtaining our first view of it i think in its longest extent  there were high hills and one mountain with its head in the clouds visible on the farther shore and on the horizon beyond it but the nearer banks were long ridges and hills of only moderate height the declining sun threw a broad sheen of brightness over the surface of the lake so that we could not well see it for excess of light but had a vision of headlands and islands floating about in a flood of gold and blue airy heights bounding it afar  when we first drew near the lake there was but a narrow tract covered with vines and olives between it and the hill that rose on the other side  as we advanced the tract grew wider and was very fertile as was the hillside with wheatfields and vines and olives especially the latter which symbol of peace as it is seemed to find something congenial to it in the soil stained long ago with blood  farther onward the space between the lake and hill grew still narrower the road skirting along almost close to the waterside and when we reached the town of passignano there was but room enough for its dirty and ugly street to stretch along the shore  i have seldom beheld a lovelier scene than that of the lake and the landscape around it never an uglier one than that of this idle and decaying village where we were immediately surrounded by beggars of all ages and by men vociferously proposing to row us out upon the lake  we declined their offers of a boat for the evening was very fresh and cool insomuch that i should have liked an outside garmenta temperature that i had not anticipated so near the beginning of june in sunny italy  instead of a row we took a walk through the village hoping to come upon the shore of the lake in some secluded spot but an incredible number of beggarchildren both boys and girls but more of the latter rushed out of every door and went along with us all howling their miserable petitions at the same moment  the village street is long and our escort waxed more numerous at every step till miss shepard actually counted forty of these little reprobates and more were doubtless added afterwards  at first no doubt they begged in earnest hope of getting some baiocchi but by and by perceiving that we had determined not to give them anything they made a joke of the matter and began to laugh and to babble and turn heels over head still keeping about us like a swarm of flies and now and then begging again with all their might  there were as few pretty faces as i ever saw among the same number of children and they were as ragged and dirty little imps as any in the world and moreover tainted the air with a very disagreeable odor from their rags and dirt rugged and healthy enough nevertheless and sufficiently intelligent certainly bold and persevering too so that it is hard to say what they needed to fit them for success in life  yet they begin as beggars and no doubt will end so as all their parents and grandparents do for in our walk through the village every old woman and many younger ones held out their hands for alms as if they had all been famished  yet these people kept their houses over their heads had firesides in winter i suppose and food out of their little gardens every day pigs to kill chickens olives wine and a great many things to make life comfortable  the children desperately as they begged looked in good bodily ease and happy enough but certainly there was a look of earnest misery in the faces of some of the old women either genuine or exceedingly well acted  i could not bear the persecution and went into our hotel determining not to venture out again till our departure at least not in the daylight  my wife and the rest of the family however continued their walk and at length were relieved from their little pests by three policemen the very images of those in rome in their blue longskirted coats cocked chapeauxbras white shoulderbelts and swords who boxed their ears and dispersed them  meanwhile they had quite driven away all sentimental effusion of which i felt more really than i expected about the lake of thrasymene  the inn of passignano promised little from its outward appearance a tall dark old house with a stone staircase leading us up from one sombre story to another into a brickpaved diningroom with our sleepingchambers on each side  there was a fireplace of tremendous depth and height fit to receive big forestlogs and with a queer double pair of ancient andirons capable of sustaining them and in a handful of ashes lay a small stick of olivewooda specimen i suppose of the sort of fuel which had made the chimney black in the course of a good many years  there must have been much shivering and misery of cold around this fireplace  however we needed no fire now and there was promise of good cheer in the spectacle of a man cleaning some lakefish for our dinner while the poor things flounced and wriggled under the knife  the dinner made its appearance after a long while and was most plentiful     so that having measured our appetite in anticipation of a paucity of food we had to make more room for such overflowing abundance  when dinner was over it was already dusk and before retiring i opened the window and looked out on lake thrasymene the margin of which lies just on the other side of the narrow village street  the moon was a day or two past the full just a little clipped on the edge but gave light enough to show the lake and its nearer shores almost as distinctly as by day and there being a ripple on the surface of the water it made a sheen of silver over a wide space    arezzo   may 30thwe started at six oclock and left the one ugly street of passignano before many of the beggars were awake  immediately in the vicinity of the village there is very little space between the lake in front and the ridge of hills in the rear but the plain widened as we drove onward so that the lake was scarcely to be seen or often quite hidden among the intervening trees although we could still discern the summits of the mountains that rise far beyond its shores  the country was fertile presenting on each side of the road vines trained on figtrees wheatfields and olives in greater abundance than any other product  on our right with a considerable width of plain between was the bending ridge of hills that shut in the roman army by its close approach to the lake at passignano  in perhaps half all hours drive we reached the little bridge that throws its arch over the sanguinetto and alighted there  the stream has but about a yards width of water and its whole course between the hills and the lake might well have been reddened and swollen with the blood of the multitude of slain romans its name put me in mind of the bloody brook at deerfield where a company of massachusetts men were massacred by the indians  the sanguinetto flows over a bed of pebbles and j crept under the bridge and got one of them for a memorial while u miss shepard and r plucked some olive twigs and oak leaves and made them into wreaths togethersymbols of victory and peace  the tower which is traditionally named after hannibal is seen on a height that makes part of the line of enclosing hills  it is a large old castle apparently of the middle ages with a square front and a battlemented sweep of wall the town of torres its name i think where hannibals main army is supposed to have lain while the romans came through the pass was in full view and i could understand the plan of the battle better than any system of military operations which i have hitherto tried to fathom both last night and today i found myself stirred more sensibly than i expected by the influences of this scene  the old battlefield is still fertile in thoughts and emotions though it is so many ages since the blood spilt there has ceased to make the grass and flowers grow more luxuriantly  i doubt whether i should feel so much on the field of saratoga or monmouth but these old classic battlefields belong to the whole world and each man feels as if his own forefathers fought them mine by the by if they fought them at all must have been on the side of hannibal for certainly i sympathized with him and exulted in the defeat of the romans on their own soil  they excite much the same emotion of general hostility that the english do  byron has written some very fine stanzas on the battlefieldnot so good as others that he has written on classical scenes and subjects yet wonderfully impressing his own perception of the subject on the reader  whenever he has to deal with a statue a ruin a battlefield he pounces upon the topic like a vulture and tears out its heart in a twinkling so that there is nothing more to be said  if i mistake not our passport was examined by the papal officers at the last customhouse in the pontifical territory before we traversed the path through which the roman army marched to its destruction  lake thrasymene of which we took our last view is not deep set among the hills but is bordered by long ridges with loftier mountains receding into the distance  it is not to be compared to windermere or loch lomond for beauty nor with lake champlain and many a smaller lake in my own country none of which i hope will ever become so historically interesting as this famous spot  a few miles onward our passport was countersigned at the tuscan customhouse and our luggage permitted to pass without examination on payment of a fee of nine or ten pauls besides two pauls to the porters  there appears to be no concealment on the part of the officials in thus waiving the exercise of their duty and i rather imagine that the thing is recognized and permitted by their superiors  at all events it is very convenient for the traveller  we saw cortona sitting like so many other cities in this region on its hill and arrived about noon at arezzo which also stretches up a high hillside and is surrounded as they all are by its walls or the remains of one with a fortified gate across every entrance  i remember one little village somewhere in the neighborhood of the clitumnus which we entered by one gateway and in the course of two minutes at the utmost left by the opposite one so diminutive was this walled town  everything hereabouts bears traces of times when war was the prevalent condition and peace only a rare gleam of sunshine  at arezzo we have put up at the hotel royal which has the appearance of a grand old house and proves to be a tolerable inn enough  after lunch we wandered forth to see the town which did not greatly interest me after perugia being much more modern and less picturesque in its aspect we went to the cathedrala gothic edifice but not of striking exterior  as the doors were closed and not to be opened till three oclock we seated ourselves under the trees on a high grassy space surrounded and intersected with gravelwalksa public promenade in short near the cathedral and after resting ourselves here we went in search of petrarchs house which murray mentions as being in this neighborhood  we inquired of several people who knew nothing about the matter one woman misdirected us out of mere fun i believe for she afterwards met us and asked how we had succeeded  but finally through s enterprise and perseverance we found the spot not a stonesthrow from where we had been sitting  petrarchs house stands below the promenade which i have just mentioned and within hearing of the reverberations between the strokes of the cathedral bell  it is two stories high covered with a lightcolored stucco and has not the slightest appearance of antiquity no more than many a modern and modest dwellinghouse in an american city  its only remarkable feature is a pointed arch of stone let into the plastered wall and forming a framework for the doorway  i set my foot on the doorsteps ascended them and miss shepard and j gathered some weeds or blades of grass that grew in the chinks between the steps  there is a long inscription on a slab of marble set in the front of the house as is the fashion in arezzo when a house has been the birthplace or residence of a distinguished man  right opposite petrarchs birthhouseand it must have been the well whence the water was drawn that first bathed himis a well which boccaccio has introduced into one of his stories  it is surrounded with a stone curb octagonal in shape and evidently as ancient as boccaccios time  it has a wooden cover through which is a square opening and looking down i saw my own face in the water far beneath  there is no familiar object connected with daily life so interesting as a well and this well or old arezzo whence petrarch had drunk around which he had played in his boyhood and which boccaccio has made famous really interested me more than the cathedral  it lies right under the pavement of the street under the sunshine without any shade of trees about it or any grass except a little that grows in the crevices of its stones but the shape of its stonework would make it a pretty object in an engraving  as i lingered round it i thought of my own townpump in old salem and wondered whether my townspeople would ever point it out to strangers and whether the stranger would gaze at it with any degree of such interest as i felt in boccaccios well  o certainly not but yet i made that humble townpump the most celebrated structure in the good town  a thousand and a thousand people had pumped there merely to water oxen or fill their teakettles but when once i grasped the handle a rill gushed forth that meandered as far as england as far as india besides tasting pleasantly in every town and village of our own country  i like to think of this so long after i did it and so far from home and am not without hopes of some kindly local remembrance on this score  petrarchs house is not a separate and insulated building but stands in contiguity and connection with other houses on each side and all when i saw them as well as the whole street extending down the slope of the hill had the bright and sunny aspect of a modern town  as the cathedral was not yet open and as j and i had not so much patience as my wife we left her and miss shepard and set out to return to the hotel  we lost our way however and finally had to return to the cathedral to take a fresh start and as the door was now open we went in  we found the cathedral very stately with its great arches and darkly magnificent with the dim rich light coming through its painted windows some of which are reckoned the most beautiful that the whole world has to show  the hues are far more brilliant than those of any painted glass i saw in england and a great wheel window looks like a constellation of manycolored gems  the old english glass gets so smoky and dull with dust that its pristine beauty cannot any longer be even imagined nor did i imagine it till i saw these italian windows  we saw nothing of my wife and miss shepard but found afterwards that they had been much annoyed by the attentions of a priest who wished to show them the cathedral till they finally told him that they had no money with them when he left them without another word  the attendants in churches seem to be quite as venal as most other italians and for the sake of their little profit they do not hesitate to interfere with the great purposes for which their churches were built and decorated hanging curtains for instance before all the celebrated pictures or hiding them away in the sacristy so that they cannot be seen without a fee  returning to the hotel we looked out of the window and in the street beneath there was a very busy scene it being sunday and the whole population apparently being astir promenading up and down the smooth flagstones which made the breadth of the street one sidewalk or at their windows or sitting before their doors  the vivacity of the population in these parts is very striking after the gravity and lassitude of rome and the air was made cheerful with the talk and laughter of hundreds of voices  i think the women are prettier than the roman maids and matrons who as i think i have said before have chosen to be very uncomely since the rape of their ancestresses by way of wreaking a terrible spite and revenge  i have nothing more to say of arezzo except that finding the ordinary wine very bad as black as ink and tasting as if it had tar and vinegar in it we called for a bottle of monte pulciano and were exceedingly gladdened and mollified thereby    incisa   we left arezzo early on monday morning the sun throwing the long shadows of the trees across the road which at first after we had descended the hill lay over a plain  as the morning advanced or as we advanced the country grew more hilly  we saw many bits of rustic lifesuch as old women tending pigs or sheep by the roadside and spinning with a distaff women sewing under trees or at their own doors children leading goats tied by the horns while they browse sturdy sunburnt creatures in petticoats but otherwise manlike at work side by side with male laborers in the fields  the broadbrimmed highcrowned hat of tuscan straw is the customary female headdress and is as unbecoming as can possibly be imagined and of little use one would suppose as a shelter from the sun the brim continually blowing upward from the face  some of the elder women wore black felt hats likewise broadbrimmed and the men wore felt hats also shaped a good deal like a mushroom with hardly any brim at all  the scenes in the villages through which we passed were very lively and characteristic all the population seeming to be out of doors some at the butchers shop others at the well a tailor sewing in the open air with a young priest sitting sociably beside him children at play women mending clothes embroidering spinning with the distaff at their own doorsteps many idlers letting the pleasant morning pass in the sweetdonothing all assembling in the street as in the common room of one large household and thus brought close together and made familiar with one another as they can never be in a different system of society  as usual along the road we passed multitudes of shrines where the virgin was painted in fresco or sometimes represented in basreliefs within niches or under more spacious arches  it would be a good idea to place a comfortable and shady seat beneath all these wayside shrines where the wayfarer might rest himself and thank the virgin for her hospitality nor can i believe that it would offend her any more than other incense if he were to regale himself even in such consecrated spots with the fragrance of a pipe or cigar  in the wirework screen before many of the shrines hung offerings of roses and other flowers some wilted and withered some fresh with that mornings dew some that never bloomed and never fadedbeing artificial  i wonder that they do not plant rosetrees and all kinds of fragrant and flowering shrubs under the shrines and twine and wreathe them all around so that the virgin may dwell within a bower of perpetual freshness at least put flowerpots with living plants into the niche there are many things in the customs of these people that might be made very beautiful if the sense of beauty were as much alive now as it must have been when these customs were first imagined and adopted  i must not forget among these little descriptive items the spectacle of women and girls bearing huge bundles of twigs and shrubs or grass with scarlet poppies and blue flowers intermixed the bundles sometimes so huge as almost to hide the womans figure from head to heel so that she looked like a locomotive mass of verdure and flowers sometimes reaching only halfway down her back so as to show the crooked knife slung behind with which she had been reaping this strange harvestsheaf  a preraphaelite painterthe one for instance who painted the heap of autumnal leaves which we saw at the manchester exhibitionwould find an admirable subject in one of these girls stepping with a free erect and graceful carriage her burden on her head and the miscellaneous herbage and flowers would give him all the scope he could desire for minute and various delineation of nature  the country houses which we passed had sometimes open galleries or arcades on the second story and above where the inhabitants might perform their domestic labor in the shade and in the air  the houses were often ancient and most picturesquely timestained the plaster dropping in spots from the old brickwork others were tinted of pleasant and cheerful lines some were frescoed with designs in arabesques or with imaginary windows some had escutcheons of arms painted on the front  wherever there was a pigeonhouse a flight of doves were represented as flying into the holes doubtless for the invitation and encouragement of the real birds  once or twice i saw a bush stuck up before the door of what seemed to be a wineshop  if so it is the ancient custom so long disused in england and alluded to in the proverb good wine needs no bush several times we saw grass spread to dry on the road covering half the track and concluded it to have been cut by the roadside for the winter forage of his ass by some poor peasant or peasants wife who had no grass land except the margin of the public way  a beautiful feature of the scene today as the preceding day were the vines growing on figtrees  this interrogationmark must mean that mr hawthorne was not sure they were figtreesed and often wreathed in rich festoons from one tree to another by and by to be hung with clusters of purple grapes  i suspect the vine is a pleasanter object of sight under this mode of culture than it can be in countries where it produces a more precious wine and therefore is trained more artificially  nothing can be more picturesque than the spectacle of an old grapevine with almost a trunk of its own clinging round its tree imprisoning within its strong embrace the friend that supported its tender infancy converting the tree wholly to its own selfish ends as seemingly flexible natures are apt to do stretching out its innumerable arms on every bough and allowing hardly a leaf to sprout except its own i must not yet quit this hasty sketch without throwing in both in the early morning and later in the forenoon the mist that dreamed among the hills and which now that i have called it mist i feel almost more inclined to call light being so quietly cheerful with the sunshine through it  put in now and then a castle on a hilltop a rough ravine a smiling valley a mountain stream with a far wider bed than it at present needs and a stone bridge across it with ancient and massive archesand i shall say no more except that all these particulars and many better ones which escape me made up a very pleasant whole  at about noon we drove into the village of incisa and alighted at the albergo where we were to lunch  it was a gloomy old house as much like my idea of an etruscan tomb as anything else that i can compare it to we passed into a wide and lofty entrancehall paved with stone and vaulted with a roof of intersecting arches supported by heavy columns of stuccoedbrick the whole as sombre and dingy as can well be  this entrancehall is not merely the passageway into the inn but is likewise the carriagehouse into which our vettura is wheeled and it has on one side the stable odorous with the litter of horses and cattle and on the other the kitchen and a common sittingroom  a narrow stone staircase leads from it to the diningroom and chambers above which are paved with brick and adorned with rude frescos instead of paperhangings  we look out of the windows and step into a little ironrailed balcony before the principal window and observe the scene in the village street  the street is narrow and nothing can exceed the tall grim ugliness of the village houses many of them four stories high contiguous all along and paved quite across so that nature is as completely shut out from the precincts of this little town as from the heart of the widest city  the walls of the houses are plastered gray dilapidated the windows small some of them drearily closed with wooden shutters others flung wide open and with womens heads protruding others merely frescoed for a show of light and air  it would be a hideous street to look at in a rainy day or when no human life pervaded it  now it has vivacity enough to keep it cheerful  people lounge round the door of the albergo and watch the horses as they drink from a stone trough which is built against the wall of the house and filled with the unseen gush of a spring  at first there is a shade entirely across the street and all the withindoors of the village empties itself there and keeps up a babblement that seems quite disproportioned even to the multitude of tongues that make it  so many words are not spoken in a new england village in a whole year as here in this single day  people talk about nothing as if they were terribly in earnest and laugh at nothing as if it were all excellent joke  as the hot noon sunshine encroaches on our side of the street it grows a little more quiet  the loungers now confine themselves to the shady margin growing narrower and narrower of the other side where directly opposite the albergo there are two cafes and a wineshop vendita di pane vino ed altri generi all in a row with benches before them  the benchers joke with the women passing by and are joked with back again the sun still eats away the shadow inch by inch beating down with such intensity that finally everybody disappears except a few passersby  doubtless the village snatches this halfhour for its siesta  there is a song however inside one of the cafes with a burden in which several voices join  a girl goes through the street sheltered under her great bundle of freshly cut grass  by and by the song ceases and two young peasants come out of the cafe a little affected by liquor in their shirtsleeves and bare feet with their trousers tucked up  they resume their song in the street and dance along ones arm around his fellows neck his own waist grasped by the others arm  they whirl one another quite round about and come down upon their feet  meeting a village maid coming quietly along they dance up and intercept her for a moment but give way to her sobriety of aspect  they pass on and the shadow soon begins to spread from one side of the street which presently fills again and becomes once more for its size the noisiest place i ever knew  we had quite a tolerable dinner at this ugly inn where many preceding travellers had written their condemnatory judgments as well as a few their favorable ones in pencil on the walls of the diningroom    to florence   at setting off from incisa we were surrounded by beggars as usual the most interesting of whom were a little blind boy and his mother who had besieged us with gentle pertinacity during our whole stay there  there was likewise a man with a maimed hand and other hurts or deformities also an old woman who i suspect only pretended to be blind keeping her eyes tightly squeezed together but directing her hand very accurately where the copper shower was expected to fall  besides these there were a good many sturdy little rascals vociferating in proportion as they needed nothing  it was touching however to see several personsthemselves beggars for aught i knowassisting to hold up the little blind boys tremulous hand so that he at all events might not lack the pittance which we had to give  our dole was but a poor one after all consisting of what roman coppers we had brought into tuscany with us and as we drove off some of the boys ran shouting and whining after us in the hot sunshine nor stopped till we reached the summit of the hill which rises immediately from the village street  we heard gaetano once say a good thing to a swarm of beggarchildren who were infesting us are your fathers all deada proverbial expression i suppose  the pertinacity of beggars does not i think excite the indignation of an italian as it is apt to do that of englishmen or americans  the italians probably sympathize more though they give less gaetano is very gentle in his modes of repelling them and indeed never interferes at all as long as there is a prospect of their getting anything  immediately after leaving incisa we saw the arno already a considerable river rushing between deep banks with the greenish line of a duckpond diffused through its water  nevertheless though the first impression was not altogether agreeable we soon became reconciled to this line and ceased to think it an indication of impurity for in spite of it the river is still to a certain degree transparent and is at any rate a mountain stream and comes uncontaminated from its source  the pure transparent brown of the new england rivers is the most beautiful color but i am content that it should be peculiar to them  our afternoons drive was through scenery less striking than some which we had traversed but still picturesque and beautiful  we saw deep valleys and ravines with streams at the bottom long wooded hillsides rising far and high and dotted with white dwellings well towards the summits  by and by we had a distant glimpse of florence showing its great dome and some of its towers out of a sidelong valley as if we were between two great waves of the tumultuous sea of hills while far beyond rose in the distance the blue peaks of three or four of the apennines just on the remote horizon  there being a haziness in the atmosphere however florence was little more distinct to us than the celestial city was to christian and hopeful when they spied at it from the delectable mountains  keeping steadfastly onward we ascended a winding road and passed a grand villa standing very high and surrounded with extensive grounds it must be the residence of some great noble and it has an avenue of poplars or aspens very light and gay and fit for the passage of the bridal procession when the proprietor or his heir brings home his bride while in another direction from the same front of the palace stretches an avenue or grove of cypresses very long and exceedingly black and dismal like a train of gigantic mourners  i have seen few things more striking in the way of trees than this grove of cypresses  from this point we descended and drove along an ugly dusty avenue with a high brick wall on one side or both till we reached the gate of florence into which we were admitted with as little trouble as customhouse officers soldiers and policemen can possibly give  they did not examine our luggage and even declined a fee as we had already paid one at the frontier customhouse  thank heaven and the grand duke  as we hoped that the casa del bello had been taken for us we drove thither in the first place but found that the bargain had not been concluded  as the house and studio of mr powers were just on the opposite side of the street i went to it but found him too much engrossed to see me at the moment so i returned to the vettura and we told gaetano to carry us to a hotel  he established us at the albergo della fontana a good and comfortable house     mr powers called in the eveninga plain personage characterized by strong simplicity and warm kindliness with an impending brow and large eyes which kindle as he speaks  he is gray and slightly bald but does not seem elderly nor past his prime  i accept him at once as an honest and trustworthy man and shall not vary from this judgment  through his good offices the next day we engaged the casa del bello at a rent of fifty dollars a month and i shall take another opportunity my fingers and head being tired now to write about the house and mr powers and what appertains to him and about the beautiful city of florence  at present i shall only say further that this journey from rome has been one of the brightest and most uncareful interludes of my life we have all enjoyed it exceedingly and i am happy that our children have it to look back upon   june 4that our visit to powerss studio on tuesday we saw a marble copy of the fisherboy holding a shell to his ear and the bust of proserpine and two or three other ideal busts various casts of most of the ideal statues and portrait busts which he has executed  he talks very freely about his works and is no exception to the rule that an artist is not apt to speak in a very laudatory style of a brother artist he showed us a bust of mr sparks by persicoa lifeless and thoughtless thing enough to be sureand compared it with a very good one of the same gentleman by himself but his chiefest scorn was bestowed on a wretched and ridiculous image of mr king of alabama by clark mills of which he said he had been employed to make several copies for southern gentlemen  the consciousness of power is plainly to be seen and the assertion of it by no means withheld in his simple and natural character nor does it give me an idea of vanity on his part to see and hear it  he appears to consider himself neglected by his countryby the government of it at leastand talks with indignation of the byways and political intrigue which he thinks win the rewards that ought to be bestowed exclusively on merit  an appropriation of twentyfive thousand dollars was made some years ago for a work of sculpture by him to be placed in the capitol but the intermediate measures necessary to render it effective have been delayed while the abovementioned clark mills certainly the greatest bungler that ever botched a block of marblehas received an order for an equestrian statue of washington  not that mr powers is made bitter or sour by these wrongs as he considers them he talks of them with the frankness of his disposition when the topic comes in his way and is pleasant kindly and sunny when he has done with it  his long absence from our country has made him think worse of us than we deserve and it is an effect of what i myself am sensible in my shorter exile the most piercing shriek the wildest yell and all the ugly sounds of popular turmoil inseparable from the life of a republic being a million times more audible than the peaceful hum of prosperity and content which is going on all the while  he talks of going home but says that he has been talking of it every year since he first came to italy and between his pleasant life of congenial labor and his idea of moral deterioration in america i think it doubtful whether he ever crosses the sea again  like most exiles of twenty years he has lost his native country without finding another but then it is as well to recognize the truththat an individual country is by no means essential to ones comfort  powers took us into the farthest room i believe of his very extensive studio and showed us a statue of washington that has much dignity and stateliness  he expressed however great contempt for the coat and breeches and masonic emblems in which he had been required to drape the figure  what would he do with washington the most decorous and respectable personage that ever went ceremoniously through the realities of life  did anybody ever see washington nude  it is inconceivable  he had no nakedness but i imagine he was born with his clothes on and his hair powdered and made a stately bow on his first appearance in the world  his costume at all events was a part of his character and must be dealt with by whatever sculptor undertakes to represent him  i wonder that so very sensible a man as powers should not see the necessity of accepting drapery and the very drapery of the day if he will keep his art alive  it is his business to idealize the tailors actual work  but he seems to be especially fond of nudity none of his ideal statues so far as i know them having so much as a rag of clothes  his statue of california lately finished and as naked as venus seemed to me a very good work not an actual woman capable of exciting passion but evidently a little out of the category of human nature  in one hand she holds a diviningrod  she says to the emigrants observed powers here is the gold if you choose to take it  but in her face and in her eyes very finely expressed there is a look of latent mischief rather grave than playful yet somewhat impish or spritelike and in the other hand behind her back she holds a bunch of thorns  powers calls her eyes indian  the statue is true to the present fact and history of california and includes the agelong truth as respects the auri sacra fames      when we had looked sufficiently at the sculpture powers proposed that we should now go across the street and see the casa del bello  we did so in a body powers in his dressinggown and slippers and his wife and daughters without assuming any street costume  the casa del bello is a palace of three pianos the topmost of which is occupied by the countess of st george an english lady and two lower pianos are to be let and we looked at both  the upper one would have suited me well enough but the lower has a terrace with a rustic summerhouse over it and is connected with a garden where there are arbors and a willowtree and a little wilderness of shrubbery and roses with a fountain in the midst  it has likewise an immense suite of rooms round the four sides of a small court spacious lofty with frescoed ceilings and rich hangings and abundantly furnished with armchairs sofas marble tables and great lookingglasses  not that these last are a great temptation but in our wandering life i wished to be perfectly comfortable myself and to make my family so for just this summer and so i have taken the lower piano the price being only fifty dollars per month entirely furnished even to silver and linen  certainly this is something like the paradise of cheapness we were told of and which we vainly sought in rome      to me has been assigned the pleasantest room for my study and when i like i can overflow into the summerhouse or an arbor and sit there dreaming of a story  the weather is delightful too warm to walk but perfectly fit to do nothing in in the coolness of these great rooms every day i shall write a little perhapsand probably take a brief nap somewhere between breakfast and teabut go to see pictures and statues occasionally and so assuage and mollify myself a little after that uncongenial life of the consulate and before going back to my own hard and dusty new england  after concluding the arrangement for the casa del bello we stood talking a little while with powers and his wife and daughter before the door of the house for they seem so far to have adopted the habits of the florentines as to feel themselves at home on the shady side of the street  the outofdoor life and free communication with the pavement habitual apparently among the middle classes reminds me of the plays of moliere and other old dramatists in which the street or the square becomes a sort of common parlor where most of the talk and scenic business of the people is carried on   june 5thfor two or three mornings after breakfast i have rambled a little about the city till the shade grew narrow beneath the walls of the houses and the heat made it uncomfortable to be in motion  today i went over the ponte carraja and thence into and through the heart of the city looking into several churches in all of which i found people taking advantage of the cool breadth of these sacred interiors to refresh themselves and say their prayers  florence at first struck me as having the aspect of a very new city in comparison with rome but on closer acquaintance i find that many of the buildings are antique and massive though still the clear atmosphere the bright sunshine the light cheerful hues of the stucco andas much as anything else perhapsthe vivacious character of the human life in the streets take away the sense of its being an ancient city  the streets are delightful to walk in after so many penitential pilgrimages as i have made over those little square uneven blocks of the roman pavement which wear out the boots and torment the soul  i absolutely walk on the smooth flags of florence for the mere pleasure of walking and live in its atmosphere for the mere pleasure of living and warm as the weather is getting to be i never feel that inclination to sink down in a heap and never stir again which was my dull torment and misery as long as i stayed in rome  i hardly think there can be a place in the world where life is more delicious for its own simple sake than here  i went today into the baptistery which stands near the duomo and like that is covered externally with slabs of black and white marble now grown brown and yellow with age  the edifice is octagonal and on entering one immediately thinks of the pantheonthe whole space within being free from side to side with a dome above but it differs from the severe simplicity of the former edifice being elaborately ornamented with marble and frescos and lacking that great eye in the roof that looks so nobly and reverently heavenward from the pantheon  i did little more than pass through the baptistery glancing at the famous bronze doors some perfect and admirable casts of which i had already seen at the crystal palace  the entrance of the duomo being just across the piazza i went in there after leaving the baptistery and was struck anewfor this is the third or fourth visitwith the dim grandeur of the interior lighted as it is almost exclusively by painted windows which seem to me worth all the variegated marbles and rich cabinetwork of st peters  the florentine cathedral has a spacious and lofty nave and side aisles divided from it by pillars but there are no chapels along the aisles so that there is far more breadth and freedom of interior in proportion to the actual space than is usual in churches  it is woful to think how the vast capaciousness within st peters is thrown away and made to seem smaller than it is by every possible device as if on purpose  the pillars and walls of this duomo are of a uniform brownish neutral tint the pavement a mosaic work of marble the ceiling of the dome itself is covered with frescos which being very imperfectly lighted it is impossible to trace out  indeed it is but a twilight region that is enclosed within the firmament of this great dome which is actually larger than that of st peters though not lifted so high from the pavement  but looking at the painted windows i little cared what dimness there might be elsewhere for certainly the art of man has never contrived any other beauty and glory at all to be compared to this  the dome sits as it were upon three smaller domessmaller but still greatbeneath which are three vast niches forming the transepts of the cathedral and the tribune behind the high altar  all round these hollow domecovered arches or niches are high and narrow windows crowded with saints angels and all manner of blessed shapes that turn the common daylight into a miracle of richness and splendor as it passes through their heavenly substance  and just beneath the swell of the great central dome is a wreath of circular windows quite round it as brilliant as the tall and narrow ones below  it is a pity anybody should die without seeing an antique painted window with the bright italian sunshine glowing through it  this is the dim religious light that milton speaks of but i doubt whether he saw these windows when he was in italy or any but those faded or dusty and dingy ones of the english cathedrals else he would have illuminated that word dim with some epithet that should not chase away the dimness yet should make it shine like a million of rubies sapphires emeralds and topazesbright in themselves but dim with tenderness and reverence because god himself was shining through them  i hate what i have said  all the time that i was in the cathedral the space around the high altar which stands exactly under the dome was occupied by priests or acolytes in white garments chanting a religious service  after coming out i took a view of the edifice from a corner of the street nearest to the dome where it and the smaller domes can be seen at once  it is greatly more satisfactory than st peters in any view i ever had of itstriking in its outline with a mystery yet not a bewilderment in its masses and curves and angles and wrought out with a richness of detail that gives the eyes new arches new galleries new niches new pinnacles new beauties great and small to play with when wearied with the vast whole  the hue black and white marbles like the baptistery turned also yellow and brown is greatly preferable to the buff travertine of st peters  from the duomo it is but a moderate streets length to the piazza del gran duca the principal square of florence  it is a very interesting place and has on one side the old governmental palacethe palazzo vecchiowhere many scenes of historic interest have been enacted for example conspirators have been hanged from its windows or precipitated from them upon the pavement of the square below  it is a pity that we cannot take as much interest in the history of these italian republics as in that of england for the former is much the more picturesque and fuller of curious incident  the sobriety of the anglosaxon racein connection too with their moral sensekeeps them from doing a great many things that would enliven the page of history and their events seem to come in great masses shoved along by the agency of many persons rather than to result from individual will and character  a hundred plots for a tragedy might be found in florentine history for one in english  at one corner of the palazzo vecchio is a bronze equestrian statue of cosmo de medici the first grand duke very stately and majestic there are other marble statuesone of david by michael angeloat each side of the palace door and entering the court i found a rich antique arcade within surrounded by marble pillars most elaborately carved supporting arches that were covered with faded frescos  i went no farther but stepped across a little space of the square to the loggia di lanzi which is broad and noble of three vast arches at the end of which i take it is a part of the palazzo uffizi fronting on the piazza  i should call it a portico if it stood before the palace door but it seems to have been constructed merely for itself and as a shelter for the people from sun and rain and to contain some fine specimens of sculpture as well antique as of more modern times  benvenuto cellinis perseus stands here but it did not strike me so much as the cast of it in the crystal palace  a good many people were under these great arches some of whom were reclining half or quite asleep on the marble seats that are built against the back of the loggia  a group was reading an edict of the grand duke which appeared to have been just posted on a board at the farther end of it and i was surprised at the interest which they ventured to manifest and the freedom with which they seemed to discuss it  a soldier was on guard and doubtless there were spies enough to carry every word that was said to the ear of absolute authority glancing myself at the edict however i found it referred only to the furtherance of a project got up among the citizens themselves for bringing water into the city and on such topics i suppose there is freedom of discussion   june 7thsaturday evening we walked with u and j into the city and looked at the exterior of the duomo with new admiration  since my former view of it i have noticedwhich strangely enough did not strike me beforethat the facade is but a great bare ugly space roughly plastered over with the brickwork peeping through it in spots and a faint almost invisible fresco of colors upon it  this front was once nearly finished with an incrustation of black and white marble like the rest of the edifice but one of the city magistrates benedetto uguccione demolished it three hundred years ago with the idea of building it again in better style  he failed to do so and ever since the magnificence of the great church has been marred by this unsightly roughness of what should have been its richest part nor is there i suppose any hope that it will ever be finished now  the campanile or belltower stands within a few paces of the cathedral but entirely disconnected from it rising to a height of nearly three hundred feet a square tower of light marbles now discolored by time it is impossible to give an idea of the richness of effect produced by its elaborate finish the whole surface of the four sides from top to bottom being decorated with all manner of statuesque and architectural sculpture  it is like a toy of ivory which some ingenious and pious monk might have spent his lifetime in adorning with scriptural designs and figures of saints and when it was finished seeing it so beautiful he prayed that it might be miraculously magnified from the size of one foot to that of three hundred  this idea somewhat satisfies me as conveying an impression how gigantesque the campanile is in its mass and height and how minute and varied in its detail  surely these mediaeval works have an advantage over the classic  they combine the telescope and the microscope  the city was all alive in the summer evening and the streets humming with voices  before the doors of the cafes were tables at which people were taking refreshment and it went to my heart to see a bottle of english ale some of which was poured foaming into a glass at least it had exactly the amber hue and the foam of english bitter ale but perhaps it may have been merely a florentine imitation  as we returned home over the arno crossing the ponte di santa trinita we were struck by the beautiful scene of the broad calm river with the palaces along its shores repeated in it on either side and the neighboring bridges too just as perfect in the tide beneath as in the air abovea city of dream and shadow so close to the actual one  god has a meaning no doubt in putting this spiritual symbol continually beside us  along the river on both sides as far as we could see there was a row of brilliant lamps which in the far distance looked like a cornice of golden light and this also shone as brightly in the rivers depths  the lilies of the evening in the quarter where the sun had gone down were very soft and beautiful though not so gorgeous as thousands that i have seen in america  but i believe i must fairly confess that the italian sky in the daytime is bluer and brighter than our own and that the atmosphere has a quality of showing objects to better advantage  it is more than mere daylight the magic of moonlight is somehow mixed up with it although it is so transparent a medium of light  last evening mr powers called to see us and sat down to talk in a friendly and familiar way  i do not know a man of more facile intercourse nor with whom one so easily gets rid of ceremony  his conversation too is interesting  he talked to begin with about italian food as poultry mutton beef and their lack of savoriness as compared with our own and mentioned an exquisite dish of vegetables which they prepare from squash or pumpkin blossoms likewise another dish which it will be well for us to remember when we get back to the wayside where we are overrun with acacias  it consists of the acaciablossoms in a certain stage of their development fried in oliveoil  i shall get the receipt from mrs powers and mean to deserve well of my country by first trying it and then making it known only i doubt whether american lard or even butter will produce the dish quite so delicately as fresh florence oil  meanwhile i like powers all the better because he does not put his life wholly into marble  we had much talk nevertheless on matters of sculpture for he drank a cup of tea with us and stayed a good while  he passed a condemnatory sentence on classic busts in general saying that they were conventional and not to be depended upon as trite representations of the persons  he particularly excepted none but the bust of caracalla and indeed everybody that has seen this bust must feel the justice of the exception and so be the more inclined to accept his opinion about the rest  there are not more than half a dozenthat of cato the censor among the othersin regard to which i should like to ask his judgment individually  he seems to think the faculty of making a bust an extremely rare one  canova put his own likeness into all the busts he made  greenough could not make a good one nor crawford nor gibson  mr harte he observedan american sculptor now a resident in florenceis the best man of the day for making busts  of course it is to be presumed that he excepts himself but i would not do powers the great injustice to imply that there is the slightest professional jealousy in his estimate of what others have done or are now doing in his own art  if he saw a better man than himself he would recognize him at once and tell the world of him but he knows well enough that in this line there is no better and probably none so good  it would not accord with the simplicity of his character to blink a fact that stands so broadly before him  we asked him what he thought of mr gibsons practice of coloring his statues and he quietly and slyly said that he himself had made wax figures in his earlier days but had left off making them now  in short he objected to the practice wholly and said that a letter of his on the subject had been published in the london athenaeum and had given great offence to some of mr gibsons friends  it appeared to me however that his arguments did not apply quite fairly to the case for he seems to think gibson aims at producing an illusion of life in the statue whereas i think his object is merely to give warmth and softness to the snowy marble and so bring it a little nearer to our hearts and sympathies  even so far nevertheless i doubt whether the practice is defensible and i was glad to see that powers scorned at all events the argument drawn from the use of color by the antique sculptors on which gibson relies so much  it might almost be implied from the contemptuous way in which powers spoke of color that he considers it an impertinence on the face of visible nature and would rather the world had been made without it for he said that everything in intellect or feeling can be expressed as perfectly or more so by the sculptor in colorless marble as by the painter with all the resources of his palette  i asked him whether he could model the face of beatrice cenci from guidos picture so as to retain the subtle expression and he said he could for that the expression depended entirely on the drawing the picture being a badly colored thing  i inquired whether he could model a blush and he said yes and that he had once proposed to an artist to express a blush in marble if he would express it in picture  on consideration i believe one to be as impossible as the other the life and reality of the blush being in its tremulousness coming and going  it is lost in a settled red just as much as in a settled paleness and neither the sculptor nor painter can do more than represent the circumstances of attitude and expression that accompany the blush  there was a great deal of truth in what powers said about this matter of color and in one of our interminable new england winters it ought to comfort us to think how little necessity there is for any hue but that of the snow  mr powers nevertheless had brought us a bunch of beautiful roses and seemed as capable of appreciating their delicate blush as we were  the best thing he said against the use of color in marble was to the effect that the whiteness removed the object represented into a sort of spiritual region and so gave chaste permission to those nudities which would otherwise suggest immodesty  i have myself felt the truth of this in a certain sense of shame as i looked at gibsons tinted venus  he took his leave at about eight oclock being to make a call on the bryants who are at the hotel de new york and also on mrs browning at casa guidi   end of vol i       passages from the french and italian notebooks  of  nathaniel hawthorne   vol  ii     passages from hawthornes notebooks in france and italy     florence continued   june 8thi went this morning to the uffizi gallery  the entrance is from the great court of the palace which communicates with lung arno at one end and with the grand ducal piazza at the other  the gallery is in the upper story of the palace and in the vestibule are some busts of the princes and cardinals of the medici familynone of them beautiful one or two so ugly as to be ludicrous especially one who is all but buried in his own wig  i at first travelled slowly through the whole extent of this long long gallery which occupies the entire length of the palace on both sides of the court and is full of sculpture and pictures  the latter being opposite to the light are not seen to the best advantage but it is the most perfect collection in a chronological series that i have seen comprehending specimens of all the masters since painting began to be an art  here are giotto and cimabue and botticelli and fra angelico and filippo lippi and a hundred others who have haunted me in churches and galleries ever since i have been in italy and who ought to interest me a great deal more than they do  occasionally today i was sensible of a certain degree of emotion in looking at an old picture as for example by a large dark ugly picture of christ hearing the cross and sinking beneath it when somehow or other a sense of his agony and the fearful wrong that mankind did and does its redeemer and the scorn of his enemies and the sorrow of those who loved him came knocking at any heart and got entrance there  once more i deem it a pity that protestantism should have entirely laid aside this mode of appealing to the religious sentiment  i chiefly paid attention to the sculpture and was interested in a long series of busts of the emperors and the members of their families and some of the great men of rome  there is a bust of pompey the great bearing not the slightest resemblance to that vulgar and unintellectual one in the gallery of the capitol altogether a different cast of countenance  i could not judge whether it resembled the face of the statue having seen the latter so imperfectly in the duskiness of the hall of the spada palace  these i presume are the busts which mr powers condemns from internal evidence as unreliable and conventional he may be rightand is far more likely of course to be right than i amyet there certainly seems to be character in these marble faces and they differ as much among themselves as the same number of living faces might  the bust of caracalla however which powers excepted from his censure certainly does give stronger assurance of its being an individual and faithful portrait than any other in the series  all the busts of caracallaof which i have seen manygive the same evidence of their truth and i should like to know what it was in this abominable emperor that made him insist upon having his actual likeness perpetuated with all the ugliness of its animal and moral character  i rather respect him for it and still more the sculptor whose hand methinks must have trembled as he wrought the bust  generally these wicked old fellows and their wicked wives and daughters are not so hideous as we might expect  messalina for instance has small and pretty features though with rather a sensual development of the lower part of the face the busts it seemed to me are usually superior as works of art to those in the capitol and either better preserved or more thoroughly restored the bust of nero might almost be called handsome here though bearing his likeness unmistakably  i wish some competent person would undertake to analyze and develop his character and how and by what necessitywith all his elegant tastes his love of the beautiful his artist naturehe grew to be such a monster  nero has never yet had justice done him nor have any of the wicked emperors not that i suppose them to have been any less monstrous than history represents them but there must surely have been something in their position and circumstances to render the terrible moral disease which seized upon them so generally almost inevitable  a wise and profound man tender and reverent of the human soul and capable of appreciating it in its height and depth has a great field here for the exercise of his powers  it has struck me in reading the history of the italian republics that many of the tyrants who sprung up after the destruction of their liberties resembled the worst of the roman emperors  the subject of nero and his brethren has often perplexed me with vain desires to come at the truth  there were many beautiful specimens of antique ideal sculpture all along the galleryapollos bacchuses venuses mercurys faunswith the general character of all of which i was familiar enough to recognize them at a glance  the mystery and wonder of the gallery however the venus de medici i could nowhere see and indeed was almost afraid to see it for i somewhat apprehended the extinction of another of those lights that shine along a mans pathway and go out in a snuff the instant he comes within eyeshot of the fulfilment of his hopes  my european experience has extinguished many such  i was pretty well contented therefore not to find the famous statue in the whole of my long journey from end to end of the gallery which terminates on the opposite side of the court from that where it commences  the ceiling by the by through the entire length is covered with frescos and the floor paved with a composition of stone smooth and polished like marble  the final piece of sculpture at the end of the gallery is a copy of the laocoon considered very fine  i know not why but it did not impress me with the sense of mighty and terrible reposea repose growing out of the infinitude of trouble that i had felt in the original  parallel with the gallery on both sides of the palacecourt there runs a series of rooms devoted chiefly to pictures although statues and basreliefs are likewise contained in some of them  i remember an unfinished basrelief by michael angelo of a holy family which i touched with my finger because it seemed as if he might have been at work upon it only an hour ago  the pictures i did little more than glance at till i had almost completed again the circuit of the gallery through this series of parallel rooms and then i came upon a collection of french and dutch and flemish masters all of which interested me more than the italian generally  there was a beautiful picture by claude almost as good as those in the british national gallery and very like in subject the sun near the horizon of course and throwing its line of light over the ripple of water with ships at the strand and one or two palaces of stately architecture on the shore  landscapes by rembrandt fat graces and other plump nudities by rubens brass pans and earthen pots and herrings by terriers and other dutchmen none by gerard douw i think but several by mieris all of which were like bread and beef and ale after having been fed too long on made dishes  this is really a wonderful collection of pictures and from first to lastfrom giotto to the men of yesterdaythey are in admirable condition and may be appreciated for all the merit that they ever possessed  i could not quite believe that i was not to find the venus de medici and still as i passed from one room to another my breath rose and fell a little with the halfhope halffear that she might stand before me really i did not know that i cared so much about venus or any possible woman of marble  at last when i had come from among the dutchmen i believe and was looking at some works of italian artists chiefly florentines i caught a glimpse of her through the door of the next room it is the best room of the series octagonal in shape and hung with red damask and the light comes down from a row of windows passing quite round beneath an octagonal dome  the venus stands somewhat aside from the centre of the room and is surrounded by an iron railing a pace or two from her pedestal in front and less behind  i think she might safely be left to the reverence her womanhood would win without any other protection  she is very beautiful very satisfactory and has a fresh and new charm about her unreached by any cast or copy  the line of the marble is just so much mellowed by time as to do for her all that gibson tries or ought to try to do for his statues by color softening her warming her almost imperceptibly making her an inmate of the heart as well as a spiritual existence  i felt a kind of tenderness for her an affection not as if she were one woman but all womanhood in one her modest attitude which before i saw her i had not liked deeming that it might be an artificial shame is partly what unmakes her as the heathen goddess and softens her into woman  there is a slight degree of alarm too in her face not that she really thinks anybody is looking at her yet the idea has flitted through her mind and startled her a little  her face is so beautiful and intellectual that it is not dazzled out of sight by her form  methinks this was a triumph for the sculptor to achieve  i may as well stop here  it is of no use to throw heaps of words upon her for they all fall away and leave her standing in chaste and naked grace as untouched as when i began  she has suffered terribly by the mishaps of her long existence in the marble  each of her legs has been broken into two or three fragments her arms have been severed her body has been broken quite across at the waist her head has been snapped off at the neck  furthermore there have been grievous wounds and losses of substance in various tender parts of her person  but on account of the skill with which the statue has been restored and also because the idea is perfect and indestructible all these injuries do not in the least impair the effect even when you see where the dissevered fragments have been reunited  she is just as whole as when she left the hands of the sculptor  i am glad to have seen this venus and to have found her so tender and so chaste  on the wall of the room and to be taken in at the same glance is a painted venus by titian reclining on a couch naked and lustful  the room of the venus seems to be the treasureplace of the whole uffizi palace containing more pictures by famous masters than are to be found in all the rest of the gallery  there were several by raphael and the room was crowded with the easels of artists  i did not look half enough at anything but merely took a preliminary taste as a prophecy of enjoyment to come  as we were at dinner today at half past three there was a ring at the door and a minute after our servant brought a card  it was mr robert brownings and on it was written in pencil an invitation for us to go to see them this evening  he had left the card and gone away but very soon the bell rang again and he had come back having forgotten to give his address  this time he came in and he shook hands with all of us children and grown people and was very vivacious and agreeable  he looked younger and even handsomer than when i saw him in london two years ago and his gray hairs seemed fewer than those that had then strayed into his youthful head  he talked a wonderful quantity in a little time and told usamong other things that we should never have dreamed ofthat italian people will not cheat you if you construe them generously and put them upon their honor  mr browning was very kind and warm in his expressions of pleasure at seeing us and on our part we were all very glad to meet him  he must be an exceedingly likable man     they are to leave florence very soon and are going to normandy i think he said for the rest of the summer  the venus de medici has a dimple in her chin   june 9thwe went last evening at eight oclock to see the brownings and after some search and inquiry we found the casa guidi which is a palace in a street not very far from our own  it being dusk i could not see the exterior which if i remember browning has celebrated in song at all events mrs browning has called one of her poems casa guidi windows  the street is a narrow one but on entering the palace we found a spacious staircase and ample accommodations of vestibule and hall the latter opening on a balcony where we could hear the chanting of priests in a church close by  browning told us that this was the first church where an oratorio had ever been performed  he came into the anteroom to greet us as did his little boy robert whom they call pennini for fondness  the latter cognomen is a diminutive of apennino which was bestowed upon him at his first advent into the world because he was so very small there being a statue in florence of colossal size called apennino  i never saw such a boy as this before so slender fragile and spiritlikenot as if he were actually in ill health but as if he had little or nothing to do with human flesh and blood  his face is very pretty and most intelligent and exceedingly like his mothers  he is nine years old and seems at once less childlike and less manly than would befit that age  i should not quite like to be the father of such a boy and should fear to stake so much interest and affection on him as he cannot fail to inspire  i wonder what is to become of himwhether he will ever grow to be a manwhether it is desirable that he should  his parents ought to turn their whole attention to making him robust and earthly and to giving him a thicker scabbard to sheathe his spirit in he was born in florence and prides himself on being a florentine and is indeed as unenglish a production as if he were native of another planet  mrs browning met us at the door of the drawingroom and greeted us most kindlya pale small person scarcely embodied at all at any rate only substantial enough to put forth her slender fingers to be grasped and to speak with a shrill yet sweet tenuity of voice  really i do not see how mr browning can suppose that he has an earthly wife any more than an earthly child both are of the elfin race and will flit away from him some day when he least thinks of it  she is a good and kind fairy however and sweetly disposed towards the human race although only remotely akin to it  it is wonderful to see how small she is how pale her cheek how bright and dark her eyes  there is not such another figure in the world and her black ringlets cluster down into her neck and make her face look the whiter by their sable profusion  i could not form any judgment about her age it may range anywhere within the limits of human life or elfin life  when i met her in london at lord houghtons breakfasttable she did not impress me so singularly for the morning light is more prosaic than the dim illumination of their great tapestried drawingroom and besides sitting next to her she did not have occasion to raise her voice in speaking and i was not sensible what a slender voice she has  it is marvellous to me how so extraordinary so acute so sensitive a creature can impress us as she does with the certainty of her benevolence  it seems to me there were a million chances to one that she would have been a miracle of acidity and bitterness  we were not the only guests  mr and mrs e americans recently from the east and on intimate terms with the brownings arrived after us also miss f h an english literary lady whom i have met several times in liverpool and lastly came the white head and palmerlike beard of mr  with his daughter  mr browning was very efficient in keeping up conversation with everybody and seemed to be in all parts of the room and in every group at the same moment a most vivid and quickthoughted person logical and commonsensible as i presume poets generally are in their daily talk  mr  as usual was homely and plain of manner with an oldfashioned dignity nevertheless and a remarkable deference and gentleness of tone in addressing mrs browning  i doubt however whether he has any high appreciation either of her poetry or her husbands and it is my impression that they care as little about his  we had some tea and some strawberries and passed a pleasant evening there was no very noteworthy conversation the most interesting topic being that disagreeable and now wearisome one of spiritual communications as regards which mrs browning is a believer and her husband an infidel  mr  appeared not to have made up his mind on the matter but told a story of a successful communication between cooper the novelist and his sister who had been dead fifty years  browning and his wife had both been present at a spiritual session held by mr hume and had seen and felt the unearthly hands one of which had placed a laurel wreath on mrs brownings head  browning however avowed his belief that these hands were affixed to the feet of mr hume who lay extended in his chair with his legs stretched far under the table  the marvellousness of the fact as i have read of it and heard it from other eyewitnesses melted strangely away in his hearty gripe and at the sharp touch of his logic while his wife ever and anon put in a little gentle word of expostulation  i am rather surprised that brownings conversation should be so clear and so much to the purpose at the moment since his poetry can seldom proceed far without running into the high grass of latent meanings and obscure allusions  mrs brownings health does not permit late hours so we began to take heave at about ten oclock  i heard her ask mr  if he did not mean to revisit europe and heard him answer not uncheerfully taking hold of his white hair it is getting rather too late in the evening now  if any old age can be cheerful i should think his might be so good a man so cool so calm so bright too we may say  his life has been like the days that end in pleasant sunsets  he has a great loss however or what ought to be a great losssoon to be encountered in the death of his wife who i think can hardly live to reach america  he is not eminently an affectionate man  i take him to be one who cannot get closely home to his sorrow nor feel it so sensibly as he gladly would and in consequence of that deficiency the world lacks substance to him it is partly the result perhaps of his not having sufficiently cultivated his emotional nature  his poetry shows it and his personal intercourse though kindly does not stir ones blood in the least  little pennini during the evening sometimes helped the guests to cake and strawberries joined in the conversation when he had anything to say or sat down upon a couch to enjoy his own meditations  he has long curling hair and has not yet emerged from his frock and short hose  it is funny to think of putting him into trousers  his likeness to his mother is strange to behold   june 10thmy wife and i went to the pitti palace today and first entered a court where yesterday she had seen a carpet of flowers arranged for some great ceremony  it must have been a most beautiful sight the pavement of the court being entirely covered by them in a regular pattern of brilliant lines so as really to be a living mosaic this morning however the court had nothing but its usual stones and the show of yesterday seemed so much the more inestimable as having been so evanescent  around the walls of the court there were still some pieces of splendid tapestry which had made part of yesterdays magnificence  we went up the staircase of regally broad and easy ascent and made application to be admitted to see the grandducal apartments  an attendant accordingly took the keys and ushered us first into a great hall with a vaulted ceiling and then through a series of noble rooms with rich frescos above and mosaic floors hung with damask adorned with gilded chandeliers and glowing in short with more gorgeousness than i could have imagined beforehand or can now remember in many of the rooms were those superb antique cabinets which i admire more than any other furniture ever invented only these were of unexampled art and glory inlaid with precious stones and with beautiful florentine mosaics both of flowers and landscapeseach cabinet worth a lifetimes toil to make it and the cost a whole palace to pay for it many of the rooms were covered with arras of landscapes huntingscenes mythological subjects or historical scenes equal to pictures in truth of representation and possessing an indescribable richness that makes them preferable as a mere adornment of princely halls and chambers  some of the rooms as i have said were laid in mosaic of stone and marble otherwise in lovely patterns of various woods others were covered with carpets delightful to tread upon and glowing like the living floor of flowers which my wife saw yesterday  there were tables too of florentine mosaic the mere materials of whichlapis lazuli malachite pearl and a hundred other precious thingswere worth a fortune and made a thousand times more valuable by the artistic skill of the manufacturer  i toss together brilliant words by the handful and make a rude sort of patchwork but can record no adequate idea of what i saw in this suite of rooms and the taste the subdued splendor so that it did not shine too high but was all tempered into an effect at once grand and softthis was quite as remarkable as the gorgeous material  i have seen a very dazzling effect produced in the principal cabin of an american clippership quite opposed to this in taste  after making the circuit of the grandducal apartments we went into a door in the left wing of the palace and ascended a narrow flight of stairsseveral tortuous flights indeedto the picturegallery  it fills a great many stately halls which themselves are well worth a visit for the architecture and frescos only these matters become commonplace after travelling through a mile or two of them  the collection of picturesas well for their number as for the celebrity and excellence of many of themis the most interesting that i have seen and i do not yet feel in a condition nor perhaps ever shall to speak of a single one it gladdened my very heart to find that they were not darkened out of sight nor apparently at all injured by time but were well kept and varnished brilliantly framed and no doubt restored by skilful touches if any of them needed it  the artists and amateurs may say what they like for my part i know no drearier feeling than that inspired by a ruined pictureruined that is by time damp or rough treatmentand i would a thousand times rather an artist should do his best towards reviving it than have it left in such a condition  i do not believe however that these pictures have been sacrilegiously interfered with at all events i saw in the masterpieces no touch but what seemed worthy of the masterhand  the most beautiful picture in the world i am convinced is raphaels madonna della seggiola  i was familiar with it in a hundred engravings and copies and therefore it shone upon one as with a familiar beauty though infinitely more divine than i had ever seen it before  an artist was copying it and producing certainly something very like a facsimile yet leaving out as a matter of course that mysterious something that renders the picture a miracle  it is my present opinion that the pictorial art is capable of something more like magic more wonderful and inscrutable in its methods than poetry or any other mode of developing the beautiful  but how does this accord with what i have been saying only a minute ago  how then can the decayed picture of a great master ever be restored by the touches of an inferior hand  doubtless it never can be restored but let some devoted worshipper do his utmost and the whole inherent spirit of the divine picture may pervade his restorations likewise  i saw the three fates of michael angelo which were also being copied as were many other of the best pictures  miss fanny howorth whom i met in the gallery told me that to copy the madonna della seggiola application must be made five years beforehand so many are the artists who aspire to copy it  michael angelos fates are three very grim and pitiless old women who respectively spin hold and cut the thread of human destiny all in a mood of sombre gloom but with no more sympathy than if they had nothing to do with us  i remember seeing an etching of this when i was a child and being struck even then with the terrible stern passionless severity neither loving us nor hating us that characterizes these ugly old women  if they were angry or had the least spite against human kind it would render them the more tolerable  they are a great work containing and representing the very idea that makes a belief in fate such a cold torture to the human soul  god give me the sure belief in his providence  in a years time with the advantage of access to this magnificent gallery i think i might come to have some little knowledge of pictures at present i still know nothing but am glad to find myself capable at least of loving one picture better than another  i cannot always keep the heights i gain however and after admiring and being moved by a picture one day it is within my experience to look at it the next as little moved as if it were a tavernsign  it is pretty much the same with statuary the same too with those pictured windows of the duomo which i described so rapturously a few days ago  i looked at them again the next morning and thought they would have been hardly worthy of my eulogium even had all the separate windows of the cathedral combined their narrow lights into one grand resplendent manycolored arch at the eastern end  it is a pity they are so narrow  england has many a great chancelwindow that though dimmer in its hues dusty and perhaps made up of heterogeneous fragments eclipses these by its spacious breadth  from the gallery i went into the boboli gardens which are contiguous to the palace but found them too sunny for enjoyment  they seem to consist partly of a wilderness but the portion into which i strayed was laid out with straight walks lined with high boxhedges along which there was only a narrow margin of shade  i saw an amphitheatre with a wide sweep of marble seat around it enclosing a grassy space where doubtless the medici may have witnessed splendid spectacles   june 11thi paid another visit to the uffizi gallery this morning and found that the venus is one of the things the charm of which does not diminish on better acquaintance  the world has not grown weary of her in all these ages and mortal man may look on her with new delight from infancy to old age and keep the memory of her i should imagine as one of the treasures of spiritual existence hereafter  surely it makes me more ready to believe in the high destinies of the human race to think that this beautiful form is but natures plan for all womankind and that the nearer the actual woman approaches it the more natural she is  i do not and cannot think of her as a senseless image but as a being that lives to gladden the world incapable of decay and death as young and fair today as she was three thousand years ago and still to be young and fair as long as a beautiful thought shall require physical embodiment  i wonder how any sculptor has had the impertinence to aim at any other presentation of female beauty  i mean no disrespect to gibson or powers or a hundred other men who people the world with nudities all of which are abortions as compared with her but i think the world would be all the richer if their venuses their greek slaves their eves were burnt into quicklime leaving us only this statue as our image of the beautiful  i observed today that the eyes of the statue are slightly hollowed out in a peculiar way so as to give them a look of depth and intelligence  she is a miracle  the sculptor must have wrought religiously and have felt that something far beyond his own skill was working through his hands  i mean to leave off speaking of the venus hereafter in utter despair of saying what i wish especially as the contemplation of the statue will refine and elevate my taste and make it continually more difficult to express my sense of its excellence as the perception of it grows upon one  if at any time i become less sensible of it it will be my deterioration not any defect in the statue  i looked at many of the pictures and found myself in a favorable mood for enjoying them  it seems to me that a work of art is entitled to credit for all that it makes us feel in our best moments and we must judge of its merits by the impression it then makes and not by the coldness and insensibility of our less genial moods  after leaving the uffizi palace     i went into the museum of natural history near the pitti palace  it is a very good collection of almost everything that nature has madeor exquisite copies of what she has madestones shells vegetables insects fishes animals man the greatest wonders of the museum being some models in wax of all parts of the human frame  it is good to have the wholeness and summedup beauty of woman in the memory when looking at the details of her system as here displayed for these last to the natural eye are by no means beautiful but they are what belong only to our mortality  the beauty that makes them invisible is our immortal type which we shall take away with us under glass cases there were some singular and horribly truthful representations in small wax figures of a time of pestilence the hasty burial or tossing into one common sepulchre of discolored corpsesa very ugly piece of work indeed  i think murray says that these things were made for the grand duke cosmo and if so they do him no credit indicating something dark and morbid in his character   june 13thwe called at the powerss yesterday morning to leave r there for an hour or two to play with the children and it being not yet quite time for the pitti palace we stopped into the studio  soon mr powers made his appearance in his dressinggown and slippers and sculptors cap smoking a cigar     he was very cordial and pleasant as i have always found him and began immediately to be communicative about his own works or any other subject that came up there were two casts of the venus de medici in the rooms which he said were valuable in a commercial point of view being genuine casts from the mould taken from the statue  he then gave us a quite unexpected but most interesting lecture on the venus demonstrating it as he proceeded by reference to the points which he criticised  the figure he seemed to allow was admirable though i think he hardly classes it so high as his own greek slave or eva but the face he began with saying was that of an idiot  then leaning on the pedestal of the cast he continued it is rather a bold thing to say isnt it that the sculptor of the venus de medici did not know what he was about  truly it appeared to me so but powers went on remorselessly and showed in the first place that the eye was not like any eye that nature ever made and indeed being examined closely and abstracted from the rest of the face it has a very queer lookless like a human eye than a halfworn buttonhole  then he attacked the ear which he affirmed and demonstrated was placed a good deal too low on the head thereby giving an artificial and monstrous height to the portion of the head above it the forehead met with no better treatment in his hands and as to the mouth it was altogether wrong as well in its general make as in such niceties as the junction of the skin of the lips to the common skin around them  in a word the poor face was battered all to pieces and utterly demolished nor was it possible to doubt or question that it fell by its own demerits  all that could be urged in its defenceand even that i did not urgebeing that this very face had affected me only the day before with a sense of higher beauty and intelligence than i had ever then received from sculpture and that its expression seemed to accord with that of the whole figure as if it were the sweetest note of the same music  there must be something in this the sculptor disregarded technicalities and the imitation of actual nature the better to produce the effect which he really does produce in somewhat the same way as a painter works his magical illusions by touches that have no relation to the truth if looked at from the wrong point of view but powers considers it certain that the antique sculptor had bestowed all his care on the study of the human figure and really did not know how to make a face  i myself used to think that the face was a much less important thing with the greeks among whom the entire beauty of the form was familiarly seen than with ourselves who allow no other nudity  after annihilating the poor visage powers showed us his two busts of proserpine and psyche and continued his lecture by showing the truth to nature with which these are modelled  i freely acknowledge the fact there is no sort of comparison to be made between the beauty intelligence feeling and accuracy of representation in these two faces and in that of the venus de medici  a lightthe light of a soul proper to each individual characterseems to shine from the interior of the marble and beam forth from the features chiefly from the eyes  still insisting upon the eye and hitting the poor venus another and another and still another blow on that unhappy feature mr powers turned up and turned inward and turned outward his own titanic orbthe biggest by far that ever i saw in mortal headand made us see and confess that there was nothing right in the venus and everything right in psyche and proserpine  to say the truth their marble eyes have life and placing yourself in the proper position towards them you can meet their glances and feel them mingle with your own  powers is a great man and also a tender and delicate one massive and rude of surface as he looks and it is rather absurd to feel how he impressed his auditor for the time being with his own evident idea that nobody else is worthy to touch marble  mr b told me that powers has had many difficulties on professional grounds as i understood him and with his brother artists no wonder  he has said enough in my hearing to put him at swords points with sculptors of every epoch and every degree between the two inclusive extremes of phidias and clark mills  he has a bust of the reigning grand duchess of tuscany who sat to him for it  the bust is that of a noblelooking lady and powers remarked that royal personages have a certain look that distinguishes them from other people and is seen in individuals of no lower rank  they all have it the queen of england and prince albert have it and so likewise has every other royalty although the possession of this kingly look implies nothing whatever as respects kingly and commanding qualities  he said that none of our public men whatever authority they may have held or for whatever length of time possess this look but he added afterwards that washington had it  commanders of armies sometimes have it but not in the degree that royal personages do  it is as well as i could make out powerss idea a certain coldness of demeanor and especially of eye that surrounds them with an atmosphere through which the electricity of human brotherhood cannot pass  from their youth upward they are taught to feel themselves apart from the rest of mankind and this manner becomes a second nature to them in consequence and as a safeguard to their conventional dignity  they put themselves under glass as it were the illustration is my own so that though you see them and see them looking no more noble and dignified than other mortals nor so much so as many still they keep themselves within a sort of sanctity and repel you by an invisible barrier  even if they invite you with a show of warmth and hospitality you cannot get through  i too recognize this look in the portraits of washington in him a mild benevolent coldness and apartness but indicating that formality which seems to have been deeper in him than in any other mortal and which built up an actual fortification between himself and human sympathy  i wish for once washington could come out of his envelopment and show us what his real dimensions were  among other models of statues heretofore made powers showed us one of melancholy or rather of contemplation from miltons penseroso a female figure with uplifted face and rapt look communing with the skies  it is very fine and goes deeply into miltons thought but as far as the outward form and action are concerned i remember seeing a rude engraving in my childhood that probably suggested the idea  it was prefixed to a cheap american edition of miltons poems and was probably as familiar to powers as to myself  it is very remarkable how difficult it seems to be to strike out a new attitude in sculpture a new group or a new single figure  one piece of sculpture powers exhibited however which was very exquisite and such as i never saw before  opening a desk he took out something carefully enclosed between two layers of cottonwool on removing which there appeared a little babys hand most delicately represented in the whitest marble all the dimples where the knuckles were to be all the creases in the plump flesh every infantine wrinkle of the soft skin being lovingly recorded  the critics condemn minute representation said powers but you may look at this through a microscope and see if it injures the general effect  nature herself never made a prettier or truer little hand  it was the hand of his daughterlulys hand powers called itthe same that gave my own such a frank and friendly grasp when i first met luly  the sculptor made it only for himself and his wife but so many people he said had insisted on having a copy that there are now forty scattered about the world  at sixty years luly ought to have her hand sculptured again and give it to her grandchildren with the babys hand of five months old the babyhand that had done nothing and felt only its mothers kiss the old ladys hand that had exchanged the lovepressure worn the marriagering closed dead eyesdone a lifetimes work in short  the sentiment is rather obvious but true nevertheless  before we went away powers took us into a room apartapparently the secretest room he hadand showed us some tools and machinery all of his own contrivance and invention  you see i am a bit of a yankee he observed  this machinery is chiefly to facilitate the process of modelling his works forexcept in portraitbustshe makes no clay model as other sculptors do but models directly in the plaster so that instead of being crumbled like clay the original model remains a permanent possession  he has also invented a certain open file which is of great use in finishing the surface of the marble and likewise a machine for making these files and for punching holes through iron and he demonstrated its efficiency by punching a hole through an iron bar with a force equivalent to ten thousand pounds by the mere application of a part of his own weight  these inventions he says are his amusement and the bent of his nature towards sculpture must indeed have been strong to counteract in an american such a capacity for the contrivance of steamengines      i had no idea of filling so many pages of this journal with the sayings and characteristics of mr powers but the man and his talk are fresh original and full of bone and muscle and i enjoy him much  we now proceeded to the pitti palace and spent several hours pleasantly in its saloons of pictures  i never enjoyed pictures anywhere else as i do in florence  there is an admirable judith in this gallery by allori a face of great beauty and depth and her hand clutches the head of holofernes by the hair in a way that startles the spectator  there are two peasant madonnas by murillo simple women yet with a thoughtful sense of some high mystery connected with the baby in their arms  raphael grows upon me several other famous paintersguido for instanceare fading out of my mind  salvator rosa has two really wonderful landscapes looking from the shore seaward and rubens too likewise on a large scale of mountain and plain  it is very idle and foolish to talk of pictures yet after poring over them and into them it seems a pity to let all the thought excited by them pass into nothingness  the copyists of pictures are very numerous both in the pitti and uffizi galleries and unlike sculptors they appear to be on the best of terms with one another chatting sociably exchanging friendly criticism and giving their opinions as to the best mode of attaining the desired effects  perhaps as mere copyists they escape the jealousy that might spring up between rival painters attempting to develop original ideas miss howorth says that the business of copying pictures especially those of raphael is a regular profession and she thinks it exceedingly obstructive to the progress or existence of a modern school of painting there being a regular demand and sure sale for all copies of the old masters at prices proportioned to their merit whereas the effort to be original insures nothing except long neglect at the beginning of a career and probably ultimate failure and the necessity of becoming a copyist at last  some artists employ themselves from youth to age in nothing else but the copying of one single and selfsame picture by raphael and grow at last to be perfectly mechanical making i suppose the same identical stroke of the brush in fifty successive pictures  the weather is very hot nowhotter in the sunshine i think than a midsummer day usually is in america but with rather a greater possibility of being comfortable in the shade  the nights too are warm and the bats fly forth at dusk and the fireflies quite light up the green depths of our little garden  the atmosphere or something else causes a sort of alacrity in my mind and an affluence of ideas such as they are but it does not thereby make me the happier  i feel an impulse to be at work but am kept idle by the sense of being unsettled with removals to be gone through over and over again before i can shut myself into a quiet room of my own and turn the key  i need monotony too an eventless exterior life before i can live in the world within   june 15thyesterday we went to the uffizi gallery and of course i took the opportunity to look again at the venus de medici after powerss attack upon her face  some of the defects he attributed to her i could not see in the statue for instance the ear appeared to be in accordance with his own rule the lowest part of it being about in a straight line with the upper lip  the eyes must be given up as not when closely viewed having the shape the curve outwards the formation of the lids that eyes ought to have but still at a proper distance they seemed to have intelligence in them beneath the shadow cast by the brow  i cannot help thinking that the sculptor intentionally made every feature what it is and calculated them all with a view to the desired effect  whatever rules may be transgressed it is a noble and beautiful facemore so perhaps than if all rules had been obeyed  i wish powers would do his best to fit the venuss figure which he does not deny to be admirable with a face which he would deem equally admirable and in accordance with the sentiment of the form  we looked pretty thoroughly through the gallery and i saw many pictures that impressed me but among such a multitude with only one poor mind to take note of them the stamp of each new impression helps to obliterate a former one  i am sensible however that a process is going on and has been ever since i came to italy that puts me in a state to see pictures with less toil and more pleasure and makes me more fastidious yet more sensible of beauty where i saw none before  it is the sign i presume of a taste still very defective that i take singular pleasure in the elaborate imitations of van mieris gerard douw and other old dutch wizards who painted such brass pots that you can see your face in them and such earthen pots that they will surely hold water and who spent weeks and months in turning a foot or two of canvas into a perfect microscopic illusion of some homely scene  for my part i wish raphael had painted the transfiguration in this style at the same time preserving his breadth and grandeur of design nor do i believe that there is any real impediment to the combination of the two styles except that no possible space of human life could suffice to cover a quarter part of the canvas of the transfiguration with such touches as gerard douws  but one feels the vast scope of this wonderful art when we think of two excellences so far apart as that of this last painter and raphael  i pause a good while too before the dutch paintings of fruit and flowers where tulips and roses acquire an immortal bloom and grapes have kept the freshest juice in them for two or three hundred years often in these pictures there is a birdsnest every straw perfectly represented and the stray feather or the down that the motherbird plucked from her bosom with the three or four small speckled eggs that seem as if they might be yet warm  these pretty miracles have their use in assuring us that painters really can do something that takes hold of us in our most matteroffact moods whereas the merits of the grander style of art may be beyond our ordinary appreciation and leave us in doubt whether we have not befooled ourselves with a false admiration  until we learn to appreciate the cherubs and angels that raphael scatters through the blessed air in a picture of the nativity it is not amiss to look at a dutch fly settling on a peach or a bumblebee burying himself in a flower  it is another token of imperfect taste no doubt that queer pictures and absurd pictures remain in my memory when better ones pass away by the score  there is a picture of venus combing her son cupids head with a smalltooth comb and looking with maternal care among his curls this i shall not forget  likewise a picture of a broad rubicund judith by bardonea widow of fifty of an easy lymphatic cheerful temperament who has just killed holofernes and is as selfcomplacent as if she had been carving a goose  what could possibly have stirred up this pudding of a woman unless it were a puddingstick to do such a deed  i looked with much pleasure at an ugly old fat jolly bacchus astride on a barrel by rubens the most natural and lifelike representation of a tipsy rotundity of flesh that it is possible to imagine  and sometimes amid these sensual images i caught the divine pensiveness of a madonnas face by raphael or the glory and majesty of the babe jesus in her arm with his father shining through him  this is a sort of revelation whenever it comes  this morning immediately after breakfast i walked into the city meaning to make myself better acquainted with its appearance and to go into its various churches but it soon grew so hot that i turned homeward again  the interior of the duomo was deliciously cool to be surecool and dim after the whitehot sunshine but an old woman began to persecute me so that i came away  a male beggar drove me out of another church and i took refuge in the street where the beggar and i would have been two cinders together if we had stood long enough on the sunny sidewalk  after my five summers experience of england i may have forgotten what hot weather is but it does appear to me that an american summer is not so fervent as this  besides the direct rays the white pavement throws a furnaceheat up into ones face the shady margin of the street is barely tolerable but it is like going through the ordeal of fire to cross the broad bright glare of an open piazza  the narrow streets prove themselves a blessing at this season except when the sun looks directly into them the broad eaves of the houses too make a selvage of shade almost always  i do not know what becomes of the streetmerchants at the noontide of these hot days  they form a numerous class in florence displaying their wareslinen or cotton cloth threads combs and all manner of haberdasheryon movable counters that are borne about on wheels  in the shady morning you see a whole side of a street in a piazza occupied by them all offering their merchandise at full cry  they dodge as they can from shade to shade but at last the sunshine floods the whole space and they seem to have melted away leaving not a rag of themselves or what they dealt in  cherries are very abundant now and have been so ever since we came here in the markets and all about the streets  they are of various kinds some exceedingly large insomuch that it is almost necessary to disregard the old proverb about making two bites of a cherry  fresh figs are already spoken of though i have seen none but i saw some peaches this morning looking as if they might be ripe   june 16thmr and mrs powers called to see us last evening  mr powers as usual was full of talk and gave utterance to a good many instructive and entertaining ideas  as one instance of the little influence the religion of the italians has upon their morals he told a story of one of his servants who desired leave to set up a small shrine of the virgin in their rooma cheap print or basrelief or image such as are sold everywhere at the shops and to burn a lamp before it she engaging of course to supply the oil at her own expense  by and by her oilflask appeared to possess a miraculous property of replenishing itself and mr powers took measures to ascertain where the oil came from  it turned out that the servant had all the time been stealing the oil from them and keeping up her daily sacrifice and worship to the virgin by this constant theft  his talk soon turned upon sculpture and he spoke once more of the difficulty imposed upon an artist by the necessity of clothing portrait statues in the modern costume  i find that he does not approve either of nudity or of the roman toga for a modern statue neither does he think it right to shirk the difficultyas chantrey did in the case of washington by enveloping him in a cloak but acknowledges the propriety of taking the actual costume of the age and doing his best with it  he himself did so with his own washington and also with a statue that he made of daniel webster  i suggested that though this costume might not appear ridiculous to us now yet two or three centuries hence it would create to the people of that day an impossibility of seeing the real man through the absurdity of his envelopment after it shall have entirely grown out of fashion and remembrance and webster would seem as absurd to them then as he would to us now in the masquerade of some bygone day  it might be well therefore to adopt some conventional costume never actual but always graceful and noble  besides webster for example had other costumes than that which he wore in public and perhaps it was in those that he lived his most real life his dressinggown his drapery of the night the dress that he wore on his fishingexcursions in these other costumes he spent three fourths of his time and most probably was thus arrayed when he conceived the great thoughts that afterwards in some formal and outside mood he gave forth to the public  i scarcely think i was right but am not sure of the contrary  at any rate i know that i should have felt much more sure that i knew the real webster if i had seen him in any of the abovementioned dresses than either in his swallowtailed coat or frock  talking of a taste for painting and sculpture powers observed that it was something very different and quite apart from the moral sense and that it was often perhaps generally possessed by unprincipled men of ability and cultivation  i have had this perception myself  a genuine love of painting and sculpture and perhaps of music seems often to have distinguished men capable of every social crime and to have formed a fine and hard enamel over their characters  perhaps it is because such tastes are artificial the product of cultivation and when highly developed imply a great remove from natural simplicity  this morning i went with u to the uffizi gallery and again looked with more or less attention at almost every picture and statue  i saw a little picture of the golden age by zucchero in which the charms of youths and virgins are depicted with a freedom that this iron age can hardly bear to look at  the cabinet of gems happened to be open for the admission of a privileged party and we likewise went in and saw a brilliant collection of goldsmiths work among which no doubt were specimens from such hands as benvenuto cellini  little busts with diamond eyes boxes of gems cups carved out of precious material crystal vases beautifully chased and engraved and sparkling with jewels great pearls in the midst of rubies opals rich with all manner of lovely lights  i remember benvenuto cellini in his memoirs speaks of manufacturing such playthings as these  i observed another characteristic of the summer streets of florence today tables movable to and fro on wheels and set out with cool iced drinks and cordials   june 17thmy wife and i went this morning to the academy of fine arts and on our way thither went into the duomo where we found a deliciously cool twilight through which shone the mild gleam of the painted windows  i cannot but think it a pity that st peters is not lighted by such windows as these although i by no means saw the glory in them now that i have spoken of in a record of my former visit  we found out the monument of giotto a tablet and portrait in basrelief on the wall near the entrance of the cathedral on the right hand also a representation in fresco of a knight on horseback the memorial of one john rawkwood close by the door to the left  the priests were chanting a service of some kind or other in the choir terribly inharmonious and out of tune      on reaching the academy the soldier or policeman at the entrance directed us into the large hall the walls of which were covered on both sides with pictures arranged as nearly as possible in a progressive series with reference to the date of the painters so that here the origin and procession of the art may be traced through the course of at least two hundred years  giotto cimabue and others of unfamiliar names to me are among the earliest and except as curiosities i should never desire to look once at them nor think of looking twice  they seem to have been executed with great care and conscientiousness and the heads are often wrought out with minuteness and fidelity and have so much expression that they tell their own story clearly enough but it seems not to have been the painters aim to effect a lifelike illusion the background and accessories being conventional  the trees are no more like real trees than the feather of a pen and there is no perspective the figure of the picture being shadowed forth on a surface of burnished gold  the effect when these pictures some of them very large were new and freshly gilded must have been exceedingly brilliant and much resembling on an immensely larger scale the rich illuminations in an old monkish missal  in fact we have not now in pictorial ornament anything at all comparable to what their splendor must have been  i was most struck with a picture by fabriana gentile of the adoration of the magi where the faces and figures have a great deal of life and action and even grace and where the jewelled crowns the rich embroidered robes and cloth of gold and all the magnificence of the three kings are represented with the vividness of the real thing a gold swordhilt for instance or a pair of gold spurs being actually embossed on the picture  the effect is very powerful and though produced in what modern painters would pronounce an unjustifiable way there is yet pictorial art enough to reconcile it to the spectators mind  certainly the people of the middle ages knew better than ourselves what is magnificence and how to produce it and what a glorious work must that have been both in its mere sheen of burnished gold and in its illuminating art which shines thus through the gloom of perhaps four centuries  fra angelico is a man much admired by those who have a taste for preraphaelite painters and though i take little or no pleasure in his works i can see that there is great delicacy of execution in his heads and that generally he produces such a christ and such a virgin and such saints as he could not have foreseen except in a pure and holy imagination nor have wrought out without saying a prayer between every two touches of his brush  i might come to like him in time if i thought it worth while but it is enough to have an outside perception of his kind and degree of merit and so to let him pass into the garret of oblivion where many things as good or better are piled away that our own age may not stumble over them  perugino is the first painter whose works seem really worth preserving for the genuine merit that is in them apart from any quaintness and curiosity of an ancient and newborn art probably his religion was more genuine than raphaels and therefore the virgin often revealed herself to him in a loftier and sweeter face of divine womanhood than all the genius of raphael could produce  there is a crucifixion by him in this gallery which made me partly feel as if i were a faroff spectatorno i did not mean a crucifixion but a picture of christ dead lying with a calm sweet face on his mothers knees a pieta  the most inadequate and utterly absurd picture here or in any other gallery is a head of the eternal father by carlo dolce it looks like a feeble saint on the eve of martyrdom and very doubtful how he shall be able to bear it very finely and prettily painted nevertheless  after getting through the principal gallery we went into a smaller room in which are contained a great many small specimens of the old tuscan artists among whom fra angelico makes the principal figure  these pictures are all on wood and seem to have been taken from the shrines and altars of ancient churches they are predellas and triptychs or pictures on three folding tablets shaped quaintly in gothic peaks or arches and still gleaming with backgrounds of antique gold  the wood is much wormeaten and the colors have often faded or changed from what the old artists meant then to be a bright angel darkening into what looks quite as much like the devil  in one of fra angelicos picturesa representation of the last judgmenthe has tried his saintly hand at making devils indeed and showing them busily at work tormenting the poor damned souls in fifty ghastly ways  above sits jesus with the throng of blessed saints around him and a flow of tender and powerful love in his own face that ought to suffice to redeem all the damned and convert the very fiends and quench the fires of hell  at any rate fra angelico had a higher conception of his saviour than michael angelo   june 19ththis forenoon we have been to the church of st lorenzo which stands on the site of an ancient basilica and was itself built more than four centuries ago  the facade is still an ugly height of rough brickwork as is the case with the duomo and i think some other churches in florence the design of giving them an elaborate and beautiful finish having been delayed from cycle to cycle till at length the day for spending mines of wealth on churches is gone by  the interior had a nave with a flat roof divided from the side aisles by corinthian pillars and at the farther end a raised space around the high altar  the pavement is a mosaic of squares of black and white marble the squares meeting one another cornerwise the pillars pilasters and other architectural material is dark brown or grayish stone and the general effect is very sombre especially as the church is somewhat dimly lighted and as the shrines along the aisles and the statues and the monuments of whatever kind look dingy with time and neglect  the nave is thickly set with wooden seats brown and worn what pictures there are in the shrines and chapels are dark and faded on the whole the edifice has a shabby aspect  on each side of the high altar elevated on four pillars of beautiful marble is what looks like a great sarcophagus of bronze  they are in fact pulpits and are ornamented with mediaeval basreliefs representing scenes in the life of our saviour  murray says that the restingplace of the first cosmo de medici the old banker who so managed his wealth as to get the posthumous title of father of his country and to make his posterity its reigning princesis in front of the high altar marked by red and green porphyry and marble inlaid into the pavement  we looked but could not see it there  there were worshippers at some of the shrines and persons sitting here and there along the nave and in the aisles rapt in devotional thought doubtless and sheltering themselves here from the white sunshine of the piazzas  in the vicinity of the choir and the high altar workmen were busy repairing the church or perhaps only making arrangements for celebrating the great festival of st john  on the left hand of the choir is what is called the old sacristy with the peculiarities or notabilities of which i am not acquainted  on the right hand is the new sacristy otherwise called the capella dei depositi or chapel of the buried built by michael angelo to contain two monuments of the medici family  the interior is of somewhat severe and classic architecture the walls and pilasters being of dark stone and surmounted by a dome beneath which is a row of windows quite round the building throwing their light down far beneath upon niches of white marble  these niches are ranged entirely around the chapel and might have sufficed to contain more than all the medici monuments that the world would ever care to have  only two of these niches are filled however  in one of them sits giuliano de medici sculptured by michael angeloa figure of dignity which would perhaps be very striking in any other presence than that of the statue which occupies the corresponding niche  at the feet of giuliano recline two allegorical statues day and night whose meaning there i do not know and perhaps michael angelo knew as little  as the great sculptors statues are apt to do they fling their limbs abroad with adventurous freedom  below the corresponding niche on the opposite side of the chapel recline two similar statues representing morning and evening sufficiently like day and night to be their brother and sister all in truth having sprung from the same father      but the statue that sits above these two latter allegories morning and evening is like no other that ever came from a sculptors hand  it is the one work worthy of michael angelos reputation and grand enough to vindicate for him all the genius that the world gave him credit for  and yet it seems a simple thing enough to think of or to execute merely a sitting figure the face partly overshadowed by a helmet one hand supporting the chin the other resting on the thigh  but after looking at it a little while the spectator ceases to think of it as a marble statue it comes to life and you see that the princely figure is brooding over some great design which when he has arranged in his own mind the world will be fain to execute for him  no such grandeur and majesty has elsewhere been put into human shape  it is all a miracle the deep repose and the deep life within it  it is as much a miracle to have achieved this as to make a statue that would rise up and walk  the face when one gazes earnestly into it beneath the shadow of its helmet is seen to be calmly sombre a mood which i think is generally that of the rulers of mankind except in moments of vivid action  this statue is one of the things which i look at with highest enjoyment but also with grief and impatience because i feel that i do not come at all which it involves and that by and by i must go away and leave it forever  how wonderful  to take a block of marble and convert it wholly into thought and to do it through all the obstructions and impediments of drapery for there is nothing nude in this statue but the face and hands the vest is the costume of michael angelos century  this is what i always thought a sculptor of true genius should be able to doto show the man of whatever epoch nobly and heroically through the costume which he might actually have worn  the statue sits within a square niche of white marble and completely fills it  it seems to me a pity that it should be thus confined  at the crystal palace if i remember the effect is improved by a free surrounding space  its naturalness is as if it came out of the marble of its own accord with all its grandeur hanging heavily about it and sat down there beneath its weight  i cannot describe it  it is like trying to stop the ghost of hamlets father by crossing spears before it  communicating with the sacristy is the medicean chapel which was built more than two centuries ago for the reception of the holy sepulchre arrangements having been made about that time to steal this most sacred relic from the turks  the design failing the chapel was converted by cosmo ii into a place of sepulture for the princes of his family  it is a very grand and solemn edifice octagonal in shape with a lofty dome within which is a series of brilliant frescos painted not more than thirty years ago  these pictures are the only portion of the adornment of the chapel which interferes with the sombre beauty of the general effect for though the walls are incrusted from pavement to dome with marbles of inestimable cost and it is a florentine mosaic on a grander scale than was ever executed elsewhere the result is not gaudy as in many of the roman chapels but a dark and melancholy richness  the architecture strikes me as extremely fine each alternate side of the octagon being an arch rising as high as the cornice of the lofty dome and forming the frame of a vast niche  all the dead princes no doubt according to the general design were to have been honored with statues within this stately mausoleum but only twothose of ferdinand i and cosmo iiseem to have been placed here  they were a bad breed and few of them deserved any better monument than a dunghill and yet they have this grand chapel for the family at large and yonder grand statue for one of its most worthless members  i am glad of it and as for the statue michael angelo wrought it through the efficacy of a kingly idea which had no reference to the individual whose name it bears  in the piazza adjoining the church is a statue of the first cosmo the old banker in roman costume seated and looking like a man fit to hold authority  no i mistake the statue is of john de medici the father of cosmo and himself no banker but a soldier   june 21styesterday after dinner we went with the two eldest children to the boboli gardens     we entered by a gate nearer to our house than that by the pitti palace and found ourselves almost immediately among embowered walks of box and shrubbery and little wildernesses of trees with here and there a seat under an arbor and a marble statue gray with ancient weatherstains  the site of the garden is a very uneven surface and the paths go upward and downward and ascend at their ultimate point to a base of what appears to be a fortress commanding the city  a good many of the florentines were rambling about the gardens like ourselves little parties of schoolboys fathers and mothers with their youthful progeny young men in couples looking closely into every female face lovers with a maid or two attendant on the young lady  all appeared to enjoy themselves especially the children dancing on the esplanades or rolling down the slopes of the hills and the loving pairs whom it was rather embarrassing to come upon unexpectedly sitting together on the stone seat of an arbor with clasped hands a passionate solemnity in the young mans face and a downcast pleasure in the ladys  policemen in cocked hats and epaulets crossbelts and swords were scattered about the grounds but interfered with nobody though they seemed to keep an eye on all  a sentinel stood in the hot sunshine looking down over the garden from the ramparts of the fortress  for my part in this foreign country i have no objection to policemen or any other minister of authority though i remember in america i had an innate antipathy to constables and always sided with the mob against law  this was very wrong and foolish considering that i was one of the sovereigns but a sovereign or any number of sovereigns or the twentymillionth part of a sovereign does not love to find himself as an american must included within the delegated authority of his own servants  there is a sheet of water somewhere in the boboli gardens inhabited by swans but this we did not see  we found a smaller pond however set in marble and surrounded by a parapet and alive with a multitude of fish  there were minnows by the thousand and a good many goldfish and j who had brought some bread to feed the swans threw in handfuls of crumbs for the benefit of these finny people  they seemed to be accustomed to such courtesies on the part of visitors and immediately the surface of the water was blackened at the spot where each crumb fell with shoals of minnows thrusting one another even above the surface in their eagerness to snatch it  within the depths of the pond the yellowishgreen waterits hue being precisely that of the arno would be reddened duskily with the larger bulk of two or three goldfishes who finally poked their great snouts up among the minnows but generally missed the crumb  beneath the circular margin of the pond there are little arches into the shelter of which the fish retire when the noonday sun burns straight down into their dark waters  we went on through the gardenpaths shadowed quite across by the high walls of box and reached an esplanade whence we had a good view of florence with the bare brown ridges on the northern side of the arno and glimpses of the river itself flowing like a street between two rows of palaces  a great way off too we saw some of the cloudlike peaks of the apennines and above them the clouds into which the sun was descending looking quite as substantial as the distant mountains  the city did not present a particularly splendid aspect though its great duomo was seen in the middle distance sitting in its circle of little domes with the tall campanile close by and within one or two hundred yards of it the high cumbrous bulk of the palazzo vecchio with its lofty machicolated and battlemented tower very picturesque yet looking exceedingly like a martinbox on a pole  there were other domes and towers and spires and here and there the distinct shape of an edifice but the general picture was of a contiguity of red earthen roofs filling a not very broad or extensive valley among dry and ridgy hills with a rivergleam lightening up the landscape a little  u took out her pencil and tablets and began to sketch the tower of the palazzo vecchio in doing which she immediately became an object of curiosity to some little boys and larger people who failed not under such pretences as taking a grasshopper off her dress or no pretence at all to come and look over her shoulder  there is a kind of familiarity among these florentines which is not meant to be discourteous and ought to be taken in good part  we continued to ramble through the gardens in quest of a good spot from which to see the sunset and at length found a stone bench on the slope of a hill whence the entire cloud and sun scenery was fully presented to us  at the foot of the hill were statues and among them a pegasus with wings outspread and a little beyond the gardenfront of the pitti palace which looks a little less like a stateprison here than as it fronts the street  girls and children and young men and old were taking their pleasure in our neighborhood and just before us a lady stood talking with her maid  by and by we discovered her to be miss howorth  there was a misty light streaming down on the hither side of the ridge of hills that was rather peculiar but the most remarkable thing was the shape into which the clouds gathered themselves after the disappearance of the sun  it was like a tree with a broad and heavy mass of foliage spreading high upward on the sky and a dark and welldefined trunk which rooted itself on the verge of the horizon  this morning we went to the pitti palace  the air was very sultry and the pavements already heated with the sun made the space between the buildings seem like a close room  the earth i think is too much stoned out of the streets of an italian citypaved like those of florence quite across with broad flagstones to the line where the stones of the houses on each side are piled up  thunder rumbled over our heads however and the clouds were so dark that we scarcely hoped to reach the palace without feeling the first drops of the shower  the air still darkened and darkened so that by the time we arrived at the suite of picturerooms the pictures seemed all to be changed to rembrandts the shadows as black as midnight with only some highly illuminated portions gleaming out  the obscurity of the atmosphere made us sensible how splendid is the adornment of these saloons  for the gilded cornices shone out as did the gilding of the arches and wreathed circles that divide the ceiling into compartments within which the frescos are painted and whence the figures looked dimly down like gods out of a mysterious sky  the white marble sculptures also gleamed from their height where winged cupids or cherubs gambolled aloft in basreliefs or allegoric shapes reclined along the cornices hardly noticed when the daylight comes brightly into the window  on the walls all the rich pictureframes glimmered in gold as did the framework of the chairs and the heavy gilded pedestals of the marble alabaster and mosaic tables these are very magnificent saloons and since i have begun to speak of their splendor i may as well add that the doors are framed in polished richly veined marble and the walls hung with scarlet damask  it was useless to try to see the pictures  all the artists engaged in copying laid aside their brushes and we looked out into the square before the palace where a mighty wind sprang up and quickly raised a prodigious cloud of dust  it hid the opposite side of the street and was carried in a great dusky whirl higher than the roofs of the houses higher than the top of the pitti palace itself  the thunder muttered and grumbled the lightning now and then flashed and a few raindrops pattered against the windows but for a long time the shower held off at last it came down in a stream and lightened the air to such a degree that we could see some of the pictures especially those of rubens and the illuminated parts of salvator rosas and best of all titians magdalen the one with golden hair clustering round her naked body the golden hair indeed seemed to throw out a glory of its own  this magdalen is very coarse and sensual with only an impudent assumption of penitence and religious sentiment scarcely so deep as the eyelids but it is a splendid picture nevertheless with those naked lifelike arms and the hands that press the rich locks about her and so carefully permit those voluptuous breasts to be seen  she a penitent  she would shake off all pretence to it as easily as she would shake aside that clustering hair     titian must have been a very goodfornothing old man  i looked again at michael angelos fates today but cannot satisfactorily make out what he meant by them  one of themshe who holds the distaffhas her mouth open as if uttering a cry and might be fancied to look somewhat irate  the second who holds the thread has a pensive air but is still i think pitiless at heart  the third sister looks closely and coldly into the eyes of the second meanwhile cutting the thread with a pair of shears  michael angelo if i may presume to say so wished to vary the expression of these three sisters and give each a different one but did not see precisely how inasmuch as all the fatal three are united heart and soul in one purpose  it is a very impressive group  but as regards the interpretation of this or of any other profound picture there are likely to be as many interpretations as there are spectators  it is very curious to read criticisms upon pictures and upon the same face in a picture and by men of taste and feeling and to find what different conclusions they arrive at  each man interprets the hieroglyphic in his own way and the painter perhaps had a meaning which none of them have reached or possibly he put forth a riddle without himself knowing the solution  there is such a necessity at all events of helping the painter out with the spectators own resources of feeling and imagination that you can never be sure how much of the picture you have yourself made  there is no doubt that the public is to a certain extent right and sure of its ground when it declares through a series of ages that a certain picture is a great work  it is so a great symbol proceeding out of a great mind but if it means one thing it seems to mean a thousand and often opposite things   june 27thi have had a heavy cold and fever almost throughout the past week and have thereby lost the great florentine festivity the feast of st john which took place on thursday last with the fireworks and illuminations the evening before and the races and court ceremonies on the day itself  however unless it were more characteristic and peculiar than the carnival i have not missed anything very valuable  mr powers called to see me one evening and poured out as usual a stream of talk both racy and oracular in its character  speaking of human eyes he observed that they did not depend for their expression upon color nor upon any light of the soul beaming through them nor any glow of the eyeball nor upon anything but the form and action of the surrounding muscles  he illustrates it by saying that if the eye of a wolf or of whatever fiercest animal could be placed in another setting it would be found capable of the utmost gentleness of expression  you yourself said he have a very bright and sharp look sometimes but it is not in the eye itself  his own eyes as i could have sworn were glowing all the time he spoke and remembering how many times i have seemed to see eyes glow and blaze and flash and sparkle and melt and soften and how all poetry is illuminated with the light of ladies eyes and how many people have been smitten by the lightning of an eye whether in love or anger it was difficult to allow that all this subtlest and keenest fire is illusive not even phosphorescent and that any other jelly in the same socket would serve as well as the brightest eye nevertheless he must be right of course he must and i am rather ashamed ever to have thought otherwise  where should the light come from  has a man a flame inside of his head  does his spirit manifest itself in the semblance of flame  the moment we think of it the absurdity becomes evident  i am not quite sure however that the outer surface of the eye may not reflect more light in some states of feeling than in others the state of the health certainly has an influence of this kind  i asked powers what he thought of michael angelos statue of lorenzo de medici  he allowed that its effect was very grand and mysterious but added that it owed this to a trickthe effect being produced by the arrangement of the hood as he called it or helmet which throws the upper part of the face into shadow  the niche in which it sits has i suppose its part to perform in throwing a still deeper shadow  it is very possible that michael angelo may have calculated upon this effect of sombre shadow and legitimately i think but it really is not worthy of mr powers to say that the whole effect of this mighty statue depends not on the positive efforts of michael angelos chisel but on the absence of light in a space of a few inches  he wrought the whole statue in harmony with that small part of it which he leaves to the spectators imagination and if he had erred at any point the miracle would have been a failure so that working in marble he has positively reached a degree of excellence above the capability of marble sculpturing his highest touches upon air and duskiness  mr powers gave some amusing anecdotes of his early life when he was a clerk in a store in cincinnati  there was a museum opposite the proprietor of which had a peculiar physiognomy that struck powers insomuch that he felt impelled to make continual caricatures of it  he used to draw them upon the door of the museum and became so familiar with the face that he could draw them in the dark so that every morning here was this absurd profile of himself greeting the museumman when he came to open his establishment  often too it would reappear within an hour after it was rubbed out  the man was infinitely annoyed and made all possible efforts to discover the unknown artist but in vain and finally concluded i suppose that the likeness broke out upon the door of its own accord like the nettlerash  some years afterwards the proprietor of the museum engaged powers himself as an assistant and one day powers asked him if he remembered this mysterious profile yes said he did you know who drew them  powers took a piece of chalk and touched off the very profile again before the mans eyes ah said he if i had known it at the time i would have broken every bone in your body  before he began to work in marble powers had greater practice and success in making wax figures and he produced a work of this kind called the infernal regions which he seemed to imply had been very famous he said he once wrought a face in wax which was life itself having made the eyes on purpose for it and put in every hair in the eyebrows individually and finished the whole with similar minuteness so that within the distance of a foot or two it was impossible to tell that the face did not live  i have hardly ever before felt an impulse to write down a mans conversation as i do that of mr powers  the chief reason is probably that it is so possible to do it his ideas being square solid and tangible and therefore readily grasped and retained  he is a very instructive man and sweeps ones empty and dead notions out of the way with exceeding vigor but when you have his ultimate thought and perception you feel inclined to think and see a little further for yourself  he sees too clearly what is within his range to be aware of any region of mystery beyond  probably however this latter remark does him injustice  i like the man and am always glad to encounter the millstream of his talk     yesterday he met me in the street dressed in his linen blouse and slippers with a little bit of a sculptors cap on the side of his head and gave utterance to a theory of colds and a dissertation on the bad effects of draughts whether of cold air or hot and the dangers of transfusing blood from the veins of one living subject to those of another  on the last topic he remarked that if a single particle of air found its way into the veins along with the transfused blood it caused convulsions and inevitable death otherwise the process might be of excellent effect  last evening we went to pass the evening with miss blagden who inhabits a villa at bellosguardo about a mile outside of the walls  the situation is very lofty and there are good views from every window of the house and an especially fine one of florence and the hills beyond from the balcony of the drawingroom  by and by came mr browning mr trollope mr boott and his young daughter and two or three other gentlemen      browning was very genial and full of life as usual but his conversation has the effervescent aroma which you cannot catch even if you get the very words that seem to be imbued with it  he spoke most rapturously of a portrait of mrs browning which an italian artist is painting for the wife of an american gentleman as a present from her husband  the success was already perfect although there had been only two sittings as yet and both on the same day and in this relation mr browning remarked that p the american artist had had no less than seventythree sittings of him for a portrait  in the result every hair and speck of him was represented yet as i inferred from what he did not say this accumulation of minute truths did not after all amount to the true whole  i do not remember much else that browning said except a playful abuse of a little king charles spaniel named frolic miss blagdens lapdog whose venerable age he is eleven years old ought to have pleaded in his behalf  brownings nonsense is of very genuine and excellent quality the true babble and effervescence of a bright and powerful mind and he lets it play among his friends with the faith and simplicity of a child he must be an amiable man  i should like him much and should make him like me if opportunities were favorable  i conversed principally with mr trollope the son i believe of the mrs trollope to whom america owes more for her shrewd criticisms than we are ever likely to repay  mr trollope is a very sensible and cultivated man and i suspect an author at least there is a literary man of repute of this name though i have never read his works  he has resided in italy eighteen years  it seems a pity to do this  it needs the native air to give life a reality a truth which i do not fail to take home regretfully to myself though without feeling much inclination to go back to the realities of my own  we had a pleasant cup of tea and took a moonlight view of florence from the balcony       june 28thyesterday afternoon j and i went to a horserace which took place in the corso and contiguous line of streets in further celebration of the feast of st john  a crowd of people was already collected all along the line of the proposed race as early as six oclock and there were a great many carriages driving amid the throng open barouches mostly in which the beauty and gentility of florence were freely displayed  it was a repetition of the scene in the corso at rome at carnival time without the masks the fun and the confetti  the grand duke and duchess and the court likewise made their appearance in as many as seven or eight coachesandsix each with a coachman three footmen and a postilion in the royal livery and attended by a troop of horsemen in scarlet coats and cocked hats  i did not particularly notice the grand duke himself but in the carriage behind him there sat only a lady who favored the people along the street with a constant succession of bows repeated at such short intervals and so quickly as to be little more than nods therefore not particularly graceful or majestic having the good fortune to be favored with one of these nods i lifted my hat in response and may therefore claim a bowing acquaintance with the grand duchess  she is a bourbon of the naples family and was a pale handsome woman of princely aspect enough  the crowd evinced no enthusiasm nor the slightest feeling of any kind in acknowledgment of the presence of their rulers and indeed i think i never saw a crowd so well behaved that is with so few salient points so little ebullition so absolutely tame as the florentine one  after all and much contrary to my expectations an american crowd has incomparably more life than any other and meeting on any casual occasion it will talk laugh roar and be diversified with a thousand characteristic incidents and gleams and shadows that you see nothing of here  the people seems to have no part even in its own gatherings  it comes together merely as a mass of spectators and must not so much as amuse itself by any activity of mind  the race which was the attraction that drew us all together turned out a very pitiful affair  when we had waited till nearly dusk the street being thronged quite across insomuch that it seemed impossible that it should be cleared as a racecourse there came suddenly from every throat a quick sharp exclamation combining into a general shout  immediately the crowd pressed back on each side of the street a moment afterwards there was a rapid pattering of hoofs over the earth with which the pavement was strewn and i saw the head and back of a horse rushing past a few seconds more and another horse followed and at another little interval a third  this was all that we had waited for all that i saw or anybody else except those who stood on the utmost verge of the course at the risk of being trampled down and killed  two men were killed in this way on thursday and certainly human life was never spent for a poorer object  the spectators at the windows to be sure having the horses in sight for a longer time might get a little more enjoyment out of the affair  by the by the most picturesque aspect of the scene was the life given to it by the many faces some of them fair ones that looked out from window and balcony all along the curving line of lofty palaces and edifices between which the racecourse lay and from nearly every window and over every balcony was flung a silken texture or cloth of brilliant line or piece of tapestry or carpet or whatever adornment of the kind could be had so as to dress up the street in gala attire  but the feast of st john like the carnival is but a meagre semblance of festivity kept alive factitiously and dying a lingering death of centuries  it takes the exuberant mind and heart of a people to keep its holidays alive  i do not know whether there be any populace in florence but i saw none that i recognized as such on this occasion  all the people were respectably dressed and perfectly well behaved and soldiers and priests were scattered abundantly among the throng  on my way home i saw the teatro goldoni which is in our own street lighted up for a representation this sunday evening  it shocked my new england prejudices a little  thus forenoon my wife and i went to the church of santa croce the great monumental deposit of florentine worthies  the piazza before it is a wide gravelled square where the liberty of florence if it really ever had any genuine liberty came into existence some hundreds of years ago by the peoples taking its own rights into its hands and putting its own immediate will in execution  the piazza has not much appearance of antiquity except that the facade of one of the houses is quite covered with ancient frescos a good deal faded and obliterated yet with traces enough of old glory to show that the colors must have been well laid on  the front of the church the foundation of which was laid six centuries ago is still waiting for its casing of marbles and i suppose will wait forever though a carpenters staging is now erected before it as if with the purpose of doing something  the interior is spacious the length of the church being between four and five hundred feet  there is a nave roofed with wooden crossbeams lighted by a clerestory and supported on each side by seven great pointed arches which rest upon octagonal pillars  the octagon seems to be a favorite shape in florence  these pillars were clad in yellow and scarlet damask in honor of the feast of st john  the aisles on each side of the nave are lighted with high and somewhat narrow windows of painted glass the effect of which however is much diminished by the flood of common daylight that comes in through the windows of the clerestory  it is like admitting too much of the light of reason and worldly intelligence into the mind instead of illuminating it wholly through a religious medium  the manyhued saints and angels lose their mysterious effulgence when we get white light enough and find we see all the better without their help  the main pavement of the church is brickwork but it is inlaid with many sepulchral slabs of marble on some of which knightly or priestly figures are sculptured in basrelief  in both of the side aisles there are saintly shrines alternating with mural monuments some of which record names as illustrious as any in the world  as you enter the first monument on your right is that of michael angelo occupying the ancient burialsite of his family  the general design is a heavy sarcophagus of colored marble with the figures of sculpture painting and architecture as mourners and michael angelos bust above the whole assuming a pyramidal form  you pass a shrine within its framework of marble pillars and a pediment and come next to dantes monument a modern work with likewise its sarcophagus and some huge cold images weeping and sprawling over it and an unimpressive statue of dante sitting above  another shrine intervenes and next you see the tomb of alfieri erected to his memory by the countess of albany who pays out of a womans love the honor which his country owed him  her own monument is in one of the chapels of the transept  passing the next shrine you see the tomb of macchiavelli which i think was constructed not many years after his death  the rest of the monuments on this side of the church commemorate people of less than worldwide fame and though the opposite side has likewise a monument alternating with each shrine i remember only the names of raphael morghen and of galileo  the tomb of the latter is over against that of michael angelo being the first large tomb on the lefthand wall as you enter the church  it has the usual heavy sarcophagus surmounted by a bust of galileo in the habit of his time and is of course duly provided with mourners in the shape of science or astronomy or some such coldhearted people  i wish every sculptor might be at once imprisoned for life who shall hereafter chisel an allegoric figure and as for those who have sculptured them heretofore let them be kept in purgatory till the marble shall have crumbled away  it is especially absurd to assign to this frozen sisterhood of the allegoric family the office of weeping for the dead inasmuch as they have incomparably less feeling than a lump of ice which might contrive to shed a tear if the sun shone on it  but they seem to let themselves out like the hired mourners of an english funeral for the very reason that having no interest in the dead person nor any affections or emotions whatever it costs them no wear and tear of heart  all round both transepts of the church there is a series of chapels into most of which we went and generally found an inscrutably dark picture over the altar and often a marble bust or two or perhaps a mediaeval statue of a saint or a modern monumental basrelief in marble as white as newfallen snow  a chapel of the bonapartes is here containing memorials of two female members of the family  in several chapels moreover there were some of those distressing frescos by giotto cimabue or their compeers which whenever i see thempoor faded relics looking as if the devil had been rubbing and scrubbing them for centuries in spite against the saintsmy heart sinks and my stomach sickens  there is no other despondency like this it is a new shade of human misery akin to the physical disease that comes from dryrot in a wall  these frescos are to a church what dreary old remembrances are to a mind the drearier because they were once bright hope fading into disappointment joy into grief and festal splendor passing into funereal duskiness and saddening you all the more by the grim identity that you find to exist between gay things and sorrowful ones  only wait long enough and they turn out to be the very same  all the time we were in the church some great religious ceremony had been going forward the organ playing and the whiterobed priests bowing gesticulating and making latin prayers at the high altar where at least a hundred wax tapers were burning in constellations  everybody knelt except ourselves yet seemed not to be troubled by the echoes of our passing footsteps nor to require that we should pray along with them they consider us already lost irrevocably no doubt and therefore right enough in taking no heed of their devotions not but what we took so much heed however as to give the smallest possible disturbance  by and by we sat down in the nave of the church till the ceremony should be concluded and then my wife left me to go in quest of yet another chapel where either cimabue or giotto or both have left some of their now ghastly decorations  while she was gone i threw my eyes about the church and came to the conclusion that in spite of its antiquity its size its architecture its painted windows its tombs of great men and all the reverence and interest that broods over them it is not an impressive edifice  any little norman church in england would impress me as much and more  there is something i do not know what but it is in the region of the heart rather than in the intellect that italian architecture of whatever age or style never seems to reach  leaving the santa croce we went next in quest of the riccardi palace on our way in the rear of the grand ducal piazza we passed by the bargello formerly the palace of the podesta of florence and now converted into a prison  it is an immense square edifice of dark stone with a tall lank tower rising high above it at one corner  two stone lions symbols of the city lash their tails and glare at the passersby and all over the front of the building windows are scattered irregularly and grated with rusty iron bars also there are many square holes which probably admit a little light and a breath or two of air into prisoners cells  it is a very ugly edifice but looks antique and as if a vast deal of history might have been transacted within it or have beaten like fierce blasts against its dark massive walls since the thirteenth century  when i first saw the city it struck me that there were few marks of antiquity in florence but i am now inclined to think otherwise although the bright italian atmosphere and the general squareness and monotony of the italian architecture have their effect in apparently modernizing everything  but everywhere we see the ponderous tuscan basements that never can decay and which will look five hundred years hence as they look now and one often passes beneath an abbreviated remnant of what was once a lofty tower perhaps three hundred feet high such as used to be numerous in florence when each noble of the city had his own warfare to wage and there are patches of sculpture that look old on houses the modern stucco of which causes them to look almost new here and there an unmistakable antiquity stands in its own impressive shadow the church of or san michele for instance once a market but which grew to be a church by some inherent fitness and inevitable consecration  it has not the least the aspect of a church being high and square like a mediaeval palace but deep and high niches are let into its walls within which stand great statues of saints masterpieces of donatello and other sculptors of that age before sculpture began to be congealed by the influence of greek art  the riccardi palace is at the corner of the via larga  it was built by the first cosmo de medici the old banker more than four centuries ago and was long the home of the ignoble race of princes which he left behind him  it looks fit to be still the home of a princely race being nowise dilapidated nor decayed externally nor likely to be so its high tuscan basement being as solid as a ledge of rock and its upper portion not much less so though smoothed into another order of stately architecture entering its court from the via larga we found ourselves beneath a pillared arcade passing round the court like a cloister and on the walls of the palace under this succession of arches were statues basreliefs and sarcophagi in which first dead pagans had slept and then dead christians before the sculptured coffins were brought hither to adorn the palace of the medici  in the most prominent place was a latin inscription of great length and breadth chiefly in praise of old cosino and his deeds and wisdom  this mansion gives the visitor a stately notion of the life of a commercial man in the days when merchants were princes not that it seems to be so wonderfully extensive nor so very grand for i suppose there are a dozen roman palaces that excel it in both these particulars  still we cannot but be conscious that it must have been in some sense a great man who thought of founding a homestead like this and was capable of filling it with his personality as the hand fills a glove  it has been found spacious enough since cosmos time for an emperor and a pope and a king all of whom have been guests in this house  after being the family mansion of the medici for nearly two centuries it was sold to the riccardis but was subsequently bought of then by the government and it is now occupied by public offices and societies  after sufficiently examining the court and its antiquities we ascended a noble staircase that passes by broad flights and square turns to the region above the basement  here the palace is cut up and portioned off into little rooms and passages and everywhere there were desks inkstands and men with pens in their fingers or behind their ears  we were shown into a little antique chapel quite covered with frescos in the giotto style but painted by a certain gozzoli  they were in pretty good preservation and in fact i am wrong in comparing them to giottos works inasmuch as there must have been nearly two hundred years between the two artists  the chapel was furnished with curiously carved old chairs and looked surprisingly venerable within its little precinct  we were next guided into the grand gallery a hall of respectable size with a frescoed ceiling on which is represented the blue sky and various members of the medici family ascending through it by the help of angelic personages who seem only to have waited for their society to be perfectly happy  at least this was the meaning so far as i could make it out  along one side of the gallery were oilpictures on lookingglasses rather good than otherwise but rome with her palaces and villas takes the splendor out of all this sort of thing elsewhere  on our way home and on our own side of the ponte vecchio we passed the palazzo guicciardini the ancient residence of the historian of italy who was a politic statesman of his day and probably as cruel and unprincipled as any of those whose deeds he has recorded  opposite across the narrow way stands the house of macchiavelli who was his friend and i should judge an honester man than he  the house is distinguished by a marble tablet let into the wall commemorative of macchiavelli but has nothing antique or picturesque about it being in a continuous line with other smoothfaced and stuccoed edifices   june 30thyesterday at three oclock p m i went to see the final horserace of the feast of st john or rather to see the concourse of people and grandees whom it brought together  i took my stand in the vicinity of the spot whence the grand duke and his courtiers view the race and from this point the scene was rather better worth looking at than from the streetcorners whence i saw it before  the vista of the street stretching far adown between two rows of lofty edifices was really gay and gorgeous with the silks damasks and tapestries of all bright hues that flaunted from windows and balconies whence ladies looked forth and looked down themselves making the liveliest part of the show  the whole capacity of the street swarmed with moving heads leaving scarce room enough for the carriages which as on sunday passed up and down until the signal for the race was given  equipages too were constantly arriving at the door of the building which communicates with the open loggia where the grand ducal party sit to see and to be seen  two sentinels were standing at the door and presented arms as each courtier or ambassador or whatever dignity it might be alighted most of them had on goldembroidered courtdresses some of them had military uniforms and medals in abundance at the breast and ladies also came looking like heaps of lace and gauze in the carriages but lightly shaking themselves into shape as they went up the steps  by and by a trumpet sounded a drum beat and again appeared a succession of half a dozen royal equipages each with its six horses its postilion coachman and three footmen grand with cocked hats and embroidery and the grayheaded bowing grand duke and his nodding grand duchess as before the noble guard ranged themselves on horseback opposite the loggia but there was no irksome and impertinent show of ceremony and restraint upon the people  the playguard of volunteer soldiers who escort the president of the united states in his northern progresses keep back their fellowcitizens much more sternly and immitigably than the florentine guard kept back the populace from its despotic sovereign  this morning j and i have been to the uffizi gallery  it was his first visit there and he passed a sweeping condemnation upon everything he saw except a fly a snailshell a caterpillar a lemon a piece of bread and a wineglass in some of the dutch pictures  the venus de medici met with no sort of favor  his feeling of utter distaste reacted upon me and i was sensible of the same weary lack of appreciation that used to chill me through in my earlier visits to picturegalleries the same doubt moreover whether we do not bamboozle ourselves in the greater part of the admiration which we learn to bestow  i looked with some pleasure at one of correggios madonnas in the tribuneno divine and deepthoughted mother of the saviour but a young woman playing with her first child as gay and thoughtless as itself  i looked at michael angelos madonna in which william ware saw such prophetic depth of feeling but i suspect it was one of the many instances in which the spectator sees more than the painter ever dreamed of  straying through the city after leaving the gallery we went into the church of or san michele and saw in its architecture the traces of its transformation from a market into a church  in its pristine state it consisted of a double row of three great open arches with the wind blowing through them and the sunshine falling aslantwise into them while the bustle of the market the sale of fish flesh or fruit went on within or brimmed over into the streets that enclosed them on every side  but four or five hundred years ago the broad arches were built up with stonework windows were pierced through and filled with painted glass a high altar in a rich style of pointed gothic was raised shrines and confessionals were set up and here it is a solemn and antique church where a man may buy his salvation instead of his dinner at any rate the catholic priests will insure it to him and take the price  the sculpture within the beautifully decorated niches on the outside of the church is very curious and interesting  the statues of those old saints seem to have that charm of earnestness which so attracts the admirers of the preraphaelite painters  it appears that a picture of the virgin used to hang against one of the pillars of the marketplace while it was still a market and in the year 1291 several miracles were wrought by it insomuch that a chapel was consecrated for it  so many worshippers came to the shrine that the business of the market was impeded and ultimately the virgin and st michael won the whole space for themselves  the upper part of the edifice was at that time a granary and is still used for other than religious purposes  this church was one spot to which the inhabitants betook themselves much for refuge and divine assistance during the great plague described by boccaccio   july 2dwe set out yesterday morning to visit the palazzo buonarotti michael angelos ancestral home     it is in the via ghibellina an ordinarylooking threestory house with broadbrimmed eaves a stuccoed front and two or three windows painted in fresco besides the real ones adown the street there is a glimpse of the hills outside of florence the sun shining heavily directly upon the front we rang the doorbell and then drew back into the shadow that fell from the opposite side of the street  after we had waited some time a man looked out from an upper window and a woman from a lower one and informed us that we could not be admitted now nor for two or three months to come the house being under repairs  it is a pity for i wished to see michael angelos sword and walkingstick and old slippers and whatever other of his closest personalities are to be shown      we passed into the piazza of the grand duke and looked into the court of the palazzo vecchio with its beautifully embossed pillars and seeing just beyond the court a staircase of broad and easy steps we ascended it at a venture  upward and upward we went flight after flight of stairs and through passages till at last we found an official who ushered us into a large saloon  it was the hall of audience  its heavily embossed ceiling rich with tarnished gold was a feature of antique magnificence and the only one that it retained the floor being paved with tiles and the furniture scanty or none  there were however three cabinets standing against the walls two of which contained very curious and exquisite carvings and cuttings in ivory some of them in the chinese style of hollow concentric balls others really beautiful works of art little crucifixes statues saintly and knightly and cups enriched with delicate basreliefs  the custode pointed to a small figure of st sebastian and also to a vase around which the reliefs seemed to assume life  both these specimens he said were by benvenuto cellini and there were many others that might well have been wrought by his famous hand  the third cabinet contained a great number and variety of crucifixes chalices and whatever other vessels are needed in altar service exquisitely carved out of amber  they belong to the chapel of the palace and into this holy closet we were now conducted  it is large enough to accommodate comfortably perhaps thirty worshippers and is quite covered with frescos by ghirlandaio in good preservation and with remnants enough of gilding and bright color to show how splendid the chapel must have been when the medicean grand dukes used to pray here the altar is still ready for service and i am not sure that some of the wax tapers were not burning but lorenzo the magnificent was nowhere to be seen  the custode now led us back through the hall of audience into a smaller room hung with pictures chiefly of the medici and their connections among whom was one carolina an intelligent and pretty child and bianca capella  there was nothing else to show us except a very noble and most spacious saloon lighted by two large windows at each end coming down level with the floor and by a row of windows on one side just beneath the cornice a gilded framework divides the ceiling into squares circles and octagons the compartments of which are filled with pictures in oil and the walls are covered with immense frescos representing various battles and triumphs of the florentines  statues by michael angelo john of bologna and bandinello as well historic as ideal stand round the hall and it is really a fit theatre for the historic scenes of a country to be acted in  it was built moreover with the idea of its being the councilhall of a free people but our own little faneuil which was meant in all simplicity to be merely a spot where the townspeople should meet to choose their selectmen has served the world better in that respect  i wish i had more room to speak of this vast dusky historic hall  this volume of journal closes here   july 4th 1858yesterday forenoon we went to see the church of santa maria novella  we found the piazza on one side of which the church stands encumbered with the amphitheatrical ranges of wooden seats that had been erected to accommodate the spectators of the chariotraces at the recent feast of st john  the front of the church is composed of black and white marble which in the course of the five centuries that it has been built has turned brown and yellow  on the right hand as you approach is a long colonnade of arches extending on a line with the facade and having a tomb beneath every arch  this colonnade forms one of the enclosing walls of a cloister  we found none of the front entrances open but on our left in a wall at right angles with the church there was an open gateway approaching which we saw within the foursided colonnade an enclosed green space of a cloister  this is what is called the chiostro verde so named from the prevailing color of the frescos with which the walls beneath the arches are adorned  this cloister is the reality of what i used to imagine when i saw the halfruinous colonnades connected with english cathedrals or endeavored to trace out the lines along the broken wall of some old abbey  not that this extant cloister still perfect and in daily use for its original purposes is nearly so beautiful as the crumbling ruin which has ceased to be trodden by monkish feet for more than three centuries  the cloister of santa maria has not the seclusion that is desirable being open by its gateway to the public square and several of the neighbors women as well as men were loitering within its precincts  the convent however has another and larger cloister which i suppose is kept free from interlopers  the chiostro verde is a walk round the four sides of a square beneath an arched and groined roof  one side of the walk looks upon an enclosed green space with a fountain or a tomb i forget which in the centre the other side is ornamented all along with a succession of ancient frescos representing subjects of scripture history  in the days when the designs were more distinct than now it must have been a very effective way for a monk to read bible history to see its personages and events thus passing visibly beside him in his morning and evening walks  beneath the frescos on one side of the cloistered walk and along the low stone parapet that separates it from the grassplat on the other are inscriptions to the memory of the dead who are buried underneath the pavement  the most of these were modern and recorded the names of persons of no particular note  other monumental slabs were inlaid with the pavement itself  two or three dominican monks belonging to the convent passed in and out while we were there in their white habits  after going round three sides we came to the fourth formed by the wall of the church and heard the voice of a priest behind a curtain that fell down before a door  lifting it aside we went in and found ourselves in the ancient chapterhouse a large interior formed by two great pointed arches crossing one another in a groined roof  the broad spaces of the walls were entirely covered with frescos that are rich even now and must have glowed with an inexpressible splendor when fresh from the artists hands five hundred years ago  there is a long period during which frescos illuminate a church or a hall in a way that no other adornment can when this epoch of brightness is past they become the dreariest ghosts of perished magnificence     this chapterhouse is the only part of the church that is now used for the purposes of public worship there are several confessionals and two chapels or shrines each with its lighted tapers  a priest performed mass while we were there and several persons as usual stepped in to do a little devotion either praying on their own account or uniting with the ceremony that was going forward  one man was followed by two little dogs and in the midst of his prayers as one of the dogs was inclined to stray about the church he kept snapping his fingers to call him back  the cool dusky refreshment of these holy places affording such a refuge from the hot noon of the streets and piazzas probably suggests devotional ideas to the people and it may be when they are praying they feel a breath of paradise fanning them  if we could only see any good effects in their daily life we might deem it an excellent thing to be able to find incense and a prayer always ascending to which every individual may join his own  i really wonder that the catholics are not better men and women  when we had looked at the old frescos     we emerged into the cloister again and thence ventured into a passage which would have led us to the chiostro grande where strangers and especially ladies have no right to go  it was a secluded corridor very neatly kept bordered with sepulchral monuments and at the end appeared a vista of cypresstrees which indeed were but an illusory perspective being painted in fresco  while we loitered along the sacristan appeared and offered to show us the church and led us into the transept on the right of the high altar and ushered us into the sacristy where we found two artists copying some of fra angelicos pictures  these were painted on the three wooden leaves of a triptych and as usual were glorified with a great deal of gilding so that they seemed to float in the brightness of a heavenly element  solomon speaks of apples of gold in pictures of silver  the pictures of fra angelico and other artists of that age are really pictures of gold and it is wonderful to see how rich the effect and how much delicate beauty is attained by fra angelico at least along with it  his miniatureheads appear to me much more successful than his larger ones  in a monkish point of view however the chief value of the triptych of which i am speaking does not lie in the pictures for they merely serve as the framework of some relics which are set all round the edges of the three leaves  they consist of little bits and fragments of bones and of packages carefully tied up in silk the contents of which are signified in gothic letters appended to each parcel  the sacred vessels of the church are likewise kept in the sacristy      reentering the transept our guide showed us the chapel of the strozzi family which is accessible by a flight of steps from the floor of the church  the walls of this chapel are covered with frescos by orcagna representing around the altar the last judgment and on one of the walls heaven and the assembly of the blessed and on the other of course hell  i cannot speak as to the truth of the representation but at all events it was purgatory to look at it      we next passed into the choir which occupies the extreme end of the church behind the great square mass of the high altar and is surrounded with a double row of ancient oaken seats of venerable shape and carving the choir is illuminated by a threefold gothic window full of richly painted glass worth all the frescos that ever stained a wall or ceiling but these walls nevertheless are adorned with frescos by ghirlandaio and it is easy to see must once have made a magnificent appearance  i really was sensible of a sad and ghostly beauty in many of the figures but all the bloom the magic of the painters touch his topmost art have long ago been rubbed off the white plaster showing through the colors in spots and even in large spaces  any other sort of ruin acquires a beauty proper to its decay and often superior to that of its pristine state but the ruin of a picture especially of a fresco is wholly unredeemed and moreover it dies so slowly that many generations are likely to be saddened by it  we next saw the famous picture of the virgin by cimabue which was deemed a miracle in its day     and still brightens the sombre walls with the lustre of its gold ground  as to its artistic merits it seems to me that the babe jesus has a certain air of state and dignity but i could see no charm whatever in the broadfaced virgin and it would relieve my mind and rejoice my spirit if the picture were borne out of the church in another triumphal procession like the one which brought it there and reverently burnt  this should be the final honor paid to all human works that have served a good office in their day for when their day is over if still galvanized into false life they do harm instead of good     the interior of santa maria novella is spacious and in the gothic style though differing from english churches of that order of architecture  it is not now kept open to the public nor were any of the shrines and chapels nor even the high altar itself adorned and lighted for worship  the pictures that decorated the shrines along the side aisles have been removed leaving bare blank spaces of brickwork very dreary and desolate to behold  this is almost worse than a black oilpainting or a faded fresco  the church was much injured by the french and afterwards by the austrians both powers having quartered their troops within the holy precincts  its old walls however are yet stalwart enough to outlast another set of frescos and to see the beginning and the end of a new school of painting as longlived as cimabues  i should be sorry to have the church go to decay because it was here that boccaccios dames and cavaliers encountered one another and formed their plan of retreating into the country during the plague      at the door we bought a string of beads with a small crucifix appended in memory of the place  the beads seem to be of a grayish pearshaped seed and the seller assured us that they were the tears of st job they were cheap probably because job shed so many tears in his lifetime  it being still early in the day we went to the uffizi gallery and after loitering a good while among the pictures were so fortunate as to find the room of the bronzes open  the first object that attracted us was john of bolognas mercury poising himself on tiptoe and looking not merely buoyant enough to float but as if he possessed more than the eagles power of lofty flight  it seems a wonder that he did not absolutely fling himself into the air when the artist gave him the last touch  no bolder work was ever achieved nothing so full of life has been done since  i was much interested too in the original little wax model two feet high of benvenuto cellinis perseus  the wax seems to be laid over a wooden framework and is but roughly finished off      in an adjoining room are innumerable specimens of roman and etruscan bronzes great and small  a bronze chimera did not strike me as very ingeniously conceived the goats head being merely an adjunct growing out of the back of the monster without possessing any original and substantive share in its nature  the snakes head is at the end of the tail  the object most really interesting was a roman eagle the standard of the twentyfourth legion about the size of a blackbird   july 8thon the 6th we went to the church of the annunziata which stands in the piazza of the same name  on the corner of the via dei servi is the palace which i suppose to be the one that browning makes the scene of his poem the statue and the bust and the statue of duke ferdinand sits stately on horseback with his face turned towards the window where the lady ought to appear  neither she nor the bust however was visible at least not to my eyes  the church occupies one side of the piazza and in front of it as likewise on the two adjoining sides of the square there are pillared arcades constructed by brunelleschi or his scholars  after passing through these arches and still before entering the church itself you come to an ancient cloister which is now quite enclosed in glass as a means of preserving some frescos of andrea del sarto and others which are considered valuable  passing the threshold of the church we were quite dazzled by the splendor that shone upon us from the ceiling of the nave the great parallelograms of which viewed from one end look as if richly embossed all over with gold  the whole interior indeed has an effect of brightness and magnificence the walls being covered mostly with lightcolored marble into which are inlaid compartments of rarer and richer marbles  the pillars and pilasters too are of variegated marbles with corinthian capitals that shine just as brightly as if they were of solid gold so faithfully have they been gilded and burnished the pavement is formed of squares of black and white marble  there are no side aisles but ranges of chapels with communication from one to another stand round the whole extent of the nave and choir all of marble all decorated with pictures statues busts and mural monuments all worth separately a days inspection  the high altar is of great beauty and richness     and also the tomb of john of bologna in a chapel at the remotest extremity of the church  in this chapel there are some basreliefs by him and also a large crucifix with a marble christ upon it  i think there has been no better sculptor since the days of phidias      the church was founded by seven gentlemen of florence who formed themselves into a religious order called servants of mary  many miraculous cures were wrought here and the church in consequence was so thickly hung with votive offerings of legs arms and other things in wax that they used to tumble upon peoples heads so that finally they were all cleared out as rubbish  the church is still i should imagine looked upon as a place of peculiar sanctity for while we were there it had an unusual number of kneeling worshippers and persons were passing from shrine to shrine all round the nave and choir praying awhile at each and thus performing a pilgrimage at little cost of time and labor one old gentleman i observed carried a cushion or pad just big enough for one knee on which he carefully adjusted his genuflexions before each altar  an old woman in the choir prayed alternately to us and to the saints with most success i hope in her petitions to the latter though certainly her prayers to ourselves seemed the more fervent of the two  when we had gone entirely round the church we came at last to the chapel of the annunziata which stands on the floor of the nave on the left hand as we enter  it is a very beautiful piece of architecturea sort of canopy of marble supported upon pillars and its magnificence within in marble and silver and all manner of holy decoration is quite indescribable  it was built four hundred years ago by pietro de medici and has probably been growing richer ever since  the altar is entirely of silver richly embossed  as many people were kneeling on the steps before it as could find room and most of them when they finished their prayers ascended the steps kissed over and over again the margin of the silver altar laid their foreheads upon it and then deposited an offering in a box placed upon the altars top  from the dulness of the chink in the only case when i heard it i judged it to be a small copper coin  in the inner part of this chapel is preserved a miraculous picture of the santissima annunziata painted by angels and held in such holy repute that forty thousand dollars have lately been expended in providing a new crown for the sacred personage represented  the picture is now veiled behind a curtain and as it is a fresco and is not considered to do much credit to the angelic artists i was well contented not to see it  we found a side door of the church admitting us into the great cloister which has a walk of intersecting arches round its four sides paved with flat tombstones and broad enough for six people to walk abreast  on the walls in the semicircles of each successive arch are frescos representing incidents in the lives of the seven founders of the church and all the lower part of the wall is incrusted with marble inscriptions to the memory of the dead and mostly of persons who have died not very long ago  the space enclosed by the cloistered walk usually made cheerful by green grass has a pavement of tombstones laid in regular ranges  in the centre is a stone octagonal structure which at first i supposed to be the tomb of some deceased mediaeval personage but on approaching i found it a well with its bucket hanging within the curb and looking as if it were in constant use  the surface of the water lay deep beneath the deepest dust of the dead people and thence threw up its picture of the sky but i think it would not be a moderate thirst that would induce me to drink of that well  on leaving the church we bought a little gilt crucifix      on sunday evening i paid a short visit to mr powers and as usual was entertained and instructed with his conversation  it did not indeed turn upon artistical subjects but the artistic is only one side of his character and i think not the principal side  he might have achieved valuable success as an engineer and mechanician  he gave a dissertation on flyingmachines evidently from his own experience and came to the conclusion that it is impossible to fly by means of steam or any other motivepower now known to man  no force hitherto attained would suffice to lift the engine which generated it  he appeared to anticipate that flying will be a future mode of locomotion but not till the moral condition of mankind is so improved as to obviate the bad uses to which the power might be applied  another topic discussed was a cure for complaints of the chest by the inhalation of nitric acid and he produced his own apparatus for that purpose being merely a tube inserted into a bottle containing a small quantity of the acid just enough to produce the gas for inhalation  he told me too a remedy for burns accidentally discovered by himself viz to wear washleather or something equivalent over the burn and keep it constantly wet  it prevents all pain and cures by the exclusion of the air  he evidently has a great tendency to empirical remedies and would have made a natural doctor of mighty potency possessing the shrewd sense inventive faculty and selfreliance that such persons require  it is very singular that there should be an ideal vein in a man of this character  this morning he called to see me with intelligence of the failure of the new attempt to lay the electric cable between england and america and here too it appears the misfortune might have been avoided if a plan of his own for laying the cable had been adopted  he explained his process and made it seem as practicable as to put up a bellwire  i do not remember how or why but appositely he repeated some verses from a pretty little ballad about fairies that had struck his fancy and he wound up his talk with some acute observations on the characters of general jackson and other public men  he told an anecdote illustrating the old generals small acquaintance with astronomical science and his force of will in compelling a whole dinnerparty of better instructed people than himself to succumb to him in an argument about eclipses and the planetary system generally  powers witnessed the scene himself  he thinks that general jackson was a man of the keenest and surest intuitions in respect to men and measures but with no power of reasoning out his own conclusions or of imparting them intellectually to other persons  men who have known jackson intimately and in great affairs would not agree as to this intellectual and argumentative deficiency though they would fully allow the intuitive faculty  i have heard general pierce tell a striking instance of jacksons power of presenting his own view of a subject with irresistible force to the mind of the auditor  president buchanan has likewise expressed to me as high admiration of jackson as i ever heard one man award to another  surely he was a great man and his native strength as well of intellect as character compelled every man to be his tool that came within his reach and the more cunning the individual might be it served only to make him the sharper tool  speaking of jackson and remembering raphaels picture of pope julius ii the best portrait in the whole world and excellent in all its repetitions i wish it had been possible for raphael to paint general jackson  referring again to general jacksons intuitions and to powerss idea that he was unable to render a reason to himself or others for what he chose to do i should have thought that this very probably might have been the case were there not such strong evidence to the contrary  the highest or perhaps any high administrative ability is intuitive and precedes argument and rises above it  it is a revelation of the very thing to be done and its propriety and necessity are felt so strongly that very likely it cannot be talked about if the doer can likewise talk it is an additional and gratuitous faculty as little to be expected as that a poet should be able to write an explanatory criticism on his own poem  the english overlook this in their scheme of government which requires that the members of the national executive should be orators and the readiest and most fluent orators that can be found  the very fact on which they are selected that they are men of words makes it improbable that they are likewise men of deeds  and it is only tradition and old custom founded on an obsolete state of things that assigns any value to parliamentary oratory  the world has done with it except as an intellectual pastime  the speeches have no effect till they are converted into newspaper paragraphs and they had better be composed as such in the first place and oratory reserved for churches courts of law and public dinnertables   july 10thmy wife and i went yesterday forenoon to see the church of san marco with which is connected a convent of dominicans     the interior is not less than three or four hundred years old and is in the classic style with a flat ceiling gilded and a lofty arch supported by pillars between the nave and choir  there are no side aisles but ranges of shrines on both sides of the nave each beneath its own pair of pillars and pediments  the pavement is of brick with here and there a marble tombstone inlaid  it is not a magnificent church but looks dingy with time and apparent neglect though rendered sufficiently interesting by statues of mediaeval date by john of bologna and other old sculptors and by monumental busts and basreliefs also there is a wooden crucifix by giotto with ancient gilding on it and a painting of christ which was considered a wonderful work in its day  each shrine or most of them at any rate had its dark old picture and there is a very old and hideous mosaic of the virgin and two saints which i looked at very slightly with the purpose of immediately forgetting it  savonarola the reforming monk was a brother of this convent and was torn from its shelter to be subsequently hanged and burnt in the grand ducal piazza a large chapel in the left transept is of the salviati family dedicated to st anthony and decorated with several statues of saints and with some old frescos  when we had more than sufficiently examined these the custode proposed to show us some frescos of fra angelico and conducted us into a large cloister under the arches of which and beneath a covering of glass he pointed to a picture of st dominic kneeling at the cross  there are two or three others by the angelic friar in different parts of the cloister and a regular series filling up all the arches by various artists  its foursided cloistered walk surrounds a square open to the sky as usual and paved with gray stones that have no inscriptions but probably are laid over graves  its walls however are incrusted and the walk itself is paved with monumental inscriptions on marble none of which so far as i observed were of ancient date either the fashion of thus commemorating the dead is not ancient in florence or the old tombstones have been removed to make room for new ones  i do not know where the monks themselves have their burialplace perhaps in an inner cloister which we did not see  all the inscriptions here i believe were in memory of persons not connected with the convent  a door in the wall of the cloister admitted us into the chapterhouse its interior moderately spacious with a roof formed by intersecting arches  three sides of the walls were covered with blessed whitewash but on the fourth side opposite to the entrance was a great fresco of the crucifixion by fra angelico surrounded with a border or pictured framework in which are represented the heads of saints prophets and sibyls as large as life  the cross of the saviour and those of the thieves were painted against a dark red sky the figures upon them were lean and attenuated evidently the vague conceptions of a man who had never seen a naked figure  beneath was a multitude of people most of whom were saints who had lived and been martyred long after the crucifixion and some of these had wounds from which gilded rays shone forth as if the inner glory and blessedness of the holy men blazed through them  it is a very ugly picture and its ugliness is not that of strength and vigor but of weakness and incompetency  fra angelico should have confined himself to miniature heads in which his delicacy of touch and minute labor often produce an excellent effect  the custode informed us that there were more frescos of this pious artist in the interior of the convent into which i might be allowed admittance but not my wife  i declined seeing them and heartily thanked heaven for my escape  returning through the church we stopped to look at a shrine on the right of the entrance where several wax candles were lighted and the steps of which were crowded with worshippers  it was evidently a spot of special sanctity and approaching the steps we saw behind a gilded framework of stars and protected by glass a wooden image of the saviour naked covered with spots of blood crowned with thorns and expressing all the human wretchedness that the carvers skill could represent  the whole shrine within the glass was hung with offerings as well of silver and gold as of tinsel and trumpery and the body of christ glistened with gold chains and ornaments and with watches of silver and gold some of which appeared to be of very old manufacture and others might be new amid all this glitter the face of pain and grief looked forth not a whit comforted  while we stood there a woman who had been praying arose from her knees and laid an offering of a single flower upon the shrine  the corresponding arch on the opposite side of the entrance contained a waxwork within a large glass case representing the nativity  i do not remember how the blessed infant looked but the virgin was gorgeously dressed in silks satins and gauzes with spangles and ornaments of all kinds and i believe brooches of real diamonds on her bosom  her attire judging from its freshness and newness of glitter might have been put on that very morning   july 13thwe went for the second time this morning to the academy of fine arts and i looked pretty thoroughly at the preraphaelite pictures few of which are really worth looking at nowadays  cimabue and giotto might certainly be dismissed henceforth and forever without any detriment to the cause of good art  there is what seems to me a better picture than either of these has produced by bonamico buffalmacco an artist of about their date or not long after  the first real picture in the series is the adoration of the magi by gentile da fabriano a really splendid work in all senses with noble and beautiful figures in it and a crowd of personages managed with great skill  three pictures by perugino are the only other ones i cared to look at  in one of these the face of the virgin who holds the dead christ on her knees has a deeper expression of woe than can ever have been painted since  after perugino the pictures cease to be interesting the art came forward with rapid strides but the painters and their productions do not take nearly so much hold of the spectator as before  they all paint better than giotto and cimabuein some respects better than perugino but they paint in vain probably because they were not nearly so much in earnest and meant far less though possessing the dexterity to express far more andrea del sarto appears to have been a good painter yet i always turn away readily from his pictures  i looked again and for a good while at carlo dolces portrait of the eternal father for it is a miracle and masterpiece of absurdity and almost equally a miracle of pictorial art it is the allpowerless a fairhaired soft consumptive deity with a mouth that has fallen open through very weakness  he holds one hand on his stomach as if the wickedness and wretchedness of mankind made him qualmish and he is looking down out of heaven with an expression of pitiable appeal or as if seeking somewhere for assistance in his heavy task of ruling the universe  you might fancy such a being falling on his knees before a strongwilled man and beseeching him to take the reins of omnipotence out of his hands  no wonder that wrong gets the better of right and that good and ill are confounded if the supreme head were as here depicted for i never saw and nobody else ever saw so perfect a representation of a person burdened with a task infinitely above his strength  if carlo dolce had been wicked enough to know what he was doing the picture would have been most blasphemousa satire in the very person of the almighty against all incompetent rulers and against the rickety machine and crazy action of the universe  heaven forgive me for such thoughts as this picture has suggested  it must be added that the great original defect in the character as here represented is an easy goodnature  i wonder what michael angelo would have said to this painting  in the large enclosed court connected with the academy there are a number of statues basreliefs and casts and what was especially interesting the vague and rude commencement of a statue of st matthew by michael angelo  the conceptions of this great sculptor were so godlike that he seems to have been discontented at not likewise possessing the godlike attribute of creating and embodying them with an instantaneous thought and therefore we often find sculptures from his hand left at the critical point of their struggle to get out of the marble  the statue of st matthew looks like the antediluvian fossil of a human being of an epoch when humanity was mightier and more majestic than now long ago imprisoned in stone and half uncovered again   july 16thwe went yesterday forenoon to see the bargello  i do not know anything more picturesque in florence than the great interior court of this ancient palace of the podesta with the lofty height of the edifice looking down into the enclosed space dark and stern and the armorial bearings of a long succession of magistrates carved in stone upon the walls a garland as it were of these gothic devices extending quite round the court  the best feature of the whole is the broad stone staircase with its heavy balustrade ascending externally from the court to the irongrated door in the second story  we passed the sentinels under the lofty archway that communicates with the street and went up the stairs without being questioned or impeded  at the irongrated door however we were met by two officials in uniform who courteously informed us that there was nothing to be exhibited in the bargello except an old chapel containing some frescos by giotto and that these could only be seen by making a previous appointment with the custode he not being constantly on hand  i was not sorry to escape the frescos though one of them is a portrait of dante  we next went to the church of the badia which is built in the form of a greek cross with a flat roof embossed and once splendid with now tarnished gold  the pavement is of brick and the walls of dark stone similar to that of the interior of the cathedral pietra serena and there being according to florentine custom but little light the effect was sombre though the cool gloomy dusk was refreshing after the hot turmoil and dazzle of the adjacent street  here we found three or four gothic tombs with figures of the deceased persons stretched in marble slumber upon them  there were likewise a picture or two which it was impossible to see indeed i have hardly ever met with a picture in a church that was not utterly wasted and thrown away in the deep shadows of the chapel it was meant to adorn  if there is the remotest chance of its being seen the sacristan hangs a curtain before it for the sake of his fee for withdrawing it  in the chapel of the bianco family we saw if it could be called seeing what is considered the finest oilpainting of fra filippo lippi  it was evidently hung with reference to a lofty window on the other side of the church whence sufficient light might fall upon it to show a picture so vividly painted as this is and as most of fra filippo lippis are  the window was curtained however and the chapel so dusky that i could make out nothing  several persons came in to say their prayers during the little time that we remained in the church and as we came out we passed a good woman who sat knitting in the coolness of the vestibule which was lined with mural tombstones  probably she spends the day thus keeping up the little industry of her fingers slipping into the church to pray whenever a devotional impulse swells into her heart and asking an alms as often as she sees a person of charitable aspect  from the church we went to the uffizi gallery and reinspected the greater part of it pretty faithfully  we had the good fortune too again to get admittance into the cabinet of bronzes where we admired anew the wonderful airiness of john of bolognas mercury which as i now observed rests on nothing substantial but on the breath of a zephyr beneath him  we also saw a bronze bust of one of the medici by benvenuto cellini and a thousand other things the curiosity of which is overlaid by their multitude  the roman eagle which i have recorded to be about the size of a blackbird i now saw to be as large as a pigeon  on our way towards the door of the gallery at our departure we saw the cabinet of gems open and again feasted our eyes with its concentrated brilliancies and magnificences  among them were two crystal cups with engraved devices and covers of enamelled gold wrought by benvenuto cellini and wonderfully beautiful  but it is idle to mention one or two things when all are so beautiful and curious idle too because language is not burnished gold with here and there a brighter word flashing like a diamond and therefore no amount of talk will give the slightest idea of one of these elaborate handiworks   july 27thi seldom go out nowadays having already seen florence tolerably well and the streets being very hot and myself having been engaged in sketching out a romance the marble fauned which whether it will ever come to anything is a point yet to be decided  at any rate it leaves me little heart for journalizing and describing new things and six months of uninterrupted monotony would be more valuable to me just now than the most brilliant succession of novelties  yesterday i spent a good deal of time in watching the setting out of a wedding party from our door the bride being the daughter of an english lady the countess of   after all there was nothing very characteristic  the bridegroom is a young man of english birth son of the countess of st g who inhabits the third piano of this casa del bello  the very curious part of the spectacle was the swarm of beggars who haunted the street all day the most wretched mob conceivable chiefly women with a few blind people and some old men and boys  among these the bridal party distributed their beneficence in the shape of some handfuls of copper with here and there a halfpaul intermixed whereupon the whole wretched mob flung themselves in a heap upon the pavement struggling lighting tumbling one over another and then looking up to the windows with petitionary gestures for more and more and still for more  doubtless they had need enough for they looked thin sickly illfed and the women ugly to the last degree  the wedding party had a breakfast above stairs which lasted till four oclock and then the bridegroom took his bride in a barouche and pair which was already crammed with his own luggage and hers     he was a welllooking young man enough in a uniform of french gray with silver epaulets more agreeable in aspect than his bride who i think will have the upper hand in their domestic life  i observed that on getting into the barouche he sat down on her dress as he could not well help doing and received a slight reprimand in consequence  after their departure the wedding guests took their leave the most noteworthy person being the popes nuncio the young man being son of the popes chamberlain and one of the grand dukes noble guard an ecclesiastical personage in purple stockings attended by two priests all of whom got into a coach the driver and footmen of which wore goldlaced cocked hats and other splendors  today i paid a short visit to the gallery of the pitti palace  i looked long at a madonna of raphaels the one which is usually kept in the grand dukes private apartments only brought into the public gallery for the purpose of being copied  it is the holiest of all raphaels madonnas with a great reserve in the expression a sense of being apart and yet with the utmost tenderness and sweetness although she drops her eyelids before her like a veil as it were and has a primness of eternal virginity about the mouth  it is one of raphaels earlier works when he mixed more religious sentiment with his paint than afterwards peruginos pictures give the impression of greater sincerity and earnestness than raphaels though the genius of raphael often gave him miraculous vision   july 28thlast evening we went to the powerss and sat with them on the terrace at the top of the house till nearly ten oclock  it was a delightful calm summer evening and we were elevated far above all the adjacent roofs and had a prospect of the greater part of florence and its towers and the surrounding hills while directly beneath us rose the trees of a garden and they hardly sent their summits higher than we sat at a little distance with only a house or two between was a theatre in full action the teatro goldoni which is an open amphitheatre in the ancient fashion without any roof  we could see the upper part of the proscenium and had we been a little nearer might have seen the whole performance as did several boys who crept along the tops of the surrounding houses  as it was we heard the music and the applause and now and then an actors stentorian tones when we chose to listen  mrs p and my wife u and master bob sat in a group together and chatted in one corner of our aerial drawingroom while mr powers and myself leaned against the parapet and talked of innumerable things when the clocks struck the hour or the bells rang from the steeples as they are continually doing i spoke of the sweetness of the florence bells the tones of some of them being as if the bell were full of liquid melody and shed it through the air on being upturned  i had supposed in my lack of musical ear that the bells of the campanile were the sweetest but mr powers says that there is a defect in their tone and that the bell of the palazzo vecchio is the most melodious he ever heard then he spoke of his having been a manufacturer of organs or at least of reeds for organs at one period of his life  i wonder what he has not been  he told me of an invention of his in the musical line a jewsharp with two tongues and by and by he produced it for my inspection  it was carefully kept in a little wooden case and was very neatly and elaborately constructed with screws to tighten it and a silver centrepiece between the two tongues  evidently a great deal of thought had been bestowed on this little harp but mr powers told me that it was an utter failure because the tongues were apt to interfere and jar with one another although the strain of music was very sweet and melodious as he proved by playing on it a littlewhen everything went right  it was a youthful production and he said that its failure had been a great disappointment to him at the time whereupon i congratulated him that his failures had been in small matters and his successes in great ones  we talked furthermore about instinct and reason and whether the brute creation have souls and if they have none how justice is to be done them for their sufferings here and mr powers came finally to the conclusion that brutes suffer only in appearance and that god enjoys for them all that they seem to enjoy and that man is the only intelligent and sentient being  we reasoned high about other states of being and i suggested the possibility that there might be beings inhabiting this earth contemporaneously with us and close beside us but of whose existence and whereabout we could have no perception nor they of ours because we are endowed with different sets of senses for certainly it was in gods power to create beings who should communicate with nature by innumerable other senses than those few which we possess  mr powers gave hospitable reception to this idea and said that it had occurred to himself and he has evidently thought much and earnestly about such matters but is apt to let his idea crystallize into a theory before he can have sufficient data for it  he is a swedenborgian in faith  the moon had risen behind the trees while we were talking and powers intimated his idea that beings analogous to menmen in everything except the modifications necessary to adapt them to their physical circumstancesinhabited the planets and peopled them with beautiful shapes  each planet however must have its own standard of the beautiful i suppose and probably his sculptors eye would not see much to admire in the proportions of an inhabitant of saturn  the atmosphere of florence at least when we ascend a little way into it suggests planetary speculations  galileo found it so and mr powers and i pervaded the whole universe but finally crept down his garretstairs and parted with a friendly pressure of the hand    villa montanto  monte beni   august 2dwe had grown weary of the heat of florence within the walls     there being little opportunity for air and exercise except within the precincts of our little garden which also we feared might breed malaria or something akin to it  we have therefore taken this suburban villa for the two next months and yesterday morning we all came out hither  j  had preceded us with b p  the villa is on a hill called bellosguardo about a mile beyond the porta romana  less than half an hours walk brought us who were on foot to the iron gate of our villa which we found shut and locked  we shouted to be let in and while waiting for somebody to appear there was a good opportunity to contemplate the external aspect of the villa  after we had waited a few minutes j came racing down to the gate laughing heartily and said that bob and he had been in the house but had come out shutting the door behind them and as the door closed with a springlock they could not get in again  now as the key of the outer gate as well as that of the house itself was in the pocket of js coat left inside we were shut out of our own castle and compelled to carry on a siege against it without much likelihood of taking it although the garrison was willing to surrender  but b p called in the assistance of the contadini who cultivate the ground and live in the farmhouse close by and one of them got into a window by means of a ladder so that the keys were got the gates opened and we finally admitted  before examining any other part of the house we climbed to the top of the tower which indeed is not very high in proportion to its massive square  very probably its original height was abbreviated in compliance with the law that lowered so many of the fortified towers of noblemen within the walls of florence     the stairs were not of stone built in with the original mass of the tower as in english castles but of now decayed wood which shook beneath us and grew more and more crazy as we ascended  it will not be many years before the height of the tower becomes unattainable     near at hand in the vicinity of the city we saw the convent of monte olivetto and other structures that looked like convents being built round an enclosed square also numerous white villas many of which had towers like that we were standing upon square and massive some of them battlemented on the summit and others apparently modernized for domestic purposes  among them u pointed out galileos tower whither she made an excursion the other day  it looked lower than our own but seemed to stand on a higher elevation  we also saw the dukes villa the poggio with a long avenue of cypresses leading from it as if a funeral were going forth  and having wasted thus much of description on the landscape i will finish with saying that it lacked only water to be a very fine one  it is strange what a difference the gleam of water makes and how a scene awakens and comes to life wherever it is visible  the landscape moreover gives the beholder at least this beholder a sense of oppressive sunshine and scanty shade and does not incite a longing to wander through it on foot as a really delightful landscape should  the vine too being cultivated in so trim a manner does not suggest that idea of luxuriant fertility which is the poetical notion of a vineyard  the oliveorchards have a pale and unlovely hue  an english view would have been incomparably richer in its neverfading green and in my own country the wooded hills would have been more delightful than these peaks and ridges of dreary and barren sunshine and there would have been the bright eyes of half a dozen little lakes looking heavenward within an extent like that of the val d arno  by and by mammas carriage came along the dusty road and passed through the iron gateway which we had left open for her reception  we shouted down to her and r and they waved their handkerchiefs upward to us and on my way down i met r and the servant coming up through the ghostly rooms  the rest of the day we spent mostly in exploring the premises  the house itself is of almost bewildering extent insomuch that we might each of us have a suite of rooms individually  i have established myself on the groundfloor where i have a dressingroom a large vaulted saloon hung with yellow damask and a square writingstudy the walls and ceilings of the two latter apartments being ornamented with angels and cherubs aloft in fresco and with temples statues vases broken columns peacocks parrots vines and sunflowers below  i know not how many more saloons anterooms and sleepingchambers there are on this same basement story besides an equal number over them and a great subterranean establishment  i saw some immense jars there which i suppose were intended to hold oil and iron kettles for what purpose i cannot tell there is also a chapel in the house but it is locked up and we cannot yet with certainty find the door of it nor even in this great wilderness of a house decide absolutely what space the holy precincts occupy  adjoining us chamber which is in the tower there is a little oratory hung round with sacred prints of very ancient date and with crucifixes holywater vases and other consecrated things and here within a glass case there is the representation of an undraped little boy in wax very prettily modelled and holding up a heart that looks like a bit of red sealingwax  if i had found him anywhere else i should have taken him for cupid but being in an oratory i presume him to have some religious signification  in the servants room a crucifix hung on one side of the bed and a little vase for holy water now overgrown with a cobweb on the other and no doubt all the other sleepingapartments would have been equally well provided only that their occupants were to be heretics  the lower floor of the house is tolerably furnished and looks cheerful with its frescos although the bare pavements in every room give an impression of discomfort  but carpets are universally taken up in italy during summertime  it must have been an immense family that could have ever filled such a house with life  we go on voyages of discovery and when in quest of any particular point are likely enough to fetch up at some other  this morning i had difficulty in finding my way again to the top of the tower  one of the most peculiar rooms is constructed close to the tower under the roof of the main building but with no external walls on two sides  it is thus left open to the air i presume for the sake of coolness  a parapet runs round the exposed sides for the sake of security  some of the palaces in florence have such open loggias in their upper stories and i saw others on our journey hither after arriving in tuscany  the grounds immediately around the house are laid out in gravelwalks and ornamented with shrubbery and with what ought to be a grassy lawn but the italian sun is quite as little favorable to beauty of that kind as our own  i have enjoyed the luxury however almost for the first time since i left my hilltop at the wayside of flinging myself at full length on the ground without any fear of catching cold  moist england would punish a man soundly for taking such liberties with her greensward a podere or cultivated tract comprising several acres belongs to the villa and seems to be fertile like all the surrounding country  the possessions of different proprietors are not separated by fences but only marked out by ditches and it seems possible to walk miles and miles along the intersecting paths without obstruction  the rural laborers so far as i have observed go about in their shirtsleeves and look very much like tanned and sunburnt yankees  last night it was really a work of time and toil to go about making our defensive preparations for the night first closing the iron gate then the ponderous and complicated fastenings of the house door then the separate barricadoes of each ironbarred window on the lower floor with a somewhat slighter arrangement above  there are bolts and shutters however for every window in the house and i suppose it would not be amiss to put them all in use  our garrison is so small that we must depend more upon the strength of our fortifications than upon our own active efforts in case of an attack  in england in an insulated country house we should need all these bolts and bars and italy is not thought to be the safer country of the two  it deserves to be recorded that the count montanto a nobleman and seemingly a man of property should deem it worth while to let his country seat and reside during the hot months in his palace in the city for the consideration of a comparatively small sum a month  he seems to contemplate returning hither for the autumn and winter when the situation must be very windy and bleak and the cold deathlike in these great halls and then it is to be supposed he will let his palace in town  the count through the agency of his son bargained very stiffly for and finally obtained three dollars in addition to the sum which we at first offered him  this indicates that even a little money is still a matter of great moment in italy  signor del bello who i believe is also a nobleman haggled with us about some cracked crockery at our late residence and finally demanded and received fifty cents in compensation but this poor gentleman has been a spendthrift and now acts as the agent of another   august 3dyesterday afternoon william story called on me he being on a day or twos excursion from siena where he is spending the summer with his family  he was very entertaining and conversative as usual and said in reply to my question whether he were not anxious to return to cleopatra that he had already sketched out another subject for sculpture which would employ him during next winter  he told me what i was glad to hear that his sketches of italian life intended for the atlantic monthly and supposed to be lost have been recovered speaking of the superstitiousness of the italians he said that they universally believe in the influence of the evil eye  the evil influence is supposed not to be dependent on the will of the possessor of the evil eye on the contrary the persons to whom he wishes well are the very ones to suffer by it  it is oftener found in monks than in any other class of people and on meeting a monk and encountering his eye an italian usually makes a defensive sign by putting both hands behind him with the forefingers and little fingers extended although it is a controverted point whether it be not more efficacious to extend the hand with its outspread fingers towards the suspected person  it is considered an evil omen to meet a monk on first going out for the day the evil eye may be classified with the phenomena of mesmerism  the italians especially the neapolitans very generally wear amulets  pio nono perhaps as being the chief of all monks and other religious people is supposed to have an evil eye of tenfold malignancy and its effect has been seen in the ruin of all schemes for the public good so soon as they are favored by him  when the pillar in the piazza de spagna commemorative of his dogma of the immaculate conception was to be erected the people of rome refused to be present or to have anything to do with it unless the pope promised to abstain from interference  his holiness did promise but so far broke his word as to be present one day while it was being erected and on that day a man was killed  a little while ago there was a lord clifford an english catholic nobleman residing in italy and happening to come to rome he sent his compliments to pio nono and requested the favor of an interview  the pope as it happened was indisposed or for some reason could not see his lordship but very kindly sent him his blessing  those who knew of it shook their heads and intimated that it would go ill with his lordship now that he had been blessed by pio nono and the very next day poor lord clifford was dead  his holiness had better construe the scriptural injunction literally and take to blessing his enemies  i walked into town with j this morning and meeting a monk in the via furnace i thought it no more than reasonable as the good father fixed his eyes on me to provide against the worst by putting both hands behind me with the forefingers and little fingers stuck out  in speaking of the little oratory connected with us chamber i forgot to mention the most remarkable object in it  it is a skull the size of life or death     this part of the house must be very old probably coeval with the tower  the ceiling of us apartment is vaulted with intersecting arches and adjoining it is a very large saloon likewise with a vaulted and groined ceiling and having a cushioned divan running all round the walls  the windows of these rooms look out on the val d arno  the apartment above this saloon is of the same size and hung with engraved portraits printed on large sheets by the score and hundred together and enclosed in wooden frames  they comprise the whole series of roman emperors the succession of popes the kings of europe the doges of venice and the sultans of turkey  the engravings bear different dates between 1685 and thirty years later and were executed at rome   august 4thwe ascended our tower yesterday afternoon to see the sunset in my first sketch of the val d arno i said that the arno seemed to hold its course near the bases of the hills  i now observe that the line of trees which marks its current divides the valley into two pretty equal parts and the river runs nearly east and west     at last when it was growing dark we went down groping our way over the shaky staircases and peeping into each dark chamber as we passed  i gratified j exceedingly by hitting my nose against the wall  reaching the bottom i went into the great saloon and stood at a window watching the lights twinkle forth near and far in the valley and listening to the convent bells that sounded from monte olivetto and more remotely still the stars came out and the constellation of the dipper hung exactly over the val d arno pointing to the north star above the hills on my right   august 12thwe drove into town yesterday afternoon with miss blagden to call on mr kirkup an old englishman who has resided a great many years in florence  he is noted as an antiquarian and has the reputation of being a necromancer not undeservedly as he is deeply interested in spiritrappings and holds converse through a medium with dead poets and emperors  he lives in an old house formerly a residence of the knights templars hanging over the arno just as you come upon the ponte vecchio and going up a dark staircase and knocking at a door on one side of the landingplace we were received by mr kirkup  he had had notice of our visit and was prepared for it being dressed in a blue frockcoat of rather an old fashion with a velvet collar and in a thin waistcoat and pantaloons fresh from the drawer looking very sprucely in short and unlike his customary guise for miss blagden hinted to us that the poor gentleman is generally so untidy that it is not quite pleasant to take him by the hand  he is rather low of stature with a pale shrivelled face and hair and beard perfectly white and the hair of a particularly soft and silken texture  he has a high thin nose of the english aristocratic type his eyes have a queer rather wild look and the eyebrows are arched above them so that he seems all the time to be seeing something that strikes him with surprise  i judged him to be a little crackbrained chiefly on the strength of this expression  his whole make is delicate his hands white and small and his appearance and manners those of a gentleman with rather more embroidery of courtesy than belongs to an englishman  he appeared to be very nervous tremulous indeed to his fingers ends without being in any degree disturbed or embarrassed by our presence  finally he is very deaf an infirmity that quite took away my pleasure in the interview because it is impossible to say anything worth while when one is compelled to raise ones voice above its ordinary level  he ushered us through two or three large rooms dark dusty hung with antiquelooking pictures and lined with bookcases containing i doubt not a very curious library  indeed he directed my attention to one case and said that he had collected those works in former days merely for the sake of laughing at them  they were books of magic and occult sciences  what he seemed really to value however were some manuscript copies of dante of which he showed us two one a folio on parchment beautifully written in german text the letters as clear and accurately cut as printed type the other a small volume fit as mr kirkup said to be carried in a capacious mediaeval sleeve  this also was on vellum and as elegantly executed as the larger one but the larger had beautiful illuminations the vermilion and gold of which looked as brilliant now as they did five centuries ago  both of these books were written early in the fourteenth century  mr kirkup has also a plaster cast of dantes face which he believes to be the original one taken from his face after death and he has likewise his own accurate tracing from giottos fresco of dante in the chapel of the bargello  this fresco was discovered through mr kirkups means and the tracing is particularly valuable because the original has been almost destroyed by rough usage in drawing out a nail that had been driven into the eye  it represents the profile of a youthful but melancholy face and has the general outline of dantes features in other portraits  dante has held frequent communications with mr kirkup through a medium the poet being described by the medium as wearing the same dress seen in the youthful portrait but as hearing more resemblance to the cast taken from his dead face than to the picture from his youthful one  there was a very good picture of savonarola in one of the rooms and many other portraits paintings and drawings some of them ancient and others the work of mr kirkup himself  he has the torn fragment of an exquisite drawing of a nude figure by rubens and a portfolio of other curious drawings  and besides books and works of art he has no end of antique knickknackeries none of which we had any time to look at among others some instruments with which nuns used to torture themselves in their convents by way of penance  but the greatest curiosity of all and no antiquity was a pale largeeyed little girl about four years old who followed the conjurers footsteps wherever he went  she was the brightest and merriest little thing in the world and frisked through those shadowy old chambers among the dead peoples trumpery as gayly as a butterfly flits among flowers and sunshine  the childs mother was a beautiful girl named regina whose portrait mr kirkup showed us on the wall  i never saw a more beautiful and striking face claiming to be a real one  she was a florentine of low birth and she lived with the old necromancer as his spiritual medium  he showed us a journal kept during her lifetime and read from it his notes of an interview with the czar alexander when that potentate communicated to mr kirkup that he had been poisoned  the necromancer set a great value upon regina     and when she died he received her poor baby into his heart and now considers it absolutely his own  at any rate it is a happy belief for him since he has nothing else in the world to love and loves the child entirely and enjoys all the bliss of fatherhood though he must have lived as much as seventy years before he began to taste it  the child inherits her mothers gift of communication with the spiritual world so that the conjurer can still talk with regina through the baby which she left and not only with her but with dante and any other great spirit that may choose to visit him  it is a very strange story and this child might be put at once into a romance with all her history and environment the ancient knight templar palace with the arno flowing under the ironbarred windows and the ponte vecchio covered with its jewellers shops close at hand the dark lofty chambers with faded frescos on the ceilings black pictures hanging on the walls old books on the shelves and hundreds of musty antiquities emitting an odor of past centuries the shrivelled whitebearded old man thinking all the time of ghosts and looking into the childs eyes to seek them and the child herself springing so freshly out of the soil so pretty so intelligent so playful with never a playmate save the conjurer and a kitten  it is a persian kitten and lay asleep in a window but when i touched it it started up at once in as gamesome a mood as the child herself  the child looks pale and no wonder seldom or never stirring out of that old palace or away from the river atmosphere  miss blagden advised mr kirkup to go with her to the seaside or into the country and he did not deny that it might do her good but seemed to be hampered by an old mans sluggishness and dislike of change  i think he will not live a great while for he seems very frail  when he dies the little girl will inherit what property he may leave  a lady catharine fleeting an englishwoman and a friend of mr kirkup has engaged to take her in charge  she followed us merrily to the door and so did the persian kitten and mr kirkup shook hands with us over and over again with vivacious courtesy his manner having been characterized by a great deal of briskness throughout the interview  he expressed himself delighted to have met one whose books he had read and said that the day would be a memorable one to himwhich i did not in the least believe  mr kirkup is an intimate friend of trelawny author of adventures of a younger son and long ago the latter promised him that if he ever came into possession of the family estate he would divide it with him trelawny did really succeed to the estate and lost no time in forwarding to his friend the legal documents entitling him to half of the property but mr kirkup declined the gift as he himself was not destitute and trelawny had a brother  there were two pictures of trelawny in the saloons one a slight sketch on the wall the other a halflength portrait in a turkish dress both handsome but indicating no very amiable character  it is not easy to forgive trelawny for uncovering dead byrons limbs and telling that terrible story about themequally disgraceful to himself be it truth or a lie  it seems that regina had a lover and a sister who was very disreputable it rather adds than otherwise to the romance of the affairthe idea that this pretty little elf has no right whatever to the asylum which she has found  her name is imogen  the small manuscript copy of dante which he showed me was written by a florentine gentleman of the fourteenth century one of whose ancestors the poet had met and talked with in paradise   august 19thhere is a good italian incident which i find in valery andrea del castagno was a painter in florence in the fifteenth century and he had a friend likewise a painter domenico of venice  the latter had the secret of painting in oils and yielded to castagnos entreaties to impart it to him  desirous of being the sole possessor of this great secret castagno waited only the night to assassinate domenico who so little suspected his treachery that he besought those who found him bleeding and dying to take him to his friend castagno that he might die in his arms  the murderer lived to be seventyfour years old and his crime was never suspected till he himself revealed it on his deathbed domenico did actually die in castagnos arms  the death scene would have been a good one for the latter to paint in oils   september 1stfew things journalizable have happened during the last month because florence and the neighborhood have lost their novelty and furthermore i usually spend the whole day at home having been engaged in planning and sketching out a romance  i have now done with this for the present and mean to employ the rest of the time we stay here chiefly in revisiting the galleries and seeing what remains to be seen in florence  last saturday august 28th we went to take tea at miss blagdens who has a weekly reception on that evening  we found mr powers there and by and by mr boott and mr trollope came in  miss  has lately been exercising her faculties as a spiritual writingmedium and the conversation turning on that subject mr powers related some things that he had witnessed through the agency of mr home who had held a session or two at his house  he described the apparition of two mysterious hands from beneath a table round which the party were seated  these hands purported to belong to the aunt of the countess cotterel who was present and were a pair of thin delicate aged ladylike hands and arms appearing at the edge of the table and terminating at the elbow in a sort of white mist  one of the hands took up a fan and began to use it  the countess then said fan yourself as you used to do dear aunt and forthwith the hands waved the fan back and forth in a peculiar manner which the countess recognized as the manner of her dead aunt the spirit was then requested to fan each member of the party and accordingly each separate individual round the table was fanned in turn and felt the breeze sensibly upon his face  finally the hands sank beneath the table i believe mr powers said but i am not quite sure that they did not melt into the air  during this apparition mr home sat at the table but not in such a position or within such distance that he could have put out or managed the spectral hands and of this mr powers satisfied himself by taking precisely the same position after the party had retired  mr powers did not feel the hands at this time but he afterwards felt the touch of infant hands which were at the time invisible  he told of many of the wonders which seem to have as much right to be set down as facts as anything else that depends on human testimony  for example mr k one of the party gave a sudden start and exclamation  he had felt on his knee a certain token which could have been given him only by a friend long ago in his grave  mr powers inquired what was the last thing that had been given as a present to a deceased child and suddenly both he and his wife felt a prick as of some sharp instrument on their knees  the present had been a penknife i have forgotten other incidents quite as striking as these but with the exception of the spirithands they seemed to be akin to those that have been produced by mesmerism returning the inquirers thoughts and veiled recollections to himself as answers to his queries  the hands are certainly an inexplicable phenomenon  of course they are not portions of a dead body nor any other kind of substance they are impressions on the two senses sight and touch but how produced i cannot tell  even admitting their appearanceand certainly i do admit it as freely and fully as if i had seen them myselfthere is no need of supposing them to come from the world of departed spirits  powers seems to put entire faith in the verity of spiritual communications while acknowledging the difficulty of identifying spirits as being what they pretend to be  he is a swedenborgian and so far prepared to put faith in many of these phenomena  as for home powers gives a decided opinion that he is a knave but thinks him so organized nevertheless as to be a particularly good medium for spiritual communications  spirits i suppose like earthly people are obliged to use such instruments as will answer their purposes but rather than receive a message from a dead friend through the organism of a rogue or charlatan methinks i would choose to wait till we meet  but what most astonishes me is the indifference with which i listen to these marvels they throw old ghost stories quite into the shade they bring the whole world of spirits down amongst us visibly and audibly they are absolutely proved to be sober facts by evidence that would satisfy us of any other alleged realities and yet i cannot force my mind to interest myself in them  they are facts to my understanding which it might have been anticipated would have been the last to acknowledge them but they seem not to be facts to my intuitions and deeper perceptions  my inner soul does not in the least admit them there is a mistake somewhere  so idle and empty do i feel these stories to be that i hesitated long whether or no to give up a few pages of this not very important journal to the record of them  we have had written communications through miss  with several spirits my wifes father mother two brothers and a sister who died long ago in infancy a certain mary hall who announces herself as the guardian spirit of miss  and queerest of all a mary runnel who seems to be a wandering spirit having relations with nobody but thrusts her finger into everybodys affairs  my wifes mother is the principal communicant she expresses strong affection and rejoices at the opportunity of conversing with her daughter  she often says very pretty things for instance in a dissertation upon heavenly music but there is a lack of substance in her talk a want of gripe a delusive show a sentimental surface with no bottom beneath it  the same sort of thing has struck me in all the poetry and prose that i have read from spiritual sources  i should judge that these effusions emanated from earthly minds but had undergone some process that had deprived them of solidity and warmth  in the communications between my wife and her mother i cannot help thinking that miss  being unconsciously in a mesmeric state all the responses are conveyed to her fingers from my wifes mind      we have tried the spirits by various test questions on every one of which they have failed egregiously  here however the aforesaid mary runnel comes into play  the other spirits have told us that the veracity of this spirit is not to be depended upon and so whenever it is possible poor mary runnel is thrust forward to bear the odium of every mistake or falsehood  they have avowed themselves responsible for all statements signed by themselves and have thereby brought themselves into more than one inextricable dilemma but it is very funny where a response or a matter of fact has not been thus certified how invariably mary runnel is made to assume the discredit of it on its turning out to be false  it is the most ingenious arrangement that could possibly have been contrived and somehow or other the pranks of this lying spirit give a reality to the conversations which the more respectable ghosts quite fail in imparting  the whole matter seems to me a sort of dreaming awake  it resembles a dream in that the whole material is from the first in the dreamers mind though concealed at various depths below the surface the dead appear alive as they always do in dreams unexpected combinations occur as continually in dreams the mind speaks through the various persons of the drama and sometimes astonishes itself with its own wit wisdom and eloquence as often in dreams but in both cases the intellectual manifestations are really of a very flimsy texture  mary runnel is the only personage who does not come evidently from dreamland and she i think represents that lurking scepticism that sense of unreality of which we are often conscious amid the most vivid phantasmagoria of a dream  i should be glad to believe in the genuineness of these spirits if i could but the above is the conclusion to which my soberest thoughts tend  there remains of course a great deal for which i cannot account and i cannot sufficiently wonder at the pigheadedness both of metaphysicians and physiologists in not accepting the phenomena so far as to make them the subject of investigation  in writing the communications miss  holds the pencil rather loosely between her fingers it moves rapidly and with equal facility whether she fixes her eyes on the paper or not  the handwriting has far more freedom than her own  at the conclusion of a sentence the pencil lays itself down  she sometimes has a perception of each word before it is written at other times she is quite unconscious what is to come next  her integrity is absolutely indubitable and she herself totally disbelieves in the spiritual authenticity of what is communicated through her medium   september 3dwe walked into florence yesterday betimes after breakfast it being comfortably cool and a gray english sky though indeed the clouds had a tendency to mass themselves more than they do on an overcast english day  we found it warmer in florence but not inconveniently so even in the sunniest streets and squares  we went to the uffizi gallery the whole of which with its contents is now familiar to us except the room containing drawings and our todays visit was especially to them  the door giving admittance to them is the very last in the gallery and the rooms three in number are i should judge over the loggia de lanzi looking on the grand ducal piazza  the drawings hang on the walls framed and glazed and number perhaps from one to two hundred in each room but this is only a small portion of the collection which amounts it is said to twenty thousand and is reposited in portfolios  the sketches on the walls are changed from time to time so as to exhibit all the most interesting ones in turn their whole charm is artistic imaginative and intellectual and in no degree of the upholstery kind their outward presentment being in general a design hastily shadowed out by means of colored crayons on tinted paper or perhaps scratched rudely in pen and ink or drawn in pencil or charcoal and half rubbed out very rough things indeed in many instances and the more interesting on that account because it seems as if the artist had bestirred himself to catch the first glimpse of an image that did but reveal itself and vanish  the sheets or sometimes scraps of paper on which they are drawn are discolored with age creased soiled but yet you are magnetized by the hand of raphael michael angelo leonardo or whoever may have jotted down those roughlooking mastertouches  they certainly possess a charm that is lost in the finished picture and i was more sensible of forecasting thought skill and prophetic design in these sketches than in the most consummate works that have been elaborated from them  there is something more divine in these for i suppose the first idea of a picture is real inspiration and all the subsequent elaboration of the master serves but to cover up the celestial germ with something that belongs to himself at any rate the first sketch is the more suggestive and sets the spectators imagination at work whereas the picture if a good one leaves him nothing to do if bad it confuses stupefies disenchants and disheartens him  first thoughts have an aroma and fragrance in them that they do not lose in three hundred years for so old and a good deal more are some of these sketches  none interested me more than some drawings on separate pieces of paper by perugino for his picture of the mother and friends of jesus round his dead body now at the pitti palace  the attendant figures are distinctly made out as if the virgin and john and mary magdalen had each favored the painter with a sitting but the body of jesus lies in the midst dimly hinted with a few pencilmarks  there were several designs by michael angelo none of which made much impression on me the most striking was a very ugly demon afterwards painted in the sistine chapel  raphael shows several sketches of madonnasone of which has flowered into the grand dukes especial madonna at the pitti palace but with a different face  his sketches were mostly very rough in execution but there were two or three designs for frescos i think in the vatican very carefully executed perhaps because these works were mainly to be done by other hands than his own it seems to one that the preraphaelite artists made more careful drawings than the later ones and it rather surprised me to see how much science they possessed  we looked at few other things in the gallery and indeed it was not one of the days when works of art find me impressible  we stopped a little while in the tribune but the venus de medici seemed to me today little more than any other piece of yellowish white marble  how strange that a goddess should stand before us absolutely unrecognized even when we know by previous revelations that she is nothing short of divine  it is also strange that unless when one feels the ideal charm of a statue it becomes one of the most tedious and irksome things in the world  either it must be a celestial thing or an old lump of stone dusty and timesoiled and tiring out your patience with eternally looking just the same  once in a while you penetrate through the crust of the old sameness and see the statue forever new and immortally young  leaving the gallery we walked towards the duomo and on our way stopped to look at the beautiful gothic niches hollowed into the exterior walls of the church of san michele  they are now in the process of being cleaned and each niche is elaborately inlaid with precious marbles and some of them magnificently gilded and they are all surmounted with marble canopies as light and graceful as frostwork  within stand statues st george and many other saints by donatello and others and all taking a hold upon ones sympathies even if they be not beautiful classic statues escape you with their slippery beauty as if they were made of ice  rough and ugly things can be clutched  this is nonsense and yet it means something     the streets were thronged and vociferative with more life and outcry than usual  it must have been marketday in florence for the commerce of the streets was in great vigor narrow tables being set out in them and in the squares burdened with all kinds of small merchandise such as cheap jewelry glistening as brightly as what we had just seen in the gemroom of the uffizi crockery ware toys books italian and french silks slippers old iron all advertised by the dealers with terribly loud and high voices that reverberated harshly from side to side of the narrow streets  italian streetcries go through the head not that they are so very sharp but exceedingly hard like a blunt iron bar  we stood at the base of the campanile and looked at the basreliefs which wreathe it round and above them a row of statues and from bottom to top a marvellous minuteness of inlaid marbles filling up the vast and beautiful design of this heavenaspiring tower  looking upward to its lofty summitwhere angels might alight lapsing downward from heaven and gaze curiously at the bustle of men belowi could not but feel that there is a moral charm in this faithful minuteness of gothic architecture filling up its outline with a million of beauties that perhaps may never be studied out by a single spectator  it is the very process of nature and no doubt produces an effect that we know not of classic architecture is nothing but an outline and affords no little points no interstices where human feelings may cling and overgrow it like ivy  the charm as i said seems to be moral rather than intellectual for in the gemroom of the uffizi you may see fifty designs elaborated on a small scale that have just as much merit as the design of the campanile  if it were only five inches long it might be a case for some article of toilet being two hundred feet high its prettiness develops into grandeur as well as beauty and it becomes really one of the wonders of the world  the design of the pantheon on the contrary would retain its sublimity on whatever scale it might be represented  returning homewards we crossed the ponte vecchio and went to the museum of natural history where we gained admittance into the rooms dedicated to galileo  they consist of a vestibule a saloon and a semicircular tribune covered with a frescoed dome beneath which stands a colossal statue of galileo longbearded and clad in a students gown or some voluminous garb of that kind  around the tribune beside and behind the statue are six nichesin one of which is preserved a forefinger of galileo fixed on a little gilt pedestal and pointing upward under a glass cover  it is very much shrivelled and mummylike of the color of parchment and is little more than a fingerbone with the dry skin or flesh flaking away from it on the whole not a very delightful relic but galileo used to point heavenward with this finger and i hope has gone whither he pointed  another niche contains two telescopes wherewith he made some of his discoveries they are perhaps a yard long and of very small calibre other astronomical instruments are displayed in the glass cases that line the rooms but i did not understand their use any better than the monks who wished to burn galileo for his heterodoxy about the planetary system      after dinner i climbed the tower     florence lay in the sunshine level compact and small of compass  above the tiled roofs rose the tower of the palazzo vecchio the loftiest and the most picturesque though built i suppose with no idea of making it so  but it attains in a singular degree the end of causing the imagination to fly upward and alight on its airy battlements  near it i beheld the square mass of or san michele and farther to the left the bulky duomo and the campanile close beside it like a slender bride or daughter the dome of san lorenzo too  the arno is nowhere visible  beyond and on all sides of the city the hills pile themselves lazily upward in ridges here and there developing into a peak towards their bases white villas were strewn numerously but the upper region was lonely and bare  as we passed under the arch of the porta romana this morning on our way into the city we saw a queer object  it was what we at first took for a living man in a garb of light reddish or yellowish red color of antique or priestly fashion and with a cowl falling behind  his face was of the same hue and seemed to have been powdered as the faces of maskers sometimes are  he sat in a cart which he seemed to be driving into the deity with a load of earthen jars and pipkins the color of which was precisely like his own  on closer inspection this priestly figure proved to be likewise an image of earthenware but his lifelikeness had a very strange and rather ghastly effect  adam perhaps was made of just such red earth and had the complexion of this figure   september 7thi walked into town yesterday morning by way of the porta san frediano  the gate of a city might be a good locality for a chapter in a novel or for a little sketch by itself whether by painter or writer  the great arch of the gateway piercing through the depth and height of the massive masonry beneath the battlemented summit the shadow brooding below in the immense thickness of the wall and beyond it the vista of the street sunny and swarming with life outside of the gate a throng of carts laden with fruits vegetables small flat barrels of wine waiting to be examined by the customhouse officers carriages too and footpassengers entering and others swarming outward  under the shadowy arch are the offices of the police and customs and probably the guardroom of the soldiers all hollowed out in the mass of the gateway civil officers loll on chairs in the shade perhaps with an awning over their heads  where the sun falls aslantwise under the arch a sentinel with musket and bayonet paces to and fro in the entrance and other soldiers lounge close by  the life of the city seems to be compressed and made more intense by this barrier and on passing within it you do not breathe quite so freely yet are sensible of an enjoyment in the close elbowing throng the clamor of high voices from side to side of the street and the million of petty sights actions traffics and personalities all so squeezed together as to become a great whole  the street by which i entered led me to the carraja bridge crossing which i kept straight onward till i came to the church of santa maria novella  doubtless it looks just the same as when boccaccios party stood in a cluster on its broad steps arranging their excursion to the villa  thence i went to the church of st lorenzo which i entered by the side door and found the organ sounding and a religious ceremony going forward  it is a church of sombre aspect with its gray walls and pillars but was decked out for some festivity with hangings of scarlet damask and gold  i sat awhile to rest myself and then pursued my way to the duomo  i entered and looked at sir john hawkwoods painted effigy and at several busts and statues and at the windows of the chapel surrounding the dome through which the sunshine glowed white in the outer air but a hundredhued splendor within  i tried to bring up the scene of lorenzo de medicis attempted assassination but with no great success and after listening a little while to the chanting of the priests and acolytes i went to the bank  it is in a palace of which raphael was the architect in the piazza gran duca  i next went as a matter of course to the uffizi gallery and in the first place to the tribune where the venus de medici deigned to reveal herself rather more satisfactorily than at my last visit     i looked into all the rooms bronzes drawings and gemroom a volume might easily be written upon either subject  the contents of the gemroom especially require to be looked at separately in order to convince ones self of their minute magnificences for among so many the eye slips from one to another with only a vague outward sense that here are whole shelves full of little miracles both of natures material and mans workmanship  greater larger things can be reasonably well appreciated with a less scrupulous though broader attention but in order to estimate the brilliancy of the diamond eyes of a little agate bust for instance you have to screw your mind down to them and nothing else you must sharpen your faculties of observation to a point and touch the object exactly on the right spot or you do not appreciate it at all  it is a troublesome process when there are a thousand such objects to be seen  i stood at an open window in the transverse corridor and looked down upon the arno and across at the range of edifices that impend over it on the opposite side  the river i should judge may be a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards wide in its course between the ponte alle grazie and the ponte vecchio that is the width between strand and strand is at least so much  the river however leaves a broad margin of mud and gravel on its right bank on which waterweeds grow pretty abundantly and creep even into the stream  on my first arrival in florence i thought the goosepond green of the water rather agreeable than otherwise but its hue is now that of unadulterated mud as yellow as the tiber itself yet not impressing me as being enriched with city sewerage like that other famous river  from the ponte alle grazie downward halfway towards the ponte vecchio there is an island of gravel and the channel on each side is so shallow as to allow the passage of men and horses wading not overleg  i have seen fishermen wading the main channel from side to side their feet sinking into the dark mud and thus discoloring the yellow water with a black track visible step by step through its shallowness  but still the arno is a mountain stream and liable to be tetchy and turbulent like all its kindred and no doubt it often finds its borders of hewn stone not too far apart for its convenience  along the right shore beneath the uffizi and the adjacent buildings there is a broad paved way with a parapet on the opposite shore the edifices are built directly upon the rivers edge and impend over the water supported upon arches and machicolations as i think that peculiar arrangement of buttressing arcades is called  the houses are picturesquely various in height from two or three stories to seven picturesque in hue likewisepeagreen yellow white and of aged discolorationbut all with green blinds picturesque also in the courts and galleries that look upon the river and in the wide arches that open beneath intended perhaps to afford a haven for the household boat  nets were suspended before one or two of the houses as if the inhabitants were in the habit of fishing out of window  as a general effect the houses though often palatial in size and height have a shabby neglected aspect and are jumbled too closely together  behind their range the city swells upward in a hillside which rises to a great height above forming i believe a part of the boboli gardens  i returned homewards over the ponte vecchio which is a continuous street of ancient houses except over the central arch so that a stranger might easily cross the river without knowing it  in these small old houses there is a community of goldsmiths who set out their glass cases and hang their windows with rings bracelets necklaces strings of pearl ornaments of malachite and coral and especially with florentine mosaics watches too and snuffboxes of old fashion or new offerings for shrines also such as silver hearts pierced with swords an infinity of pretty things the manufacture of which is continually going on in the little backroom of each little shop  this gewgaw business has been established on the ponte vecchio for centuries although long since it was an art of far higher pretensions than now  benvenuto cellini had his workshop here probably in one of these selfsame little nooks  it would have been a ticklish affair to be benvenutos fellowworkman within such narrow limits  going out of the porta romana i walked for some distance along the city wall and then turning to the left toiled up the hill of bellosguardo through narrow zigzag lanes between high walls of stone or plastered brick where the sun had the fairest chance to frizzle me  there were scattered villas and houses here and there concentrating into a little bit of a street paved with flagstones from side to side as in the city and shadowed quite across its narrowness by the height of the houses  mostly however the way was inhospitably sunny and shut out by the high wall from every glimpse of a view except in one spot where florence spread itself before my eyes with every tower dome and spire which it contains  a little way farther on my own gray tower rose before me the most welcome object that i had seen in the course of the day   september 10thi went into town again yesterday by way of the porta san frediano and observed that this gate like the other gates of florence as far as i have observed is a tall square structure of stone or brick or both rising high above the adjacent wall and having a range of open loggie in the upper story  the arch externally is about half the height of the structure  inside towards the town it rises nearly to the roof  on each side of the arch there is much room for offices apartments storehouses or whatever else  on the outside of the gate along the base are those iron rings and sockets for torches which are said to be the distinguishing symbol of illustrious houses  as contrasted with the vista of the narrow swarming street through the arch from without the view from the inside might be presented with a glimpse of the free blue sky  i strolled a little about florence and went into two or three churches into that of the annunziata for one  i have already described this church with its general magnificence and it was more magnificent than ever today being hung with scarlet silk and goldembroidery  a great many people were at their devotions thronging principally around the virgins shrine  i was struck now with the many basreliefs and busts in the costume of their respective ages and seemingly with great accuracy of portraiture in the passage leading from the front of the church into the cloisters  the marble was not at all abashed nor degraded by being made to assume the guise of the mediaeval furred robe or the closefitting tunic with elaborate ruff or the breastplate and gorget or the flowing wig or whatever the actual costume might be and one is sensible of a rectitude and reality in the affair and respects the dead people for not putting themselves into an eternal masquerade  the dress of the present day will look equally respectable in one or two hundred years  the fair is still going on and one of its principal centres is before this church in the piazza of the annunziata  cloth is the chief commodity offered for sale and none of the finest coarse unbleached linen and cotton prints for countrypeoples wear together with yarn stockings and here and there an assortment of brightcolored ribbons playthings of a very rude fashion were also displayed likewise books in italian and french and a great deal of ironwork  both here and in rome they have this odd custom of offering rusty iron implements for sale spread out on the pavements  there was a good deal of tinware too glittering in the sunshine especially around the pedestal of the bronze statue of duke ferdinand who curbs his horse and looks down upon the bustling piazza in a very stately way     the people attending the fair had mostly a rustic appearance sunburnt faces thin frames no beauty no bloom no joyousness of young or old an anxious aspect as if life were no easy or holiday matter with them but i should take them to be of a kindly nature and reasonably honest  except the broadbrimmed tuscan hats of the women there was no peculiarity of costume  at a careless glance i could very well have mistaken most of the men for yankees as for the women there is very little resemblance between them and oursthe old being absolutely hideous and the young ones very seldom pretty  it was a very dull crowd  they do not generate any warmth among themselves by contiguity they have no pervading sentiment such as is continually breaking out in rough merriment from an american crowd they have nothing to do with one another they are not a crowd considered as one mass but a collection of individuals  a despotic government has perhaps destroyed their principle of cohesion and crumbled them to atoms  italian crowds are noted for their civility possibly they deserve credit for native courtesy and gentleness possibly on the other hand the crowd has not spirit and selfconsciousness enough to be rampant  i wonder whether they will ever hold another parliament in the piazza of santa croce  i paid a visit to the gallery of the pitti palace  there is too large an intermixture of andrea del sartos pictures in this gallery everywhere you see them cold proper and uncriticisable looking so much like firstrate excellence that you inevitably quarrel with your own taste for not admiring them      it was one of the days when my mind misgives me whether the pictorial art be not a humbug and when the minute accuracy of a fly in a dutch picture of fruit and flowers seems to me something more reliable than the mastertouches of raphael  the gallery was considerably thronged and many of the visitors appeared to be from the country and of a class intermediate between gentility and labor  is there such a rural class in italy  i saw a respectablelooking man feeling awkward and uncomfortable in a new and glossy pair of pantaloons not yet bent and creased to his natural movement  nothing pleased me better today than some amber cups in one of the cabinets of curiosities  they are richly wrought and the material is as if the artist had compressed a great deal of sunshine together and when sufficiently solidified had moulded these cups out of it and let them harden  this simile was suggested by   leaving the palace i entered the boboli gardens and wandered up and down a good deal of its uneven surface through broad wellkept edges of box sprouting loftily trimmed smoothly and strewn between with cleanly gravel skirting along plantations of aged trees throwing a deep shadow within their precincts passing many statues not of the finest art yet approaching so near it as to serve just as good a purpose for garden ornament coming now and then to the borders of a fishpool or a pond where stately swans circumnavigated an island of flowersall very fine and very wearisome  i have never enjoyed this garden perhaps because it suggests dresscoats and such elegant formalities   september 11thwe have heard a good deal of spirit matters of late especially of wonderful incidents that attended mr homes visit to florence two or three years ago  mrs powers told a very marvellous thing how that when mr home was holding a seance in her house and several persons present a great scratching was heard in a neighboring closet  she addressed the spirit and requested it not to disturb the company then as they were busy with other affairs promising to converse with it on a future occasion  on a subsequent night accordingly the scratching was renewed with the utmost violence and in reply to mrs powerss questions the spirit assured her that it was not one but legion being the ghosts of twentyseven monks who were miserable and without hope  the house now occupied by powers was formerly a convent and i suppose these were the spirits of all the wicked monks that had ever inhabited it at least i hope that there were not such a number of damnable sinners extant at any one time  these ghostly fathers must have been very improper persons in their lifetime judging by the indecorousness of their behavior even after death and in such dreadful circumstances for they pulled mrs powerss skirts so hard as to break the gathers     it was not ascertained that they desired to have anything done for their eternal welfare or that their situation was capable of amendment anyhow but being exhorted to refrain from further disturbance they took their departure after making the sign of the cross on the breast of each person present  this was very singular in such reprobates who by their own confession had forfeited all claim to be benefited by that holy symbol it curiously suggests that the forms of religion may still be kept up in purgatory and hell itself  the sign was made in a way that conveyed the sense of something devilish and spiteful the perpendicular line of the cross being drawn gently enough but the transverse one sharply and violently so as to leave a painful impression  perhaps the monks meant this to express their contempt and hatred for heretics and how queer that this antipathy should survive their own damnation  but i cannot help hoping that the case of these poor devils may not be so desperate as they think  they cannot be wholly lost because their desire for communication with mortals shows that they need sympathy therefore are not altogether hardened therefore with loving treatment may be restored  a great many other wonders took place within the knowledge and experience of mrs p  she saw not one pair of hands only but many  the head of one of her dead children a little boy was laid in her lap not in ghastly fashion as a head out of the coffin and the grave but just as the living child might have laid it on his mothers knees  it was invisible by the by and she recognized it by the features and the character of the hair through the sense of touch  little hands grasped hers  in short these soberly attested incredibilities are so numerous that i forget nine tenths of them and judge the others too cheap to be written down  christ spoke the truth surely in saying that men would not believe though one rose from the dead  in my own case the fact makes absolutely no impression  i regret such confirmation of truth as this  within a mile of our villa stands the villa columbaria a large house built round a square court  like mr powerss residence it was formerly a convent  it is inhabited by major gregorie an old soldier of waterloo and various other fights and his family consists of mrs  the widow of one of the majors friends and her two daughters  we have become acquainted with the family and mrs  the married daughter has lent us a written statement of her experiences with a ghost who has haunted the villa columbaria for many years back  he had made mrs  aware of his presence in her room by a sensation of extreme cold as if a wintry breeze were blowing over her also by a rustling of the bedcurtains and at such times she had a certain consciousness as she says that she was not alone  through mr homes agency the ghost was enabled to explain himself and declared that he was a monk named giannane who died a very long time ago in mrs s present bedchamber  he was a murderer and had been in a restless and miserable state ever since his death wandering up and down the house but especially haunting his own deathchamber and a staircase that communicated with the chapel of the villa  all the interviews with this lost spirit were attended with a sensation of severe cold which was felt by every one present  he made his communications by means of tablerapping and by the movements of chairs and other articles which often assumed an angry character  the poor old fellow does not seem to have known exactly what he wanted with mrs  but promised to refrain from disturbing her any more on condition that she would pray that he might find some repose  he had previously declined having any masses said for his soul  rest rest rest appears to be the continual craving of unhappy spirits they do not venture to ask for positive bliss perhaps in their utter weariness would rather forego the trouble of active enjoyment but pray only for rest  the cold atmosphere around this monk suggests new ideas as to the climate of hades  if all the aforementioned twentyseven monks had a similar one the combined temperature must have been that of a polar winter  mrs  saw at one time the fingers of her monk long yellow and skinny these fingers grasped the hands of individuals of the party with a cold clammy and horrible touch  after the departure of this ghost other seances were held in her bedchamber at which good and holy spirits manifested themselves and behaved in a very comfortable and encouraging way  it was their benevolent purpose apparently to purify her apartments from all traces of the evil spirit and to reconcile her to what had been so long the haunt of this miserable monk by filling it with happy and sacred associations in which as mrs  intimates they entirely succeeded  these stories remind me of an incident that took place at the old manse in the first summer of our marriage       september 17thwe walked yesterday to florence and visited the church of st lorenzo where we saw for the second time the famous medici statues of michael angelo  i found myself not in a very appreciative state and being a stone myself the statue of lorenzo was at first little more to me than another stone but it was beginning to assume life and would have impressed me as it did before if i had gazed long enough  there was a better light upon the face under the helmet than at my former visit although still the features were enough overshadowed to produce that mystery on which according to mr powers the effect of the statue depends  i observe that the costume of the figure instead of being mediaeval as i believe i have stated is roman but be it what it may the grand and simple character of the figure imbues the robes with its individual propriety  i still think it the greatest miracle ever wrought in marble  we crossed the church and entered a cloister on the opposite side in quest of the laurentian library  ascending a staircase we found an old man blowing the bellows of the organ which was in full blast in the church nevertheless he found time to direct us to the library door  we entered a lofty vestibule of ancient aspect and stately architecture and thence were admitted into the library itself a long and wide gallery or hall lighted by a row of windows on which were painted the arms of the medici  the ceiling was inlaid with dark wood in an elaborate pattern which was exactly repeated in terracotta on the pavement beneath our feet  long desks much like the oldfashioned ones in schools were ranged on each side of the mid aisle in a series from end to end with seats for the convenience of students and on these desks were rare manuscripts carefully preserved under glass and books fastened to the desks by iron chains as the custom of studious antiquity used to be  along the centre of the hall between the two ranges of desks were tables and chairs at which two or three scholarly persons were seated diligently consulting volumes in manuscript or old type  it was a very quiet place imbued with a cloistered sanctity and remote from all streetcries and rumble of the cityodorous of old literaturea spot where the commonest ideas ought not to be expressed in less than latin  the librarianor custode he ought rather to be termed for he was a man not above the fee of a paulnow presented himself and showed us some of the literary curiosities a vellum manuscript of the bible with a splendid illumination by ghirlandaio covering two folio pages and just as brilliant in its color as if finished yesterday  other illuminated manuscriptsor at least separate pages of them for the volumes were kept under glass and not to be turned overwere shown us very magnificent but not to be compared with this of ghirlandaio  looking at such treasures i could almost say that we have left behind us more splendor than we have kept alive to our own age  we publish beautiful editions of books to be sure and thousands of people enjoy them but in ancient times the expense that we spread thinly over a thousand volumes was all compressed into one and it became a great jewel of a book a heavy folio worth its weight in gold  then what a spiritual charm it gives to a book to feel that every letter has been individually wrought and the pictures glow for that individual page alone  certainly the ancient reader had a luxury which the modern one lacks  i was surprised moreover to see the clearness and accuracy of the chirography  print does not surpass it in these respects  the custode showed us an ancient manuscript of the decameron likewise a volume containing the portraits of petrarch and of laura each covering the whole of a vellum page and very finely done  they are authentic portraits no doubt and laura is depicted as a fairhaired beauty with a very satisfactory amount of loveliness  we saw some choice old editions of books in a small separate room but as these were all ranged in shut bookcases and as each volume moreover was in a separate cover or modern binding this exhibition did us very little good  by the by there is a conceit struggling blindly in my mind about petrarch and laura suggested by those two lifelike portraits which have been sleeping cheek to cheek through all these centuries  but i cannot lay hold of it   september 21styesterday morning the val d arno was entirely filled with a thick fog which extended even up to our windows and concealed objects within a very short distance  it began to dissipate itself betimes however and was the forerunner of an unusually bright and warm day  we set out after breakfast and walked into town where we looked at mosaic brooches  these are very pretty little bits of manufacture but there seems to have been no infusion of fresh fancy into the work and the specimens present little variety  it is the characteristic commodity of the place the central mart and manufacturing locality being on the ponte vecchio from end to end of which they are displayed in cases but there are other mosaic shops scattered about the town  the principal devices are rosespink yellow or whitejasmines lilies of the valley forgetmenots orange blossoms and others single or in sprigs or twined into wreaths parrots too and other birds of gay plumage often exquisitely done and sometimes with precious materials such as lapis lazuli malachite and still rarer gems  bracelets with several different yet relative designs are often very beautiful  we find at different shops a great inequality of prices for mosaics that seemed to be of much the same quality  we went to the uffizi gallery and found it much thronged with the middle and lower classes of italians and the english too seemed more numerous than i have lately seen them  perhaps the tourists have just arrived here starting at the close of the london season  we were amused with a pair of englishmen who went through the gallery one of them criticising the pictures and statues audibly for the benefit of his companion  the critic i should take to be a country squire and wholly untravelled a tall wellbuilt rather rough but gentlemanly man enough his friend a small personage exquisitely neat in dress and of artificial deportment every attitude and gesture appearing to have been practised before a glass  being but a small pattern of a man physically and intellectually he had thought it worth while to finish himself off with the elaborateness of a florentine mosaic and the result was something like a dancingmaster though without the exuberant embroidery of such persons  indeed he was a very quiet little man and though so thoroughly made up there was something particularly green fresh and simple in him  both these englishmen were elderly and the smaller one had perfectly white hair glossy and silken  it did not make him in the least venerable however but took his own character of neatness and prettiness  he carried his wellbrushed and glossy hat in his hand in such a way as not to ruffle its surface and i wish i could put into one word or one sentence the pettiness the minikinfinical effect of this little man his selfconsciousness so lifelong that in some sort he forgot himself even in the midst of it his propriety his cleanliness and unruffledness his prettiness and nicety of manifestation like a bird hopping daintily about  his companion as i said was of a completely different type a tall grayhaired man with the rough english face a little tinted with port wine careless natural manner betokening a man of position in his own neighborhood a loud voice not vulgar nor outraging the rules of society but betraying a character incapable of much refinement  he talked continually in his progress through the gallery and audibly enough for us to catch almost everything he said at many yards distance  his remarks and criticisms addressed to his small friend were so entertaining that we strolled behind him for the sake of being benefited by them and i think he soon became aware of this and addressed himself to us as well as to his more immediate friend  nobody but an englishman it seems to me has just this kind of vanitya feeling mixed up with scorn and goodnature selfcomplacency on his own merits and as an englishman pride at being in foreign parts contempt for everybody around him a rough kindliness towards people in general i liked the man and should be glad to know him better  as for his criticism i am sorry to remember only one  it was upon the picture of the nativity by correggio in the tribune where the mother is kneeling before the child and adoring it in an awful rapture because she sees the eternal god in its baby face and figure  the englishman was highly delighted with this picture and began to gesticulate as if dandling a baby and to make a chirruping sound  it was to him merely a representation of a mother fondling her infant  he then said if i could have my choice of the pictures and statues in the tribune i would take this picture and that one yonder it was a good enough enthronement of the virgin by andrea del sarto and the dancing faun and let the rest go  a delightful man i love that wholesome coarseness of mind and heart which no education nor opportunity can polish out of the genuine englishman a coarseness without vulgarity  when a yankee is coarse he is pretty sure to be vulgar too  the two critics seemed to be considering whether it were practicable to go from the uffizi to the pitti gallery but it confuses one remarked the little man to see more than one gallery in a day  i should think sothe pitti palace tumbling into his small receptacle on the top of the uffizi it does so responded the big man with heavy emphasis   september 23dthe vintage has been going on in our podere for about a week and i saw a part of the process of making wine under one of our back windows  it was on a very small scale the grapes being thrown into a barrel and crushed with a sort of pestle and as each estate seems to make its own wine there are probably no very extensive and elaborate appliances in general use for the manufacture  the cidermaking of new england is far more picturesque the great heap of golden or rosy apples under the trees and the cidermill worked by a circumgyratory horse and all agush with sweet juice  indeed nothing connected with the grapeculture and the vintage here has been picturesque except the large inverted pyramids in which the clusters hang those great bunches white or purple really satisfy my idea both as to aspect and taste  we can buy a large basketful for less than a paul and they are the only things that one can never devour too much ofand there is no enough short of a little too much without subsequent repentance  it is a shame to turn such delicious juice into such sour wine as they make in tuscany  i tasted a sip or two of a flask which the contadini sent us for trial the rich result of the process i had witnessed in the barrel  it took me altogether by surprise for i remembered the nectareousness of the new cider which i used to sip through a straw in my boyhood and i never doubted that this would be as dulcet but finer and more ethereal as much more delectable in short as these grapes are better than puckery cider apples  positively i never tasted anything so detestable such a sour and bitter juice still lukewarm with fermentation it was a wail of woe squeezed out of the winepress of tribulation and the more a man drinks of such the sorrier he will be  besides grapes we have had figs and i have now learned to be very fond of them  when they first began to appear two months ago they had scarcely any sweetness and tasted very like a decaying squash this was an early variety with purple skins  there are many kinds of figs the best being greenskinned growing yellower as they ripen and the riper they are the more the sweetness within them intensifies till they resemble dried figs in everything except that they retain the fresh fruitflavor rich luscious yet not palling  we have had pears too some of them very tolerable and peaches which look magnificently as regards size and downy blush but have seldom much more taste than a cucumber  a succession of fruits has followed us ever since our arrival in florencefirst and for a long time abundance of cherries then apricots which lasted many weeks till we were weary of them then plums pears and finally figs peaches and grapes  except the figs and grapes a new england summer and autumn would give us better fruit than any we have found in italy  italy beats us i think in mosquitoes they are horribly pungent little satanic particles  they possess strange intelligence and exquisite acuteness of sight and smellprodigious audacity and courage to match it insomuch that they venture on the most hazardous attacks and get safe off  one of them flew into my mouth the other night and sting me far down in my throat but luckily i coughed him up in halves  they are bigger than american mosquitoes and if you crush them after one of their feasts it makes a terrific bloodspot  it is a sort of suicideat least a shedding of ones own bloodto kill them but it gratifies the old adam to do it  it shocks me to feel how revengeful i am but it is impossible not to impute a certain malice and intellectual venom to these diabolical insects  i wonder whether our health at this season of the year requires that we should be kept in a state of irritation and so the mosquitoes are natures prophetic remedy for some disease or whether we are made for the mosquitoes not they for us  it is possible just possible that the infinitesimal doses of poison which they infuse into us are a homoeopathic safeguard against pestilence but medicine never was administered in a more disagreeable way  the moist atmosphere about the arno i suppose produces these insects and fills the broad tenmile valley with them and as we are just on the brim of the basin they overflow into our windows   september 25thu and i walked to town yesterday morning and went to the uffizi gallery  it is not a pleasant thought that we are so soon to give up this gallery with little prospect none or hardly any on my part of ever seeing it again  it interests me and all of us far more than the gallery of the pitti palace wherefore i know not for the latter is the richer of the two in admirable pictures  perhaps it is the picturesque variety of the uffizithe combination of painting sculpture gems and bronzesthat makes the charm  the tribune too is the richest room in all the world a heart that draws all hearts to it the dutch pictures moreover give a homely human interest to the uffizi and i really think that the frequency of andrea del santos productions at the pitti palacelooking so very like masterpieces yet lacking the soul of art and naturehave much to do with the weariness that comes from better acquaintance with the latter gallery  the splendor of the gilded and frescoed saloons is perhaps another bore but after all my memory will often tread there as long as i live  what shall we do in america  speaking of dutch pictures i was much struck yesterday as frequently before with a small picture by teniers the elder  it seems to be a pawnbroker in the midst of his pledges old earthen jugs flasks a brass kettle old books and a huge pile of wornout and broken rubbish which he is examining  these things are represented with vast fidelity yet with bold and free touches unlike the minute microscopic work of other dutch masters and a wonderful picturesqueness is wrought out of these humble materials and even the figure and head of the pawnbroker have a strange grandeur  we spent no very long time at the uffizi and afterwards crossed the ponte alle grazie and went to the convent of san miniato which stands on a hill outside of the porta san gallo  a paved pathway along which stand crosses marking stations at which pilgrims are to kneel and pray goes steeply to the hilltop where in the first place is a smaller church and convent than those of san miniato  the latter are seen at a short distance to the right the convent being a large square battlemented mass adjoining which is the church showing a front of aged white marble streaked with black and having an old stone tower behind i have seen no other convent or monastery that so well corresponds with my idea of what such structures were  the sacred precincts are enclosed by a high wall gray ancient and luxuriously ivygrown and lofty and strong enough for the rampart of a fortress  we went through the gateway and entered the church which we found in much disarray and masons at work upon the pavement  the tribune is elevated considerably above the nave and accessible by marble staircases there are great arches and a chapel with curious monuments in the gothic style and ancient carvings and mosaic works and in short a dim dusty and venerable interior well worth studying in detail     the view of florence from the church door is very fine and seems to include every tower dome or whatever object emerges out of the general mass   september 28thi went to the pitti palace yesterday and to the uffizi today paying them probably my last visit yet cherishing an unreasonable doubt whether i may not see them again  at all events i have seen them enough for the present even what is best of them and at the same time with a sad reluctance to bid them farewell forever i experience an utter weariness of raphaels old canvas and of the timeyellowed marble of the venus de medici  when the material embodiment presents itself outermost and we perceive them only by the grosser sense missing their ethereal spirit there is nothing so heavily burdensome as masterpieces of painting and sculpture  i threw my farewell glance at the venus de medici today with strange insensibility  the nights are wonderfully beautiful now  when the moon was at the full a few nights ago its light was an absolute glory such as i seem only to have dreamed of heretofore and that only in my younger days  at its rising i have fancied that the orb of the moon has a kind of purple brightness and that this tinge is communicated to its radiance until it has climbed high aloft and sheds a flood of white over hill and valley now that the moon is on the wane there is a gentler lustre but still bright and it makes the val d arno with its surrounding hills and its soft mist in the distance as beautiful a scene as exists anywhere out of heaven  and the morning is quite as beautiful in its own way  this mist of which i have so often spoken sets it beyond the limits of actual sense and makes it ideal it is as if you were dreaming about the valleyas if the valley itself were dreaming and met you halfway in your own dream  if the mist were to be withdrawn i believe the whole beauty of the valley would go with it  until pretty late in the morning we have the comet streaming through the sky and dragging its interminable tail among the stars  it keeps brightening from night to night and i should think must blaze fiercely enough to cast a shadow by and by  i know not whether it be in the vicinity of galileos tower and in the influence of his spirit but i have hardly ever watched the stars with such interest as now   september 29thlast evening i met mr powers at miss blagdens and he talked about his treatment by our government in reference to an appropriation of twentyfive thousand dollars made by congress for a statue by him  its payment and the purchase of the statue were left at the option of the president and he conceived himself wronged because the affair was never concluded     as for the president he knows nothing of art and probably acted in the matter by the advice of the director of public works  no doubt a sculptor gets commissions as everybody gets public employment and emolument of whatever kind from our government not by merit or fitness but by political influence skilfully applied  as powers himself observed the ruins of our capitol are not likely to afford sculptures equal to those which lord elgin took from the parthenon if this be the system under which they are produced     i wish our great republic had the spirit to do as much according to its vast means as florence did for sculpture and architecture when it was a republic but we have the meanest government and the shabbiest andif truly represented by itwe are the meanest and shabbiest people known in history  and yet the less we attempt to do for art the better if our future attempts are to have no better result than such brazen troopers as the equestrian statue of general jackson or even such naked respectabilities as greenoughs washington  there is something false and affected in our highest taste for art and i suppose furthermore we are the only people who seek to decorate their public institutions not by the highest taste among them but by the average at best  there was also at miss blagdens among other company mr  an artist in florence and a sensible man  i talked with him about home the medium whom he had many opportunities of observing when the latter was in these parts  mr  says that home is unquestionably a knave but that he himself is as much perplexed at his own preternatural performances as any other person he is startled and affrighted at the phenomena which he produces  nevertheless when his spiritual powers fall short he does his best to eke them out with imposture  this moral infirmity is a part of his nature and i suggested that perhaps if he were of a firmer and healthier moral make if his character were sufficiently sound and dense to be capable of steadfast principle he would not have possessed the impressibility that fits him for the socalled spiritual influences  mr  says that louis napoleon is literally one of the most skilful jugglers in the world and that probably the interest he has taken in mr home was caused partly by a wish to acquire his art  this morning mr powers invited me to go with him to the grand dukes new foundry to see the bronze statue of webster which has just been cast from his model  it is the second cast of the statue the first having been shipped some months ago on board of a vessel which was lost and as powers observed the statue now lies at the bottom of the atlantic ocean somewhere in the vicinity of the telegraphic cable  we were received with much courtesy and emphasis by the director of the foundry and conducted into a large room walled with bare new brick where the statue was standing in front of the extinct furnace a majestic webster indeed eight feet high and looking even more colossal than that  the likeness seemed to me perfect and like a sensible man powers has dressed him in his natural costume such as i have seen webster have on while making a speech in the open air at a mass meeting in concorddresscoat buttoned pretty closely across the breast pantaloons and bootseverything finished even to a seam and a stitch not an inch of the statue but is webster even his coattails are imbued with the man and this true artist has succeeded in showing him through the broadcloth as nature showed him  he has felt that a mans actual clothes are as much a part of him as his flesh and i respect him for disdaining to shirk the difficulty by throwing the meanness of a cloak over it and for recognizing the folly of masquerading our yankee statesman in a roman toga and the indecorousness of presenting him as a brassy nudity  it would have been quite as unjustifiable to strip him to his skeleton as to his flesh  webster is represented as holding in his right hand the written roll of the constitution with which he points to a bundle of fasces which he keeps from falling by the grasp of his left thus symbolizing him as the preserver of the union  there is an expression of quiet solid massive strength in the whole figure a deep pervading energy in which any exaggeration of gesture would lessen and lower the effect  he looks really like a pillar of the state  the face is very grand very webster stern and awful because he is in the act of meeting a great crisis and yet with the warmth of a great heart glowing through it  happy is webster to have been so truly and adequately sculptured happy the sculptor in such a subject which no idealization of a demigod could have supplied him with  perhaps the statue at the bottom of the sea will be cast up in some future age when the present race of man is forgotten and if so that far posterity will look up to us as a grander race than we find ourselves to be  neither was webster altogether the man he looked  his physique helped him out even when he fell somewhat short of its promise and if his eyes had not been in such deep caverns their fire would not have looked so bright  powers made me observe how the surface of the statue was wrought to a sort of roughness instead of being smoothed as is the practice of other artists  he said that this had cost him great pains and certainly it has an excellent effect  the statue is to go to boston and i hope will be placed in the open air for it is too mighty to be kept under any roof that now exists in america      after seeing this the director showed us some very curious and exquisite specimens of castings such as baskets of flowers in which the most delicate and fragile blossoms the curl of a petal the finest veins in a leaf the lightest flowerspray that ever quivered in a breeze were perfectly preserved and the basket contained an abundant heap of such sprays  there were likewise a pair of hands taken actually from life clasped together as they were and they looked like parts of a man who had been changed suddenly from flesh to brass  they were worn and rough and unhandsome hands and so very real with all their veins and the pores of the skin that it was shocking to look at them  a bronze leaf cast also from the life was as curious and more beautiful  taking leave of powers i went hither and thither about florence seeing for the last time things that i have seen many times before the market for instance blocking up a line of narrow streets with fruitstalls and obstreperous dealers crying their peaches their green lemons their figs their delicious grapes their mushrooms their pomegranates their radishes their lettuces  they use one vegetable here which i have not known so used elsewhere that is very young pumpkins or squashes of the size of apples and to be cooked by boiling  they are not to my taste but the people here like unripe thingsunripe fruit unripe chickens unripe lamb  this market is the noisiest and swarmiest centre of noisy and swarming florence and i always like to pass through it on that account  i went also to santa croce and it seemed to me to present a longer vista and broader space than almost any other church perhaps because the pillars between the nave and aisles are not so massive as to obstruct the view  i looked into the duomo too and was pretty well content to leave it  then i came homeward and lost my way and wandered far off through the white sunshine and the scanty shade of the vineyard walls and the olivetrees that here and there branched over them  at last i saw our own gray battlements at a distance on one side quite out of the direction in which i was travelling so was compelled to the grievous mortification of retracing a great many of my weary footsteps  it was a very hot day  this evening i have been on the towertop stargazing and looking at the comet which waves along the sky like an immense feather of flame  over florence there was an illuminated atmosphere caused by the lights of the city gleaming upward into the mists which sleep and dream above that portion of the valley as well as the rest of it  i saw dimly or fancied i saw the hill of fiesole on the other side of florence and remembered how ghostly lights were seen passing thence to the duomo on the night when lorenzo the magnificent died  from time to time the sweet bells of florence rang out and i was loath to come down into the lower world knowing that i shall never again look heavenward from an old towertop in such a soft calm evening as this  yet i am not loath to go away impatient rather for taking no root i soon weary of any soil in which i may be temporarily deposited  the same impatience i sometimes feel or conceive of as regards this earthly life      i forgot to mention that powers showed me in his studio the model of the statue of america which he wished the government to buy  it has great merit and embodies the ideal of youth freedom progress and whatever we consider as distinctive of our countrys character and destiny  it is a female figure vigorous beautiful planting its foot lightly on a broken chain and pointing upward  the face has a high look of intelligence and lofty feeling the form nude to the middle has all the charms of womanhood and is thus warmed and redeemed out of the cold allegoric sisterhood who have generally no merit in chastity being really without sex  i somewhat question whether it is quite the thing however to make a genuine woman out of an allegory we ask who is to wed this lovely virgin and we are not satisfied to banish her into the realm of chilly thought  but i liked the statue and all the better for what i criticise and was sorry to see the huge package in which the finished marble lies bundled up ready to be sent to our countrywhich does not call for it  mr powers and his two daughters called to take leave of us and at parting i expressed a hope of seeing him in america  he said that it would make him very unhappy to believe that he should never return thither but it seems to me that he has no such definite purpose of return as would be certain to bring itself to pass  it makes a very unsatisfactory life thus to spend the greater part of it in exile  in such a case we are always deferring the reality of life till a future moment and by and by we have deferred it till there are no future moments or if we do go back we find that life has shifted whatever of reality it had to the country where we deemed ourselves only living temporarily and so between two stools we come to the ground and make ourselves a part of one or the other country only by laying our bones in its soil  it is particularly a pity in powerss case because he is so very american in character and the only convenience for him of his italian residence is that here he can supply himself with marble and with workmen to chisel it according to his designs    siena   october 2dyesterday morning at six oclock we left our ancient tower and threw a parting glanceand a rather sad oneover the misty val d arno  this summer will look like a happy one in our childrens retrospect and also no doubt in the years that remain to ourselves and in truth i have found it a peaceful and not uncheerful one  it was not a pleasant morning and monte morello looking down on florence had on its cap betokening foul weather according to the proverb  crossing the suspensionbridge we reached the leopoldo railway without entering the city  by some mistakeor perhaps because nobody ever travels by firstclass carriages in tuscanywe found we had received secondclass tickets and were put into a long crowded carriage full of priests military men commercial travellers and other respectable people facing one another lengthwise along the carriage and many of them smoking cigars  they were all perfectly civil and i think i must own that the manners of this secondclass would compare favorably with those of an american firstclass one  at empoli about an hour after we started we had to change carriages the main train proceeding to leghorn     my observations along the road were very scanty a hilly country with several old towns seated on the most elevated hilltops as is common throughout tuscany or sometimes a fortress with a town on the plain at its base or once or twice the towers and battlements of a mediaeval castle commanding the pass below it  near florence the country was fertile in the vine and olive and looked as unpicturesque as that sort of fertility usually makes it not but what i have come to think better of the tint of the oliveleaf than when i first saw it  in the latter part of our journey i remember a wild stream of a greenish hue but transparent rushing along over a rough bed and before reaching siena we rumbled into a long tunnel and emerged from it near the city      we drove up hill and down for the surface of siena seems to be nothing but an irregularity through narrow old streets and were set down at the aquila nera a grimlooking albergo near the centre of the town mrs s had already taken rooms for us there and to these we were now ushered up the highway of a dingy stone staircase and into a small brickpaved parlor  the house seemed endlessly old and all the glimpses that we caught of siena out of window seemed more ancient still  almost within arms reach across a narrow street a tall palace of gray timeworn stone clambered skyward with arched windows and square windows and large windows and small scattered up and down its side  it is the palazzo tolomei and looks immensely venerable  from the windows of our bedrooms we looked into a broader street though still not very wide and into a small piazza the most conspicuous object in which was a column hearing on its top a bronze wolf suckling romulus and remus this symbol is repeated in other parts of the city and scours to indicate that the sienese people pride themselves in a roman origin  in another direction over the tops of the houses we saw a very high tower with battlements projecting around its summit so that it was a fortress in the air and this i have since found to be the palazzo publico  it was pleasant looking downward into the little old piazza and narrow streets to see the swarm of life on the pavement the life of today just as new as if it had never been lived before the citizens the priests the soldiers the mules and asses with their panniers the diligence lumbering along with a postilion in a faded crimson coat bobbing up and down on the offhorse  such a bustling scene vociferous too with various streetcries is wonderfully set off by the gray antiquity of the town and makes the town look older than if it were a solitude  soon mr and mrs story came and accompanied us to look for lodgings they also drove us about the city in their carriage and showed us the outside of the palazzo publico and of the cathedral and other remarkable edifices  the aspect of siena is far more picturesque than that of any other town in italy so far as i know italian towns and yet now that i have written it i remember perugia and feel that the observation is a mistake  but at any rate siena is remarkably picturesque standing on such a site on the verge and within the crater of an extinct volcano and therefore being as uneven as the sea in a tempest the streets so narrow ascending between tall ancient palaces while the side streets rush headlong down only to be threaded by surefooted mules such as climb alpine heights old stone balconies on the palace fronts old arched doorways and windows set in frames of gothic architecture arcades resembling canopies of stone with quaintly sculptured statues in the richly wrought gothic niches of each pillareverything massive and lofty yet minutely interesting when you look at it stone by stone the florentines and the romans too have obliterated as far as they could all the interest of their mediaeval structures by covering them with stucco so that they have quite lost their character and affect the spectator with no reverential idea of age  here the city is all overwritten with blackletter and the glad italian sun makes the effect so much the stronger  we took a lodging and afterwards j and i rambled about and went into the cathedral for a moment and strayed also into the piazza del campo the great public square of siena  i am not in the mood for further description of public places now so shall say a word or two about the old palace in which we have established ourselves  we have the second piano and dwell amid faded grandeur having for our saloon what seems to have been a ballroom  it is ornamented with a great fresco in the centre of the vaulted ceiling and others covering the sides of the apartment and surrounded with arabesque frameworks where cupids gambol and chase one another  the subjects of the frescos i cannot make out not that they are faded like giottos for they are as fresh as roses and are done in an exceedingly workmanlike style but they are allegories of fame and plenty and other matters such as i could never understand our whole accommodation is in similar stylespacious magnificent and mouldy  in the evening miss s and i drove to the railway and on the arrival of the train from florence we watched with much eagerness the unlading of the luggagevan  at last the whole of our ten trunks and tin bandbox were produced and finally my leather bag in which was my journal and a manuscript book containing my sketch of a romance  it gladdened my very heart to see it and i shall think the better of tuscan promptitude and accuracy for so quickly bringing it back to me  it was left behind under one of the railcarriage seats  we find all the public officials whether of railway police or customhouse extremely courteous and pleasant to encounter they seem willing to take trouble and reluctant to give it and it is really a gratification to find that such civil people will sometimes oblige you by taking a paul or two aside   october 3di took several strolls about the city yesterday and find it scarcely extensive enough to get lost in and if we go far from the centre we soon come to silent streets with only here and there an individual and the inhabitants stare from their doors and windows at the stranger and turn round to look at him after he has passed  the interest of the old town would soon be exhausted for the traveller but i can conceive that a thoughtful and shy man might settle down here with the view of making the place a home and spend many years in a sombre kind of happiness  i should prefer it to florence as a residence but it would be terrible without an independent life in ones own mind  u and i walked out in the afternoon and went into the piazza del campo the principal place of the city and a very noble and peculiar one  it is much in the form of an amphitheatre and the surface of the ground seems to be slightly scooped out so that it resembles the shallow basin of a shell  it is thus a much better site for an assemblage of the populace than if it were a perfect level  a semicircle or truncated ellipse of stately and ancient edifices surround the piazza with arches opening beneath them through which streets converge hitherward  one side of the piazza is a straight line and is occupied by the palazzo publico which is a most noble and impressive gothic structure  it has not the mass of the palazzo vecchio at florence but is more striking it has a long battlemented front the central part of which rises eminent above the rest in a great square bulk which is likewise crowned with battlements  this is much more picturesque than the one great block of stone into which the palazzo vecchio is consolidated  at one extremity of this long front of the palazzo publico rises a tower shooting up its shaft high high into the air and bulging out there into a battlemented fortress within which the tower slenderer than before climbs to a still higher region  i do not know whether the summit of the tower is higher or so high as that of the palazzo vecchio but the length of the shaft free of the edifice is much greater and so produces the more elevating effect  the whole front of the palazzo publico is exceedingly venerable with arched windows gothic carvings and all the oldtime ornaments that betoken it to have stood a great while and the gray strength that will hold it up at least as much longer  at one end of the facade beneath the shadow of the tower is a grand and beautiful porch supported on square pillars within each of which is a niche containing a statue of mediaeval sculpture  the great piazza del campo is the marketplace of siena  in the morning it was thronged with booths and stalls especially of fruit and vegetable dealers but as in florence they melted away in the sunshine gradually withdrawing themselves into the shadow thrown from the palazzo publico  on the side opposite the palace is an antique fountain of marble ornamented with two statues and a series of basreliefs and it was so much admired in its day that its sculptor received the name del fonte i am loath to leave the piazza and palace without finding some word or two to suggest their antique majesty in the sunshine and the shadow and how fit it seemed notwithstanding their venerableness that there should be a busy crowd filling up the great hollow amphitheatre and crying their fruit and little merchandises so that all the curved line of stately old edifices helped to reverberate the noise  the life of today within the shell of a time past is wonderfully fascinating  another point to which a strangers footsteps are drawn by a kind of magnetism so that he will be apt to find himself there as often as he strolls out of his hotel is the cathedral  it stands in the highest part of the city and almost every street runs into some other street which meanders hitherward  on our way thither u and i came to a beautiful front of black and white marble in somewhat the same style as the cathedral in fact it was the baptistery and should have made a part of it according to the original design which contemplated a structure of vastly greater extent than this actual one  we entered the baptistery and found the interior small but very rich in its clustered columns and intersecting arches and its frescos pictures statues and ornaments  moreover a father and mother had brought their baby to be baptized and the poor little thing in its gay swaddlingclothes looked just like what i have seen in old pictures and a good deal like an indian pappoose  it gave one little slender squeak when the priest put the water on its forehead and then was quiet again  we now went round to the facade of the cathedral     it is of black and white marble with i believe an intermixture of red and other colors but time has toned them down so that white black and red do not contrast so strongly with one another as they may have done five hundred years ago  the architecture is generally of the pointed gothic style but there are likewise carved arches over the doors and windows and a variety which does not produce the effect of confusiona magnificent eccentricity an exuberant imagination flowering out in stone  on high in the great peak of the front and throwing its colored radiance into the nave within there is a round window of immense circumference the painted figures in which we can see dimly from the outside  but what i wish to express and never can is the multitudinous richness of the ornamentation of the front the arches within arches sculptured inch by inch of the deep doorways the statues of saints some making a hermitage of a niche others standing forth the scores of busts that look like faces of ancient people gazing down out of the cathedral the projecting shapes of stone lionsthe thousand forms of gothic fancy which seemed to soften the marble and express whatever it liked and allow it to harden again to last forever  but my description seems like knocking off the noses of some of the busts the fingers and toes of the statues the projecting points of the architecture jumbling them all up together and flinging them down upon the page  this gives no idea of the truth nor least of all can it shadow forth that solemn whole mightily combined out of all these minute particulars and sanctifying the entire space of ground over which this cathedralfront flings its shadow or on which it reflects the sun  a majesty and a minuteness neither interfering with the other each assisting the other this is what i love in gothic architecture  we went in and walked about but i mean to go again before sketching the interior in my poor watercolors   october 4thon looking again at the palazzo publico i see that the pillared portal which i have spoken of does not cover an entrance to the palace but is a chapel with an altar and frescos above it  bouquets of fresh flowers are on the altar and a lamp burns in all the daylight before the crucifix  the chapel is quite unenclosed except by an openwork balustrade of marble on which the carving looks very ancient nothing could be more convenient for the devotions of the crowd in the piazza and no doubt the daily prayers offered at the shrine might be numbered by the thousandbrief but i hope earnestlike those glimpses i used to catch at the blue sky revealing so much in an instant while i was toiling at brook farm  another picturesque thing about the palazzo publico is a great stone balcony quaintly wrought about midway in the front and high aloft with two arched windows opening into it  after another glimpse at the cathedral too i realize how utterly i have failed in conveying the idea of its elaborate ornament its twisted and clustered pillars and numberless devices of sculpture nor did i mention the venerable statues that stand all round the summit of the edifice relieved against the skythe highest of all being one of the saviour on the topmost peak of the front nor the tall tower that ascends from one side of the building and is built of layers of black and white marble piled one upon another in regular succession nor the dome that swells upward close beside this tower  had the cathedral been constructed on the plan and dimensions at first contemplated it would have been incomparably majestic the finished portion grand as it is being only what was intended for a transept one of the walls of what was to have been the nave is still standing and looks like a ruin though i believe it has been turned to account as the wall of a palace the space of the nevercompleted nave being now a court or street  the whole family of us were kindly taken out yesterday to dine and spend the day at the villa belvedere with our friends mr and mrs story  the vicinity of siena is much more agreeable than that of florence being cooler breezier with more foliage and shrubbery both near at hand and in the distance and the prospect mr story told us embraces a diameter of about a hundred miles between hills north and south  the villa belvedere was built and owned by an englishman now deceased who has left it to his butler and its lawns and shrubbery have something english in their character and there was almost a dampness in the grass which really pleased me in this parched italy  within the house the walls are hung with fine oldfashioned engravings from the pictures of gainsborough west and other english painters  the englishman though he had chosen to live and die in italy had evidently brought his native tastes and peculiarities along with him  mr story thinks of buying this villa i do not know but i might be tempted to buy it myself if siena were a practicable residence for the entire year but the winter here with the bleak mountainwinds of a hundred miles round about blustering against it must be terribly disagreeable  we spent a very pleasant day turning over books or talking on the lawn whence we could behold scenes picturesque afar and rich vineyard glimpses near at hand  mr story is the most variously accomplished and brilliant person the fullest of social life and fire whom i ever met and without seeming to make an effort he kept us amused and entertained the whole day long not wearisomely entertained neither as we should have been if he had not let his fountain play naturally  still though he bubbled and brimmed over with fun he left the impression on me that     there is a pain and care bred it may be out of the very richness of his gifts and abundance of his outward prosperity  rich in the prime of life     and children budding and blossoming around him as fairly as his heart could wish with sparkling talentsso many that if he choose to neglect or fling away one or two or three he would still have enough left to shine withwho should be happy if not he      towards sunset we all walked out into the podere pausing a little while to look down into a well that stands on the verge of the lawn  within the spacious circle of its stone curb was an abundant growth of maidenhair forming a perfect wreath of thickly clustering leaves quite round and trailing its tendrils downward to the water which gleamed beneath  it was a very pretty sight  mr story bent over the well and uttered deep musical tones which were reverberated from the hollow depths with wonderful effect as if a spirit dwelt within there and unlike the spirits that speak through mediums sent him back responses even profounder and more melodious than the tones that awakened them such a responsive well as this might have been taken for an oracle in old days  we went along paths that led from one vineyard to another and which might have led us for miles across the country  the grapes had been partly gathered but still there were many purple or white clusters hanging heavily on the vines  we passed cottage doors and saw groups of contadini and contadine in their festal attire and they saluted us graciously but it was observable that one of the men generally lingered on our track to see that no grapes were stolen for there were a good many young people and children in our train not only our own but some from a neighboring villa  these italian peasants are a kindly race but i doubt not very hospitable of grape or fig  there was a beautiful sunset and by the time we reached the house again the comet was already visible amid the unextinguished glow of daylight a mr and mrs b scotch people from the next villa had come to see the storys and we sat till teatime reading talking william story drawing caricatures for his childrens amusement and ours and all of us sometimes getting up to look at the comet which blazed brighter and brighter till it went down into the mists of the horizon  among the caricatures was one of a presidential candidate evidently a man of very malleable principles and likely to succeed  late in the evening too late for little rosebud we drove homeward  the streets of old siena looked very grim at night and it seemed like gazing into caverns to glimpse down some of the side streets as we passed with a light burning dimly at the end of them  it was after ten when we reached home and climbed up our gloomy staircase lighted by the glimmer of some wax moccoli which i had in my pocket   october 5thi have been two or three times into the cathedral     the whole interior is of marble in alternate lines of black and white each layer being about eight inches in width and extending horizontally it looks very curiously and might remind the spectator of a stuff with horizontal stripes  nevertheless the effect is exceedingly rich these alternate lines stretching away along the walls and round the clustered pillars seen aloft and through the arches everywhere this inlay of black and white  every sort of ornament that could be thought of seems to have been crammed into the cathedral in one place or another gilding frescos pictures a roof of blue spangled with golden stars a magnificent wheelwindow of old painted glass over the entrance and another at the opposite end of the cathedral statues some of marble others of gilded bronze pulpits of carved marble a gilded organ a cornice of marble busts of the popes extending round the entire church a pavement covered all over with a strange kind of mosaic work in various marbles wrought into marble pictures of sacred subjects immense clustered pillars supporting the round arches that divide the nave from the side aisles a clerestory of windows within pointed archesit seemed as if the spectator were reading an antique volume written in blackletter of a small character but conveying a high and solemn meaning  i can find no way of expressing its effect on me so quaint and venerable as i feel this cathedral to be in its immensity of striped waistcoat now dingy with five centuries of wear  i ought not to say anything that might detract from the grandeur and sanctity of the blessed edifice for these attributes are really uninjured by any of the gothic oddities which i have hinted at  we went this morning to the institute of the fine arts which is interesting as containing a series of the works of the sienese painters from a date earlier than that of cimabue  there is a dispute i believe between florence and siena as to which city may claim the credit of having originated the modern art of painting  the florentines put forward cimabue as the first artist but as the sienese produce a picture by guido da siena dated before the birth of cimabue the victory is decidedly with them  as to pictorial merit to my taste there is none in either of these old painters nor in any of their successors for a long time afterwards  at the institute there are several rooms hung with early productions of the sienese school painted before the invention of oilcolors on wood shaped into gothic altarpieces  the backgrounds still retain a bedimmed splendor of gilding  there is a plentiful use of red and i can conceive that the pictures must have shed an illumination through the churches where they were displayed  there is often too a minute care bestowed on the faces in the pictures and sometimes a very strong expression stronger than modern artists get and it is very strange how they attained this merit while they were so inconceivably rude in other respects  it is remarkable that all the early faces of the madonna are especially stupid and all of the same type a sort of face such as one might carve on a pumpkin representing a heavy sulky phlegmatic woman with a long and low arch of the nose this same dull face continues to be assigned to the madonna even when the countenances of the surrounding saints and angels are characterized with power and beauty so that i think there must have been some portrait of this sacred personage reckoned authentic which the early painters followed and religiously repeated  at last we came to a picture by sodoma the most illustrious representative of the sienese school  it was a fresco christ bound to the pillar after having been scourged  i do believe that painting has never done anything better so far as expression is concerned than this figure  in all these generations since it was painted it must have softened thousands of hearts drawn down rivers of tears been more effectual than a million of sermons  really it is a thing to stand and weep at  no other painter has done anything that can deserve to be compared to this  there are some other pictures by sodoma among them a judith very noble and admirable and full of a profound sorrow for the deed which she has felt it her mission to do   aquila nera october 7thour lodgings in siena had been taken only for five days as they were already engaged after that period so yesterday we returned to our old quarters at the black eagle  in the forenoon j and i went out of one of the gates the road from it leads to florence and had a pleasant country walk  our way wound downward round the hill on which siena stands and gave us views of the duomo and its campanile seemingly pretty near after we had walked long enough to be quite remote from them  sitting awhile on the parapet of a bridge i saw a laborer chopping the branches off a poplartree which he had felled and when it was trimmed he took up the large trunk on one of his shoulders and carried it off seemingly with ease  he did not look like a particularly robust man but i have never seen such an herculean feat attempted by an englishman or american  it has frequently struck me that the italians are able to put forth a great deal of strength in such insulated efforts as this but i have been told that they are less capable of continued endurance and hardship than our own race  i do not know why it should be so except that i presume their food is less strong than ours  there was no other remarkable incident in our walk which lay chiefly through gorges of the hills winding beneath high cliffs of the brown siena earth with many pretty scenes of rural landscape vineyards everywhere and olivetrees a mill on its little stream over which there was an old stone bridge with a graceful arch farmhouses a villa or two subterranean passages passing from the roadside through the high banks into the vineyards  at last we turned aside into a road which led us pretty directly to another gate of the city and climbed steeply upward among tanneries where the young men went about with their wellshaped legs bare their trousers being tucked up till they were strictly breeches and nothing else  the campanile stood high above us and by and by and very soon indeed the steep ascent of the street brought us into the neighborhood of the piazza del campo and of our own hotel     from about twelve oclock till one i sat at my chamber window watching the specimens of human life as displayed in the piazza tolomei  here follow several pages of moving objects     of course a multitude of other people passed by but the curiousness of the catalogue is the prevalence of the martial and religious elements  the general costume of the inhabitants is frocks or sacks loosely made and rather shabby often shirtsleeves or the coat hung over one shoulder  they wear felt hats and straw  people of respectability seem to prefer cylinder hats either black or drab and broadcloth frockcoats in the french fashion but like the rest they look a little shabby  almost all the women wear shawls  ladies in swelling petticoats and with fans some of which are highly gilded appear  the people generally are not tall but have a sufficient breadth of shoulder in complexion similar to americans bearded universally the vehicle used for driving is a little gig without a top but these are seldom seen and still less frequently a cab or other carriages  the gait of the people has not the energy of business or decided purpose everybody appears to lounge and to have time for a moments chat and a disposition to rest reason or none  after dinner i walked out of another gate of the city and wandered among some pleasant country lanes bordered with hedges and wearing an english aspect at least i could fancy so  the vicinity of siena is delightful to walk about in there being a verdant outlook a wide prospect of purple mountains though no such level valley as the val d arno and the city stands so high that its towers and domes are seen more picturesquely from many points than those of florence can be  neither is the pedestrian so cruelly shut into narrow lanes between high stonewalls over which he cannot get a glimpse of landscape  as i walked by the hedges yesterday i could have fancied that the olivetrunks were those of appletrees and that i was in one or other of the two lands that i love better than italy  but the great white villas and the farmhouses were unlike anything i have seen elsewhere or that i should wish to see again though proper enough to italy   october 9ththursday forenoon 8th we went to see the palazzo publico there are some fine old halls and chapels adorned with ancient frescos and pictures of which i remember a picture of the virgin by sodoma very beautiful and other fine pictures by the same master  the architecture of these old rooms is grand the roofs being supported by ponderous arches which are covered with frescos still magnificent though faded darkened and defaced  we likewise saw an antique casket of wood enriched with gilding which had once contained an arm of john the baptistso the custode told us  one of the halls was hung with the portraits of eight popes and nearly forty cardinals who were natives of siena  i have done hardly any other sightseeing except a daily visit to the cathedral which i admire and love the more the oftener i go thither its striped peculiarity ceases entirely to interfere with the grandeur and venerable beauty of its impression and i am never weary of gazing through the vista of its arches and noting continually something that i had not seen before in its exuberant adornment  the pavement alone is inexhaustible being covered all over with figures of lifesize or larger which look like immense engravings of gothic or scriptural scenes  there is absalom hanging by his hair and joab slaying him with a spear  there is samson belaboring the philistines with the jawbone of an ass  there are armed knights in the tumult of battle all wrought with wonderful expression  the figures are in white marble inlaid with darker stone and the shading is effected by means of engraved lines in the marble filled in with black  it would be possible perhaps to print impressions from some of these vast plates for the process of cutting the lines was an exact anticipation of the modern art of engraving  however the same thing was doneand i suppose at about the same periodon monumental brasses and i have seen impressions or rubbings from those for sale in the old english churches  yesterday morning in the cathedral i watched a woman at confession being curious to see how long it would take her to tell her sins the growth of a week perhaps  i know not how long she had been confessing when i first observed her but nearly an hour passed before the priest came suddenly from the confessional looking weary and moist with perspiration and took his way out of the cathedral  the woman was left on her knees  this morning i watched another woman and she too was very long about it and i could see the face of the priest behind the curtain of the confessional scarcely inclining his ear to the perforated tin through which the penitent communicated her outpourings  it must be very tedious to listen day after day to the minute and commonplace iniquities of the multitude of penitents and it cannot be often that these are redeemed by the treasuretrove of a great sin  when her confession was over the woman came and sat down on the same bench with me where her broadbrimmed straw hat was lying  she seemed to be a country woman with a simple matronly face which was solemnized and softened with the comfort that she had obtained by disburdening herself of the soil of worldly frailties and receiving absolution  an old woman who haunts the cathedral whispered to her and she went and knelt down where a procession of priests were to pass and then the old lady begged a cruzia of me and got a halfpaul  it almost invariably happens in church or cathedral that beggars address their prayers to the heretic visitor and probably with more unction than to the virgin or saints however i have nothing to say against the sincerity of this peoples devotion  they give all the proof of it that a mere spectator can estimate  last evening we all went out to see the comet which then reached its climax of lustre  it was like a lofty plume of fire and grew very brilliant as the night darkened   october 10ththis morning too we went to the cathedral and sat long listening to the music of the organ and voices and witnessing rites and ceremonies which are far older than even the ancient edifice where they were exhibited  a good many people were present sitting kneeling or walking abouta freedom that contrasts very agreeably with the grim formalities of english churches and our own meetinghouses  many persons were in their best attire but others came in with unabashed simplicity in their old garments of labor sunburnt women from their toil among the vines and olives  one old peasant i noticed with his withered shanks in breeches and blue yarn stockings  the people of whatever class are wonderfully tolerant of heretics never manifesting any displeasure or annoyance though they must see that we are drawn thither by curiosity alone and merely pry while they pray  i heartily wish the priests were better men and that human nature divinely influenced could be depended upon for a constant supply and succession of good and pure ministers their religion has so many admirable points  and then it is a sad pity that this noble and beautiful cathedral should be a mere fossil shell out of which the life has died long ago  but for many a year yet to come the tapers will burn before the high altar the host will be elevated the incense diffuse its fragrance the confessionals be open to receive the penitents  i saw a father entering with two little bits of boys just big enough to toddle along holding his hand on either side  the father dipped his fingers into the marble font of holy waterwhich on its pedestals was two or three times as high as those small christians and wetted a hand of each and taught them how to cross themselves when they come to be men it will be impossible to convince those children that there is no efficacy in holy water without plucking up all religious faith and sentiment by the roots  generally i suspect when people throw off the faith they were born in the best soil of their hearts is apt to cling to its roots  raised several feet above the pavement against every clustered pillar along the nave of the cathedral is placed a statue of gothic sculpture in various places are sitting statues of popes of sienese nativity all of whom i believe have a hand raised in the act of blessing  shrines and chapels set in grand heavy frames of pillared architecture stand all along the aisles and transepts and these seem in many instances to have been built and enriched by noble families whose arms are sculptured on the pedestals of the pillars sometimes with a cardinals hat above to denote the rank of one of its members  how much pride love and reverence in the lapse of ages must have clung to the sharp points of all this sculpture and architecture  the cathedral is a religion in itself something worth dying for to those who have an hereditary interest in it  in the pavement yesterday i noticed the gravestone of a person who fell six centuries ago in the battle of monte aperto and was buried here by public decree as a meed of valor  this afternoon i took a walk out of one of the city gates and found the country about siena as beautiful in this direction as in all others  i came to a little stream flowing over into a pebbly bed and collecting itself into pools with a scanty rivulet between  its glen was deep and was crossed by a bridge of several lofty and narrow arches like those of a roman aqueduct  it is a modern structure however  farther on as i wound round along the base of a hill which fell down upon the road by precipitous cliffs of brown earth i saw a gray ruined wall on the summit surrounded with cypresstrees  this tree is very frequent about siena and the scenery is made soft and beautiful by a variety of other trees and shrubbery without which these hills and gorges would have scarcely a charm  the road was thronged with country people mostly women and children who had been spending the feastday in siena and parties of boys were chasing one another through the fields pretty much as boys do in new england of a sunday but the sienese lads had not the sense of sabbathbreaking like our boys  sunday with these people is like any other feastday and consecrated cheerful enjoyment  so much religious observance as regards outward forms is diffused through the whole week that they have no need to intensify the sabbath except by making it gladden the other days  returning through the same gate by which i had come out i ascended into the city by a long and steep street which was paved with bricks set edgewise  this pavement is common in many of the streets which being too steep for horses and carriages are meant only to sustain the lighter tread of mules and asses  the more level streets are paved with broad smooth flagstones like those of florencea fashion which i heartily regret to change for the little penitential blocks of rome  the walls of siena in their present state and so far as i have seen them are chiefly brick but there are intermingled fragments of ancient stonework and i wonder why the latter does not prevail more largely  the romans howeverand siena had roman characteristicsalways liked to build of brick a taste that has made their ruins now that the marble slabs are torn off much less grand than they ought to have been  i am grateful to the old sienese for having used stone so largely in their domestic architecture and thereby rendered their city so grimly picturesque with its black palaces frowning upon one another from arched windows across narrow streets to the height of six stories like opposite ranks of tall men looking sternly into one anothers eyes   october 11thagain i went to the cathedral this morning and spent an hour listening to the music and looking through the orderly intricacies of the arches where many vistas open away among the columns of the choir  there are five clustered columns on each side of the nave then under the dome there are two more arches not in a straight line but forming the segment of a circle and beyond the circle of the dome there are four more arches extending to the extremity of the chancel  i should have said instead of clustered columns as above that there are five arches along the nave supported by columns  this cathedral has certainly bewitched me to write about it so much effecting nothing with my pains  i should judge the width of each arch to be about twenty feet and the thickness of each clustered pillar is eight or ten more and the length of the entire building may be between two and three hundred feet not very large certainly but it makes an impression of grandeur independent of size      i never shall succeed even in reminding myself of the venerable magnificence of this minster with its arches its columns its cornice of popes heads its great wheel windows its manifold ornament all combining in one vast effect though many men have labored individually and through a long course of time to produce this multifarious handiwork and headwork  i now took a walk out of the city  a road turned immediately to the left as i emerged from the city and soon proved to be a rustic lane leading past several villas and farmhouses  it was a very pleasant walk with vineyards and oliveorchards on each side and now and then glimpses of the towers and sombre heapedup palaces of siena and now a rural seclusion again for the hills rise and the valleys fall like the swell and subsidence of the sea after a gale so that siena may be quite hidden within a quarter of a mile of its wall or may be visible i doubt not twenty miles away  it is a fine old town with every promise of health and vigor in its atmosphere and really if i could take root anywhere i know not but it could as well be here as in another place  it would only be a kind of despair however that would ever make me dream of finding a home in italy a sense that i had lost my country through absence or incongruity and that earth is not an abidingplace  i wonder that we americans love our country at all it having no limits and no oneness and when you try to make it a matter of the heart everything falls away except ones native state neither can you seize hold of that unless you tear it out of the union bleeding and quivering  yet unquestionably we do stand by our national flag as stoutly as any people in the world and i myself have felt the heart throb at sight of it as sensibly as other men  i think the singularity of our form of government contributes to give us a kind of patriotism by separating us from other nations more entirely  if other nations had similar institutionsif england especially were a democracywe should as readily make ourselves at home in another country as now in a new state   october 12thand again we went to the cathedral this forenoon and the whole family except myself sketched portions of it  even rosebud stood gravely sketching some of the inlaid figures of the pavement  as for me i can but try to preserve some memorial of this beautiful edifice in illfitting words that never hit the mark  this morning visit was not my final one for i went again after dinner and walked quite round the whole interior  i think i have not yet mentioned the rich carvings of the old oaken seats round the choir and the curious mosaic of lighter and darker woods by which figures and landscapes are skilfully represented on the backs of some of the stalls  the process seems to be the same as the inlaying and engraving of the pavement the material in one case being marble in the other wood  the only other thing that i particularly noticed was that in the fonts of holy water at the front entrance marble fish are sculptured in the depths of the basin and eels and shellfish crawling round the brim  have i spoken of the sumptuous carving of the capitals of the columns  at any rate i have left a thousand beauties without a word  here i drop the subject  as i took my parting glance the cathedral had a gleam of golden sunshine in its far depths and it seemed to widen and deepen itself as if to convince me of my error in saying yesterday that it is not very large  i wonder how i could say it  after taking leave of the cathedral i found my way out of another of the city gates and soon turned aside into a green lane     soon the lane passed through a hamlet consisting of a few farmhouses the shabbiest and dreariest that can be conceived ancient and ugly and dilapidated with irongrated windows below and heavy wooden shutters on the windows abovehigh ruinous walls shutting in the courts and ponderous gates one of which was off its hinges  the farmyards were perfect pictures of disarray and slovenly administration of home affairs only one of these houses had a door opening on the road and that was the meanest in the hamlet  a flight of narrow stone stairs ascended from the threshold to the second story  all these houses were specimens of a rude antiquity built of brick and stone with the marks of arched doors and windows where a subsequent generation had shut up the lights or the accesses which the original builders had opened  humble as these dwellings arethough large and high compared with rural residences in other countriesthey may very probably date back to the times when siena was a warlike republic and when every house in its neighborhood had need to be a fortress  i suppose however prowling banditti were the only enemies against whom a defence would be attempted  what lives must now be lived therein beastly ignorance mental sluggishness hard toil for little profit filth and a horrible discomfort of fleas for if the palaces of italy are overrun with these pests what must the country hovels be      we are now all ready for a start tomorrow    radicofani   october 13thwe arranged to begin our journey at six     it was a chill lowering morning and the rain blew a little in our faces before we had gone far but did not continue long  the country soon lost the pleasant aspect which it wears immediately about siena and grew very barren and dreary  then it changed again for the better the road leading us through a fertility of vines and olives after which the dreary and barren hills came back again and formed our prospect throughout most of the day  we stopped for our dejeuner a la fourchette at a little old town called san quirico which we entered through a ruined gateway the town being entirely surrounded by its ancient wall this wall is far more picturesque than that of siena being lofty and built of stone with a machicolation of arches running quite round its top like a cornice  it has little more than a single street perhaps a quarter of a mile long narrow paved with flagstones in the florentine fashion and lined with two rows of tall rusty stone houses without a gap between them from end to end  the cafes were numerous in relation to the size of the town and there were two tavernsour own the eagle being doubtless the best and having three arched entrances in its front of these the middle one led to the guests apartments the one on the right to the barn and that on the left to the stable so that as is usual in italian inns the whole establishment was under one roof  we were shown into a brickpaved room on the first floor adorned with a funny fresco of aurora on the ceiling and with some colored prints both religious and profane      as we drove into the town we noticed a gothic church with two doors of peculiar architecture and while our dejeuner was being prepared we went to see it  the interior had little that was remarkable for it had been repaired early in the last century and spoilt of course but an old triptych is still hanging in a chapel beside the high altar  it is painted on wood and dates back beyond the invention of oilpainting and represents the virgin and some saints and angels  neither is the exterior of the church particularly interesting with the exception of the carving and ornaments of two of the doors  both of them have round arches deep and curiously wrought and the pillars of one of the two are formed of a peculiar knot or twine in stonework such as i cannot well describe but it is both ingenious and simple  these pillars rest on two nondescript animals which look as much like walruses as anything else the pillars of the other door consist of two figures supporting the capitals and themselves standing on two handsomely carved lions  the work is curious and evidently very ancient and the material a red freestone  after lunch j and i took a walk out of the gate of the town opposite to that of our entrance  there were no soldiers on guard as at city gates of more importance nor do i think that there is really any gate to shut but the massive stone gateway still stands entire over the empty arch  looking back after we had passed through i observed that the lofty upper story is converted into a dovecot and that pumpkins were put to ripen in some open chambers at one side  we passed near the base of a tall square tower which is said to be of roman origin  the little town is in the midst of a barren region but its immediate neighborhood is fertile and an oliveorchard venerable of aspect lay on the other side of the pleasant lane with its english hedges and olivetrees grew likewise along the base of the city wall  the arched machicolations which i have before mentioned were here and there interrupted by a house which was built upon the old wall or incorporated into it and from the windows of one of then i saw ears of indian corn hung out to ripen in the sun and somebody was winnowing grain at a little door that opened through the wall  it was very pleasant to see the ancient warlike rampart thus overcome with rustic peace  the ruined gateway is partly overgrown with ivy  returning to our inn along the street we saw  sketching one of the doors of the gothic church in the midst of a crowd of the good people of san quirico who made no scruple to look over her shoulder pressing so closely as hardly to allow her elbowroom  i must own that i was too cowardly to come forward and take my share of this public notice so i turned away to the inn and there awaited her coming  indeed she has seldom attempted to sketch without finding herself the nucleus of a throng    viterbo   the black eagle october 14thperhaps i had something more to say of san quirico but i shall merely add that there is a stately old palace of the piccolomini close to the church above described  it is built in the style of the roman palaces and looked almost large enough to be one of them  nevertheless the basement story or part of it seems to be used as a barn and stable for i saw a yoke of oxen in the entrance  i cannot but mention a most wretched team of vetturahorses which stopped at the door of our albergo poor lean downcast creatures with deep furrows between their ribs nothing but skin and bone in short and not even so much skin as they should have had for it was partially worn off from their backs  the harness was fastened with ropes the traces and reins were ropes the carriage was old and shabby and out of this miserable equipage there alighted an ancient gentleman and lady whom our waiter affirmed to be the prefect of florence and his wife  we left san quirico at two oclock and followed an ascending road till we got into the region above the clouds the landscape was very wide but very dreary and barren and grew more and more so till we began to climb the mountain of radicofani the peak of which had been blackening itself on the horizon almost the whole day  when we had come into a pretty high region we were assailed by a real mountain tempest of wind rain and hail which pelted down upon us in good earnest and cooled the air a little below comfort  as we toiled up the mountain its upper region presented a very striking aspect looking as if a precipice had been smoothed and squared for the purpose of rendering the old castle on its summit more inaccessible than it was by nature  this is the castle of the robberknight ghino di tacco whom boccaccio introduces into the decameron  a freebooter of those days must have set a higher value on such a rock as this than if it had been one mass of diamond for no art of mediaeval warfare could endanger him in such a fortress  drawing yet nearer we found the hillside immediately above us strewn with thousands upon thousands of great fragments of stone  it looked as if some great ruin had taken place there only it was too vast a ruin to have been the dismemberment and dissolution of anything made by man  we could now see the castle on the height pretty distinctly  it seemed to impend over the precipice and close to the base of the latter we saw the street of a town on as strange and inconvenient a foundation as ever one was built upon  i suppose the inhabitants of the village were dependants of the old knight of the castle his brotherhood of robbers as they married and had families settled there under the shelter of the eagles nest  but the singularity is how a community of people have contrived to live and perpetuate themselves so far out of the reach of the worlds help and seemingly with no means of assisting in the worlds labor  i cannot imagine how they employ themselves except in begging and even that branch of industry appears to be left to the old women and the children  no house was ever built in this immediate neighborhood for any such natural purpose as induces people to build them on other sites even our hotel at which we now arrived could not be said to be a natural growth of the soil it had originally been a whim of one of the grand dukes of tuscanya huntingpalaceintended for habitation only during a few weeks of the year  of all dreary hotels i ever alighted at methinks this is the most so but on first arriving i merely followed the waiter to look at our rooms across stonepaved basementhalls dismal as etruscan tombs up dim staircases and along shivering corridors all of stone stone stone nothing but cold stone  after glancing at these pleasant accommodations my wife and i with j set out to ascend the hill and visit the town of radicofani  it is not more than a quarter of a mile above our hotel and is accessible by a good piece of road though very steep  as we approached the town we were assailed by some little beggars but this is the case all through italy in city or solitude and i think the mendicants of radicofani are fewer than its proportion  we had not got far towards the village when looking back over the scene of many miles that lay stretched beneath us we saw a heavy shower apparently travelling straight towards us over hill and dale  it seemed inevitable that it should soon be upon us so i persuaded my wife to return to the hotel but j and i kept onward being determined to see radicofani with or without a drenching  we soon entered the street the blackest ugliest rudest old street i do believe that ever human life incrusted itself with  the first portion of it is the overbrimming of the town in generations subsequent to that in which it was surrounded by a wall but after going a little way we came to a high square tower planted right across the way with an arched gateway in its basement story so that it looked like a great shortlegged giant striding over the street of radicofani  within the gateway is the proper and original town though indeed the portion outside of the gate is as densely populated as ugly and as ancient as that within  the street was very narrow and paved with flagstones not quite so smooth as those of florence the houses are tall enough to be stately if they were not so inconceivably dingy and shabby but with their halfdozen stories they make only the impression of hovel piled upon hovelsqualor immortalized in undecaying stone  it was now getting far into the twilight and i could not distinguish the particularities of the little town except that there were shops a cafe or two and as many churches all dusky with age crowded closely together inconvenient stifled too in spite of the breadth and freedom of the mountain atmosphere outside the scanty precincts of the street  it was a deathinlife little place a fossilized place and yet the street was thronged and had all the bustle of a city even more noise than a citys street because everybody in radicofani knows everybody and probably gossips with everybody being everybodys blood relation as they cannot fail to have become after they and their forefathers have been shut up together within the narrow walls for many hundred years  they looked round briskly at j and me but were courteous as italians always are and made way for us to pass through the throng as we kept on still ascending the steep street  it took us but a few minutes to reach the still steeper and winding pathway which climbs towards the old castle  after ascending above the village the path though still paved becomes very rough as if the hoofs of ghino di taccos robber cavalry had displaced the stones and they had never been readjusted  on every side too except where the path just finds space enough there is an enormous rubbish of huge stones which seems to have fallen from the precipice above or else to have rained down out of the sky  we kept on and by and by reached what seemed to have been a lower outwork of the castle on the top there was the massive old arch of a gateway and a great deal of ruin of mans work beside the large stones that here as elsewhere were scattered so abundantly  within the wall and gateway just mentioned however there was a kind of farmhouse adapted i suppose out of the old ruin and i noticed some ears of indian corn hanging out of a window there were also a few stacks of hay but no signs of human or animal life and it is utterly inexplicable to me where these products of the soil could have come from for certainly they never grew amid that barrenness  we had not yet reached ghinos castle and being now beneath it we had to bend our heads far backward to see it rising up against the clear sky while we were now in twilight  the path upward looked terribly steep and rough and if we had climbed it we should probably have broken our necks in descending again into the lower obscurity  we therefore stopped here much against js will and went back as we came still wondering at the strange situation of radicofani for its aspect is as if it had stepped off the top of the cliff and lodged at its base though still in danger of sliding farther down the hillside  emerging from the compact grimy life of its street we saw that the shower had swept by or probably had expended itself in a region beneath us for we were above the scope of many of the showery clouds that haunt a hillcountry  there was a very bright star visible i remember and we saw the new moon now a third towards the full for the first time this evening  the air was cold and bracing  but i am excessively sleepy so will not describe our great dreary hotel where a blast howled in an interminable corridor all night  it did not seem to have anything to do with the wind out of doors but to be a blast that had been casually shut in when the doors were closed behind the last grand duke who came hither and departed and ever since it has been kept prisoner and makes a melancholy wail along the corridor  the dreamy stupidity of this conceit proves how sleepy i am    sette vene   october 15thwe left radicofani long before sunrise and i saw that ceremony take place from the coupe of the vettura for the first time in a long while  a sunset is the better sight of the two  i have always suspected it and have been strengthened in the idea whenever i have had an opportunity of comparison  our departure from radicofani was most dreary except that we were very glad to get away but the cold discomfort of dressing in a chill bedroom by candlelight and our uncertain wandering through the immense hotel with a dim taper in search of the breakfastroom and our poor breakfast of eggs italian bread and coffeeall these things made me wish that people were created with roots like trees so they could not befool themselves with wandering about  however we had not long been on our way before the morning air blew away all our troubles and we rumbled cheerfully onward ready to encounter even the papal customhouse officers at ponte centino  our road thither was a pretty steep descent  i remember the barren landscape of hills with here and there a lonely farmhouse which there seemed to be no occasion for where nothing grew  at ponte centino my passport was examined and i was invited into an office where sat the papal customhouse officer a thin subtlelooking keeneyed sallow personage of aspect very suitable to be the agent of a government of priests  i communicated to him my wish to pass the customhouse without giving the officers the trouble of examining my luggage  he inquired whether i had any dutiable articles and wrote for my signature a declaration in the negative and then he lifted a sandbox beneath which was a little heap of silver coins  on this delicate hint i asked what was the usual fee and was told that fifteen pauls was the proper sum  i presume it was entirely an illegal charge and that he had no right to pass any luggage without examination but the thing is winked at by the authorities and no money is better spent for the travellers convenience than these fifteen pauls  there was a papal military officer in the room and he i believe cheated me in the change of a napoleon as his share of the spoil  at the door a soldier met me with my passport and looked as if he expected a fee for handing it to me but in this he was disappointed  after i had resumed my seat in the coupe the porter of the customhousea poor sicklylooking creature half dead with the malaria of the placeappeared and demanded a fee for doing nothing to my luggage  he got three pauls and looked but half contented  this whole set of men seem to be as corrupt as official people can possibly be and yet i hardly know whether to stigmatize them as corrupt because it is not their individual delinquency but the operation of a regular system  their superiors know what men they are and calculate upon their getting a living by just these means  and indeed the customhouse and passport regulations as they exist in italy would be intolerable if there were not this facility of evading them at little cost  such laws are good for nothing but to be broken  we now began to ascend again and the country grew fertile and picturesque  we passed many mules and donkeys laden with a sort of deep firkin on each side of the saddle and these were heaped up with grapes both purple and white  we bought some and got what we should have thought an abundance at small price only we used to get twice as many at montanto for the same money  however a roman paul bought us three or four pounds even here  we still ascended and came soon to the gateway of the town of acquapendente which stands on a height that seems to descend by natural terraces to the valley below      french soldiers in their bluishgray coats and scarlet trousers were on duty at the gate and one of them took my passport and the vetturinos and we then drove into the town to wait till they should be vised  we saw but one street narrow with tall rusty aged houses built of stone evil smelling in short a kind of place that would be intolerably dismal in cloudy england and cannot be called cheerful even under the sun of italy     priests passed and burly friars one of whom was carrying a winebarrel on his head  little carts laden with firkins of grapes and donkeys with the same genial burden brushed passed our vettura finding scarce room enough in the narrow street  all the idlers of acquapendenteand they were manyassembled to gaze at us but not discourteously  indeed i never saw an idle curiosity exercised in such a pleasant way as by the countrypeople of italy  it almost deserves to be called a kindly interest and sympathy instead of a hard and cold curiosity like that of our own people and it is displayed with such simplicity that it is evident no offence is intended  by and by the vetturino brought his passport and my own with the official vise and we kept on our way still ascending passing through vineyards and olives and meeting grapeladen donkeys till we came to the town of san lorenzo nuovo a place built by pius vi as the refuge for the people of a lower town which had been made uninhabitable by malaria  the new town which i suppose is hundreds of years old with all its novelty shows strikingly the difference between places that grow up and shape out their streets of their own accord as it were and one that is built on a settled plan of malice aforethought  this little rural village has gates of classic architecture a spacious piazza and a great breadth of straight and rectangular streets with houses of uniform style airy and wholesome looking to a degree seldom seen on the continent  nevertheless i must say that the town looked hatefully dull and ridiculously prim and of the two i had rather spend my life in radicofani  we drove through it from gate to gate without stopping and soon came to the brow of a hill whence we beheld right beneath us the beautiful lake of bolsena not exactly at our feet however for a portion of level ground lay between haunted by the pestilence which has depopulated all these shores and made the lake and its neighborhood a solitude  it looked very beautiful nevertheless with a sheen of a silver mid a gray like that of steel as the wind blew and the sun shone over it and judging by my own feelings i should really have thought that the breeze from its surface was bracing and healthy  descending the hill we passed the ruins of the old town of san lorenzo of which the prim village on the hilltop may be considered the daughter there is certainly no resemblance between parent and child the former being situated on a sort of precipitous bluff where there could have been no room for piazzas and spacious streets nor accessibility except by mules donkeys goats and people of alpine habits  there was an ivycovered tower on the top of the bluff and some arched cavern mouths that looked as if they opened into the great darkness  these were the entrances to etruscan tombs for the town on top had been originally etruscan and the inhabitants had buried themselves in the heart of the precipitous bluffs after spending their lives on its summit  reaching the plain we drove several miles along the shore of the lake and found the soil fertile and generally well cultivated especially with the vine though there were tracks apparently too marshy to be put to any agricultural purpose  we met now and then a flock of sheep watched by sallowlooking and spiritless men and boys who we took it for granted would soon perish of malaria though i presume they never spend their nights in the immediate vicinity of the lake  i should like to inquire whether animals suffer from the bad qualities of the air  the lake is not nearly so beautiful on a nearer view as it is from the hill above there being no rocky margin nor bright sandy beach but everywhere this interval of level ground and often swampy marsh betwixt the water and the hill  at a considerable distance from the shore we saw two islands one of which is memorable as having been the scene of an empresss murder but i cannot stop to fill my journal with historical reminiscences  we kept onward to the town of bolsena which stands nearly a mile from the lake and on a site higher than the level margin yet not so much so i should apprehend as to free it from danger of malaria  we stopped at an albergo outside of the wall of the town and before dinner had time to see a good deal of the neighborhood  the first aspect of the town was very striking with a vista into its street through the open gateway and high above it an old gray squarebuilt castle with three towers visible at the angles one of them battlemented one taller than the rest and one partially ruined  outside of the towngate there were some fragments of etruscan ruin capitals of pillars and altars with inscriptions these we glanced at and then made our entrance through the gate  there it was againthe same narrow dirty timedarkened street of piledup houses which we have so often seen the same swarm of illtodo people grapeladen donkeys little stands or shops of roasted chestnuts peaches tomatoes white and purple figs the same evidence of a fertile land and grimy poverty in the midst of abundance which nature tries to heap into their hands  it seems strange that they can never grasp it  we had gone but a little way along this street when we saw a narrow lane that turned aside from it and went steeply upward  its name was on the cornerthe via di castelloand as the castle promised to be more interesting than anything else we immediately began to ascend  the streeta strange name for such an avenueclambered upward in the oddest fashion passing under arches scrambling up steps so that it was more like a long irregular pair of stairs than anything that christians call a street and so large a part of it was under arches that we scarcely seemed to be out of doors  at last u who was in advance emerged into the upper air and cried out that we had ascended to an upper town and a larger one than that beneath  it really seemed like coming up out of the earth into the midst of the town when we found ourselves so unexpectedly in upper bolsena  we were in a little nook surrounded by old edifices and called the piazza del orologio on account of a clock that was apparent somewhere  the castle was close by and from its platform there was a splendid view of the lake and all the near hillcountry  the castle itself is still in good condition and apparently as strong as ever it was as respects the exterior walls but within there seemed to be neither floor nor chamber nothing but the empty shell of the dateless old fortress  the stones at the base and lower part of the building were so massive that i should think the etrurians must have laid them and then perhaps the romans built a little higher and the mediaeval people raised the battlements and towers  but we did not look long at the castle our attention being drawn to the singular aspect of the town itself whichto speak first of its most prominent characteristicis the very filthiest place i do believe that was ever inhabited by man  defilement was everywhere in the piazza in nooks and corners strewing the miserable lanes from side to side the refuse of every day and of accumulated ages  i wonder whether the ancient romans were as dirty a people as we everywhere find those who have succeeded them for there seems to have been something in the places that have been inhabited by romans or made famous in their history and in the monuments of every kind that they have raised that puts people in mind of their very earthliness and incites them to defile therewith whatever temple column ruined palace or triumphal arch may fall in their way  i think it must be an hereditary trait probably weakened and robbed of a little of its horror by the influence of milder ages and i am much afraid that caesar trod narrower and fouler ways in his path to power than those of modern rome or even of this disgusting town of bolsena  i cannot imagine anything worse than these however rotten vegetables thrown everywhere about musty straw standing puddles running rivulets of dissolved nastinessthese matters were a relief amid viler objects  the town was full of great black hogs wallowing before every door and they grunted at us with a kind of courtesy and affability as if the town were theirs and it was their part to be hospitable to strangers  many donkeys likewise accosted us with braying children growing more uncleanly every day they lived pestered us with begging men stared askance at us as they lounged in corners and women endangered us with slops which they were flinging from doorways into the street  no decent words can describe no admissible image can give an idea of this noisome place  and yet i remember the donkeys came up the height loaded with fruit and with little flatsided barrels of wine the people had a good atmosphereexcept as they polluted it themselveson their high site and there seemed to be no reason why they should not live a beautiful and jolly life  i did not mean to write such an ugly description as the above but it is well once for all to have attempted conveying an idea of what disgusts the traveller more or less in all these italian towns  setting aside this grand characteristic the upper town of bolsena is a most curious and interesting place  it was originally an etruscan city the ancient volsinii and when taken and destroyed by the romans was said to contain two thousand statues  afterwards the romans built a town upon the site including i suppose the space occupied by the lower city which looks as if it had brimmed over like radicofani and fallen from the precipitous height occupied by the upper  the latter is a strange confusion of black and ugly houses piled massively out of the ruins of former ages built rudely and without plan as a pauper would build his hovel and yet with here and there an arched gateway a cornice a pillar that might have adorned a palace     the streets are the narrowest i have seen anywhereof no more width indeed than may suffice for the passage of a donkey with his panniers  they wind in and out in strange confusion and hardly look like streets at all but nevertheless have names printed on the corners just as if they were stately avenues  after looking about us awhile and drawing halfbreaths so as to take in the less quantity of gaseous pollution we went back to the castle and descended by a path winding downward from it into the plain outside of the towngate  it was now dinnertime     and we had in the first place some fish from the pestiferous lake not i am sorry to say the famous stewed eels which dante says killed pope martin but some trout     by the by the meal was not dinner but our midday colazione  after despatching it we again wandered forth and strolled round the outside of the lower town which with the upper one made as picturesque a combination as could be desired  the old wall that surrounds the lower town has been appropriated long since as the back wall of a range of houses windows have been pierced through it upper chambers and loggie have been built upon it so that it looks something like a long row of rural dwellings with one continuous front or back constructed in a strange style of massive strength contrasting with the vines that here and there are trained over it and with the wreaths of yellow corn that hang from the windows  but portions of the old battlements are interspersed with the line of homely chambers and tiled housetops  within the wall the town is very compact and above its roofs rises a rock the sheer precipitous bluff on which stands the upper town whose foundations impend over the highest roof in the lower  at one end is the old castle with its towers rising above the square battlemented mass of the main fortress and if we had not seen the dirt and squalor that dwells within this venerable outside we should have carried away a picture of gray grim dignity presented by a long past age to the present one to put its mean ways and modes to shame   sat diligently sketching and children came about her exceedingly unfragrant but very courteous and gentle looking over her shoulders and expressing delight as they saw each familiar edifice take its place in the sketch  they are a lovable people these italians as i find from almost all with whom we come in contact they have great and little faults and no great virtues that i know of but still are sweet amiable pleasant to encounter save when they beg or when you have to bargain with them  we left bolsena and drove to viterbo passing the gate of the picturesque town of montefiascone over the wall of which i saw spires and towers and the dome of a cathedral  i was sorry not to taste in its own town the celebrated est which was the deathdraught of the jolly prelate  at viterbo however i called for some wine of montefiascone and had a little strawcovered flask which the waiter assured us was the genuine estwine  it was of golden color and very delicate somewhat resembling still champagne but finer and requiring a calmer pause to appreciate its subtle delight  its good qualities however are so evanescent that the finer flavor became almost imperceptible before we finished the flask  viterbo is a large disagreeable town built at the foot of a mountain the peak of which is seen through the vista of some of the narrow streets  there are more fountains in viterbo than i have seen in any other city of its size and many of them of very good design  around most of them there were winehogsheads waiting their turn to be cleansed and rinsed before receiving the wine of the present vintage  passing a doorway j saw some men treading out the grapes in a great vat with their naked feet  among the beggars here the loudest and most vociferous was a crippled postilion wearing his uniform jacket green faced with red and he seemed to consider himself entitled still to get his living from travellers as having been disabled in the way of his profession  i recognized his claim and was rewarded with a courteous and grateful bow at our departure     to beggarsafter my much experience both in england and italyi give very little though i am not certain that it would not often be real beneficence in the latter country  there being little or no provision for poverty and age the poor must often suffer nothing can be more earnest than their entreaties for aid nothing seemingly more genuine than their gratitude when they receive it  they return you the value of their alms in prayers and say god will accompany you  many of them have a professional whine and a certain doleful twist of the neck and turn of the head which hardens my heart against them at once  a painter might find numerous models among them if canvas had not already been more than sufficiently covered with their style of the picturesque  there is a certain brickdust colored cloak worn in viterbo not exclusively by beggars which when ragged enough is exceedingly artistic    rome   68 piazza poli october 17thwe left viterbo on the 15th and proceeded through monterosi to sette verse  there was nothing interesting at sette verse except an old roman bridge of a single arch which had kept its sweep composed of one row of stones unbroken for two or more thousand years and looked just as strong as ever though gray with age and fringed with plants that found it hard to fix themselves in its close crevices  the next day we drove along the cassian way towards rome  it was a most delightful morning a genial atmosphere the more so i suppose because this was the campagna the region of pestilence and death  i had a quiet gentle comfortable pleasure as if after many wanderings i was drawing near rome for now that i have known it once rome certainly does draw into itself my heart as i think even london or even little concord itself or old sleepy salem never did and never will  besides we are to stay here six months and we had now a house all prepared to receive us so that this present approach in the noontide of a genial day was most unlike our first one when we crept towards rome through the wintry midnight benumbed with cold ill weary and not knowing whither to betake ourselves  ah that was a dismal tine  one thing however that disturbed even my present equanimity a little was the necessity of meeting the customhouse at the porta del popolo but my past experience warranted me in believing that even these ogres might be mollified by the magic touch of a scudo and so it proved  we should have escaped any examination at all the officer whispered me if his superior had not happened to be present but as the case stood they took down only one trunk from the top of the vettura just lifted the lid closed it again and gave us permission to proceed  so we came to 68 piazza poli and found ourselves at once at home in such a comfortable cosey little house as i did not think existed in rome  i ought to say a word about our vetturino constantino bacci an excellent and most favorable specimen of his class for his magnificent conduct his liberality and all the good qualities that ought to be imperial s called him the emperor  he took us to good hotels and feasted us with the best he was kind to us all and especially to little rosebud who used to run by his side with her small white hand in his great brown one he was cheerful in his deportment and expressed his good spirits by the smack of his whip which is the barometer of a vetturinos inward weather he drove admirably and would rumble up to the door of an albergo and stop to a hairsbreadth just where it was most convenient for us to alight he would hire postilions and horses where other vetturini would take nothing better than sluggish oxen to help us up the hilly roads so that sometimes we had a team of seven he did all that we could possibly require of him and was content and more with a buon mono of five scudi in addition to the stipulated price finally i think the tears had risen almost to his eyelids when we parted with him  our friends the thompsons through whose kindness we procured this house called to see us soon after our arrival  in the afternoon i walked with rosebud to the medici gardens and on our way thither we espied our former servant lalla who flung so many and such bitter curses after us on our departure from rome sitting at her fathers fruitstall  thank god they have not taken effect  after going to the medici we went to the pincian gardens and looked over into the borghese grounds which methought were more beautiful than ever  the same was true of the sky and of every object beneath it and as we came homeward along the corso i wondered at the stateliness and palatial magnificence of that noble street  once i remember i thought it narrow and far unworthy of its fame  in the way of costume the men in goatskin breeches whom we met on the campagna were very striking and looked like satyrs   october 21st    i have been twice to st peters and was impressed more than at any former visit by a sense of breadth and loftiness and as it were a visionary splendor and magnificence  i also went to the museum of the capitol and the statues seemed to me more beautiful than formerly and i was not sensible of the cold despondency with which i have so often viewed them  yesterday we went to the corsini palace which we had not visited before  it stands in the trastevere in the longara and is a stately palace with a grand staircase leading to the first floor where is situated the range of picturerooms  there were a good many fine pictures but none of them have made a memorable impression on my mind except a portrait by vandyke of a man in pointlace very grand and very real  the room in which this picture hung had many other portraits by holbein titian rembrandt rubens and other famous painters and was wonderfully rich in this department  in another there was a portrait of pope julius ii by raphael somewhat differing from those at the pitti and the uffizi galleries in florence and those i have seen in england and paris thinner paler perhaps older more severely intellectual but at least as high a work of art as those  the palace has some handsome old furniture and gilded chairs covered with leather cases possibly relics of queen christinas time who died here  i know not but the most curious object was a curule chair of marble sculptured all out of one piece and adorned with basreliefs it is supposed to be etruscan  it has a circular back sweeping round so as to afford sufficient rests for the elbows and sitting down in it i discovered that modern ingenuity has not made much real improvement on this chair of three or four thousand years ago  but some chairs are easier for the moment yet soon betray you and grow the more irksome  we strolled along longara and found the piazza of st peters full of french soldiers at their drill     we went quite round the interior of the church and perceiving the pavement loose and broken near the altar where guidos archangel is placed we picked up some bits of rosso antico and gray marble to be set in brooches as relics  we have the snuggest little set of apartments in rome seven rooms including an antechamber and though the stairs are exceedingly narrow there is really a carpet on thema civilized comfort of which the proudest palaces in the eternal city cannot boast  the stairs are very steep however and i should not wonder if some of us broke our noses down them  narrowness of space within doors strikes us all rather ludicrously yet not unpleasantly after being accustomed to the wastes and deserts of the montanto villa  it is well thus to be put in training for the oversnugness of our cottage in concord  our windows here look out on a small and rather quiet piazza with an immense palace on the left hand and a smaller yet statelier one on the right and just round the corner of the street leading out of our piazza is the fountain of trevi of which i can hear the plash in the evening when other sounds are hushed  looking over what i have said of sodomas christ bound at sierra i see that i have omitted to notice what seems to me one of its most striking characteristicsits loneliness  you feel as if the saviour were deserted both in heaven and earth the despair is in him which made him say my god why hast thou forsaken me  even in this extremity however he is still divine and sodoma almost seems to have reconciled the impossibilities of combining an omnipresent divinity with a suffering and outraged humanity  but this is one of the cases in which the spectators imagination completes what the artist merely hints at  mr  the sculptor called to see us the other evening and quite paid powers off for all his trenchant criticisms on his brother artists he will not allow powers to be an artist at all or to know anything of the laws of art although acknowledging him to be a great bustmaker and to have put together the greek slave and the fisherboy very ingeniously the latter however he says is copied from the apollino in the tribune of the uzi and the former is made up of beauties that had no reference to one another and he affirms that powers is ready to sell and has actually sold the greek slave limb by limb dismembering it by reversing the process of putting it togethera head to one purchaser an arm or a foot to another a hand to a third  powers knows nothing scientifically of the human frame and only succeeds in representing it as a natural bonedoctor succeeds in setting a dislocated limb by a happy accident or special providence  the illustration was my own and adopted by mr   yet mr  seems to acknowledge that he did succeed  i repeat these things only as another instance how invariably every sculptor uses his chisel and mallet to smash and deface the marblework of every other  i never heard powers speak of mr  but can partly imagine what he would have said  mr  spoke of powerss disappointment about the twentyfivethousanddollar appropriation from congress and said that he was altogether to blame inasmuch as he attempted to sell to the nation for that sum a statue which to mr s certain knowledge he had already offered to private persons for a fifth part of it  i have not implicit faith in mr s veracity and doubt not powers acted fairly in his own eyes   october 23di am afraid i have caught one of the colds which the roman air continually affected me with last winter at any rate a sirocco has taken the life out of me and i have no spirit to do anything  this morning i took a walk however out of the porta maggiore and looked at the tomb of the baker eurysaces just outside of the gatea very singular ruin covered with symbols of the mans trade in stonework and with basreliefs along the cornice representing people at work making bread  an inscription states that the ashes of his wife are likewise reposited there in a breadbasket  the mausoleum is perhaps twenty feet long in its largest extent and of equal height and if good bakers were as scarce in ancient rome as in the modern city i do not wonder that they were thought worthy of stately monuments  none of the modern ones deserve any better tomb than a pile of their own sour loaves  i walked onward a good distance beyond the gate alongside of the arches of the claudian aqueduct which in this portion of it seems to have had little repair and to have needed little since it was built  it looks like a long procession striding across the campagna towards the city and entering the gate over one of its arches within the gate i saw two or three slender jets of water spurting from the crevices this aqueduct being still in use to bring the acqua felice into rome  returning within the walls i walked along their inner base to the church of st john lateran into which i went and sat down to rest myself being languid and weary and hot with the sun though afraid to trust the coolness of the shade  i hate the roman atmosphere indeed all my pleasure in getting backall my homefeelinghas already evaporated and what now impresses me as before is the languor of romeits weary pavements its little life pressed down by a weight of death  quitting st john lateran i went astray as i do nine times out of ten in these roman intricacies and at last seeing the coliseum in the vista of a street i betook myself thither to get a fresh start  its round of stones looked vast and dreary but not particularly impressive  the interior was quite deserted except that a roman of respectable appearance was making a pilgrimage at the altars kneeling and saying a prayer at each one  outside of the coliseum a neatlooking little boy came and begged of me and i gave him a baiocco rather because he seemed to need it so little than for any other reason  i observed that he immediately afterwards went and spoke to a welldressed man and supposed that the child was likewise begging of him  i watched the little boy however and saw that in two or three other instances after begging of other individuals he still returned to this welldressed man the fact being no doubt that the latter was fishing for baiocci through the medium of his childthrowing the poor little fellow out as a bait while he himself retained his independent respectability  he had probably come out for a whole days sport for by and by he went between the arches of the coliseum followed by the child and taking with him what looked like a bottle of wine wrapped in a handkerchief   november 2dthe weather lately would have suited ones ideal of an english november except that there have been no fogs but of ugly hopeless clouds chill shivering winds drizzle and now and then pouring rain much more than enough  an english coalfire if we could see its honest face within doors would compensate for all the unamiableness of the outside atmosphere but we might ask for the sunshine of the new jerusalem with as much hope of getting it  it is extremely spiritcrushing this remorseless gray with its icy heart and the more to depress the whole family u has taken what seems to be the roman fever by sitting down in the palace of the caesars while mrs s sketched the ruins      during four months of the illness of his daughter mr hawthorne wrote no word of journaled   february 27th 1859for many days past there have been tokens of the coming carnival in the corso and the adjacent streets for example in the shops by the display of masks of wire pasteboard silk or cloth some of beautiful features others hideous fantastic currish asinine hugenosed or otherwise monstrous some intended to cover the whole face others concealing only the upper part also white dominos or robes bedizened with goldlace and theatric splendors displayed at the windows of mercers or flaunting before the doors  yesterday u and i came along the corso between one and two oclock after a walk and found all these symptoms of impending merriment multiplied and intensified     rows of chairs set out along the sidewalks elevated a foot or two by means of planks great baskets full of confetti for sale in the nooks and recesses of the streets bouquets of all qualities and prices  the corso was becoming pretty well thronged with people but until two oclock nobody dared to fling as much as a rosebud or a handful of sugarplums  there was a sort of holiday expression however on almost everybodys face such as i have not hitherto seen in rome or in any part of italy a smile gleaming out an aurora of mirth which probably will not be very exuberant in its noontide  the day was so sunny and bright that it made this opening scene far more cheerful than any day of the last years carnival  as we threaded our way through the corso u kept wishing she could plunge into the fun and uproar as j would and for my own part though i pretended to take no interest in the matter i could have bandied confetti and nosegays as readily and as riotously as any urchin there  but my black hat and grave talma would have been too good a mark for the combatants     so we went home before a shot was fired       march 7thi as well as the rest of the family have followed up the carnival pretty faithfully and enjoyed it as well or rather better than could have been expected principally in the street as a more lookeronwhich does not let one into the mystery of the funand twice from a balcony where i threw confetti and partly understood why the young people like it so much  certainly there cannot well be a more picturesque spectacle in human life than that stately palatial avenue of the corso the more picturesque because so narrow all hung with carpets and gobelin tapestry and the whole palaceheights alive with faces and all the capacity of the street thronged with the most fantastic figures that either the fancies of folks alive at this day are able to contrive or that live traditionally from year to year     the prince of wales has fought manfully through the carnival with confetti and bouquets and u received several bouquets from him on saturday as her carriage moved along   march 8thi went with u to mr motleys balcony in the corso and saw the carnival from it yesterday afternoon but the spectacle is strangely like a dream in respect to the difficulty of retaining it in the mind and solidifying it into a description  i enjoyed it a good deal and assisted in so far as to pelt all the people in cylinder hats with handfuls of confetti  the scene opens with a long array of cavalry who ride through the corso preceded by a large band playing loudly on their brazen instruments     there were some splendid dresses particularly contadina costumes of scarlet and gold which seem to be actually the festal attire of that class of people and must needs be so expensive that one must serve for a lifetime if indeed it be not an inheritance       march 9thi was yesterday an hour or so among the people on the sidewalks of the corso just on the edges of the fun  they appeared to be in a decorous goodnatured mood neither entering into the merriment nor harshly repelling and when groups of maskers overflowed among them they received their jokes in good part  many women of the lower class were in the crowd of bystanders generally broad and sturdy figures clad evidently in their best attire and wearing a good many ornaments such as gold or coral beads and necklaces combs of silver or gold heavy earrings curiously wrought brooches perhaps cameos or mosaics though i think they prefer purely metallic work to these  one ornament very common among them is a large bodkin which they stick through their hair it is usually of silver but sometimes it looks like steel and is made in the shape of a sworda long spanish thrusting sword for example dr franco told us a story of a woman of trastevere who was addressed rudely at the carnival by a gentleman she warned him to desist but as he still persisted she drew the bodkin from her hair and stabbed him to the heart  by and by i went to mr motleys balcony and looked down on the closing scenes of the carnival  methought the merrymakers labored harder to be mirthful and yet were somewhat tired of their eight playdays and their dresses looked a little shabby rumpled and draggled but the lack of sunshinewhich we have had on all the preceding daysmay have produced this effect  the wheels of some of the carriages were wreathed round and spoked with green foliage making a very pretty and fanciful appearance as did likewise the harnesses of the horses which were trimmed with roses  the pervading noise and uproar of human voices is one of the most effective points of the matter but the scene is quite indescribable and its effect not to be conceived without both witnessing and taking part in it  if you merely look at it it depresses you if you take even the slightest share in it you become aware that it has a fascination and you no longer wonder that the young people at least take such delight in plunging into this mad river of fun that goes roaring between the narrow limits of the corso  as twilight came on the moccoli commenced and as it grew darker the whole street twinkled with lights which would have been innumerable if every torchbearer had not been surrounded by a host of enemies who tried to extinguish his poor little twinkle  it was a pity to lose so much splendor as there might have been but yet there was a kind of symbolism in the thought that every one of those thousands of twinkling lights was in charge of somebody who was striving with all his might to keep it alive  not merely the streetway but all the balconies and hundreds of windows were lit up with these little torches so that it seemed as if the stars had crumbled into glittering fragments and rained down upon the corso some of them lodging upon the palacefronts some falling on the ground  besides this there were gaslights burning with a white flame but this illumination was not half so interesting as that of the torches which indicated human struggle  all this time there were myriad voices shouting senza moccolo and mingling into one long roar we in our balcony carried on a civil war against one anothers torches as is the custom of human beings within even the narrowest precincts but after a while we grew tired and so did the crowd apparently for the lights vanished one after another till the gaslightswhich at first were an unimportant part of the illuminationshone quietly out overpowering the scattered twinkles of the moccoli  they were what the fixed stars are to the transitory splendors of human life  mr motley tells me that it was formerly the custom to have a mock funeral of harlequin who was supposed to die at the close of the carnival during which he had reigned supreme and all the people or as many as chose bore torches at his burial  but this being considered an indecorous mockery of popish funereal customs the present frolic of the moccoli was institutedin some sort growing out of it  all last night or as much of it as i was awake there was a noise of song and of late revellers in the streets but today we have waked up in the sad and sober season of lent  it is worthy of remark that all the jollity of the carnival is a genuine ebullition of spirit without the aid of wine or strong drink   march 11thyesterday we went to the catacomb of st calixtus the entrance to which is alongside of the appian way within sight of the tomb of cecilia metella  we descended not a very great way under ground by a broad flight of stone steps and lighting some wax tapers with which we had provided ourselves we followed the guide through a great many intricate passages which mostly were just wide enough for me to touch the wall on each side while keeping my elbows close to my body and as to height they were from seven to ten feet and sometimes a good deal higher  it was rather picturesque when we saw the long line of our tapers for another large party had joined us twinkling along the dark passage and it was interesting to think of the former inhabitants of these caverns     in one or two places there was the round mark in the stone or plaster where a bottle had been deposited  this was said to have been the token of a martyrs burialplace and to have contained his blood  after leaving the catacomb we drove onward to cecilia metellas tomb which we entered and inspected  within the immensely massive circular substance of the tomb was a round vacant space and this interior vacancy was open at the top and had nothing but some fallen stones and a heap of earth at the bottom  on our way home we entered the church of domine quo vadis and looked at the old fragment of the appian way where our saviour met st peter and left the impression of his feet in one of the roman pavingstones the stone has been removed and there is now only a facsimile engraved in a block of marble occupying the place where jesus stood  it is a great pity they had not left the original stone for then all its brotherstones in the pavement would have seemed to confirm the truth of the legend  while we were at dinner a gentleman called and was shown into the parlor  we supposed it to be mr may but soon his voice grew familiar and my wife was sure it was general pierce so i left the table and found it to be really he  i was rejoiced to see him though a little saddened to see the marks of care and coming age in many a whitening hair and many a furrow and still more in something that seemed to have passed away out of him without leaving any trace  his voice sometimes sounded strange and old though generally it was what it used to be  he was evidently glad to see me glad to see my wife glad to see the children though there was something melancholy in his tone when he remarked what a stout boy j had grown  poor fellow he has neither son nor daughter to keep his heart warm  this morning i have been with him to st peters and elsewhere about the city and find him less changed than he seemed to be last night not at all changed in heart and affections  we talked freely about all matters that came up among the rest about the projectrecognizable by many tokensfor bringing him again forward as a candidate for the presidency next year  he appears to be firmly resolved not again to present himself to the country and is content to let his one administration stand and to be judged by the public and posterity on the merits of that  no doubt he is perfectly sincere no doubt too he would again be a candidate if a pretty unanimous voice of the party should demand it  i retain all my faith in his administrative faculty and should be glad for his sake to have it fully rccognized but the probabilities as far as i can see do not indicate for him another presidential term   march 15ththis morning i went with my wife and miss hoar to miss hosmers studio to see her statue of zenobia  we found her in her premises springing about with a birdlike action  she has a lofty room with a skylight window it was pretty well warmed with a stove and there was a small orangetree in a pot with the oranges growing on it and two or three flowershrubs in bloom  she herself looked prettily with her jaunty little velvet cap on the side of her head whence came clustering out her short brown curls her face full of pleasant life and quick expression and though somewhat worn with thought and struggle handsome and spirited  she told us that her wig was growing as gray as a rat  there were but very few things in the room two or three plaster busts a headless cast of a plaster statue and a cast of the minerva medica which perhaps she had been studying as a help towards the design of her zenobia for at any rate i seemed to discern a resemblance or analogy between the two  zenobia stood in the centre of the room as yet unfinished in the clay but a very noble and remarkable statue indeed full of dignity and beauty  it is wonderful that so brisk a woman could have achieved a work so quietly impressive and there is something in zenobias air that conveys the idea of music uproar and a great throng all about her whilst she walks in the midst of it selfsustained and kept in a sort of sanctity by her native pride  the idea of motion is attained with great success you not only perceive that she is walking but know at just what tranquil pace she steps amid the music of the triumph  the drapery is very fine and full she is decked with ornaments but the chains of her captivity hang from wrist to wrist and her deportmentindicating a soul so much above her misfortune yet not insensible to the weight of itmakes these chains a richer decoration than all her other jewels  i know not whether there be some magic in the present imperfect finish of the statue or in the material of clay as being a better medium of expression than even marble but certainly i have seldom been more impressed by a piece of modern sculpture  miss hosmer showed us photographs of her puckwhich i have seen in the marbleand likewise of the willothewisp both very pretty and fanciful  it indicates much variety of power that zenobia should be the sister of these which would seem the more natural offspring of her quick and vivid character  but zenobia is a high heroic ode      on my way up the via babuino i met general pierce  we have taken two or three walks together and stray among the roman ruins and old scenes of history talking of matters in which he is personally concerned yet which are as historic as anything around us  he is singularly little changed the more i see him the more i get him back just such as he was in our youth  this morning his face air and smile were so wonderfully like himself of old that at least thirty years are annihilated  zenobias manacles serve as bracelets a very ingenious and suggestive idea   march 18thi went to the sculpturegallery of the capitol yesterday and saw among other things the venus in her secret cabinet  this was my second view of her the first time i greatly admired her now she made no very favorable impression  there are twenty venuses whom i like as well or better  on the whole she is a heavy clumsy unintellectual and commonplace figure at all events not in good looks today  marble beauties seem to suffer the same occasional eclipses as those of flesh and blood  we looked at the faun the dying gladiator and other famous sculptures but nothing had a glory round it perhaps because the sirocco was blowing  these halls of the capitol have always had a dreary and depressing effect upon me very different from those of the vatican  i know not why except that the rooms of the capitol have a dingy shabby and neglected look and that the statues are dusty and all the arrangements less magnificent than at the vatican  the corroded and discolored surfaces of the statues take away from the impression of immortal youth and turn apollo the lycian apollo himself into an old stone unless at rare intervals when he appears transfigured by a light gleaming from within   march 23di am wearing away listlessly these last precious days of my abode in rome  us illness is disheartening and by confining  it takes away the energy and enterprise that were the spring of all our movements  i am weary of rome without having seen and known it as i ought and i shall be glad to get away from it though no doubt there will be many yearnings to return hereafter and many regrets that i did not make better use of the opportunities within my grasp  still i have been in rome long enough to be imbued with its atmosphere and this is the essential condition of knowing a place for such knowledge does not consist in having seen every particular object it contains  in the state of mind in which i now stand towards rome there is very little advantage to be gained by staying here longer  and yet i had a pleasant stroll enough yesterday afternoon all by myself from the corso down past the church of st andrea della valle the site where caesar was murderedand thence to the farnese palace the noble court of which i entered thence to the piazza cenci where i looked at one or two ugly old palaces and fixed on one of them as the residence of beatrices father then past the temple of vesta and skirting along the tiler and beneath the aventine till i somewhat unexpectedly came in sight of the gray pyramid of caius cestius  i went out of the city gate and leaned on the parapet that encloses the pyramid advancing its high unbroken slope and peak where the great blocks of marble still fit almost as closely to one another as when they were first laid though indeed there are crevices just large enough for plants to root themselves and flaunt and trail over the face of this great tomb only a little verdure however over a vast space of marble still white in spots but pervadingly turned gray by two thousand years action of the atmosphere  thence i came home by the caelian and sat down on an ancient flight of steps under one of the arches of the coliseum into which the sunshine fell sidelong  it was a delightful afternoon not precisely like any weather that i have known elsewhere certainly never in america where it is always too cold or too hot  it resembles summer more than anything which we newenglanders recognize in our idea of spring but there was an indescribable something sweet fresh gentle that does not belong to summer and that thrilled and tickled my heart with a feeling partly sensuous partly spiritual  i go to the bank and read galignani and the american newspapers thence i stroll to the pincian or to the medici gardens i see a good deal of general pierce and we talk over his presidential life which i now really think he has no latent desire nor purpose to renew  yet he seems to have enjoyed it while it lasted and certainly he was in his element as an administrative man not farseeing not possessed of vast stores of political wisdom in advance of his occasions but endowed with a miraculous intuition of what ought to be done just at the time for action  his judgment of things about him is wonderful and his cabinet recognized it as such for though they were men of great ability he was evidently the mastermind among them  none of them were particularly his personal friends when he selected them they all loved him when they parted and he showed me a letter signed by all in which they expressed their feelings of respect and attachment at the close of his administration  there was a noble frankness on his part that kept the atmosphere always clear among them and in reference to this characteristic governor marcy told him that the years during which he had been connected with his cabinet had been the happiest of his life speaking of caleb cushing he told me that the unreliability the fickleness which is usually attributed to him is an actual characteristic but that it is intellectual not moral  he has such comprehensiveness such mental variety and activity that if left to himself he cannot keep fast hold of one view of things and so cannot without external help be a consistent man  he needs the influence of a more single and stable judgment to keep him from divergency and on this condition he is a most inestimable coadjutor  as regards learning and ability he has no superior  pierce spoke the other day of the idea among some of his friends that his life had been planned from a very early period with a view to the station which he ultimately reached  he smiled at the notion said that it was inconsistent with his natural character and that it implied foresight and dexterity beyond what any mortal is endowed with  i think so too but nevertheless i was long and long ago aware that he cherished a very high ambition and that though he might not anticipate the highest things he cared very little about inferior objects  then as to plans i do not think that he had any definite ones but there was in him a subtle faculty a real instinct that taught him what was good for himthat is to say promotive of his political successand made him inevitably do it  he had a magic touch that arranged matters with a delicate potency which he himself hardly recognized and he wrought through other minds so that neither he nor they always knew when and how far they were under his influence  before his nomination for the presidency i had a sense that it was coming and it never seemed to me an accident  he is a most singular character so frank so true so immediate so subtle so simple so complicated  i passed by the tower in the via portoghese today and observed that the nearest shop appears to be for the sale of cotton or linen cloth     the upper window of the tower was half open of course like all or almost all other roman windows it is divided vertically and each half swings back on hinges      last week a fritterestablishment was opened in our piazza  it was a wooden booth erected in the open square and covered with canvas painted red which looked as if it had withstood much rain and sunshine  in front were three great boughs of laurel not so much for shade i think as ornament  there were two men and their apparatus for business was a sort of stove or charcoal furnace and a fryingpan to place over it they had an armful or two of dry sticks some flour and i suppose oil and this seemed to be all  it was friday and lent besides and possibly there was some other peculiar propriety in the consumption of fritters just then  at all events their fire burned merrily from morning till night and pretty late into the evening and they had a fine run of custom the commodity being simply dough cut into squares or rhomboids and thrown into the boiling oil which quickly turned them to a light brown color  i sent j to buy some and tasting one it resembled an unspeakably bad doughnut without any sweetening  in fact it was sour for the romans like their bread and all their preparations of flour in a state of acetous fermentation which serves them instead of salt or other condiment  this frittershop had grown up in a night like aladdins palace and vanished as suddenly for after standing through friday saturday and sunday it was gone on monday morning and a charcoalstrewn place on the pavement where the furnace had been was the only memorial of it  it was curious to observe how immediately it became a loungingplace for idle people who stood and talked all day with the fritterfriers just as they might at any old shop in the basement of a palace or between the halfburied pillars of the temple of minerva which had been familiar to them and their remote grandfathers   april 14thyesterday afternoon i drove with mr and mrs story and mr wilde to see a statue of venus which has just been discovered outside of the porta portese on the other side of the tiber  a little distance beyond the gate we came to the entrance of a vineyard with a wheeltrack through the midst of it and following this we soon came to a hillside in which an excavation had been made with the purpose of building a grotto for keeping and storing wine  they had dug down into what seemed to be an ancient bathroom or some structure of that kind the excavation being square and cellarlike and built round with old subterranean walls of brick and stone  within this hollow space the statue had been found and it was now standing against one of the walls covered with a coarse cloth or a canvas bag  this being removed there appeared a headless marble figure earthstained of course and with a slightly corroded surface but wonderfully delicate and beautiful the shape size and attitude apparently of the venus de medici but as we all thought more beautiful than that  it is supposed to be the original from which the venus de medici was copied  both arms were broken off but the greater part of both and nearly the whole of one hand had been found and these being adjusted to the figure they took the wellknown position before the bosom and the middle as if the fragmentary woman retained her instinct of modesty to the last  there were the marks on the bosom and thigh where the fingers had touched whereas in the venus de medici if i remember rightly the fingers are sculptured quite free of the person the man who showed the statue now lifted from a corner a round block of marble which had been lying there among other fragments and this he placed upon the shattered neck of the venus and behold it was her head and face perfect all but the nose  even in spite of this mutilation it seemed immediately to light up and vivify the entire figure and whatever i may heretofore have written about the countenance of the venus de medici i here record my belief that that head has been wrongfully foisted upon the statue at all events it is unspeakably inferior to this newly discovered one  this face has a breadth and front which are strangely deficient in the other  the eyes are well opened most unlike the buttonhole lids of the venus de medici the whole head is so much larger as to entirely obviate the criticism that has always been made on the diminutive head of the de medici statue  if it had but a nose they ought to sift every handful of earth that has been thrown out of the excavation for the nose and the missing hand and fingers must needs be there and if they were found the effect would be like the reappearance of a divinity upon earth  mutilated as we saw her it was strangely interesting to be present at the moment as it were when she had just risen from her long burial and was shedding the unquenchable lustre around her which no eye had seen for twenty or more centuries  the earth still clung about her her beautiful lips were full of it till mr story took a thin chip of wood and cleared it away from between them  the proprietor of the vineyard stood by a man with the most purple face and hugest and reddest nose that i ever beheld in my life  it must have taken innumerable hogsheads of his thin vintage to empurple his face in this manner  he chuckled much over the statue and i suppose counts upon making his fortune by it  he is now awaiting a bid from the papal government which i believe has the right of preemption whenever any relics of ancient art are discovered  if the statue could but be smuggled out of italy it might command almost any price  there is not i think any name of a sculptor on the pedestal as on that of the venus de medici  a dolphin is sculptured on the pillar against which she leans  the statue is of greek marble  it was first found about eight days ago but has been offered for inspection only a day or two and already the visitors come in throngs and the beggars gather about the entrance of the vineyard  a wine shop too seems to have been opened on the premises for the accommodation of this great concourse and we saw a row of german artists sitting at a long table in the open air each with a glass of thin wine and something to eat before him for the germans refresh nature ten times to other persons once  how the whole world might be peopled with antique beauty if the romans would only dig   april 19thgeneral pierce leaves rome this morning for venice by way of ancona and taking the steamer thence to trieste  i had hoped to make the journey along with him but us terrible illness has made it necessary for us to continue here another mouth and we are thankful that this seems now to be the extent of our misfortune  never having had any trouble before that pierced into my very vitals i did not know what comfort there might be in the manly sympathy of a friend but pierce has undergone so great a sorrow of his own and has so large and kindly a heart and is so tender and so strong that he really did the good and i shall always love him the better for the recollection of his ministrations in these dark days  thank god the thing we dreaded did not come to pass  pierce is wonderfully little changed  indeed now that he has won and enjoyedif there were any enjoyment in itthe highest success that public life could give him he seems more like what he was in his early youth than at any subsequent period  he is evidently happier than i have ever known him since our college days satisfied with what he has been and with the position in the country that remains to him after filling such an office  amid all his former successesearly as they came and great as they werei always perceived that something gnawed within him and kept him forever restless and miserable  nothing he won was worth the winning except as a step gained toward the summit  i cannot tell how early he began to look towards the presidency but i believe he would have died an unhappy man without it  and yet what infinite chances there seemed to be against his attaining it  when i look at it in one way it strikes me as absolutely miraculous in another it came like an event that i had all along expected  it was due to his wonderful tact which is of so subtle a character that he himself is but partially sensible of it  i have found in him here in rome the whole of my early friend and even better than i used to know him a heart as true and affectionate a mind much widened and deepened by his experience of life  we hold just the same relation to each other as of yore and we have passed all the turningoff places and may hope to go on together still the same dear friends as long as we live  i do not love him one whit the less for having been president nor for having done me the greatest good in his power a fact that speaks eloquently in his favor and perhaps says a little for myself  if he had been merely a benefactor perhaps i might not have borne it so well but each did his best for the other as friend for friend   may 15thyesterday afternoon we went to the barberini picturegallery to take a farewell look at the beatrice cenci which i have twice visited before since our return from florence  i attempted a description of it at my first visit more than a year ago but the picture is quite indescribable and unaccountable in its effect for if you attempt to analyze it you can never succeed in getting at the secret of its fascination  its peculiar expression eludes a straightforward glance and can only be caught by side glimpses or when the eye falls upon it casually as it were and without thinking to discover anything as if the picture had a life and consciousness of its own and were resolved not to betray its secret of grief or guilt though it wears the full expression of it when it imagines itself unseen  i think no other such magical effect can ever have been wrought by pencil  i looked close into its eyes with a determination to see all that there was in them and could see nothing that might not have been in any young girls eyes and yet a moment afterwards there was the expressionseen aside and vanishing in a momentof a being unhumanized by some terrible fate and gazing at me out of a remote and inaccessible region where she was frightened to be alone but where no sympathy could reach her  the mouth is beyond measure touching the lips apart looking as innocent as a babys after it has been crying  the picture never can be copied  guido himself could not have done it over again  the copyists get all sorts of expression gay as well as grievous some copies have a coquettish air a halfbackward glance thrown alluring at the spectator but nobody ever did catch or ever will the vanishing charm of that sorrow  i hated to leave the picture and yet was glad when i had taken my last glimpse because it so perplexed and troubled me not to be able to get hold of its secret  thence we went to the church of the capuchins and saw guidos archangel i have been several times to this church but never saw the picture before though i am familiar with the mosaic copy at st peters and had supposed the latter to be an equivalent representation of the original it is nearly or quite so as respects the general effect but there is a beauty in the archangels face that immeasurably surpasses the copythe expression of heavenly severity and a degree of pain trouble or disgust at being brought in contact with sin even for the purpose of quelling and punishing it  there is something finical in the copy which i do not find in the original  the sandalled feet are here those of an angel in the mosaic they are those of a celestial coxcomb treading daintily as if he were afraid they would be soiled by the touch of lucifer  after looking at the archangel we went down under the church guided by a fleshy monk and saw the famous cemetery where the dead monks of many centuries back have been laid to sleep in sacred earth from jerusalem        france   hotel des colonies marseilles may 29th saturdaywednesday was the day fixed for our departure from rome and after breakfast i walked to the pincian and saw the garden and the city and the borghese grounds and st peters in an earlier sunlight than ever before  methought they never looked so beautiful nor the sky so bright and blue  i saw soracte on the horizon and i looked at everything as if for the last time nor do i wish ever to see any of these objects again though no place ever took so strong a hold of my being as rome nor ever seemed so close to me and so strangely familiar  i seem to know it better than my birthplace and to have known it longer and though i have been very miserable there and languid with the effects of the atmosphere and disgusted with a thousand things in its daily life still i cannot say i hate it perhaps might fairly own a love for it  but life being too short for such questionable and troublesome enjoyments i desire never to set eyes on it again          we traversed again that same weary and dreary tract of country which we passed over in a winter afternoon and night on our first arrival in rome  it is as desolate a country as can well be imagined but about midway of our journey we came to the seashore and kept very near it during the rest of the way  the sight and fragrance of it were exceedingly refreshing after so long an interval and u revived visibly as we rushed along while j chuckled and contorted himself with ineffable delight  we reached civita vecchia in three or four hours and were there subjected to various troubles     all the while miss s and i were bothering about the passport the rest of the family sat in the sun on the quay with all kinds of bustle and confusion around them a very trying experience to u after the long seclusion and quiet of her sickchamber  but she did not seem to suffer from it and we finally reached the steamer in good condition and spirits      i slept wretchedly in my short and narrow berth more especially as there was an old gentleman who snored as if he were sounding a charge it was terribly hot too and i rose before four oclock and was on deck amply in time to watch the distant approach of sunrise  we arrived at leghorn pretty early and might have gone ashore and spent the day  indeed we had been recommended by dr franco and had fully purposed to spend a week or ten days there in expectation of benefit to us health from the sea air and sea bathing because he thought her still too feeble to make the whole voyage to marseilles at a stretch  but she showed herself so strong that we thought she would get as much good from our three days voyage as from the days by the seashore  moreover     we all of us still felt the languor of the roman atmosphere and dreaded the hubbub and crazy confusion of landing at an italian port     so we lay in the harbor all day without stirring from the steamer     it would have been pleasant however to have gone to pisa fifteen miles off and seen the leaning tower but for my part i have arrived at that point where it is somewhat pleasanter to sit quietly in any spot whatever than to see whatever grandest or most beautiful thing  at least this was my mood in the harbor of leghorn  from the deck of the steamer there were many things visible that might have been interesting to describe the boats of peculiar rig and covered with awning the crowded shipping the disembarkation of horses from the french cavalry which were lowered from steamers into gondolas or lighters and hung motionless like the sign of the golden fleece during the transit only kicking a little when their feet happened to graze the vessels side  one horse plunged overboard and narrowly escaped drowning  there was likewise a disembarkation of french soldiers in a train of boats which rowed shoreward with sound of trumpet  the french are concentrating a considerable number of troops at this point  our steamer was detained by order of the french government to take on board despatches so that instead of sailing at dusk as is customary we lay in the harbor till seven of the next morning  a number of young sardinian officers in green uniform came on board and a pale and picturesquelooking italian and other worthies of less noteenglish american and of all racesamong them a turk with a little boy in christian dress also a greek gentleman with his young bride  at the appointed time we weighed anchor for genoa and had a beautiful day on the mediterranean and for the first time in my life i saw the real dark blue of the sea  i do not remember noticing it on my outward voyage to italy  it is the most beautiful hue that can be imagined like a liquid sky and it retains its lustrous blue directly under the side of the ship where the water of the midatlantic looks greenish     we reached genoa at seven in the afternoon     genoa looks most picturesquely from the sea at the foot of a sheltering semicircle of lofty hills and as we lay in the harbor we saw among other interesting objects the great doria palace with its gardens and the cathedral and a heap and sweep of stately edifices with the mountains looking down upon he city and crowned with fortresses  the variety of hue in the houses white green pink and orange was very remarkable  it would have been well to go ashore here for an hour or two and see the streets having already seen the palaces churches and public buildings at our former visitand buy a few specimens of genoa goldsmiths work but i preferred the steamers deck so the evening passed pleasantly away the two lighthouses at the entrance of the port kindled up their fires and at nine oclock the evening gun thundered from the fortress and was reverberated from the heights  we sailed away at eleven and i was roused from my first sleep by the snortings and hissings of the vessel as she got under way  at genoa we took on board some more passengers an english nobleman with his lady being of the number  these were lord and lady j and before the end of our voyage his lordship talked to me of a translation of tasso in which he is engaged and a stanza or two of which he repeated to me  i really liked the lines and liked too the simplicity and frankness with which he spoke of it to me a stranger and the way be seemed to separate his egotism from the idea which he evidently had that he is going to make an excellent translation  i sincerely hope it may be so  he began it without any idea of publishing it or of ever bringing it to a conclusion but merely as a solace and occupation while in great trouble during an illness of his wife but he has gradually come to find it the most absorbing occupation he ever undertook and as mr gladstone and other high authorities give him warm encouragement he now means to translate the entire poem and to publish it with beautiful illustrations and two years hence the world may expect to see it  i do not quite perceive how such a man as thisa man of frank warm simple kindly nature but surely not of a poetical temperament or very refined or highly cultivatedshould make a good version of tassos poems but perhaps the dead poets soul may take possession of this healthy organization and wholly turn him to its own purposes  the latter part of our voyage today lay close along the coast of france which was hilly and picturesque and as we approached marseilles was very bold and striking  we steered among rocky islands rising abruptly out of the sea mere naked crags without a trace of verdure upon them and with the surf breaking at their feet  they were unusual specimens of what hills would look like without the soil that is to them what flesh is to a skeleton  their shapes were often wonderfully fine and the great headlands thrust themselves out and took such lines of light and shade that it seemed like sailing through a picture  in the course of the afternoon a squall came up and blackened the sky all over in a twinkling our vessel pitched and tossed and a brig a little way from us had her sails blown about in wild fashion  the blue of the sea turned as black as night and soon the rain began to spatter down upon us and continued to sprinkle and drizzle a considerable time after the wind had subsided  it was quite calm and pleasant when we entered the harbor of marseilles which lies at the foot of very fair hills and is set among great cliffs of stone  i did not attend much to this however being in dread of the difficulty of landing and passing through the customhouse with our twelve or fourteen trunks and numberless carpetbags  the trouble vanished into thin air nevertheless as we approached it for not a single trunk or bag was opened and moreover our luggage and ourselves were not only landed but the greater part of it conveyed to the railway without any expense  long live louis napoleon say i  we established ourselves at the hotel des colonies and then mss s j and i drove hither and thither about marseilles making arrangements for our journey to avignon where we mean to go today  we might have avoided a good deal of this annoyance but travellers like other people are continually getting their experience just a little too late  it was after nine before we got back to the hotel and took our tea in peace    avignon   hotel de leurope june 1sti remember nothing very special to record about marseilles though it was really like passing from death into life to find ourselves in busy cheerful effervescing france after living so long between asleep and awake in sluggish italy  marseilles is a very interesting and entertaining town with its bold surrounding heights its wide streetsso they seemed to us after the roman alleysits squares shady with trees its diversified population of sailors citizens orientals and what not but i have no spirit for description any longer being tired of seeing things and still more of telling myself about them  only a young traveller can have patience to write his travels the newest things nowadays have a familiarity to my eyes whereas in their lost sense of novelty lies the charm and power of description  on monday 30th may though it began with heavy rain we set early about our preparations for departure     and at about three we left the hotel des colonies  it is a very comfortable hotel though expensive the restaurant connected with it occupies the enclosed courtyard and the arcades around it and it was a good amusement to look down from the surrounding gallery communicating with our apartments and see the fashion and manner of french eating all the time going forward  in sunny weather a great awning is spread over the whole court across from the upper stories of the house  there is a grassplat in the middle and a very spacious and airy diningsaloon is thus formed  our railroad carriage was comfortable and we found in it besides two other frenchwomen two nuns  they were very devout and sedulously read their little books of devotion repeated prayers under their breath kissed the crucifixes which hung at their girdles and told a string of beads which they passed from one to the other  so much were they occupied with these duties that they scarcely looked at the scenery along the road though probably it is very rare for them to see anything outside of their convent walls  they never failed to mutter a prayer and kiss the crucifix whenever we plunged into a tunnel  if they glanced at their fellowpassengers it was shyly and askance with their lips in motion all the time like children afraid to let their eyes wander from their lessonbook  one of them however took occasion to pull down rs dress which in her frisky movements about the carriage had got out of place too high for the nuns sense of decorum neither of them was at all pretty nor was the black stuff dress and white muslin cap in the least becoming neither were their features of an intelligent or highbred stamp  their manners however or such little glimpses as i could get of them were unexceptionable and when i drew a curtain to protect one of them from the sun she made me a very courteous gesture of thanks  we had some very good views both of sea and hills and a part of our way lay along the banks of the rhone     by the by at the station at marseilles i bought the two volumes of the livre des merveilles by a certain author of my acquaintance translated into french and printed and illustrated in very pretty style  miss s also bought them and in answer to her inquiry for other works by the same author the bookseller observed that she did not think monsieur nathaniel had published anything else  the christian name deems to be the most important one in france and still more especially in italy  we arrived at avignon hotel de leurope in the dusk of the evening     the lassitude of rome still clings to us and i at least feel no spring of life or activity whether at morn or eve  in the morning we found ourselves very pleasantly situated as regards lodgings  the gallery of our suite of rooms looks down as usual into an enclosed court three sides of which are formed by the stone house and its two wings and the third by a high wall with a gateway of iron between two lofty stone pillars which for their capitals have great stone vases with grass growing in them and hanging over the brim there is a large planetree in one corner of the court and creeping plants clamber up trellises and there are pots of flowers and birdcages all of which give a very fresh and cheerful aspect to the enclosure  the court is paved with small round stones the omnibus belonging to the hotel and all the carriages of guests drive into it and the wide arch of the stabledoor opens under the central part of the house  nevertheless the scene is not in all respects that of a stableyard for gentlemen and ladies come from the salle a manger and other rooms and stand talking in the court or occupy chairs and seats there children play about the hostess or her daughter often appears and talks with her guests or servants dogs lounge and in short the court might well enough be taken for the one scene of a classic play  the hotel seems to be of the first class though such would not be indicated either in england or america by thus mixing up the stable with the lodgings  i have taken two or three rambles about the town and have climbed a high rock which dominates over it and gives a most extensive view from the broad tableland of its summit  the old church of avignon as old as the times of its popes and olderstands close beside this mighty and massive crag  we went into it and found it a dark old place with broad interior arches and a singularly shaped dome a venerable gothic and grecian porch with ancient frescos in its arched spaces some dusky pictures within an ancient chair of stone formerly occupied by the popes and much else that would have been exceedingly interesting before i went to rome  but rome takes the charm out of an inferior antiquity as well as the life out of human beings  this forenoon j and i have crossed the rhone by a bridge just the other side of one of the city gates which is near our hotel  we walked along the riverside and saw the ruins of an ancient bridge which ends abruptly in the midst of the stream two or three arches still making tremendous strides across while the others have long ago been crumbled away by the rush of the rapid river  the bridge was originally founded by st benezet who received a divine order to undertake the work while yet a shepherdboy with only three sous in his pocket and he proved the authenticity of the mission by taking an immense stone on his shoulder and laying it for the foundation  there is still an ancient chapel midway on the bridge and i believe st benezet lies buried there in the midst of his dilapidated work  the bridge now used is considerably lower down the stream  it is a wooden suspensionbridge broader than the ancient one and doubtless more than supplies its place else unquestionably st benezet would think it necessary to repair his own the view from the inner side of this ruined structure grassgrown and weedy and leading to such a precipitous plunge into the swift river is very picturesque in connection with the gray town and above it the great massive bulk of the cliff the towers of the church and of a vast old edifice shapeless ugly and venerable which the popes built and occupied as their palace many centuries ago      after dinner we all set out on a walk in the course of which we called at a booksellers shop to show u an enormous cat which i had already seen  it is of the angora breed of a mottled yellow color and is really a wonder as big and broad as a tolerably sized dog very soft and silken and apparently of the gentlest disposition  i never imagined the like nor felt anything so deeply soft as this great beast  its master seems very fond and proud of it and great favorite as the cat is she does not take airs upon herself but is gently shy and timid in her demonstrations  we ascended the great rocher above the palace of the popes and on our way looked into the old church which was so dim in the decline of day that we could not see within the dusky arches through which the chapels communicated with the nave  thence we pursued our way up the farther ascent and standing on the edge of the precipiceprotected by a parapet of stone and in other places by an iron railingwe could look down upon the road that winds its dusky track far below and at the river rhone which eddies close beside it  this is indeed a massive and lofty cliff and it tumbles down so precipitously that i could readily have flung myself from the bank and alighted on my head in the middle of the river  the rhone passes so near its base that i threw stones a good way into its current  we talked with a man of avignon who leaned over the parapet near by and he was very kind in explaining the points of view and told us that the river which winds and doubles upon itself so as to look like at least two rivers is really the rhone alone  the durance joins with it within a few miles below avignon but is here invisible   hotel de leurope june 2dthis morning we went again to the duomo of the popes and this time we allowed the custode or sacristan to show us the curiosities of it  he led us into a chapel apart and showed us the old gothic tomb of pope john xxii where the recumbent statue of the pope lies beneath one of those beautiful and venerable canopies of stone which look at once so light and so solemn  i know not how many hundred years old it is but everything of gothic origin has a faculty of conveying the idea of age whereas classic forms seem to have nothing to do with time and so lose the kind of impressiveness that arises from suggestions of decay and the past  in the sacristy the guide opened a cupboard that contained the jewels and sacred treasures of the church and showed a most exquisite figure of christ in ivory represented as on a cross of ebony and it was executed with wonderful truth and force of expression and with great beauty likewise  i do not see what a fulllength marble statue could have had that was lacking in this little ivory figure of hardly more than a foot high  it is about two centuries old by an unknown artist  there is another famous ivory statuette in avignon which seems to be more celebrated than this but can hardly be superior  i shall gladly look at it if it comes in my way  next to this the prettiest thing the man showed us was a circle of emeralds in one of the holy implements and then he exhibited a little bit or a popes skull also a great old crozier that looked as if made chiefly of silver and partly gilt but i saw where the plating of silver was worn away and betrayed the copper of its actual substance  there were two or three pictures in the sacristy by ancient and modern french artists very unlike the productions of the italian masters but not without a beauty of their own  leaving the sacristy we returned into the church where u and j began to draw the popes old stone chair  there is a beast or perhaps more than one grotesquely sculptured upon it the seat is high and square the back low and pointed and it offers no enticing promise to a weary man  the interior of the church is massively picturesque with its vaulted roof and a stone gallery heavily ornamented running along each side of the nave  each arch of the nave gives admittance to a chapel in all of which there are pictures and sculptures in most of them  one of these chapels is of the time of charlemagne and has a vaulted roof of admirable architecture covered with frescos of modern date and little merit  in an adjacent chapel is the stone monument of pope benedict whose statue reposes on it like many which i have seen in the cathedral of york and other old english churches  in another part we saw a monument consisting of a plain slab supported on pillars it is said to be of a roman or very early christian epoch  in another chapel was a figure of christ in wax i believe and clothed in real drapery a very ugly object  also a figure reposing under a slab which strikes the spectator with the idea that it is really a dead person enveloped in a shroud  there are windows of painted glass in some of the chapels and the gloom of the dimly lighted interior especially beneath the broad low arches is very impressive  while we were there some women assembled at one of the altars and went through their acts of devotion without the help of a priest one and another of them alternately repeating prayers to which the rest responded  the murmur of their voices took a musical tone which was reverberated by the vaulted arches  u and i now came out and under the porch we found an old woman selling rosaries little religious books and other holy things  we bought two little medals of the immaculate virgin one purporting to be of silver the other of gold but as both together cost only two or three sous the genuineness of the material may well be doubted  we sat down on the steps of a crucifix which is placed in front of the church and the children began to draw the porch of which i hardly know whether to call the architecture classic or gothic as i said before at all events it has a venerable aspect and there are frescos within its arches by simone memmi     the popes palace is contiguous to the church and just below it on the hillside  it is now occupied as barracks by some regiments of soldiers a number of whom were lounging before the entrance but we passed the sentinel without being challenged and addressed ourselves to the concierge who readily assented to our request to be shown through the edifice  a french gentleman and lady likewise came with similar purpose and went the rounds along with us  the palace is such a confused heap and conglomeration of buildings that it is impossible to get within any sort of a regular description  it is a huge shapeless mass of architecture and if it ever had any pretence to a plan it has lost it in the modern alterations  for instance an immense and lofty chapel or rather church has had two floors one above the other laid at different stages of its height and the upper one of these floors which extends just where the arches of the vaulted root begin to spring from the pillars is ranged round with the beds of one of the regiments of soldiers  they are small iron bedsteads each with its narrow mattress and covered with a dark blanket  on some of them lay or lounged a soldier other soldiers were cleaning their accoutrements elsewhere we saw parties of them playing cards  so it was wherever we went among those large dingy gloomy halls and chambers which no doubt were once stately and sumptuous with pictures with tapestry and all sorts of adornment that the middle ages knew how to use  the windows threw a sombre light through embrasures at least two feet thick  there were staircases of magnificent breadth  we were shown into two small chapels in different parts of the building both containing the remains of old frescos wofully defaced  in one of them was a light spiral staircase of iron built in the centre of the room as a means of contemplating the frescos which were said to be the work of our old friend giotto     finally we climbed a long long narrow stair built in the thickness of the wall and thus gained access to the top of one of the towers whence we saw the noblest landscapes mountains plains and the rhone broad and bright winding hither and thither as if it had lost its way  beneath our feet was the gray ugly old palace and its many courts just as void of system and as inconceivable as when we were burrowing through its bewildering passages  no end of historical romances might be made out of this castle of the popes and there ought to be a ghost in every room and droves of them in some of the rooms for there have been murders here in the gross and in detail as well hundreds of years ago as no longer back than the french revolution when there was a great massacre in one of the courts  traces of this bloody business were visible in actual stains on the wall only a few years ago  returning to the room of the concierge who being a little stiff with age had sent an attendant round with us instead of accompanying us in person he showed us a picture of rienzi the last of the roman tribunes who was once a prisoner here  on a table beneath the picture stood a little vase of earthenware containing some silver coin  we took it as a hint in the customary style of french elegance that a fee should be deposited here instead of being put into the hand of the concierge so the french gentleman deposited half a franc and i in my magnificence twice as much   hotel de leurope june 6thwe are still here     i have been daily to the rocher des dons and have grown familiar with the old church on its declivity  i think i might become attached to it by seeing it often  a sombre old interior with its heavy arches and its roof vaulted like the top of a trunk its stone gallery with ponderous adornments running round three sides  i observe that it is a daily custom of the old women to say their prayers in concert sometimes making a pilgrimage as it were from chapel to chapel  the voice of one of them is heard running through the series of petitions and at intervals the voices of the others join and swell into a chorus so that it is like a river connecting a series of lakes or not to use so gigantic a simile the one voice is like a thread on which the beads of a rosary are strung  one day two priests came and sat down beside these prayerful women and joined in their petitions  i am inclined to hope that there is something genuine in the devotion of these old women  the view from the top of the rocker des dons a contraction of dominis grows upon me and is truly magnificent a vast mountaingirdled plain illuminated by the far windings and reaches of the rhone  the river is here almost as turbid as the tiber itself but i remember in the upper part of its course the waters are beautifully transparent  a powerful rush is indicated by the swirls and eddies of its broad surface  yesterday was a race day at avignon and apparently almost the whole population and a great many strangers streamed out of the city gate nearest our hotel on their way to the racecourse  there were many noticeable figures that might come well into a french picture or description but only one remains in my memorya young man with a wooden leg setting off for the coursea walk of several miles i believewith prodigious courage and alacrity flourishing his wooden leg with an air and grace that seemed to render it positively flexible  the crowd returned towards sunset and almost all night long the streets and the whole air of the old town were full of song and merriment  there was a ball in a temporary structure covered with an awning in the place dhorloge and a showman has erected his tent and spread forth his great painted canvases announcing an anaconda and a seatiger to be seen j paid four sous for admittance and found that the seatiger was nothing but a large seal and the anaconda altogether a myth  i have rambled a good deal about the town  its streets are crooked and perplexing and paved with round pebbles for the most part which afford more uncomfortable pedestrianism than the pavement of rome itself  it is an ancientlooking place with some large old mansions but few that are individually impressive though here and there one sees an antique entrance a corner tower or other bit of antiquity that throws a venerable effect over the gray commonplace of past centuries  the town is not overclean and often there is a kennel of unhappy odor  there appear to have been many more churches and devotional establishments under the ancient dominion of the popes than have been kept intact in subsequent ages the tower and facade of a church for instance form the front of a carpenters shop or some such plebeian place  the church where laura lay has quite disappeared and her tomb along with it  the town reminds me of chester though it does not in the least resemble it and is not nearly so picturesque  like chester it is entirely surrounded by a wall and that of avignonthough it has no delightful promenade on its top as the wall of chester hasis the more perfectly preserved in its mediaeval form and the more picturesque of the two j and i have once or twice walked nearly round it commencing from the gate of ouelle which is very near our hotel  from this point it stretches for a considerable distance along by the river and here there is a broad promenade with trees and blocks of stone for seats on one side the arrowy rhone generally carrying a cooling breeze along with it on the other the gray wall with its battlements and machicolations impending over what was once the moat but which is now full of careless and untrained shrubbery  at intervals there are round towers swelling out from the wall and rising a little above it  after about half a mile along the riverside the wall turns at nearly right angles and still there is a wide road a shaded walk a boulevard and at short distances are cafes with their little round tables before the door or small shady nooks of shrubbery  so numerous are these retreats and pleasaunces that i do not see how the little old town can support them all especially as there are a great many cafes within the walls  i do not remember seeing any soldiers on guard at the numerous city gates but there is an office in the side of each gate for levying the octroi and old women are sometimes on guard there  this morning after breakfast j and i crossed the suspensionbridge close by the gate nearest our hotel and walked to the ancient town of villeneuve on the other side of the rhone  the first bridge leads to an island from the farther side of which another very long one with a timber foundation accomplishes the passage of the other branch of the rhone  there was a good breeze on the river but after crossing it we found the rest of the walk excessively hot  this town of villeneuve is of very ancient origin and owes its existence it is said to the famous holiness of a female saint which gathered round her abode and burialplace a great many habitations of people who reverenced her  she was the daughter of the king of saragossa and i presume she chose this site because it was so rocky and desolate  afterwards it had a long mediaeval history and in the time of the avignon popes the cardinals regretful of their abandoned roman villas built pleasurehouses here so that the town was called villa nueva  after they had done their best it must have seemed to these poor cardinals but a rude and sad exchange for the borghese the albani the pamfili doria and those other perfectest results of mans luxurious art  and probably the tradition of the roman villas had really been kept alive and extant examples of them all the way downward from the times of the empire  but this villeneuve is the stoniest roughest town that can be imagined  there are a few large old houses to be sure but built on a line with shabby village dwellings and barns and so presenting little but samples of magnificent shabbiness perhaps i might have found traces of old splendor if i had sought for them but not having the history of the place in my mind i passed through its scrambling streets without imagining that princes of the church had once made their abode here  the inhabitants now are peasants or chiefly such though for aught i know some of the french noblesse may burrow in these palaces that look so like hovels  a large church with a massive tower stands near the centre of the town and of course i did not fail to enter its arched doora pointed arch with many frames and mouldings one within another  an old woman was at her devotions and several others came in and knelt during my stay there it was quite an interesting interior a long nave with six pointed arches on each side beneath which were as many chapels  the walls were rich with pictures not only in the chapels but up and down the nave above the arches  there were gilded virgins too and much other quaint device that produced an effect that i rather liked than otherwise  at the end of the church farthest from the high altar there were four columns of exceedingly rich marble and a good deal more of such precious material was wrought into the chapels and altars  there was an old stone seat also of some former pope or prelate  the church was dim enough to cause the lamps in the shrines to become points of vivid light and looking from end to end it was a long venerable tarnished old world vista not at all tampered with by modern taste  we now went on our way through the village and emerging from a gate went clambering towards the castle of st andre which stands perhaps a quarter of a mile beyond it  this castle was built by philip le bel as a restraint to the people of avignon in extending their power on this side of the rhone  we happened not to take the most direct way and so approached the castle on the farther side and were obliged to go nearly round the hill on which it stands before striking into the path which leads to its gate  it crowns a very bold and difficult hill directly above the rhone opposite to avignonwhich is so far off that objects are not minutely distinguishableand looking down upon the long straggling town of villeneuve  it must have been a place of mighty strength in its day  its ramparts seem still almost entire as looked upon from without and when at length we climbed the rough rocky pathway to the entrance we found the two vast round towers with their battlemented summits and arched gateway between them just as perfect as they could have been five hundred or more years ago  some external defences are now however in a state of ruin and there are only the remains of a tower that once arose between the two round towers and was apparently much more elevated than they  a little in front of the gate was a monumental cross of stone and in the arch between the two round towers were two little boys at play and an old woman soon showed herself but took no notice of us  casting our eyes within the gateway we saw what looked a rough village street betwixt old houses built ponderously of stone but having far more the aspect of huts than of castlehails  they were evidently the dwellings of peasantry and people engaged in rustic labor and no doubt they have burrowed into the primitive structures of the castle and as they found convenient have taken their crumbling materials to build barns and farmhouses  there was space and accommodation for a very considerable population but the men were probably at work in the fields and the only persons visible were the children aforesaid and one or two old women bearing bundles of twigs on their backs  they showed no curiosity respecting us and though the wide space included within the castlerampart seemed almost full of habitations ruinous or otherwise i never found such a solitude in any ruin before  it contrasts very favorably in this particular with english castles where though you do not find rustic villages within the warlike enclosure there is always a padlocked gate always a guide and generally half a dozen idle tourists  but here was only antiquity with merely the natural growth of fungous human life upon it  we went to the end of the castle court and sat down for lack of other shade among some inhospitable nettles that grew close to the wall close by us was a great gap in the rampartsit may have been a breach which was once stormed through and it now afforded us an airy and sunny glimpse of distant hills     j sketched part of the broken wall which by the by did not seem to me nearly so thick as the walls of english castles  then we returned through the gate and i stopped rather impatiently under the hot sun while j drew the outline of the two round towers  this done we resumed our way homeward after drinking from a very deep well close by the square tower of philip le bel  thence we went melting through the sunshine which beat upward as pitilessly from the white road as it blazed downwards from the sky        geneva   hotel dangleterre june 11thwe left avignon on tuesday 7th and took the rail to valence where we arrived between four and five and put up at the hotel de la poste an ancient house with dirty floors and dirt generally but otherwise comfortable enough     valence is a stately old town full of tall houses and irregular streets  we found a cathedral there not very large but with a high and venerable interior a nave supported by tall pillars from the height of which spring arches this loftiness is characteristic of french churches as distinguished from those of italy     we likewise saw close by the cathedral a large monument with four arched entrances meeting beneath a vaulted roof but on inquiry of an old priest and other persons we could get no account of it except that it was a tomb and of unknown antiquity  the architecture seemed classic and yet it had some gothic peculiarities and it was a reverend and beautiful object  had i written up my journal while the town was fresh in my remembrance i might have found much to describe but a succession of other objects have obliterated most of the impressions i have received here  our railway ride to valence was intolerably hot  i have felt nothing like it since leaving america and that is so long ago that the terrible discomfort was just as good as new      we left valence at four and came that afternoon to lyons still along the rhone  either the waters of this river assume a transparency in winter which they lose in summer or i was mistaken in thinking them transparent on our former journey  they are now turbid but the hue does not suggest the idea of a running mudpuddle as the water of the tiber does  no streams however are so beautiful in the quality of their waters as the clear brown rivers of new england  the scenery along this part of the rhone as we have found all the way from marseilles is very fine and impressive old villages rocky cliffs castellated steeps quaint chateaux and a thousand other interesting objects  we arrived at lyons at five oclock and went to the hotel de lunivers to which we had been recommended by our good hostess at avignon  the day had become showery but j and i strolled about a little before nightfall and saw the general characteristics of the place  lyons is a city of very stately aspect hardly inferior to paris for it has regular streets of lofty houses and immense squares planted with trees and adorned with statues and fountains  new edifices of great splendor are in process of erection and on the opposite side of the rhone where the site rises steep and high there are structures of older date that have an exceedingly picturesque effect looking down upon the narrow town  the next morning i went out with j in quest of my bankers and of the american consul and as i had forgotten the directions of the waiter of the hotel i of course went astray and saw a good deal more of lyons than i intended  in my wanderings i crossed the rhone and found myself in a portion of the city evidently much older than that with which i had previously made acquaintance narrow crooked irregular and rudely paved streets full of dingy business and bustlethe city in short as it existed a century ago and how much earlier i know not  above rises that lofty elevation of ground which i before noticed and the glimpses of its stately old buildings through the openings of the street were very picturesque  unless it be edinburgh i have not seen any other city that has such striking features  altogether unawares immediately after crossing the bridge we came upon the cathedral and the grand timeblackened gothic front with its deeply arched entrances seemed to me as good as anything i ever sawunexpectedly more impressive than all the ruins of rome  i could but merely glance at its interior so that its noble height and venerable space filled with the dim consecrated light of pictured windows recur to me as a vision  and it did me good to enjoy the awfulness and sanctity of gothic architecture again after so long shivering in classic porticos      we now recrossed the river     the frank methods and arrangements in matters of business seem to be excellent so far as effecting the proposed object is concerned but there is such an inexorable succession of steelwrought forms that life is not long enough for so much accuracy  the stranger too goes blindfold through all these processes not knowing what is to turn up next till when quite in despair he suddenly finds his business mysteriously accomplished      we left lyons at four oclock taking the railway for geneva  the scenery was very striking throughout the journey but i allowed the hills deep valleys high impending cliffs and whatever else i saw along the road to pass from me without an inkblot  we reached geneva at nearly ten oclock     it is situated partly on low flat ground bordering the lake and behind this level space it rises by steep painfully paved streets some of which can hardly be accessible by wheeled carriages  the prosperity of the town is indicated by a good many new and splendid edifices for commercial and other purposes in the vicinity of the lake but intermixed with these there are many quaint buildings of a stern gray color and in a style of architecture that i prefer a thousand times to the monotony of italian streets  immensely high red roofs with windows in them produce an effect that delights me  they are as ugly perhaps as can well be conceived but very striking and individual  at each corner of these ancient houses frequently is a tower the roof of which rises in a square pyramidal form or if the tower be round in a round pyramidal form  arched passages gloomy and grimy pass from one street to another  the lower town creeps with busy life and swarms like an anthill but if you climb the halfprecipitous streets you find yourself among ancient and stately mansions high roofed with a strange aspect of grandeur about them looking as if they might still be tenanted by such old magnates as dwelt in them centuries ago  there is also a cathedral the older portion exceedingly fine but it has been adorned at some modern epoch with a grecian porticogood in itself but absurdly out of keeping with the edifice which it prefaces  this being a protestant country the doors were all shutan inhospitality that made me half a catholic  it is funny enough that a stranger generally profits by all that is worst for the inhabitants of the country where he himself is merely a visitor despotism makes things all the pleasanter for the stranger  catholicism lends itself admirably to his purposes  there are public gardens one at least in geneva     nothing struck me so much i think as the color of the rhone as it flows under the bridges in the lower town  it is absolutely miraculous and beautiful as it is suggests the idea that the tubs of a thousand dyers have emptied their liquid indigo into the stream  when once you have conquered and thrust out this idea it is an inexpressible delight to look down into this intense brightly transparent blue that hurries beneath you with the speed of a racehorse  the shops of geneva are very tempting to a traveller being full of such little knickknacks as he would be glad to carry away in memory of the place wonderful carvings in wood and ivory done with exquisite taste and skill jewelry that seems very cheap but is doubtless dear enough if you estimate it by the solid gold that goes into its manufacture watches above all things else for a third or a quarter of the price that one pays in england looking just as well too and probably performing the whole of a watchs duty as uncriticisably  the swiss people are frugal and inexpensive in their own habits i believe plain and simple and careless of ornament but they seem to reckon on other peoples spending a great deal of money for gewgaws  we bought some of their wooden trumpery and likewise a watch for u     next to watches jewelry and woodcarving i should say that cigars were one of the principal articles of commerce in geneva  cigarshops present themselves at every step or two and at a reasonable rate there being no duties i believe on imported goods  there was no examination of our trunks on arrival nor any questions asked on that score    villeneuve   hotel de byron june 12thyesterday afternoon we left geneva by a steamer starting from the quay at only a short distance from our hotel the forenoon had been showery but the suit now came out very pleasantly although there were still clouds and mist enough to give infinite variety to the mountain scenery  at the commencement of our voyage the scenery of the lake was not incomparably superior to that of other lakes on which i have sailed as lake windermere for instance or loch lomond or our own lake champlain  it certainly grew more grand and beautiful however till at length i felt that i had never seen anything worthy to be put beside it  the southern shore has the grandest scenery the great hills on that side appearing close to the waters edge and after descending with headlong slope directly from their rocky and snowstreaked summits down into the blue water  our course lay nearer to the northern shore and all our stoppingplaces were on that side  the first was coppet where madame de stael or her father or both were either born or resided or died i know not which and care very little  it is a picturesque village with an old church and old highroofed redtiled houses the whole looking as if nothing in it had been changed for many many years all these villages at several of which we stopped momentarily look delightfully unmodified by recent fashions  there is the church with its tower crowned by a pyramidal roof like an extinguisher then the chateau of the former lord half castle and half dwellinghouse with a round tower at each corner pyramid topped then perhaps the ancient townhouse or hotel de ville in an open paved square and perhaps the largest mansion in the whole village will have been turned into a modern inn but retaining all its venerable characteristics of high steep sloping roof and antiquated windows  scatter a delightful shade of trees among the houses throw in a timeworn monument of one kind or another swell out the delicious blue of the lake in front and the delicious green of the sunny hillside sloping up and around this closely congregated neighborhood of old comfortable houses and i do not know what more i can add to this sketch  often there was an insulated house or cottage embowered in shade and each seeming like the one only spot in the wide world where two people that had good consciences and loved each other could spend a happy life  halfruined towers old historic castles these too we saw  and all the while on the other side of the lake were the high hills sometimes dim sometimes black sometimes green with gray precipices of stone and often snowpatches right above the warm sunny lake whereon we were sailing  we passed lausanne which stands upward on the slope of the hill the tower of its cathedral forming a conspicuous object  we mean to visit this tomorrow so i may pretermit further mention of it here  we passed vevay and clarens which methought was particularly picturesque for now the hills had approached close to the water on the northern side also and steep heights rose directly above the little gray church and village and especially i remember a rocky cliff which ascends into a rounded pyramid insulated from all other peaks and ridges  but if i could perform the absolute impossibility of getting one single outline of the scene into words there would be all the color wanting the light the haze which spiritualizes it and moreover makes a thousand and a thousand scenes out of that single one  clarens however has still another interest for me for i found myself more affected by it as the scene of the love of st preux and julie than i have often been by scenes of poetry and romance  i read rousseaus romance with great sympathy when i was hardly more than a boy ten years ago or thereabouts i tried to read it again without success but i think from my feeling of yesterday that it still retains its hold upon my imagination  farther onward we saw a white ancientlooking group of towers beneath a mountain which was so high and rushed so precipitately down upon this pile of building as quite to dwarf it besides which its dingy whiteness had not a very picturesque effect  nevertheless this was the castle of chillon  it appears to sit right upon the water and does not rise very loftily above it  i was disappointed in its aspect having imagined this famous castle as situated upon a rock a hundred or for aught i know a thousand feet above the surface of the lake but it is quite as impressive a factsupposing it to be truethat the water is eight hundred feet deep at its base  by this time the mountains had taken the beautiful lake into their deepest heart they girdled it quite round with their grandeur and beauty and being able to do no more for it they here withheld it from extending any farther and here our voyage came to an end  i have never beheld any scene so exquisite nor do i ask of heaven to show me any lovelier or nobler one but only to give me such depth and breadth of sympathy with nature that i may worthily enjoy this  it is beauty more than enough for poor perishable mortals  if this be earth what must heaven be  it was nearly eight oclock when we arrived and then we had a walk of at least a mile to the hotel byron     i forgot to mention that in the latter part of our voyage there was a shower in some part of the sky and though none of it fell upon us we had the benefit of those gentle tears in a rainbow which arched itself across the lake from mountain to mountain so that our track lay directly under this triumphal arch  we took it as a good omen nor were we discouraged though after the rainbow had vanished a few sprinkles of the shower came down  we found the hotel byron very grand indeed and a good one too  there was a beautiful moonlight on the lake and hills but we contented ourselves with looking out of our lofty window whence likewise we had a sidelong glance at the white battlements of chillon not more than a mile off on the waters edge  the castle is wofully in need of a pedestal  if its site were elevated to a height equal to its own it would make a far better appearance  as it now is it looks to speak profanely of what poetry has consecrated when seen from the water or along the shore of the lake very like an old whitewashed factory or mill  this morning i walked to the castle of chillon with j who sketches everything he sees from a wildflower or a carved chair to a castle or a range of mountains  the morning had sunshine thinly scattered through it but nevertheless there was a continual sprinkle sometimes scarcely perceptible and then again amounting to a decided drizzle  the road which is built along on a little elevation above the lake shore led us past the castle of chillon and we took a sidepath which passes still nearer the castle gate  the castle stands on an isthmus of gravel permanently connecting it with the mainland  a wooden bridge covered with a roof passes from the shore to the arched entrance and beneath this shelter which has wooden walls as well as roof and floor we saw a soldier or gendarme who seemed to act as warder  as it sprinkled rather more freely than at first i thought of appealing to his hospitality for shelter from the rain but concluded to pass on  the castle makes a far better appearance on a nearer view and from the land than when seen at a distance and from the water  it is built of stone and seems to have been anciently covered with plaster which imparts the whiteness to which byron does much more than justice when he speaks of chillons snowwhite battlements  there is a lofty external wall with a cluster of round towers about it each crowned with its pyramidal roof of tiles and from the central portion of the castle rises a square tower also crowned with its own pyramid to a considerably greater height than the circumjacent ones  the whole are in a close cluster and make a fine picture of ancient strength when seen at a proper proximity for i do not think that distance adds anything to the effect  there are hardly any windows or few and very small ones except the loopholes for arrows and for the garrison of the castle to peep from on the sides towards the water indeed there are larger windows at least in the upper apartments but in that direction no doubt the castle was considered impregnable  trees here and there on the land side grow up against the castle wall on one part of which moreover there was a green curtain of ivy spreading from base to battlement  the walls retain their machicolations and i should judge that nothing had been altered nor any more work been done upon the old fortress than to keep it in singularly good repair  it was formerly a castle of the duke of savoy and since his sway over the country ceased three hundred years at least it has been in the hands of the swiss government who still keep some arms and ammunition there  we passed on and found the view of it better as we thought from a farther point along the road  the raindrops began to spatter down faster and we took shelter under an impending precipice where the ledge of rock had been blasted and hewn away to form the road  our refuge was not a very convenient and comfortable one so we took advantage of the partial cessation of the shower to turn homeward but had not gone far when we met mamma and all her train  as we were close by the castle entrance we thought it advisable to seek admission though rather doubtful whether the swiss gendarme might not deem it a sin to let us into the castle on sunday  but he very readily admitted us under his covered drawbridge and called an old man from within the fortress to show us whatever was to be seen  this latter personage was a staid rather grim and calvinisticlooking old worthy but he received us without scruple and forthwith proceeded to usher us into a range of most dismal dungeons extending along the basement of the castle on a level with the surface of the lake  first if i remember aright we came to what he said had been a chapel and which at all events looked like an aisle of one or rather such a crypt as i have seen beneath a cathedral being a succession of massive pillars supporting groined archesa very admirable piece of gloomy gothic architecture  next we came to a very dark compartment of the same dungeon range where he pointed to a sort of bed or what might serve for a bed hewn in the solid rock and this our guide said had been the last sleepingplace of condemned prisoners on the night before their execution  the next compartment was still duskier and dismaller than the last and he bade us cast our eyes up into the obscurity and see a beam where the condemned ones used to be hanged  i looked and looked and closed my eyes so as to see the clearer in this horrible duskiness on opening them again  finally i thought i discerned the accursed beam and the rest of the party were certain that they saw it  next beyond this i think was a stone staircase steep rudely cut and narrow down which the condemned were brought to death and beyond this still on the same basement range of the castle a low and narrow corridor through which we passed and saw a row of seven massive pillars supporting two parallel series of groined arches like those in the chapel which we first entered  this was bonnivards prison and the scene of byrons poem  the arches are dimly lighted by narrow loopholes pierced through the immensely thick wall but at such a height above the floor that we could catch no glimpse of land or water or scarcely of the sky  the prisoner of chillon could not possibly have seen the island to which byron alludes and which is a little way from the shore exactly opposite the town of villeneuve  there was light enough in this long gray vaulted room to show us that all the pillars were inscribed with the names of visitors among which i saw no interesting one except that of byron himself which is cut in letters an inch long or more into one of the pillars next to that to which bonnivard was chained  the letters are deep enough to remain in the pillar as long as the castle stands  byron seems to have had a fancy for recording his name in this and similar ways as witness the record which i saw on a tree of newstead abbey  in bonnivards pillar there still remains an iron ring at the height of perhaps three feet from the ground  his chain was fastened to this ring and his only freedom was to walk round this pillar about which he is said to have worn a path in the stone pavement of the dungeon but as the floor is now covered with earth or gravel i could not satisfy myself whether this be true  certainly six years with nothing else to do in them save to walk round the pillar might well suffice to wear away the rock even with naked feet  this column and all the columns were cut and hewn in a good style of architecture and the dungeon arches are not without a certain gloomy beauty  on bonnivards pillar as well as on all the rest were many names inscribed but i thought better of byrons delicacy and sensitiveness for not cutting his name into that very pillar  perhaps knowing nothing of bonnivards story he did not know to which column he was chained  emerging from the dungeonvaults our guide led us through other parts of the castle showing us the duke of savoys kitchen with a fireplace at least twelve feet long also the judgmenthall or some such place hung round with the coats of arms of some officers or other and having at one end a wooden post reaching from floor to ceiling and having upon it the marks of fire  by means of this post contumacious prisoners were put to a dreadful torture being drawn up by cords and pulleys while their limbs were scorched by a fire underneath  we also saw a chapel or two one of which is still in good and sanctified condition and was to be used this very day our guide told us for religious purposes  we saw moreover the dukes private chamber with a part of the bedstead on which he used to sleep and be haunted with horrible dreams no doubt and the ghosts of wretches whom he had tortured and hanged likewise the bedchamber of his duchess that had in its window two stone seats where directly over the head of bonnivard the ducal pair might look out on the beautiful scene of lake and mountains and feel the warmth of the blessed sun  under this window the guide said the water of the lake is eight hundred feet in depth an immense profundity indeed for an inland lake but it is not very difficult to believe that the mountain at the foot of which chillon stands may descend so far beneath the water  in other parts of the lake and not distant more than nine hundred feet have been sounded  i looked out of the duchesss window and could certainly see no appearance of a bottom in the light blue water  the last thing that the guide showed us was a trapdoor or opening beneath a crazy old floor  looking down into this aperture we saw three stone steps which we should have taken to be the beginning of a flight of stairs that descended into a dungeon or series of dungeons such as we had already seen  but inspecting them more closely we saw that the third step terminated the flight and beyond was a dark vacancy  three steps a person would grope down planting his uncertain foot on a dimly seen stone the fourth step would be in the empty air  the guide told us that it used to be the practice to bring prisoners hither under pretence of committing them to a dungeon and make them go down the three steps and that fourth fatal one and they would never more be heard of but at the bottom of the pit there would be a dead body and in due time a mouldy skeleton which would rattle beneath the body of the next prisoner that fell  i do not believe that it was anything more than a secret dungeon for state prisoners whom it was out of the question either to set at liberty or bring to public trial  the depth of the pit was about fortyfive feet  gazing intently down i saw a faint gleam of light at the bottom apparently coming from some other aperture than the trapdoor over which we were bending so that it must have been contemplated to supply it with light and air in such degree as to support human life u declared she saw a skeleton at the bottom miss s thought she saw a hand but i saw only the dim gleam of light  there are two or three courts in the castle but of no great size  we were now led across one of them and dismissed out of the arched entrance by which we had come in  we found the gendarme still keeping watch on his roofed drawbridge and as there was the same gentle shower that had been effusing itself all the morning we availed ourselves of the shelter more especially as there were some curiosities to examine these consisted chiefly of woodcarvingssuch as little figures in the national costume boxes with wreaths of foliage upon them paper knives the chamois goat admirably well represented  we at first hesitated to make any advances towards trade with the gendarme because it was sunday and we fancied there might be a calvinistic scruple on his part about turning a penny on the sabbath but from the little i know of the swiss character i suppose they would be as ready as any other men to sell not only such matters but even their own souls or any smalleror shall we say greaterthing on sunday or at any other time  so we began to ask the prices of the articles and met with no difficulty in purchasing a salad spoon and fork with pretty basreliefs carved on the handles and a napkinring  for rosebuds and our amusement the gendarme now set a musicalbox agoing and as it played a pasteboard figure of a dentist began to pull the tooth of a pasteboard patient lifting the wretched simulacrum entirely from the ground and keeping him in this horrible torture for half an hour  meanwhile mamma miss shepard u and j sat down all in a row on a bench and sketched the mountains and as the shower did not cease though the sun most of the time shone brightly they were kept actual prisoners of chillon much longer than we wished to stay  we took advantage of the first cessationthough still the drops came dimpling into the water that rippled against the pebbles beneath the bridgeof the first partial cessation of the shower to escape and returned towards the hotel with this kindliest of summer rains falling upon us most of the way  in the afternoon the rain entirely ceased and the weather grew delightfully radiant and warmer than could well be borne in the sunshine  u and i walked to the village of villeneuve a mile from the hoteland found a very commonplace little old town of one or two streets standing on a level and as uninteresting as if there were not a hill within a hundred miles  it is strange what prosaic lines men thrust in amid the poetry of nature       hotel de langleterre geneva june 14thyesterday morning was very fine and we had a pretty early breakfast at hotel byron preparatory to leaving it  this hotel is on a magnificent scale of height and breadth its staircases and corridors being the most spacious i have seen but there is a kind of meagreness in the life there and a certain lack of heartiness that prevented us from feeling at home  we were glad to get away and took the steamer on our return voyage in excellent spirits apparently it had been a cold night in the upper regions for a great deal more snow was visible on some of the mountains than we had before observed especially a mountain called diableries presented a silver summit and broad sheets and fields of snow  nothing ever can have been more beautiful than those groups of mighty hills as we saw them then with the gray rocks the green slopes the white snowpatches and crests all to be seen at one glance and the mists and fleecy clouds tumbling rolling hovering about their summits filling their lofty valleys and coming down far towards the lower world making the skyey aspects so intimate with the earthly ones that we hardly knew whether we were sojourning in the material or spiritual world  it was like sailing through the sky moreover to be borne along on such water as that of lake lemanthe bluest brightest and profoundest element the most radiant eye that the dull earth ever opened to see heaven withal  i am writing nonsense but it is because no sense within my mind will answer the purpose  some of these mountains that looked at no such mighty distance were at least forty or fifty miles off and appeared as if they were near neighbors and friends of other mountains from which they were really still farther removed  the relations into which distant points are brought in a view of mountain scenery symbolize the truth which we can never judge within our partial scope of vision of the relations which we bear to our fellowcreatures and human circumstances  these mighty mountains think that they have nothing to do with one another each seems itself its own centre and existing for itself alone and yet to an eye that can take them all in they are evidently portions of one grand and beautiful idea which could not be consummated without the lowest and the loftiest of them  i do not express this satisfactorily but have a genuine meaning in it nevertheless  we passed again by chillon and gazed at it as long as it was distinctly visible though the water view does no justice to its real picturesqueness there being no towers nor projections on the side towards the lake nothing but a wall of dingy white with an indentation that looks something like a gateway  about an hour and a half brought us to ouchy the point where passengers land to take the omnibus to lausanne  the ascent from ouchy to lausanne is a mile and a half which it took the omnibus nearly half an hour to accomplish  we left our shawls and carpetbags in the salle a manger of the hotel faucon and set forth to find the cathedral the pinnacled tower of which is visible for a long distance up and down the lake  prominent as it is however it is by no means very easy to find it while rambling through the intricate streets and declivities of the town itself for lausanne is the town i should fancy in all the world the most difficult to go directly from one point to another  it is built on the declivity of a hill adown which run several valleys or ravines and over these the contiguity of houses extends so that the communication is kept up by means of steep streets and sometimes long weary stairs which must be surmounted and descended again in accomplishing a very moderate distance  in some inscrutable way we at last arrived at the cathedral which stands on a higher site than any other in lausanne  it has a very venerable exterior with all the gothic grandeur which arched mullioned windows deep portals buttresses towers and pinnacles gray with a thousand years can give to architecture  after waiting awhile we obtained entrance by means of an old woman who acted the part of sacristan and was then showing the church to some other visitors  the interior disappointed us not but what it was very beautiful but i think the excellent repair that it was in and the puritanic neatness with which it is kept does much towards effacing the majesty and mystery that belong to an old church  every inch of every wall and column and all the mouldings and tracery and every scrap of grotesque carving had been washed with a drab mixture  there were likewise seats all up and down the nave made of pine wood and looking very new and neat just such seats as i shall see in a hundred meetinghouses if ever i go into so many in america  whatever might be the reason the stately nave with its highgroined roof the clustered columns and lofty pillars the intersecting arches of the sideaisles the choir the armorial and knightly tombs that surround what was once the high altar all produced far less effect than i could have thought beforehand  as it happened we had more ample time and freedom to inspect this cathedral than any other that we have visited for the old woman consented to go away and leave us there locking the door behind her the others except rosebud sat down to sketch such portions as struck their fancy and for myself i looked at the monuments of which some being those of old knights ladies bishops and a king were curious from their antiquity and others are interesting as bearing memorials of english people who have died at lausanne in comparatively recent years then i went up into the pulpit and tried without success to get into the stone gallery that runs all round the nave and i explored my way into various side apartments of the cathedral which i found fitted up with seats for sabbath schools perhaps or possibly for meetings of elders of the church  i opened the great bible of the church and found it to be a french version printed at lille some fifty years ago  there was also a liturgy adapted probably to the lutheran form of worship in one of the side apartments i found a strong box heavily clamped with iron and having a contrivance like the hopper of a mill by which money could be turned into the top while a double lock prevented its being abstracted again  this was to receive the avails of contributions made in the church and there were likewise boxes stuck on the ends of long poles wherewith the deacons could go round among the worshippers conveniently extending the beggingbox to the remotest curmudgeon among them all  from the arrangement of the seats in the nave and the labels pasted or painted on them i judged that the women sat on one side and the men on the other and the seats for various orders of magistrates and for ecclesiastical and collegiate people were likewise marked out  i soon grew weary of these investigations and so did rosebud and j who essayed to amuse themselves with running races together over the horizontal tombstones in the pavement of the choir treading remorselessly over the noseless effigies of old dignitaries who never expected to be so irreverently treated  i put a stop to their sport and banished them to different parts of the cathedral and by and by the old woman appeared again and released us from durance      while waiting for our dejeuner we saw the people dining at the regular table dhote of the hotel and the idea was strongly borne in upon me that the professional mystery of a male waiter is a very unmanly one  it is so absurd to see the solemn attentiveness with which they stand behind the chairs the earnestness of their watch for any crisis that may demand their interposition the gravity of their manner in performing some little office that the guest might better do for himself their decorous and soft steps in short as i sat and gazed at them they seemed to me not real men but creatures with a clerical aspect engendered out of a very artificial state of society  when they are waiting on myself they do not appear so absurd it is necessary to stand apart in order to see them properly  we left lausannewhich was to us a tedious and weary placebefore four oclock  i should have liked well enough to see the house of gibbon and the garden in which he walked after finishing the decline and fall but it could not be done without some trouble and inquiry and as the house did not come to see me i determined not to go and see the house there was indeed a mansion of somewhat antique respectability near our hotel having a garden and a shaded terrace behind it which would have answered accurately enough to the idea of gibbons residence  perhaps it was so far more probably not  our former voyages had been taken in the hirondelle we now after broiling for some time in the sunshine by the lakeside got on board of the aigle no 2  there were a good many passengers the larger proportion of whom seemed to be english and american and among the latter a large party of talkative ladies old and young  the voyage was pleasant while we were protected from the sun by the awning overhead but became scarcely agreeable when the sun had descended so low as to shine in our faces or on our backs  we looked earnestly for mont blanc which ought to have been visible during a large part of our course but the clouds gathered themselves hopelessly over the portion of the sky where the great mountain lifted his white peak and we did not see it and probably never shall  as to the meaner mountains there were enough of them and beautiful enough but we were a little weary and feverish with the heat     i think i had a headache though it is so unusual a complaint with me that i hardly know it when it comes  we were none of us sorry therefore when the eagle brought us to the quay of geneva only a short distance from our hotel      today i wrote to mr wilding requesting him to secure passages for us from liverpool on the 15th of next month or 1st of august  it makes my heart thrill half pleasantly half otherwise so much nearer does this step seem to bring that home whence i have now been absent six years and which when i see it again may turn out to be not my home any longer  i likewise wrote to bennoch though i know not his present address but i should deeply grieve to leave england without seeing him  he and henry bright are the only two men in england to whom i shall be much grieved to bid farewell but to the island itself i cannot bear to say that word as a finality  i shall dreamily hope to come back again at some indefinite time rather foolishly perhaps for it will tend to take the substance out of my life in my own land  but this i suspect is apt to be the penalty of those who stay abroad and stay too long    havre   hotel wheeler june 22dwe arrived at this hotel last evening from paris and find ourselves on the borders of the petit quay notre dame with steamers and boats right under our windows and all sorts of dockbusiness going on briskly  there are barrels bales and crates of goods there are old iron cannon for posts in short all that belongs to the wapping of a great seaport     the american partialities of the guests of this hotel are consulted by the decorations of the parlor in which hang two lithographs and colored views of new york from brooklyn and from weehawken  the fashion of the house is a sort of nondescript mixture of frank english and american and is not disagreeable to us after our weary experience of continental life  the abundance of the food is very acceptable in comparison with the meagreness of french and italian meals and last evening we supped nobly on cold roast beef and ham set generously before us in the mass instead of being doled out in slices few and thin  the waiter has a kindly sort of manner and resembles the steward of a vessel rather than a landsman and in short everything here has undergone a change which might admit of very effective description  i may now as well give up all attempts at journalizing  so i shall say nothing of our journey across france from geneva     tonight we shall take our departure in a steamer for southampton whence we shall go to london thence in a week or two to liverpool thence to boston and concord there to enjoyif enjoyment it provea little rest and a sense that we are at home  more than four months were now taken up in writing the marble faun in great part at the seaside town of redcar yorkshire mr hawthorne having concluded to remain another year in england chiefly to accomplish that romance  in redcar where he remained till september or october he wrote no journal but only the book  he then went to leamington where he finished the marble faun in march and there is a little journalizing soon after leaving redcared    england   leamington november 14th 1859j and i walked to lillington the other day  its little church was undergoing renovation when we were here two years ago and now seems to be quite renewed with the exception of its square gray battlemented tower which has still the aspect of unadulterated antiquity  on saturday j and i walked to warwick by the old road passing over the bridge of the avon within view of the castle  it is as fine a piece of english scenery as exists anywhere the quiet little river shadowed with drooping trees and in its vista the gray towers and long line of windows of the lordly castle with a picturesquely varied outline ancient strength a little softened by decay      the town of warwick i think has been considerably modernized since i first saw it  the whole of the central portion of the principal street now looks modern with its stuccoed or brick fronts of houses and in many cases handsome shop windows  leicester hospital and its adjoining chapel still look venerably antique and so does a gateway that half bestrides the street  beyond these two points on either side it has a much older aspect  the modern signs heighten the antique impression   february 5th 1860mr and mrs bennoch are staying for a little while at mr bs at coventry and mr b called upon us the other day with mr bennoch and invited us to go and see the lions of coventry so yesterday u and i went  it was not my first visit therefore i have little or nothing to record unless it were to describe a ribbonfactory into which mr b took us  but i have no comprehension of machinery and have only a confused recollection of an edifice of four or five stories on each floor of which were rows of huge machines all busy with their iron hands and joints in turning out delicate ribbons  it was very curious and unintelligible to me to observe how they caused different colored patterns to appear and even flowers to blossom on the plain surface of a ribbon  some of the designs were pretty and i was told that one manufacturer pays 500 pounds annually to french artists or artisans for i do not know whether they have a connection with higher art merely for new patterns of ribbons the english find it impossible to supply themselves with tasteful productions of this sort merely from the resources of english fancy  if an englishman possessed the artistic faculty to the degree requisite to produce such things he would doubtless think himself a great artist and scorn to devote himself to these humble purposes  every frenchman is probably more of an artist than one englishman in a thousand  we ascended to the very roof of the factory and gazed thence over smoky coventry which is now a town of very considerable size and rapidly on the increase  the three famous spires rise out of the midst that of st michael being the tallest and very beautiful  had the day been clear we should have had a wide view on all sides for warwickshire is well laid out for distant prospects if you can only gain a little elevation from which to see them  descending from the roof we next went to see trinity church which has just come through an entire process of renovation whereby much of its pristine beauty has doubtless been restored but its venerable awfulness is greatly impaired  we went into three churches and found that they had all been subjected to the same process  it would be nonsense to regret it because the very existence of these old edifices is involved in their being renewed but it certainly does deprive them of a great part of their charm and puts one in mind of wigs padding and all such devices for giving decrepitude the aspect of youth  in the pavement of the nave and aisles there are worn tombstones with defaced inscriptions and discolored marbles affixed against the wall monuments too where a mediaeval man and wife sleep side by side on a marble slab and other tombs so old that the inscriptions are quite gone  over an arch in one of the churches there was a fresco so old dark faded and blackened that i found it impossible to make out a single figure or the slightest hint of the design  on the whole after seeing the churches of italy i was not greatly impressed with these attempts to renew the ancient beauty of old english minsters it would be better to preserve as sedulously as possible their aspect of decay in which consists the principal charm      on our way to mr bs house we looked into the quadrangle of a charityschool and old mens hospital and afterwards stepped into a large roman catholic church erected within these few years past and closely imitating the mediaeval architecture and arrangements  it is strange what a plaything a trifle an unserious affair this imitative spirit makes of a huge ponderous edifice which if it had really been built five hundred years ago would have been worthy of all respect  i think the time must soon come when this sort of thing will be held in utmost scorn until the lapse of time shall give it a claim to respect but methinks we had better strike out any kind of architecture so it be our own however wretched than thus tread back upon the past  mr b now conducted us to his residence which stands a little beyond the outskirts of the city on the declivity of a hill and in so windy a spot that as he assured me the very plants are blown out of the ground  he pointed to two maimed trees whose tops were blown off by a gale two or three years since but the foliage still covers their shortened summits in summer so that he does not think it desirable to cut them down  in america a man of mr bs property would take upon himself the state and dignity of a millionaire  it is a blessed thing in england that money gives a man no pretensions to rank and does not bring the responsibilities of a great position  we found three or four gentlemen to meet us at dinnera mr d and a mr b an author having written a book called the philosophy of necessity and is acquainted with emerson who spent two or three days at his house when last in england  he was very kindly appreciative of my own productions as was also his wife next to whom i sat at dinner  she talked to me about the author of adam bede whom she has known intimately all her life     miss evans who wrote adam bede was the daughter of a steward and gained her exact knowledge of english rural life by the connection with which this origin brought her with the farmers  she was entirely selfeducated and has made herself an admirable scholar in classical as well as in modern languages  those who knew her had always recognized her wonderful endowments and only watched to see in what way they would develop themselves  she is a person of the simplest manners and character amiable and unpretending and mrs b spoke of her with great affection and respect     mr b our host is an extremely sensible man and it is remarkable how many sensible men there are in englandmen who have read and thought and can develop very good ideas not exactly original yet so much the product of their own minds that they can fairly call them their own   february 18th    this present month has been somewhat less dismal than the preceding ones there have been some sunny and breezy days when there was life in the air affording something like enjoyment in a walk especially when the ground was frozen  it is agreeable to see the fields still green through a partial covering of snow the trunks and branches of the leafless trees moreover have a verdant aspect very unlike that of american trees in winter for they are covered with a delicate green moss which is not so observable in summer  often too there is a twine of green ivy up and down the trunk  the other day as j and i were walking to whitnash an elm was felled right across our path and i was much struck by this verdant coating of moss over all its surfacethe moss plants too minute to be seen individually but making the whole tree green  it has a pleasant effect here where it is the natural aspect of trees in general but in america a mossy treetrunk is not a pleasant object because it is associated with damp low unwholesome situations the lack of foliage gives many new peeps and vistas hereabouts which i never saw in summer   march 17thj and i walked to warwick yesterday forenoon and went into st marys church to see the beauchamp chapel     on one side of it were some worn steps ascending to a confessional where the priest used to sit while the penitent in the body of the church poured his sins through a perforated auricle into this unseen receptacle  the sexton showed us too a very old chest which had been found in the burial vault with some ancient armor stored away in it  three or four helmets of rusty iron one of them barred the last with visors and all intolerably weighty were ranged in a row  what heads those must have been that could bear such massiveness  on one of the helmets was a wooden crestsome bird or otherthat of itself weighed several pounds       april 23dwe have been here several weeks     had i seen bath earlier in my english life i might have written many pages about it for it is really a picturesque and interesting city  it is completely sheltered in the lap of hills the sides of the valley rising steep and high from the level spot on which it stands and through which runs the muddy little stream of the avon  the older part of the town is on the level and the more modern growththe growth of more than a hundred yearsclimbs higher and higher up the hillside till the upper streets are very airy and lofty  the houses are built almost entirely of bath stone which in time loses its original buff color and is darkened by age and coalsmoke into a dusky gray but still the city looks clean and pure as compared with most other english towns  in its architecture it has somewhat of a parisian aspect the houses having roofs rising steep from their high fronts which are often adorned with pillars pilasters and other good devices so that you see it to be a town built with some general idea of beauty and not for business  there are circuses crescents terraces parades and all such fine names as we have become familiar with at leamington and other wateringplaces  the declivity of most of the streets keeps them remarkably clean and they are paved in a very comfortable way with large blocks of stone so that the middle of the street is generally practicable to walk upon although the sidewalks leave no temptation so to do being of generous width  in many alleys and round about the abbey and other edifices the pavement is of square flags like those of florence and as smooth as a palace floor  on the whole i suppose there is no place in england where a retired man with a moderate income could live so tolerably as at bath it being almost a city in size and social advantages quite so indeed if eighty thousand people make a cityand yet having no annoyance of business nor spirit of worldly struggle  all modes of enjoyment that english people like may be had here and even the climate is said to be milder than elsewhere in england  how this may be i know not but we have rain or passing showers almost every day since we arrived and i suspect the surrounding hills are just about of that inconvenient height that keeps catching clouds and compelling them to squeeze out their moisture upon the included valley  the air however certainly is preferable to that of leamington      there are no antiquities except the abbey which has not the interest of many other english churches and cathedrals  in the midst of the old part of the town stands the house which was formerly beau nashs residence but which is now part of the establishment of an alemerchant  the edifice is a tall but rather meanlooking stone building with the entrance from a little side court which is so cumbered with empty beerbarrels as hardly to afford a passage  the doorway has some architectural pretensions being pillared and with some sculptured deviceswhether lions or winged heraldic monstrosities i forgeton the pediment  within there is a small entry not large enough to be termed a hall and a staircase with carved balustrade ascending by angular turns and square landingplaces  for a long course of years ending a little more than a century ago princes nobles and all the great and beautiful people of old times used to go up that staircase to pay their respects to the king of bath  on the side of the house there is a marble slab inserted recording that here he resided and that here he died in 1767 between eighty and ninety years of age  my first acquaintance with him was in smolletts roderick random and i have met him in a hundred other novels  his marble statue is in a niche at one end of the great pumproom in wig squareskirted coat flapped waistcoat and all the queer costume of the period still looking ghostlike upon the scene where he used to be an autocrat  marble is not a good material for beau nash however or if so it requires color to set him off adequately      it is usual in bath to see the old sign of the checkerboard on the doorposts of taverns  it was originally a token that the game might be played there and is now merely a tavernsign    london   31 hertford street mayfair may 16th 1860i came hither from bath on the 14th and am staying with my friends mr and mrs motley  i would gladly journalize some of my proceedings and describe things and people but i find the same coldness and stiffness in my pen as always since our return to england  i dined with the motleys at lord dufferins on monday evening and there met among a few other notable people the honorable mrs norton a dark comely woman who doubtless was once most charming and still has charms at above fifty years of age  in fact i should not have taken her to be greatly above thirty though she seems to use no art to make herself look younger and talks about her time of life without any squeamishness  her voice is very agreeable having a sort of muffled quality which is excellent in woman  she is of a very cheerful temperament and so has borne a great many troubles without being destroyed by them  but i can get no color into my sketch so shall leave it here   london may 17th from a letteraffairs succeed each other so fast that i have really forgotten what i did yesterday  i remember seeing my dear friend henry bright and listening to him as we strolled in the park and along the strand  today i met at breakfast mr field talfourd who promises to send you the photograph of his portrait of mr browning  he was very agreeable and seemed delighted to see me again at lunch we had lord dufferin the honorable mrs norton and mr sterling author of the cloister life of charles v with whom we are to dine on sunday  you would be stricken dumb to see how quietly i accept a whole string of invitations and what is more perform my engagements without a murmur  a german artist has come to me with a letter of introduction and a request that i will sit to him for a portrait in basrelief  to this likewise i have assented subject to the condition that i shall have my leisure  the stir of this london life somehow or other has done me a wonderful deal of good and i feel better than for months past  this is strange for if i had my choice i should leave undone almost all the things i do  i have had time to see bennoch only once  this closes the european journal  after mr hawthornes return to america he published our old home and began a new romance of which two chapters appeared in the atlantic monthly  but the breaking out of the war stopped all imaginative work with him and all journalizing until 1862 when he went to maine for a little excursion and began another journal from which i take one paragraph giving a slight note of his state of mind at an interesting period of his countrys history ed   west gouldsborough august 15th 1862it is a week ago saturday since j and i reached this place     mr barney s hills  at hallowell and subsequently all along the route the country was astir with volunteers and the war is all that seems to be alive and even that doubtfully so  nevertheless the country certainly shows a good spirit the towns offering everywhere most liberal bounties and every ablebodied man feels an immense pull and pressure upon him to go to the war  i doubt whether any people was ever actuated by a more genuine and disinterested public spirit though of course it is not unalloyed with baser motives and tendencies  we met a train of cars with a regiment or two just starting for the south and apparently in high spirits  everywhere some insignia of soldiership were to be seen bright buttons a red stripe down the trousers a military cap and sometimes a roundshouldered bumpkin in the entire uniform  they require a great deal to give them the aspect of soldiers indeed it seems as if they needed to have a good deal taken away and added like the rough clay of a sculptor as it grows to be a model  the whole talk of the barrooms and every other place of intercourse was about enlisting and the war this being the very crisis of trial when the voluntary system is drawing to an end and the draft almost immediately to commence   end of vol ii
