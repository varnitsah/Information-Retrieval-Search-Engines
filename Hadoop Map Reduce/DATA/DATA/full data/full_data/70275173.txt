york   he was a stray boy with a very strange story the two ragged boys one of whom had a bundle of papers under his arm and the other the outfit of a bootblack slung over his shoulder thought that at the best he was stretching the truth to an alarming degree even though his manner appeared to bear out what he said  he had met these two boys at the corner of cortlandt and west streets in new york city and had stated his case to them believing that they could tell him what to do this was the story he told  the family consisting of his father mother sister and himself had come from chicago for the purpose of sailing in a steamerwhich one he was unable to sayfor europe they went directly from the cars to the pier and had gone on board the huge vessel which was to be their home while crossing the atlantic after they had been there some time and he could see no evidences that the steamer was about to start he had asked his mothers permission to go on deck for the purpose of making the acquaintance of a boy about his own age whom he had seen when they first came on board the attempt at making the acquaintance was so successful that in five minutes they were firm friends and in as many more had laid all kinds of plans for future enjoyment  both the boys claimed to excel in the art of kinging the ring but unfortunately neither one had a top with him then this one who was telling the story proposed that he should go on shore and buy two while the other remained to inform the absent boys parents where he had gone  he had had some difficulty in finding a top to suit him and he thought that he must have spent at least an hour in the search when at last he had procured two good onesand he showed them in proof of the truthfulness of his storyhe was nearly as long again in finding his way back to the steamer not knowing the name of the vessel nor the line to which she belonged he was obliged to visit each pier in succession in order to find the right one  illustration he showed them in proof of the truthfulness of his story  when from the appearance of the buildings opposite he knew that he was back again to the point from which he had started he learned to his dismay that the steamer had been gone fully an hour at first he could hardly realize that he had been left behind while his parents had started on such a long voyage and he could not account for the neglect of his newlymade friend in not telling them that he had gone on shore unless it was owing to the fact that he had neglected to point out his father or to tell what his name was  after he had fully realized that he was alone in a great city with no means of providing himself with food and shelter save through the medium of two very nice tops and six cents he started in search of the depot which they had arrived at intending to take the next train back to chicago providing the conductor would take his tops in payment but he could not find the depot and at nearly seven oclock in the evening he had stopped to ask advice from two boys of about his own ageneither one of them was over eleven years oldin the hope that they could straighten matters out for him  these two were very much inclined to doubt his story until he showed the tops as proof and even then they would have looked upon some portions of it as false had he not also produced the six cents and with three of them stood treat all round to that sticky delicacy known as peanut taffy  then they believed all he had told them and adjourning to a very broad doorstep near by they sat down to consult upon what it was best for him to do to begin with and in order that he might understand the case fully one of the boys asked as he struggled with the sticky dainty  whats yer name  paul weston replied the stranger  well my names johnny jones though the boys call me shiner said the boy with the papers under his arm an my chum heres named ben treat now you know us an well call you polly sos to make you feel mores if you was home  paul was not just certain as to how far this nickname would go towards making him feel at home but he did not venture to make any remark upon it preferring rather that his own condition and how he could better it should be the subject under discussion  johnny jones told him at once that his idea of trying to get home by the cars without money enough in his pocket to buy his ticket was an impossibility for he and ben had tried riding on the cars without paying for it even a short distance and had always come to grief because of either the conductor or the brakemen whom they looked upon as the natural enemies of boys it was useless therefore to think of getting to chicago in that way and johnny appealed to ben to decide whether he was right or not  its jest as shiner says replied ben rubbing the end of his nose thoughtfully as if he believed that gave him more of an air of wisdom you couldnt git as far as newark in a week less you walked an youd better not try it  but what shall i do asked paul in such distress that even the candy failed to soothe him  i dont see but one way said johnny gravely as he took the lump of sweetness from his mouth lest it should dissolve while he was not able to give it his undivided attention and he thus lose a portion of the treat youll have to stay here till yer earn money enough ter pay for a whole ticket  but how much will that be asked paul astounded at the careless way with which the boy spoke of such an undertaking  i dunno but itll be a good deal well find out termorrer then johnny turned his attention to the candy again  but i cant earn any money and now paul was on the verge of crying  of course yer can replied ben decidedly yer can sell papers like shiner does or yer can get a box an go inter the same bizness im in ef yer smart yerll git three or four dollars a week cordin to the weather  paul opened his eyes wide with surprise as this enormous amount was spoken of and he almost forgot his grief in the visions of wealth that floated through his brain  shiner an i haint got much money in our pockets continued ben cause were buyin some real estate an we put it all in that bout as fast as we git it but we can patch up an lend you enough to start with an you can pay it back when you git the chance  surely paul thought he was fortunate in having made the acquaintance of two boys who were so well off in this worlds goods as ben and johnny and his position did not seem nearly as bad as it had half an hour ago even though it was nearly dark and he had no idea where he should sleep that night  he did not know any more than his newlymade friends did that by telling his story to the police he would be taken care of until his relatives in chicago could be written to and he believed that he must depend upon his own exertions to get home therefore he eagerly accepted the generous offer  but where can i live he asked as the thought came to him that even though a chance for making himself rich had suddenly presented itself he was still without a home  didnt ben tell yer that wed been vestin our money in real estate asked johnny almost impatiently and speaking rather indistinctly because of his mouth being so filled with candy weve got a place we bought of dickey spry an you can stay with us if you pay your share  paul was willing to go into any extravagances for the sake of having a home provided his two tops and the three cents still remaining of his wealth was sufficient to make the first payment this he told his friends  shiner didnt mean that you was to pay it right down said ben quickly after you git to makin money for yourself all youve got to do is to buy your share of the things  as that was only just paul agreed to it and johnny who had by this time succeeded in eating the darkcolored mixture that was by courtesy called candy started off to dispose of the papers he still held under his arm while ben led paul away with him  johnny has got to tend right up to biz said ben in a halfexplanatory way or else hed git stuck you know  would he asked paul in evident alarm who would stick him  ben looked at this young gentleman from chicago in surprise and then in pity he could not understand how any one and more especially a boy could be so ignorant of the meaning of one of the most common words of slang at first he looked as if he was about to reprove such ignorance but he evidently thought better of it for he said instead  i mean that hed be stuck by havin a lot of this afternoons papers left over on his hands an he couldnt sell em termorrer you know  paul really looked relieved to know that no worse danger threatened johnny and as he walked along with ben the latter said  yer see shiner would have been about through work if we hadnt met you an fooled away so much of our time now itll take him quite a while to sell out an so you an i might as well go down to ther house ive had a pretty fair days work an ill git up such a supper asll make shiners eyes stick out moren a foot  just then they were opposite a grocery store and he went in to begin the work of making his companions eyes stick out it was with the air of one who felt able to purchase at least half the store contained in case he should want to that he ordered half a pound of bologna sausage a pound of crackers and two candles he was also very careful to see that he was given full weight  paul was a little mystified as to what share the candles could have in extending johnnys eyes but he thought it better to wait the course of events rather than to ask any questions  when ben had been served and there had been quite a delay in paying for the articles owing to his inability to count his money three times and have it amount to the same sum each time he came out and completed his purchases by buying a quart of peanuts at a stand near by  there ben said with evident satisfaction as he gave paul one of the bundles to carry i guess when shiner gets home an finds all these things hell think were havin a reglar party  paul agreed very mildly to this assertion for he had not been accustomed to look upon such an assortment as much of a treat and already he began to have vague misgivings as to the value of the real estate ben had spoken of so proudly  to paul tired as he was from the walking he had already done and the excitement through which he had passed it seemed as if they would never reach this place which ben called home for his guide turned up one street and down another until he was quite worn out  thats the place jest ahead there said ben in a cautious whisper as he halted at the corner of a street and pointed to a small yard in the rear of what seemed to be a warehouse thats the place but weve got to look out that nobody dont see us  paul believed that his companion referred to the building and he was surprised to find it so large yet why they had come around to the rear was more than he could understand  now you keep right behind me an you come quick said ben as he looked carefully around to assure himself that there was no one in sight  paul followed the directions wondering why one was obliged to use such precautions in getting into his own house and ben led the way not into the building but over the fence and down into the yard where was stored empty boxes and barrels of every description  as if he was perfectly familiar with the way ben went among the boxes to the farther end of the yard where there was a hogshead and a large packingcase close together he pulled the case a few inches asidefor it had been placed directly in front of the hogsheadand whispered  get in quick  paul obeyed hardly believing that this could be the real estate his companions had spoken of and ben followed him pulling the box against the hogshead again so adroitly as to betoken considerable practice  when one of the candles was lighted and stuck into an empty inkbottle that served as candlestick paul was able to see the interior and he stared at it in surprise  the case was evidently used as a place in which to keep their food and as a sort of general storehouse for an old coat was lying neatly folded up in one corner and opposite it were several tin cans all showing more or less marks of age and in a battered condition  the hogshead had been lined with old newspapers and from the fact that quite a quantity of straw covered the bottom it was easy to see that this was the sleepingroom  there said ben triumphantly you can stay here an live off the fat of the land jest as long as you want to  and paul never realized that if he had tried he could not have hidden himself more completely from those who might be searching for him than by thus sharing the fortunes of these two arabs of the street     chapter ii  starting in business   there was a look of delight on bens face as he saw his companion examining their home so carefully and each moment he expected to hear his exclamation of surprise at the very comfortable manner in which they lived but since after waiting some time no such exclamation was heard he asked a trifle impatiently  aint it a stunner  now paul did not really think the place merited any such praise in fact he was considerably disappointed and he compromised the matter by saying  i should think it might be real kind o comfortable  kind o comfortable echoed ben angrily well i dont know anything about chicago but if you know of any fellers there that have got any better place than this id like to go out an stay two or three months with em  well you see i dont know much about it said paul conscious that he had hurt his kindhearted friends feelings and anxious to make amends in some way ive always lived in a regular house with father and mother so i dont know how boys do live that havent got any home  youll see how they live before you get back to chicago said ben grimly and then he added in a softened voice id like to see how it would seem to have a father an a mother an a house to live in  didnt you ever have any ben  no and the boys voice trembled now in spite of himself i dont spose i ever did me an shiner have been livin round this way ever since we can remember an i reckon we always lived so we used to sleep round anywhere till dickey spry got a chance to run a stand overn jersey city an then he sold us this place for fifty cents an i tell you weve fatted right up ever since we had it  the conversation was taking such a sorrowful turn that johnnys entrance just then was very welcome paul stood very much in need of some cheerful company to prevent the great lump that was growing in his throat from getting the best of him  well you are goin it strong exclaimed johnny as he closed the door by pulling one portion of their house against the other why this is bout as good as a lectric light aint it i tell you we shall be jest as snug as mice when winter comes for this candle makes the place so warm  johnnys idea of the heat from one candle could not be a correct one if he thought that their house would be as warm in january from it as it was then in august but january was so far away that no one thought of starting an argument on the subject  ben brought forward the dainties he had bought and although shiners eyes did not stick out as far as he had said there was enough of a pleasant surprise in his face to satisfy ben for the outlay he had made  now this is what i call livin high said johnny in a choking voice as he tried to eat peanuts bologna sausage and crackers all at the same time seems like wed had a reglar streak of luck ever since we bought this house dont it  it was a good trade thats what it was an its lucky for polly that we had it or hed found out the difference in huntin round for a place to sleep  poor paul he was doing his best to eat the portion of the feast that had been set aside as his but hungry as he had been he found it difficult to swallow because of the lump in his throat that kept growing larger and larger every moment and which seemed to be doing its best to force the tears from his eyes  he thought of his parents and his sister who were probably going farther away from him each moment grieving quite as much if not more because of his absence than he did himself and when he realized that he might never see them again the tears would roll from beneath his eyelids but he brushed them away very quickly as if ashamed to have his companions see them honest though they were  then as ben and johnny began to talk of their business leaving him alone as it seemed the tears came faster and faster until he could no longer wipe them away and putting back into the paper the cracker he was trying to eat he threw himself upon the straw crying as if his heart would break  pauls hosts seemed bewildered by such singular behavior on his part they could not understand why a boy who had had the goodfortune to find such a place in which to sleep as they had just offered paul should cry and not understanding it they did the very best thing for himthey let him cry without trying to console him though it sadly marred the happiness of their feast  the tears were a relief to paul in more ways than one for before they were done flowing he was sound asleep and he did not awake to a consciousness of his troubles until ben shook him the following morning  its time to get up said the boy in a kindly tone you see shiner has to get down about sunrise to buy his papers an i go with him sos folks wont be so likely to see us comin out of here  it was some moments before paul realized where he was or what had happened to so change his sleepingroom from the neat cleanly one he called his own at home to this very rude shelter but when all that had occurred came back to his mind he leaped to his feet at once striking his head against the top of the hogshead with a force that told him he must be careful to get up no higher than his hands and knees  youll see now what a swell house weve got said johnny when they were outside and while paul was still rubbing the top of his head weve got runnin water near every room jest like any place an you can come in here an wash yer face with jest as much water as astor can git  johnny led the way to one corner of the building where a waterpipe with a faucet jutted out from the brickwork having evidently been placed there in case of fire and turning the water on the three boys scrubbed their faces and hands with the greatest vigor but paul found some difficulty in drying himself with straw as his companions did  during this important ceremony the boys had been careful to screen themselves from the view of any one on the street by the boxes which they had arranged beforehand when they were as clean as the water would make them without soap they started out of the yard at full speed going over the fence as a rubber ball goes over any projection in its way  once on the street where they were not afraid of any one seeing them their movements were more leisurely and they began to discuss plans for starting their guest in business  but the discussion was not a long one owing to the fact that but two avenues of trade were open to himthat of blackening boots or selling papers and when he was called upon to decide he chose the latter very much to johnnys secret delight  now ben said johnny who appeared to think it his duty to look out for his guests business education and welfare youd better kinder lay round an see that the boys dont try to come it on him the first day an ill keep my eye on him too  ben nodded assent and johnny said to paul  you watch an see how i do it after i git the papers an then you do jest as i do if there is a big lot of news it wont be a great deal of work but if there aint anything very portant then youve got to holler  after this lesson had been given and while they were walking towards the newspaper offices ben divided what bologna had been left from the feast of the previous evening and also put in pauls pocket his share of the peanuts which he had not eaten with the others  on account of finding an early customer who wanted his boots blackened ben did not go with them to get the papers but promised to meet paul on city hall square where it had been decided he should make his first venture as newsboy  now the boys who sell the papers do not buy their stock in the business offices as paul had supposed but are obliged to go into some room nearer the presses and where they will be out of the way of more important customers therefore when johnny led him into a room lighted by gas even though it was in the daytime and filled by a crowd of noisy pushing eager boys all wanting to be served first paul felt quite as much alarmed as surprised  its all right said johnny as he saw his companion was about to draw back there wont anybody try to hurt you here an youll git used to it after youve come two or three times  paul hardly believed that he should become accustomed to anything of the kind but before they had finished their roundsfor johnny carried four of the different morning papershe could look upon the scene which was almost the same in each case with something very nearly approaching interest  when at last the stock was procured johnny divided it giving half to paul and saying as he did so  ill git all the papers for a while till you kinder git used to it an then you can git em for yerself now come over here on the square an sing out as loud as you know how jest what i do  then for example johnny began shouting his wares in a way that was more noisy than distinct but after he had repeated it several times selling two papers in the meanwhile paul had no more idea of what he said than if he had been speaking in a foreign tongue  johnny would have lost a good deal of the morning trade which was quite brisk in his efforts to start paul aright if ben had not come along and offered to give the beginner his first lesson  paul found it rather difficult to make as much noise as ben seemed to think necessary for the sound of his own voice frightened him but in the course of an hour during which time his instructor alternately blackened boots and gave him lessons he had got along so well that he was selling quite a number of papers his success did a great deal towards helping him fight off the homesick feeling that would come over him  at first none of the other newsboys paid any attention to him perhaps because they were too busy but as trade began to grow dull they commenced to gather around paul until he was thoroughly alarmed at some of the demonstrations they made  one boy considerably larger than he was insisted that if he wanted to sell papers he should go somewhere else to do it because that particular portion of the city was under the immediate control of himself and his friends paul made no reply for the very good reason that he did not know but that the claim which this boy set up was a just one and he remained silent which caused his tormentors to thinkexactly what was the true state of the casethat he was afraid of them  one boy the same who had first spoken began pushing him aside and poor paul seeing at least a dozen boys nearly all of them larger than he was standing in threatening attitudes looked around in vain for his two friends who had promised to care for him  you want to get out of this young feller an you dont want to show your nose round here agin said the largest member of the party as he pushed paul rudely aside with one hand and with the other attempted to take his papers from him  it was this more than anything else which made paul resist for even if he had no right on that particular spot they surely had no right to take his papers from him and besides they were johnnys property not his therefore he felt he should defend them all the more strongly  illustration if you pick any row with him you pick it with me and johnny  he was trying to call up all his strength and will in defence of his own rights even though he knew the struggle could not be a long one owing to the numbers that were opposed to him when suddenly the crowd were pressed apart at one side and ben and johnny stood ready to defend their guest  this feller lives with us said ben defiantly as he looked fiercely at the boy who had been trying to rob paul an hes goin to sell papers here every day now dont any of you forget that if you pick any row with him you pick it with me an johnny  more than one of those present knew just what ben could do if he should swing that box around in defence of any one who was being imposed upon and they concluded that it was not best to discuss the matter any further the crowd fell back and paul was safe for a short time at least  johnny had sold all his own stock out and taking half of pauls the two commenced business again they had no further trouble from those who had been so eager to drive the new boy away and by dinnertime all the papers were sold but paul was ignorant that in every one was an advertisement setting forth an exact description of himself together with the promise of a large reward to the person who would take him to his father at police headquarters     chapter iii  making acquaintances   the first days work at selling newspapers was particularly hard for paul weston and more than once was it necessary for both ben and johnny to interfere to save him from what might have been serious trouble with that class of newsboys who made it their especial business to drive any newcomer away  and it would not have been a very long or difficult task to have made paul retire from the business if he had not had these two friends so experienced in the ways and hard corners of street life  according to the best judgment of both ben and johnny the only course which paul could pursue with any hope of ever reaching his friends in chicago was to earn sufficient money by the sale of papers to pay his fare on there it is true that while paul had given himself up to grief on the previous evening and they had left their hogshead home in order that he might be alone a wild idea of writing to some of his relatives had crossed their minds but it had not assumed such shape that they felt warranted in speaking of it to him  the surest way they reasoned to restore him to his home was for him to earn sufficient money to take him there properly and to that end they labored during the first day of his apprenticeship  they neglected their own work to make it known among their acquaintances that he was under their immediate care and that they should resent to the utmost of their power any effort to drive him from his task they also kept a strict watch over him and whenever they saw signs of discouragement upon his face which they did many times they encouraged him by kind words and advice to continue in his labors holding before him the hope of meeting his parents once more as the reward of his exertions  never once did the thought come to them that by keeping him within their world they were most effectually hiding him from his parents and since they were doing their best to aid him even if it was the worst thing they could do they were none the less friends to him in the truest sense of the word  that noon in order to cheer the sorrowful boy as much as possible they resolved on having such a feast as they allowed themselves only on extra occasions and that was to go to a cheap restaurant where a whole dinner such as it was could be bought for fifteen cents to them it was a rare treat but greatly to their disappointment paul did not enjoy it as they had expected he would  the afternoon papers were purchased and even though their new friend was so wholly unacquainted with the business and they were obliged to spend so much of their time in defending him from the assaults of the more evil disposed of their calling trade was more than ordinarily good  the reckless expenditure of fortyfive cents for dinner was made up and when the days work was over they had a clear profit of fortythree cents which to say the least encouraged them in their good work  instead of going directly to the home that dickey spry had founded after their days work was over ben proposed that paul be introduced to some of their mutual friends in order that his change in life might be made as agreeable as possible and then came the question as to who should be honored by the first call  ben was in favor of visiting nelly green whose mother kept a fruitstand on chatham square and who was always to be found acting as clerk while johnny was anxious to visit a mutual friend by the name of mopsey dowd who had risen from bootblack to the proud eminence of owning a peanut stand near fulton market  there was quite an argument as to which one of their friends paul would be most pleased to meet and each one held so strongly to his own views on the matter that the question was only settled by the agreement to call on both  mopsey dowds place of business being near the corner where they held their consultation the three concluded to visit there first and paul was considerably interested in this work of making acquaintances  the traffic at the ferry was still quite brisk and mopsey was in the full tide of prosperity selling his goods as rapidly as though he had extensively advertised to close out his entire stock a little below cost  between the intervals of waiting upon customers and turning the roaster to keep the nuts from burning ben related pauls story to the peanut merchant and mopsey was so much interested that he not only favored paul with a great deal of his attention but insisted on presenting him with a large handful of the very best and warmest nuts  mopsey even went so far as to enter into negotiation with paul for the purchase of the two tops that had caused him so much trouble in the getting but owing to a sudden rush of customers the proposed trade was broken off and the visitors took their leave promising to call again at some time when they would be less liable to interruption from a peanuthungry public  then the three started for nelly greens place of business taking a roundabout course to get there for the purpose of avoiding the crowd and by doing this they met another of their acquaintances whom they were rejoiced to see even though he was a creditor  this individual was none other than master dickey spry who had earned his last name because of the quickness of his movements and who had borne it so long that there was considerable doubt as to whether he remembered his parents name or not  master spry was leaning against a lamppost in an attitude of deepest dejection looking down into the gutter as if he expected to see there some help arise to aid him in his evident trouble  now dickey spry was the founder of the house in which ben and johnny took so much pride he it was who had discovered that snug place replete with all needful modern conveniences and ben and johnny had purchased it of him for fifty cents paying ten cents per week on the instalment plan and having already made three payments according to agreement  dickey had not noticed them when they first came up and it was not until ben touched him on the shoulder that he appeared to hear what they said  whats the matter with yer asked ben anxiously you look as if somebodyd stole yer an carried yer off whats up now  busted replied dickey mournfully and then he began surveying the gutter again  busted echoed the two boys in the same breath and ben asked eagerly  you dont mean to say that youve gone upfailed  thats jest it i trusted out as much as thirty cents an then i got tim dooley to tend the stand for me this forenoon an when i come back i couldnt find anything but the stand an that you know i hired all ther nuts an tim had gone off  the boys were so thoroughly overwhelmed by the news of this misfortune that it was some time before ben could ask  but cant you find out where tim is  dickey shook his head  ive been lookin everywhere an i cant hear nothin bout him an i cant make any of ther fellers pay me what they owe me so im all cleaned out  ben looked at johnny inquiringly for an instant and when that young gentleman nodded his head he said  well we owe yer twenty cents that aint due yet dickey but weve got ther money an well pay it to yer now  i dont want it replied the unfortunate tradesman an i didnt say what i did to make you pay me if you fellers will let me own twenty cents worth of ther house ill be all right for then ill have a place to live an i kin get back in ther bootblackin bizness agin  it would be crowding rather close to put four into the hogshead but matters could be arranged by turning their storeroom into a bedchamber and dickeys request was granted without the slightest show of hesitation  were goin round town awhile said johnny to the bankrupt merchant an youd better come along with us  dickey shook his head very decidedly he had no desire to mingle with the world while his loss bore so heavily upon him and he was so emphatic in his determination to go directly to the home he had once sold that no amount of persuasion could induce him to change his mind  after promising to return early in order to cheer him in his troubles the boys continued their interrupted way to chatham square where by the greatest goodluck both nelly and her mother were found seated behind a huge basket piled high with peaches and pears they were sure of having a pleasant call at this establishment for mrs green could attend to the customers while the daughter entertained them  nelly was rather diffident before this strange boy who was dressed so well and apparently had very little in common with the society in which she moved but after ben had given her a detailed account of pauls circumstances as he had to mopsey the case seemed entirely changed and she was even more sociable with paul than with her friends johnny and ben related everything of interest that they had learned since they had seen nelly last and concluded the recital by an account of dickey sprys misfortunes  nelly seemed unusually anxious to know how they could all live in the rather narrow quarters and after some conversation regarding it disclosed the reason of her sudden interest by informing the boys that since they had called last her mother had moved and that their home was larger than formerly  weve got two rooms that we shant use continued nelly speaking quickly in her excitement an mother thought perhaps you or some of the boys would come up an board with us well make it just as pleasant for you as we can an it wont cost you much more than it does the way you live nowan you dont eat more than half as often as you ought to  paul looked up with an expression of pleasure in his face for the nearer the hour of retiring approached the more distasteful and lonely did the hogshead home seem he could say nothing against it for it had served him as shelter when he was utterly alone but this idea of living in a house where some of the womankind would care for him was very agreeable to him  mother says that shell board you an see to your clothes an do your washin for two dollarsn a half a week an i think it would be awful nice for us all to live together  the boys thought so too but they also thought of their hogshead which seemed so cheerful to them if paul did have a disdain for it and there was a momentary feeling that they would not like to leave it no matter what inducement might be offered then there arose before them the vision of a regular home wherein some one would care for and minister to their comfort and the advantages of living in a hogshead grew very few indeed  come up to the house in about an hour an see how you like it suggested nelly thinking they were hesitating about accepting the offer then after she had told them the street and number at which she lived she added well be home in a little while now an then if you should think that your house is the nicest you can still live where you are  well come said ben decidedly for he had already made up his mind that he should accept the proposition then he led the others away very quickly as if he had some plan in his mind as indeed he really had  well go home an fix up an then well take the eye right outer them for they think these are the only clothes weve got  johnny was delighted with the proposition of taking the eye out of mrs green and her daughter by the splendor of their raiment and the two walked so fast in their eagerness to begin the serious operation of dressing that paul could hardly keep pace with them  after they had taken the usual precautions to prevent any one from seeing them when they readied the vicinity of their home and had succeeded in getting safely into the hogshead unobserved they found the ruined merchant laying plans for the rebuilding of his shattered fortunes it was in vain that they urged him to accompany them on their call to all their arguments he had but one reply and that was to the effect that he did not believe in their scheme of boarding  its jest nothin more nor lessn tryin to put on airs he said impatiently anybodyd think you xpected to be lected aldermen by ther way youre swellin round an old mother greenll be tickled most to death when she sees what fools youre makin of yourselves  in fact it did look just a little as if they were swelling considerably ben blackened pauls johnnys and his own boots until they would have answered for mirrors and then he attended to his own toilet  johnny had red hair which was quite coarse and persisted in growing in all directions at the same time but on this occasion he had reduced it to something like subjection by a vigorous application of the unburned end of the candle and it clung to his head as if it had been stuck there by glue his freckled face had been scrubbed until it looked as if it had been polished and his hands were almost clean  but it was upon his costume that he depended for the greatest effect that he did have another coat was shown when he put on one that had evidently been rescued from the oblivion of an ashbarrel it was very shortwaisted and very long tailed but this last defect if indeed such a term could be applied was remedied by one of the skirts having been cut off at least six inches shorter than the other which gave a jaunty careless appearance to the entire garment his vest was the same he wore when at work but by pinning the collar over so as to make it present more of the passably clean shirt he changed its entire appearance the trousers were unaltered save that where the lower portions had been fringed by long usage he had cut them off as well as he could with his knife he deeply mourned the utter absence of a necktie but consoled himself with the thought that the invitation had come at such a late hour in the day and at a time when his funds were so low that mrs green and nelly would probably understand the fact and overlook the omission  illustration paul looked on at these preparations with the most profound surprise  ben was clad in quite as startling a fashion but in exactly the opposite way johnnys coat was long very long while his was shortso short as to make it look as if it had originally belonged to a boy about half his size his vest was buttoned snug to the chin to conceal the ravages made by dirt on his shirtfront while his necktie was made of the very narrowest and most brilliant red ribbon that could be found  it would have been impossible to cut anything from the bottom of his trousers for the very good reason that they were already so short as to give them the appearance of trying to crawl up his legs to get out of sight but in his eyes the high polish of his shoes had a better chance of being seen bens face and hands were as clean as johnnys but he had put none of the candlegrease on his hair although he had smoothed it with water until two small streams were trickling down either side of his face giving plenty of employment to his hands as he tried to prevent it from running down his neck  paul looked on at these preparations with the greatest surprise and when his friends announced that they were ready and that he was to accompany them he followed without a word awed by the general magnificence     chapter iv  a great enterprise   it was not a long walk from the hogshead home to the house which mrs green proposed to turn into a place where meals and lodgings could be procured on a limited scale but neither ben nor johnny lost any opportunity of stopping to gaze in at the lighted windows that served as mirrors in order to make sure that their attire had not been disarranged in any way by their rapid walk and when they stood in front of the door it seemed to paul as if they never would get ready to ring the bell so much time did they spend in making sure that their fine toilets were quite in order and the general effect satisfactory  but they did ring the bell at last and when nelly came to the door there was no mistaking the fact that their appearance was striking in the highest degree for the girl stood regarding them with so much astonishment that it was some time before she could invite them to walk in  as ben told dickey spry when they got home that night it jest took the eyes outer mother green an nelly to see them lookin as soft as silk an fine as fiddlers  after the embarrassment caused by their costumes had passed away in a degree although nelly did not seem to recover from her surprise during the entire evening mrs green proceeded to the business on hand by showing the boys two rooms furnished with no pretensions to elegance but as neat as they were bare which she told them she would let to four boys at the moderate price of two dollars and a half each per week including meals and washing  to paul the difference was so great between the place and the one they were then occupying that he was anxious to go there at once and the others were quite as eager as he was ben was sure that he could induce dickey to make the fourth in that perfection of boardinghouses as he knew it would prove to be and in case he should not succeed in convincing master spry that it would be better for him to live there rather than in his hogshead he promised to use all his eloquence on mopsey dowd or some other equally eligible party  thus it was decided that the boys should change their home on the following day and all hands were remarkably well pleased mrs green because four boarders would bring in a weekly amount of ten dollars and the boys because at last they were to live like other people  it would not be a difficult matter to move for two coats rather the worse for wear and three old tomato cans were all the property they had to bring pauls tops which constituted his baggage could be carried in the pocket of his jacket without any trouble  when they got back to the hogshead that night and told dickey of the important change they were about to make he read them a very severe lesson on the sinfulness of extravagance it was perhaps a trifle more pointed than it would have been if he had not just been made bankrupt by the perfidy of a friend but it was both time and labor thrown away to try to induce him to become a fourth boarder at mrs greens he positively refused to listen to the scheme after it had been described to him and the conversation ended by his buying back his old home at the original price agreeing to pay ten cents each week as soon as he should be once more firmly established in business  that night paul had an attack of homesickness but being very tired he went to sleep before it became so bad as to be noticed by his friends  on the following morning paul went about his work quite as if he had been accustomed to that sort of thing for some time and owing to the fact that the papers contained an account of a terrible railroad disaster trade was remarkably good with him and johnny and correspondingly bad with ben three times during the morning they sold out their entire stock and paul was so excited by the rush as well as the amount of money they were making that he quite forgot his troubles  when dinnertime came paul and johnny had cleared two dollars and ninety cents with a fair prospect of making as much more in the afternoon since additional particulars of the accident were being received hourly ben had only made thirty cents but he and johnny had always been in partnership dividing equally the profits of both and the same arrangement held good after paul was taken into the concern  it was decided that ben should give up his business of bootblackening that afternoon and sell papers with the others so he carried his box to a friend who had a fancygoods stand in the doorway of an unoccupied store where he left it until he should finish his days work each paper that paul sold that day had the same advertisement offering a reward for any tidings of him but since he never looked at what his wares contained save to read the headlines in large letters so as to get an idea what he should cry out it did him as little good as if it had never been there  fortunately for the boys as the demand for papers was so great and continued so long mrs green had set eight oclock as the hour when they would have dinner by this plan she would have plenty of time to cook it and all hands would be through work and possessed of plenty of leisure for eating therefore they continued the trade in news until halfpast seven and then hurried for the last time to their hogshead where they found dickey spry eating his supper of crackers and cheese  the process of finding out exactly how much they had made was a long and difficult one for both ben and johnny each time they counted it over it was with a different result when they were very warm almost angry and quite positive that the fault of the difference in reckoning was in the money itself paul took it upon himself to find out the amount of cash on hand  four dollars and eightythree cents was the grand total of their earnings that day and all hands were pleasantly surprised by the prosperity that had beamed upon them  of course they could not expect such a result except on days when the papers contained some important news but business would be sure to be good on the following morning because then all the details of the accident would have been received after that perhaps bens business would have an impetus given it by some friendly shower  at the end of the week they would owe mrs green seven dollars and a half for the board of the firm and bens proposition was unanimously adopted that they pay four dollars of that amount in advance retaining the eightythree cents as a working capital for their business the next day  there was no attempt made to put on any better appearance than usual when they started for mrs greens that night for now that they were members of her family they would be obliged to go there just as they were when they finished their work and they might as well show themselves as they would be on future occasions ben attempted to take quite an elaborate and affecting farewell of master spry but that young gentleman refused utterly anything more than the ordinary expressions of parting  youll be back in lessn a month wantin to live here agin he said as seated in the farthest corner of the hogshead he looked out frowningly at their preparations for departure you cant swell very long at the rate of two dollarsn half a week an youll be glad to crawl in here agin  ben thought that it was not exactly wise to say very much against this assertion of dickeys for it was just possible that he was right and the less that was said about the matter then the easier it would be to take up their abode there again in case they were obliged to  each of the three boys took a tomato can while ben and johnny carried in addition the coats in which they had arrayed themselves the night before and in this manner they started for their new boardinghouse they were late but mrs green knowing of the activity in the newspaper market had expected they would be and had made her preparations accordingly  paul felt wonderfully relieved at being able to wash himself with soap once more and to have a towel to use while it seemed as if ben and johnny never would make themselves ready to go to the table so interested were they in the very swell thing of combing their hair before a lookingglass  i tell yer its high said ben emphatically as he took up the towel and then wiped his hands on the skirts of his coat lest he should soil itits high an if we keep on at this rate we shall jest spread ourselves all over the block before we git through with it  johnny shook his head sagely still unable to stop combing his hair in front of the glass as if he wondered where all this luxury would lead them while paul contrasted this poorly furnished room which his companions thought so magnificent with what he had been accustomed to at home  mrs green succeeded in getting her boarders away from the contemplation of their surroundings by reminding them in a very forcible voice that everything would be spoiled if they waited much longer they took their places at the table and ben and johnny were in a dream of surprise during the meal which was as ben afterwards told mopsey one of the swellest dinners ever got up in new york city  after they had eaten as much as they wantedand it seemed as if they never would get enough so good did it tastenelly showed the boarders through the rooms which were above a store there were two floors divided into five rooms and an attic which could be of no use except as a storeroom because of the fact that it was hardly more than five feet from the floor to the roof  ben was highly delighted with everything he saw paul expressed neither surprise nor pleasure and johnny was not enthusiastic until he saw the attic the moment he was taken there a gigantic idea seemed to have come to him very suddenly and he stood in the centre of the place almost too much excited to give words to the thoughts that crowded upon him  fellers he cried and he repeated it twice before he could say any morefellers do you know what we can do up here  now it is possible that both ben and paul could have thought of very many things they could do in a space as large as that attic but since they did not know what johnny referred to they shook their heads negatively and waited for him to tell them what it was that had so excited him  we can jest fix things up here an have a theatrea reglar theatre an make more money thanthanwell all we want  and then in a very excited way he went on to tell them just what could be done to transform the place into as beautiful a theatre save in one or two unimportant details as could be found in the city  nelly stood by looking first at one and then the other of the boys in mute surprise while paul delighted at the idea of making a large sum of money at one bold stroke and being saved thereby from weary days of waiting and working before he could return to his home listened attentively  illustration fellers do you know what we can do up here  ben agreed with all his partner said but he advised that mrs green be consulted as to the scheme before they went very far in deciding what work they would be obliged to do in order to transform the place from a rather dreary attic into a theatre it then occurred to johnny that mrs green might object to such a plan and he hastened downstairs to consult with her at once after considerable argument during which he set forth as prominently as possible the enormous amount of money that could be earned of which she should have a fair share johnny succeeded in gaining mrs greens consent to the plan after that the boys went to bed almost too much excited at the prospect of being managers and proprietors of a theatre to be able to sleep     chapter v  messrs treat jones weston  dowd   the particular circle of society in which ben and johnny moved was shaken to its very centre by the news which was whispered from one to the other on the day after those young gentlemen and paul had taken up their abode at mrs greens  early that morning the most exciting topic of conversation had been master sprys misfortune and tim dooleys perfidy and that had hardly begun to be commented upon when the news spread that ben and johnny since the coming of their guest who was evidently a suspicious sort of a person as was shown by his clothes and his entire ignorance of the slang of the street were no longer proud of their neat little bit of real estate but had made a change which would probably be the means of their financial ruin that they had been so extravagant as to engage rooms at a regular boardinghouse where they were to spend their substance on three square meals each day seemed like a reckless disregard of money and the price which they were to pay for board was stated at various sums from five to ten dollars per week but that was not the only bit of wonderful news  jimmy sullivan statedand he was supported by several others as the time wore onthat johnny himself had told him that they were to start a regular theatre and had already engaged a hall which would be converted into a firstclass place of amusement as soon as possible this would have been regarded simply as a rumor started for the purpose of injuring the credit of these young gentlemen had it not come so directly from one of the parties concerned and must therefore be true  business was in a great measure suspended for that day and little knots of boys gathered at the street corners eagerly discussing the news which threatened to destroy the credit for a time at least of two merchants who were well known in bootblackening and newsselling circles  it was fully understood by the majority of those who discussed this startling intelligence that it was only three weeks since the firm of treat  jones had bought a house on credit and that there was still a mortgage of twenty cents upon it in favor of the now bankrupt merchant mr dickey spry to be sure messrs treat  jones had taken in a new partner very recently but there were those who knew that this new boy had only brought to the firm three cents and two tops which could not bring in any very large amount of money even though a cash customer was found for them at once it was very clear that this new partner was more of a drawback than a help to the firm and the mystery seemed greater than ever  dickey spry on being interviewed on the subject assumed a wise air and shook his head gravely which was very much as if he had said that he was sorry to see two promising boys ruining themselves as rapidly as these two were regarding the mortgage which he held on the hogshead home he refused to say anything save that he had bought it back and those who were better informed regarding transactions in real estate at once came to the conclusion that having foreseen the coming ruin of his debtors he had foreclosed the mortgage in order to save what he could  owing to the possibility of his becoming a boarder at mrs greens and a partner in the theatrical enterprise mopsey dowd refused to express any opinion on the matter but it was said by those who called upon him that he turned the handle of his peanut roaster nervously and quickly whenever the subject was mentioned  meanwhile those who had caused all these speculations and doubts were doing their best to sell their goods and reaping almost as rich a harvest as they had the day previous they could not fail to notice the singular actions of their friends and also that whenever they approached three or four who were talking earnestly the conversation would cease entirely the boys either walking away or maintaining a positive silence until they had passed  it caused them no little surprise this singular behavior on the part of their friends but there was too much money to be made for them to try to understand it then and they continued the sale of their papers while the others speculated gloomily as to the future of the rash youths who would change their positions in life by such hazardous ventures  as a matter of fact johnny was the one who was responsible for all this excitement since it was he who had told of the theatrical enterprise he had been in such a state of mental excitement since he had first thought of the scheme that it was almost an impossibility for him to get along ten minutes without speaking of it to some one and when he told the story he was more apt to speak of the theatre as he hoped they could arrange it than as it would probably be but it must not be supposed that either ben or paul were indifferent to the matter they were almost as much excited about it as johnny was though they were not as eager to consult others regarding it  as has been said trade was very good that morning and when they went home for a lunch which bytheway they thought was much better than any of the regular dinners they had been buying down town even mrs green was disposed to think that there might possibly be some chance that they could do as johnny had proposed  it had been their intention to call on dickey spry that evening for the purpose of trying to cheer him a little in his troubles but they were too eager to accomplish their new scheme to think of spending their time anywhere but in that famous attic which was to afford an opportunity for the display of their histrionic talents as well as to bring in so much wealth  it was just as well that they did not adhere to their original plan for when ben explained to master spry the reason why they could not keep their engagement with him he gruffly told them that it was just as well for he had already made up his mind to go to jersey city in search of the defaulter tim dooley therefore they were not troubled with any pangs of conscience because they were leaving dickey to mourn alone while they planned the transformation of the attic and their dinner was eaten with a celerity that astonished their landlady johnny took upon himself the duties of architect and considering the difficulties in the way of such labor the others were not unwilling that he should hold the office  master jones found that there was a vast deal of difference between thinking of what he would like to do in the way of making improvements and actually planning how to make them he knew that he wanted a stage at one end of the attic but when the others waited to hear how he could go to work to build it with the limited amount of capital at his disposal he was almost at a loss to know what to say or do  in order that they might set about their work understandingly nelly produced what had originally been a tapemeasure one foot in length it had seen such hard usage however that only about eight inches remained with this the amateur architect set about a portion of his work which was to him very painful  he decided first that it would be a useless waste of material to build a stage entirely across one end of the attic since they would not be crowded from lack of room owing to the small number of performers and after a great amount of pacing back and forth as well as mental calculation he drew two chalk lines at supposed equal distances from the walls between these lines he measured with his fragment of a tapemeasure and found that it was exactly thirty times the length of the tape thirty times eight inches was therefore the length of his proposed stage or more properly speaking his platform and he seated himself with a look of perplexity on his face and a remarkably small piece of leadpencil in his mouth to figure up the grand total of inches he could multiply the cipher easily enough for he was positive that the answer would be the same however large the multiplier might be but the question of how much eight times three was troubled him greatly  after trying in vain to arrive at the correct result by the process of multiplication he in his despair was about to resort to the tiresome expedient of counting the number of inches on the tapemeasure thirty times over when paul astonished him considerably by giving the result without even using the pencil and paper  how nice that is said johnny with a sigh of relief as he wiped from his brow the perspiration that had been forced out by his mental exertions and he began to realize that a knowledge of the multiplication table was very useful to a person in any line of business  paul further informed him that two hundred and forty inches were twenty feet and then he proceeded with greater confidence to calculate the width which he at first decided should be twelve feet but afterwards changed to six when ben suggested that they would require too much lumber if they had it so wide  illustration multiplication is vexation  after it was settled that the platform should be raised two feet from the floor and paul had figured up the exact number of square feet of lumber which would be necessary to cover the proposed space they commenced a serious discussion as to where the material could be procured  ben concluded finally that he would call upon a carpenter whom he knew from having slept in his shop on the shavings several cold nights in the winter when he could find no other shelter and thus that question was put aside for the time being  it would be necessary to have some scenery and that johnny had already arranged for in his mind he had decided that it could be made by pasting old newspapers together hanging them on strings and coloring them with red green and black crayons for this purpose stout cord was necessary and ben went out and bought some thereby giving tangible form to their enterprise for this cord was really the only thing they had purchased towards effecting the desired transformation  their next step was to gather up all the old newspapers they could find in the house and nelly set about making some flour paste while johnny went in search of the crayons thus they made considerable progress in their enterprise that night but it yet lacked a system and what was more important capital in order to remedy this johnny called for a strict account of the cash on hand since they had been too busy to reckon up that days sales  by common consent paul was chosen bookkeeper so far as figuring up the different amounts whether of money or material desired was concerned and thanks to his knowledge of arithmetic it was not many minutes before he informed them that the capital of eightythree cents with which they had commenced that days business had been increased to three dollars and ninetyfive centsa clear profit of three dollars and twelve cents out of this one dollar and a half was given to mrs green towards the payment of the balance that would be due on their board bill one dollar was set apart as the working capital of the theatre and sixtytwo cents was to be used in business the following day  they had hardly settled these financial questions when mrs greens voice from the floor below announced that master mopsey dowd had called to see them and was already on his way upstairs  if master dowd had had any doubts as to the desirability of becoming one of mrs greens boarders they were all dispelled when he saw that attic every timber of which seemed to be begging to be converted into a theatre in fact master dowd was so impressed with the advantages of that place as a theatre that he did not even speak to his friends until he had paced up and down the room dreaming of the fame that might be achieved there  already the peanut merchant seemed to have put all thoughts of his roaster and his wares far from him and to fancy that he was before an audience of his particular and critical friends welcomed by them as an artist of whom all the world might be proud  he was recalled from these pleasant dreams by stepping on a tack that penetrated his shoe at a place where a patch was much needed and then he appeared to see for the first time his friends who were anxiously waiting for him to complete his survey of the room  its a stunner he said patronizingly to ben as he seated himself on the floor with easy grace to remove the tack from his footits a stunner an we can jest set the boys wild if we can play somethin with plenty of murder in it  then youll come in with us asked johnny delighted at the praise of this boy whom he was anxious to have for a partner because of the influence he wielded and also because it had been whispered among their immediate circle of friends not many months before that master dowd had fixed up a play that laid all over anything that the world had ever yet seen at the bowery theatre  yes ill join yer said mopsey impressively looking around as if he expected to see every face light up with joy at his decisionill join yer an ill come here to board tomorrow  then as was perfectly proper this new partner was informed of the amount of cash capital on hand and after paul had ascertained that their dollar represented thirtythree and onethird cents as the share of each one mopsey generously counted out thirtyfour cents disdaining any credit for the extra twothirds of a cent thus it was that the firm of treat jones weston  dowd sprang into existence     chapter vi  the theatrical enterprise   when it became known among that portion of the mercantile world of which ben and johnny were members that mopsey dowd the peanut merchant of fulton ferry had connected himself with the theatrical enterprise about which so many comments had been made the matter put on an entirely different aspect and it was at once shrewdly guessed that he had put in the greater portion of the working capital  there no longer seemed to be any doubt as to the success of the enterprise and ben johnny and paul found their regular business seriously interfered with by those of their acquaintances who were anxious to become actors had they given a position to each of their friends who asked for one they would have been obliged to have given the entertainment without an audience for all their acquaintances would have been employed in the theatre  master dowd had foreseen this difficulty and before he had been a member of the firm five minutes he decided that no actors outside the firm should be employed and that nelly should do something towards the entertainment probably in the way of a song as to ticketsellers doorkeepers ushers and such officers mopsey felt reasonably certain that mrs green would consent to take her knitting and fill all the positions by sitting at the door where she could collect the money for admissions keep the audience in order and keep a general eye to the safety of her house all at the same time  thus when any one pleaded old friendship or services rendered as a reason why they should be admitted as members of the company everything was made plain and pleasant by referring to the mutual agreement that prevented any more actors however brilliant they thought they were from being engaged  the public or a certain portion of it were more than anxious to know what the opening play was to be and many inquiries were made of the first three of the partners even before they had succeeded in procuring the material for the stage finally they spoke to mopsey about it for they thought the curiosity of their expected patrons should be satisfied  owing to its being generally understood that mopsey was an author making dramatic literature a specialty the other partners advised by nelly green had left the important question of what the opening play should be entirely to the peanut merchant when he was questioned on the subject by his partners he refused to give them any information save that he was thinking up something which would go ahead of anything yet written and that he would make the result of his thoughts known in due time  meanwhile the boys continued their regular business for they had wisely concluded that it would not do to let the theatrical enterprise interfere with that which they knew would provide them a living until the new scheme had been shown a success  paul had become quite proficient in the work of selling newspapers and although he had not overcome the feeling of homesickness which would creep over him every night he was becoming more reconciled to his lot because each days work seemed to bring him nearer to the attainment of his object  ben and johnny had forgotten their plan of writing a letter to some of pauls friends or of proposing that he should do it because of the great scheme of the theatre and if either of them thought of it after it had first been spoken of it was only as a useless labor since as soon as their place of amusement was open they would all have money enough to go anywhere they wanted to  business had been as good as they could have expected of course they did not have such a rush as they had been favored with during the first two days that paul was in partnership with them because the news was not so exciting but they did so well that their board was paid for a week before they had been at mrs greens four days and they had begun to think of adding to the theatrical fund  ben had heard of a small lot of timber which could be purchased for one dollar and a half and johnny insisted that each member of the firm be called upon for an addition of forty cents to his regular investment which demand was promptly met in four days the work on the scenery had advanced so well that johnny felt sure enough papers had been pasted together at least until after the stage had been built and the timber was purchased and carried into the attic at once it was no slight work to build the stage to their satisfaction and the four labored hard two entire evenings before it was completed but when it was up they were fully repaid for all they had done so thoroughly businesslike did it look and such a theatrical appearance it gave to the attic  to be sure one end was a few inches higher than the other and there were not boards enough to floor the space completely over but the first defect could and would be remedied by the scenery and the second could be gotten over by a little extra care when they walked besides mopsey was not just certain but that those very holes could be utilized by him in his construction of the play for some very startling and novel effects  the painting of the scenery was an artistic bit of work which johnny was certain he and nelly with perhaps some trifling assistance from paul could do in such a manner as would delight their patrons and cover themselves with credit therefore that portion of the work was left entirely in their hands one evening while ben and mopsey started out to call on dickey spry for the purpose of consulting with him as to how they could procure material with which to build seats for dickey was supposed to be quite an authority in such matters  very little had been seen of master spry by this firm of dramatic managers authors and actors since the night on which he had purchased his old home he had gone back to the business of blackening boots as he had said he should but he was plying his trade in jersey city in the hope that he might learn of the whereabouts of the boy who had ruined him therefore it was only right that they should call upon him because of their friendship even if they had not wanted his advice with this twofold purpose in view they started out fearing that they should not find him at home  but their fears were groundless for when they reached the hogshead master spry was discovered at a feast of herrings and crackers he was not a boy who indulged in any useless conversation and when he saw who his visitors were he welcomed them by passing to each a herring and a cracker which was really more eloquent than words  while he was eating ben glanced around in order to see what changes the new occupant had made the only unfamiliar thing he saw was a large sheet of brown paper tacked up at the end of the hogshead on this paper was printed the following notice the letters having evidently been made by a chewed stick with liquid blacking considerably diluted with water        runned away      tim dooly runned away     with all the things     i had on my penut stand in     gersey site an i will pay enny     feller ten cents what will     tell me wher he is              d spry  it is impossible to say what good master spry thought he could effect by having this notice put up in his own home where no one would see it but his friends who knew all the particulars but it seemed to afford him a great deal of satisfaction to look at it which ben concluded was the reason why he had done it  haint heard nothin bout tim asked ben after he and mopsey had spelled the notice out with considerable difficulty and many misgivings as to whether jersey should be spelled with a g or a j  dickey shook his head and tried to sigh but he had such a large piece of herring in his month that he did not dare to attempt it  i dont xpect i ever shall he said sadly as soon as he had swallowed enough of the fish to admit of his speaking plainly ive offered to give ten cents jest as ive got it there if anybody will tell me where he is but i dont hear nothin of him  ben and mopsey sat for a few moments in silence as if to better express their sympathy and then the latter asked  hows biz dick  well it aint so awful good nor it aint so dreadful bad was the noncommittal reply i spose i shall get along but i wish i could git a holt of tim dooley then id be pretty well fixed  the visitors looked as if they thought it would be of very little advantage to dickey if he should succeed in finding the defaulter and dickey said quickly as if they had spoken their doubts  if i can catch him ill make him pay me back somehow whether hes got it or not  it was rather a rash assertion but dickey spoke so confidently that his visitors thought it best not to argue the question and ben concluded that it was about time to proceed with the business for which they had come after he had explained just what it was they needed for the completion of their theatre during which time dickey sat rubbing his chin the personification of wisdom the two waited for master spry to give them the benefit of his knowledge  it was some time before he condescended to speak but when he did it was slowly and emphatically to show that his mind was fully made up and could not be changed  i know where theres a lot of boards that i could trade for an you could put some blocks under each end of them an have the best kind of seats but yer see ive bin thinkin that you oughter taken me inter company with yer for i can act all round anybody youve got in that crowd now ill git all ther seats yer want an carry em up there if youll let me come in with yer  illustration hows biz dick  it was a sudden proposal and the two did not know what to say for some moments it was gratifying to them because master spry was very cautious in making any venture and that he was anxious to become a partner showed that the public looked with favor upon the scheme or dickey spry would have been the last boy to propose partnership  but each one of us have put in seventythree cents said mopsey hesitatingly after he had thought the matter over for several moments  an sposin i git as many as twenty long boards an the blocks to put under em wont that be a good deal moren that much money  judging from the price they had paid for the timber with which the stage had been built they knew that dickeys offer was a good one and after that young gentleman had gone out into the yard in order to allow them to discuss the matter privately mopsey said as they called him back  were willin to gree to it an take you in with us but of course weve got to see what johnny an polly say to it an if youll come over to the house with us well fix the thing right up quick  by way of reply dickey jammed his hat more firmly on his head and extinguished the candlewhich actions his visitors understood to mean that he would accompany them  during the walk ben was anxious to know where and how master spry was going to procure this lumber which he offered for an interest in the concern but dickey did not hesitate to say that he would not tell them until after the question as to whether he was to be a partner or not had been settled lest they should take advantage of the information and then refuse to make him an equal owner  this seemed to cast a doubt upon their honesty but they did not take offence at it because master spry was suffering from the wickedness of a boy whom he had trusted and it was only natural that he should be suspicious  when they arrived at mrs greens and ascended to the attic which was the scene of so much industry they found that the amateur artists had made great progress in their work although it was shown more by the dense coloring that had been put on the newspaper scenery than from any very fine effects  johnny had two wide strips of paper completely covered with patches of black and green that were to be placed either side of the stage where the audience would see them as one sees the wings at a more pretentious theatre he pointed to his work with evident satisfaction and assumed an injured look when neither one of the newcomers understood that it was a very fine representation of a forest  paul and nelly were industriously engaged in coloring two other wings with alternate stripes of red and blue but their work was not sufficiently advanced to render it possible to form any idea as to what it was and they refused to give any information until they had finished it  after the coloring of the scenery had been admired and dickey had examined with a critical eye all that had been done ben stated to johnny and paul the proposition which master spry had made declaring himself in favor of accepting it  of course after the advantages of this new connection had been explained the artists were perfectly willing to admit mr spry as a partner and he was informed of the fact with the intimation that it was necessary to have the seats there as quickly as possible  dickey promised to begin his labor on the following morning and then while the others worked on the scenery he related to them the success he should make as an actor provided he was given a part which admitted of his carrying a sword and shield     chapter vii  artists and printers   dickey spry kept his word so far as having the timber for the seats at the theatre was concerned for so anxious was he to fulfil his part of the contract that he devoted all the next afternoon and evening to the work  he made arrangements with mrs green whereby he could get into the house during the afternoon while she was attending to her fruitstand and by nine oclock in the evening he had made seats enough to accommodate at least two hundred boys providing of course that they were willing to stow themselves in snugly  after the work was done there was not a member of the firm but thought they had a valuable acquisition in the person of mr spry and his timber and they listened with more attention to his suggestions than they had on the previous evening when it was possible that he would not carry out his portion of the contract as fully as they desired  when they stopped work that evening they surveyed their theatre with a great deal of pride for it was now so nearly completed that any one could tell at a very searching glance what it was intended for the scenery was all in its place and nelly had made a quantity of rosettes out of tissuepaper of various colors which were to be fastened as ornaments on the rough unpainted boards  all that remained to be done was to make the curtain and hang it so that it could be rolled up and down and to arrange a place for the candles that were to serve as footlights  what that curtain should be made of had been a vexing question for the partners to settle and many and serious had been the discussions regarding it ben had insisted that they ought to buy white cloth enough to make a regular curtain but on considering that proposition carefully they had discovered that it would cost nearly three dollars and they hardly felt warranted in going to so much expense  finally it was decided to buy large sheets of stout brown paper which could be both pasted and sewed together in order to make sure that they would not pull apart by their own weight and then these were to be ornamented in some artistic manner by each one of the party  by the time this important question was settled it was so late that no more work could be done that night but before dickey departed for his hogshead home there was an emphatic demand made upon mr dowd for some particulars as to the play which he had promised to have in readiness for the opening night it was then wednesday and since the first performance was to be given on the following saturday evening it did surely seem as if the actors should know what they were to do on that important occasion  it will be all right mopsey said so decidedly that they would have been obliged to be satisfied even if he had not added friday night well all come here an practise an then ill tell you all about it  on the following day business was so good that it was very late before any of the partners could get to work on their theatrical enterprise and if their profits had not been so large they would have deeply regretted the delay but they worked the faster when they did get the chance and while the others were interested in putting together the curtain which bid fair to be a marvel of art ben labored industriously at making the tickets  an acquaintance of his had a large lot of cardboard clippings which he had gathered from time to time as he delivered papers in a printingoffice and these ben had purchased with the understanding that he was to give free admission to the entertainment for them during three evenings providing of course that the theatre remained open to the public that length of time from these odds and ends nelly had cut about a hundred tickets during the afternoon while she was in charge of the fruitstand and these ben was converting into orders for admission by printing on them in rather a shaky hand and with a new leadpencil he had bought for that express purpose the following      grate show        let wun cum in             5 cents  as it was proposed to charge eight cents for seats in the two front benches ben printed in addition to the above twenty very unique cards similar to this      preserved ceat       frunt bench  it was a long job and he had bitten his tongue until it was sore in his efforts to make the printing legible while his fingers ached from clutching the pencil so firmly but he finished his task before the curtain was completed and was able to give his advice as to the embellishment of it  it was while working on the curtain that johnny displayed his skill as an artist for he assumed the sole charge of it insisting that the others should proceed under his direction it was spread on the floor and hunter jones was pursuing his work on his hands and knees with two candles stuck in bottles as his only light but johnny appeared to be equal to the emergency for he was dashing on the color rapidly not heeding the fact that one side of his nose was a beautiful green and the other a vivid red while his chin was as black as if he had been trying to paint a beard on it  it was on the central figure of this intended work of art that johnny was expending the most of his labors and to those who were watching him it appeared something like an eccentric rainbow or the interior of a paintshop until master jones printed under it to avoid any possibility of mistake wild ingun and then all could see the resemblance at once  illustration all could see the resemblance at once  johnny was proud of his work and when at last it was completed he stood at some distance from it transfixed with silent admiration of what he had created and quite regardless of the fact that the hot tallow from the candle which he held in his hand was running down over his fingers  it had been decided to have a small painting in each of the four corners to prevent the indian from looking lonely and one of these was to be done by each member of the firm  paul drew his entirely in black in the righthand lower corner and it was a very fair representation of two guns and a sword although the barrels of the guns were rather more crooked than they should have been while the edge of the sword was notched as if it had had some hard usage  dickey printed in red the same notice that the boys had seen in his home offering a reward for the apprehension of tim dooley and although his partners declared that it was not at all appropriate for the curtain of a dramatic stage he insisted that it should remain there citing as an argument the fact that he had contributed more than the others to the general fund it was an argument that could not be disputed and dickeys notice was allowed to remain although johnny contended that the audience would think his indian had been intended as a portrait of the missing tim  in the upper lefthand corner mopsey painted with all the colors at his command a picture of a schooner under full sail with a row of what was at first supposed to be guns showing over the rail but which he explained were peanuts adding that she was represented as having a full cargo on board  ben with fingers still aching from severe exertion with the pencil drew a picture of his blackingbox and brush which would have been quite a correct likeness if he had not made the mistake of painting the brush nearly three times as large as the box  then in order that nelly might do something towards beautifying this wonderful curtain she was allowed to print the name of each member of the firm as well as her own around the border giving more color to the whole even if it did not add to the artistic effect  it was very late when all this was done and the promoters of this grand enterprise were obliged to go to their respective beds much as they would have liked to continue at their work all night  the hundred and twenty tickets were divided equally among the five partners that they might sell as many as possible before the opening of the doors on saturday night and thus lessen mrs greens duties as doorkeeper  it was also agreed before they separated that night that ben and dickey should not attempt to do any business the next day but devote all their time to banging the curtain and hunting up old bottles to use as holders for the footlights so that everything would be in readiness for the rehearsal in the evening  during the next forenoon those of the partners who pursued their regular business had all they could do to attend to those who wished to buy papers and theatre tickets and more particularly the latter  there had been very much talk and speculation among this portion of the newsselling world as to the theatre and every one was anxious to secure a ticket as early as possible lest if they delayed until near the time of the performance they should be unable to gain admission  of course where so much had been said about any one particular thing as was said about this theatre and where so many rumors were flying around exaggeration as to the size furnishing and general appearance of the place could not be prevented some thought that an army of carpenters had been at work fitting up and decorating the whole theatre others had it that it was upon the stage only that much labor had been expended and that that portion of the theatre was more beautiful than any other that could be found in the city  the more imaginative paid no attention to mere detail but circulated the most startling rumors as to the excessive amount of brainwork mopsey dowd was doing on the new play which was to be his masterpiece and to far surpass anything buffalo bill or sixteenstring jack ever wrote  since mopsey was found at his place of business with the same regularity as before this gigantic scheme was planned some of his admirers insisted that he worked nights spending the time when he should have been asleep in bringing forth the most startling and bloodcurdling scenes to be given with all their attendant horrors on the night of the opening of the theatre  with all these things to give an impetus to the sale of tickets it was little wonder that they were disposed of readily when night came all had been sold save those which ben and dickey had and the demand was still very great  each member of the company was quite as much excited when they went home that night as if the performance was to be given then for the rehearsal was to be held and all had their parts to learn  ben and dickey had worked faithfully and performed all that had been given them to do the curtain was hung a little awkwardly to be sure on account of the uneven manner in which the stage was built but there it was whether straight or crooked where all the beauty of its manycolored illustrations could be seen if the candles were held near enough to it  when called upon to hoist and lower it ben and dickey showed evident signs of nervousness but they succeeded after some considerable time in getting it up and down without tearing it although it was plain to be seen that they were relieved when it was up for the second time and mopsey had ordered it left there  the footlights had been arranged by nailing narrow strips of board on the under side of the stage and allowing them to project about six inches beyond where the curtain would come when it was lowered on these strips the bottles some large and some small were to be placed each with a candle in it ben was confident that they would remain there safely enough provided no one walked very heavily on the stage he also suggested to mopsey that he should have as little fighting as possible in the play because of the insecurity of these bottle footlights this piece of advice however caused the author to frown severely as if he felt that some of his best scenes would thus be interfered with  no one had thought of lighting the main body of the hall until ben and dickey noticed the omission and supplied it by tying candles around two barrelhoops and hanging them up like chandeliers which added greatly to the general appearance and finish of the place after all these things had been inspected the party adjourned to dinner in order to fortify themselves for the trying mental labor before them and dickey remained as the guest of his partners having been specially invited by them and mrs green     chapter viii  an authors trials   when the dinner was endedand the members of the dramatic company made short work of it in order to begin their professional duties as soon as possiblemopsey dowd fully realized that he was about to pass in judgment before his partners whether he was entitled to it or not he had some considerable fame as an author and for that reason he had taken upon himself voluntarily and even eagerly the task of preparing an original play for the great event which goes to show perhaps more than anything else that mopseys fame resulted from chance rather than merit  when he rose from the table he knew that every eye was upon him and that each one present expected to hear him say something relative to the braineffort he was making he was a genius and would be until his friends found him out which occurrence would not be very far off if he should say anything then for the very good reason that he did not know what to say he knew that something must be done and that speedily which would bear out his claim to distinction and with a view to gaining time he said  you fellers go into the theatre cause i aint quite ready yet an ill go up to my room to think over one or two things  this speech was very much needed just then for mopsey had been so reticent as to his play that his partners were beginning to suspect that he was not all he claimed to be but now perfect trust was restored by his words and the proprietors of the theatre went up to their temple of art feeling every confidence in the author who was struggling in the privacy of his chamber for their success  this delay in the beginning of the rehearsal was just what nelly wanted for it enabled her to add what she considered would be the crowning beauty of their decorations she had conceived the idea only that afternoon while engaged in the busy whirl of keeping the sound peaches at the top of the basket and the unripe ones at the bottom  a friend of hers whose mother kept a threadandneedle emporium that was contained in a willow basket and displayed to the public very near her fruitstand was skilful in the art of making paper flowers and from time to time had presented nelly with specimens of her skill until everything in the house that could be pressed into service as a vase was filled with these neverfading and odorless roses  it had occurred to her that these flowers might be so arranged on the wall as to form the word welcome and when she suggested her idea to the boys after mopsey had gone into his room they were delighted therefore the delay caused by the author enabled them to go to work upon this last and most beautiful of their decorations at once  dickey went out for a paper of tacks and johnny drew on the wall directly opposite the entrance of the hall the outlines of the word to be filled up with the paper flowers but there was a difference of opinion among those who were watching him as to how the word should be spelled he had drawn out the letters welkum while paul insisted that it was not right spelling the word correctly and referring the matter to ben for arbitration  thus appealed to as if he was an authority in such matters ben looked wonderfully wise but refused to give any decision until after he had written the word down on a bit of paper spelling it in various ways that he might see which looked correct  after some moments of anxious suspense for johnny for he had built a very frail stand to enable him to reach a point on the wall where it would be impossible for any of the audience to tear the flowers down ben announced that neither was correct and that the word should be spelled wellcom it was in vain that paul insisted ben was wrong the decision had been given and the others decided that where a matter was left to a third party for adjustment all must be satisfied with the ruling therefore johnny marked out the letters as ben had said and after dickeys return with the tacks the flowers were put up forming a very gorgeous and badly spelled word  before the partners had finished admiring this very beautiful ornament on the wall of their theatre a noise was heard on the stairs and on looking out dickey announced by many frantic gestures that the author was coming it was a moment of anxious expectancy for at last they were to know the result of their partners labors and they were to be shown just what they were to do on the important occasion dickey was particularly anxious probably fearing lest his part should not be such as would admit of his carrying a sword and shield  mopsey walked into the room with slow and measured step as if he knew the weight of the words he was about to speak and feared lest being too heavy they might topple him over but master dowd was not one who did anything in a careless manner he did not deign to speak until he had walked the length of the room disappeared behind the scenery and stalked out upon the stage holding a huge sheet of paper in his hand as if it was a weapon with which he was about to strike any refractory member of the firm should his play not be exactly to their liking  illustration who put that up  fellers he said as he cleared his throat and then noticing the female portion of his company he corrected himself by saying fellers an nelly when we first made up our minds to build this theatre here he waved his roll of paper around as if to designate which theatre he meant the movement drew his attention to the new ornament and caused him to forget what he was about to say  who put that up he asked almost angrily  i did said johnny and then anxious to shift any responsibility of the spelling to the shoulders on which it belonged he added but ben spelled it  well fix it commanded the disturbed author if any of the fellers should see that theyd think we didnt know nothin at all put it wedouble lkom  johnny started to obey him thinking with delight that he had been almost right before and mopsey continued  when we built this place i said id fix up a play myself sos wed be sure to have everythin all right but business has been so good an i had so much trouble with my peanut roasterfor i broke it twice an had to hire one offer the italian that keeps across the streetthat i thought wed play somethin the boys all knew an wed kinder lay over anythin theyd ever seen at the same time so i thought wed play the whole of shakespeare an that would give everybody a fair show  there was a look of disappointment on the faces of his hearers as he said this and noticing it he added quickly  you see we couldnt get up a whole play new an give all hands a chance to do fightin an then agin dickey wouldnt have a shield an a sword any other way than this  this last argument changed the look on dickeys face at once and he was perfectly satisfied with any arrangement now for he knew that his ambition was to be realized the others were very careful to show no signs of approval until they were satisfied that they had been treated as well as dickey  of course continued mopsey as he looked around at his audience much as if he expected to hear some of them say that he couldnt write a play the first thing we had to have was a programme an ive made one out sos youll know jest what youve got to do  here mopsey unfolded the paper he had carried in his hand and displayed a bill of the play it is unnecessary to say that this piece of literary work had cost the author a very great effort doubts as to the spelling arose at every turn but the final result was as follows      grate showat mis grens bordin house             the hole ov shakspir         saterday nite 8 in the evenin         richard 3           mopsey dowd       makbeth             dickey spry

     grate time  mopsey waited patiently until all had read this wonderful production and he was pleased to see that nearly all were satisfied with their parts ben treat was the only one who appeared to think he had any cause for complaint and he very soon made his grievance known  i cant play ghost he said fretfully i dont know nothin bout it an i want more to do  mopsey had made up his mind as to what course he should pursue in case of any dissatisfaction and he said to ben in tones of deepest scorn  a great feller you are to get up a fuss before you know what youve got to do an you oughter be ashamed of yourself why youve got an awful lot to do in the first place youve got to come an most scare the life out of polly an then when he runs away youve got to do a song an dance an turn three or four handsprings before you sink right down through one of these holes i dont know what you do want if that dont suit you unless it is to do the whole play  ben had nothing more to say he realized that his was really an important part and he was abashed by the withering sarcasm of the angry author then each of the others fearing lest they should not have as good an opportunity for the display of their talents demanded to know what they were to do  now ill begin an tell you the whole thing said mopsey as he prepared to show how all of shakespeares plays could be performed on one evening by a small company in the first place nelly comes out all dressed up an sings a song then the play commences i come out with a sword an pistols an tell about my hoss runnin away an after i get through shiner comes out an picks a fuss with me an i kill him  here the speaker was interrupted by the gentleman who had been selected to play the part of othello with the remark that it was hardly fair to dispose of him at such an early stage of the performance more especially on the first night  but you come on agin an dance said mopsey fretfully why dont you wait till i get through after i kill shiner dickey comes in an we two have a reglar fight an we both run away then shiner jumps up an dances just as long as he can an down comes the curtain in the next act polly comes out an talks a lot of stuff an when he gets through ben comes right up through the floor an scares him awfully an when he runs off ben does a song an dance an that ends that act then nelly sings another song an we all come out fightin an when we get through dickey dances a clog an if that aint show enough for five cents i dont know what is  in fact the partners were of mopseys opinion and since they were all to appear in the last act in a grand fight they would not have complained even though it had been necessary for them all to die in the first scene even if mopsey had not written an original play he had covered himself with glory in this arrangement of shakespeares works and if there had been any doubts as to the success of their enterprise they were dispelled now  of course it was necessary to make some arrangements for costumes and an exciting discussion began at once during which mrs green was called upon to see what she could do towards fitting the party out mopsey proposed that a further assessment of twentyfive cents be made upon each of the company and announced that prosperous as business was just then he had decided to shut up shop the next day in order to give his whole attention to the important work of preparation dickey volunteered to sacrifice his business also in order to aid him and it was believed that with the funds just raised these two could buy and hire weapons enough to arm the entire party  mrs green had several things which it was thought could be used with good effect and all hands went to work making wooden swords in case there should be any trouble in finding the real articles nelly made more tickets so that all who were anxious to witness the performance might at least have one and paul was given charge of the money that had been received thus far for all were anxious to see the entire receipts of that nights performance in one unbroken whole even if it was necessary to advance funds from each individual pocket in order to make the necessary purchases and during the remainder of that evening mopsey rehearsed the different members of the combination separately until he was convinced that they could carry out their respective roles perfectly     chapter ix  the momentous occasion   however successful a venture the opening of a theatre might prove to the five boys interested it was quite evident before that eventful saturday had passed that it would seriously injure their regular business at least half their time that day was spent in answering the questions of intending patrons or those who had already purchased their tickets and of course while they were thus engaged they could not sell papers or blacken boots therefore when they stopped work at five oclock according to agreement so that they would be sure to have time to dress before eight they had not made more than ten cents apiece they did not realize what this loss of time had cost them for nearly all of the tickets had been sold and in contemplating the theatrical receipts those that should have come from the legitimate business were entirely lost sight of there was every prospect that they would have a large audience and when they went to mrs greens they congratulated themselves on having thought of such a brilliant project  that mopsey was a thoughtful manager as well as sparkling author was shown by a notice which the boys found fastened to the streetdoor it read      dores open at harf parst seven  and had evidently been prepared in anticipation of the rush of patrons which it was almost certain would fairly besiege the place before they were ready to receive them  once in the theatre it was seen that dickey and mopsey had not been wasting their time for there was such a collection of castoff uniforms and weapons as would have furnished a much larger company than theirs with outfits the two who had gathered this remarkable collection together were standing over it in conscious pride but mopsey did not give them much opportunity for admiration  now all hands turn to an git dressed he said in a tone of authority well knowing that his command would be willingly obeyed weve got to be sure to be ready an we can eat dinner after were rigged up jest as well as not  as it was only too evident that mopsey would be obliged to superintend the dressing of each boy the party stood waiting for him to designate the one who should receive the first attention  well start on you dickey said mopsey and some of the party thought that while the two had been alone that day master spry had stipulated that he should have the honor of being arrayed first  dickey stepped in front of the busylooking manager his face beaming with delight and his mouth open so wide that his smile seemed almost a grin  among the collection out of which shakespeares characters were to stalk into view were quite a number of mrs greens kitchen utensils and nearly all of the party were puzzled as to what was to be done with them when dickeys toilet explained everything two tin covers that had evidently been taken from the washboilers were fastened on master sprys chest and back and mopsey insisted on lashing them on so strongly lest they should become displaced in the fight that poor dickey found it impossible to hang his arms down by his side but was obliged to hold them straight out very much to his discomfort a tin saucepan somewhat the worse for wear and well blackened was placed on his head for a helmet and in his hands a huge cavalry sabre to throw a dash of color into what would otherwise have been a rather sombrelooking costume mopsey laced a quantity of red tape around each leg which gave him a very striking appearance to say the least  but every rose must have a thorn and dickey soon found out what particular thorn there was in wearing the costume of macbeth in the first place since he could not use his arms sufficiently to bring them around in front of him he was obliged to dispense with a shield for it would have been worse than useless and again when he tried to sit down after he had been admired by his companions he found that the tin covers were so long that they doomed him to stand until the close of the performance he would have liked a rest just then for he was very tired but the exigencies of the case and costume prevented him and he leaned up in the corner looking save about the legs like a turtle in a restaurant window  johnny was the next one who was to be made happy and perhaps uncomfortable by mr dowds idea of costume but his was on an entirely different scale since he was to play the part of othello a pair of blue uniform trousers were first put on and then pinned up since they had originally been intended for a man a broad leather belt was buckled tightly around his waist and in this was placed a carvingknife a pistol with no lock and but part of the barrel and a jackknife an old sack of mrs greens made of red flannel and somewhat soiled was put on as coat and on the shoulders were pinned epaulets made of gilt paper in addition to the weapons contained in his belt johnny had a genuine sword and scabbard fastened to his side and an army musket to carry in his hands that looked as if it might have been used in every battle during the late war  it seemed singular that two should be condemned to stand and through no ones fault but johnny also found it almost impossible to sit down owing to the number of pins mopsey had used to make sure that the trousers would remain at the proper length and he leaned against the wall by the side of dickey  bens costume required very little care since it was simply a sheet thrown over his head but he insisted so strongly that a ghost had just as much right as anybody else to have his legs laced up with red tape and to wear a sword that mopsey was obliged to give way and do as he desired a profusion of tape was tied around his legs and in order to produce a pleasing effect in case his feet could be seen below the sheet he insisted on having quite a number of ends hanging down from the ankles he also had a belt with a carvingknife and a pistol in about the same state of repair that johnnys was stuck into it and then with the sheet over his arm so that he could have it handy he looked on while the others dressed envied by dickey and johnny because he could sit down so comfortably  paul made a very showylooking hamlet to say the least he wore a pair of rubber boots many sizes too large for him with tops that reached his knees and were ornamented with tissuepaper rosettes a black frockcoat which on close inspection proved to be johnnys best one that he had worn when he called upon mrs green hung about his shoulders covering his hands completely with its profusion of sleeves and giving him a singular if not distinguished appearance this coat had been made more gorgeous than it originally was by having gilt paper pasted to each button and a red sash tied about the waist in which were two tableforks and a wooden sword the latter article interfering sadly with his knees when he walked on his head he wore a huge paper cap that had been painted red white and blue and ornamented with a tuft of feathers that had once done service in a dustingbrush he also had a gun and the weight of it was about as much as he could stagger under when he tried to carry it over his shoulder so he dragged it along behind him very much as a person of hamlets melancholy temperament would have been likely to do he also could sit down which was no small comfort  all this costuming had taken some time and mrs green had already called up the staircase that dinner was nearly ready before mopsey had commenced to clothe himself in such garments as he supposed richard the third wore first he put on a thin pair of cotton pants that had once been white but were now a drab and which fitted quite closely to his skin on the outside seams of these he pinned a strip of gilt paper and then drew on a pair of boots the tops of which came up quite as high on him as the rubber ones did on paul around these boots was laced more red tape until it would have been a difficult matter to have formed any idea as to what they might have been intended for originally he had a broad leather belt and outside of it was a red sash with ends that nearly touched the floor as weapons he wore a sword in a scabbard a carvingknife a portion of a pistol and a tablefork his coat was a soldiers overcoat cut down to prevent it from trailing on the floor when he walked and on his head was a paper cap nearly twice as large and with very much more ornamentation in the way of feathers and red paint than had the one worn by paul  the company were now ready for their arduous duties on the stage and could afford the time to go to dinner more than once had mrs green called out to them that that very important meal was ready and should be eaten if they expected her to get the dishes washed in time to act as doorkeeper she had also become imbued with the excitement of this first performance and had packed away her fruitstand fully two hours earlier than usual in order that she might first feed her actorboarders and then look out for their interest at the door  it was a ferocious looking and in at least two cases an uncomfortable feeling company that filed down the stairs and into the diningroom led by dickey who was obliged to enter the door sideways because his arms stuck out so straight as to prevent his moving through any aperture less than five feet wide in any other way  gracious ejaculated the startled landlady as she saw this singularlooking object enter the room followed by four others more or less gorgeous and all equally terrible how on earth did you contrive to make yourselves look so horrible  mopsey did it squeaked dickey piteously as if he had been accused of some wrong deed and earnestly wishing that he was the ghost  hes macbeth said mopsey in explanation and anxious to show that he had only done his duty in thus making dickey so uncomfortable thats pretty near the way macbeth always gits hisself up  poor man said mrs green sympathizingly it must have been terrible hard for him an he couldnt had a great deal of comfort with his arms and then as she looked over her spectacles pityingly at the miniature macbeth and noticed that it was the covers of her washboilers that he wore she said you must be awful careful not to tumble down dickey for you never could get up an besides if anybody should step on you theyd spoil them covers an one of ems most new  dickey made no promise but his face showed plainly that he appreciated the danger he would be in if he should fall over and that he was determined to stand as straight as possible in the combat which would take place in the third act  all of the company save dickey and johnny seated themselves at the table and began to make a hearty but hurried meal johnny stood up in a careful manner and got along very well but poor dickey could neither sit down nor help himself he made one or two vain efforts to pick up a biscuit from the table but his armor would not permit and he was about to lean back against the wall in helpless indignation when mrs green noticed him  poor child she said in a motherly tone i do think it is a shame for mopsey to rig you up in such a way that you cant eat an you do have such a good appetite  he wanted to play macbeth said mopsey anxious to clear himself from any blame an if he plays it hes got to go that way  yes i wanted to play it said dickey in a pathetic tone that told he would never want to do such an uncomfortable thing again i wanted to but i didnt know i was goin to be fixed sos i couldnt even wiggle  mrs green went without her own supper for the sake of giving dickey his and she fed him patiently while he stood with outstretched hands leaning against the wall but able to eat all that was put in his mouth  by the time the boys were through supper nelly came into the room dressed for her portion of the work in the evenings performance and even mopsey who the day before had suggested that she should wear a sword thought she looked charming in her white dress with blue ribbons  it was very near the time set for opening the doors and already they could hear a crowd of boys on the sidewalk as they jostled and pushed in their efforts to enter before the managers were ready to receive them mopsey excited at this clamor of the public drove his company upstairs and hurried mrs green to such an extent that she concluded to let her housework go until after the performance and went down to open the door     chapter x  the first act   the noble company of actors stood in breathless expectancy behind the scenes of their theatre waiting for the sound of tramping feet that should tell of the rush of the public to witness their genius as shown in this particular line of business the interest was so great that even dickey forgot the discomfort of his macbeth costume and stood as near a crevice in the boards as possible to see their patrons as they filed into the hall  the auditorium was as near a scene of enchantment as tallowcandles could make it the twelve bottle footlights flared and flickered as if they were conscious of the wonderful display of talent they were there to illumine while the barrelhoop chandeliers cast even a more brilliant light than one would have supposed the flower decorations on the wall forming the word that meant quite as much as if it had been spelled correctly stood forth in all their beauty even more prominently than if the light had been stronger  that mrs green had never acted in the capacity of doorkeeper of a theatre before was shown by the trouble she was having it had been her purpose to open the streetdoor and then go in advance of the crowd to the door of the hall where she could receive either the money or the tickets of those who entered but one look at the noisy throng was sufficient to convince her that more than half of them would distance her in the race upstairs she therefore changed her plan and by exerting all her strength she was able to keep the door closed so far as to prevent more than one from entering at a time by this means she succeeded in collecting tickets from nearly all who entered as soon as she thought she could do so with safety she ran up to the atticdoor where she could act the part of doorkeeper with more comfort and dignity  at least fifteen minutes before the advertised time for the performance to begin every one of dickeys boardseats were filled with a noisy perspiring crowd of boys who found considerable amusement in swaying back and forth on the not very secure seats until one of them would go down with a crash this seemed to afford the greatest amount of amusement to those who were thus thrown to the floor  good mrs green was thoroughly astonished by the amount of patronage bestowed that night for after she thought that the audience was complete boys of all sizes continued to pour in until she had quite a pile of fivecent pieces in her apron besides the tickets and nearly onehalf of those present were obliged to stand  although it was not eight oclock the audience suddenly came to the conclusion that it was time for the performance to begin and they announced that fact by piercing whistles furious stamping of the feet and such gentle admonitions to the managers as hurry up mopsey give it to us now shiner as well as other phrases betokening extreme familiarity  the managers of this theatre were not unmindful of the fact that their audience must be obeyed even if some of the rules were broken and ben and paul were ordered by the author who had taken upon himself the position of sole manager to raise the curtain then nelly came out and sang a melody that all were familiar with being assisted by the audience in the chorus until mrs green was obliged to cover her ears with her hands lest the great volume of music should give her a headache  this portion of the entertainment was greeted with the wildest applause and when master dowd after nelly had left the stage attempted to appear in all the gorgeousness of his costume he was plainly told to go back and let nelly sing againa command which he obeyed at once lest some of his audience should take it into their heads to force compliance  after nelly had sung the second time the applause died away as if the audience were willing that the regular business of the evening should proceed all the actors were standing where they could go on to the stage at a moments notice save dickey who was leaning against the wall holding his sword straight out at the imminent peril of hitting some one of his partners as they passed  now be all ready dickey said mopsey warningly as he prepared to go on the stage  see here whispered johnny be kinder careful when you an i fight cause theres lots of pins in these pants  mopsey nodded his head as much as to say that he would look out for such things and in another instant he was before the footlights receiving a storm of applause although he was at a loss to know whether it was directed to him personally or to the costume he wore so great was the enthusiasm manifested by his presence that it was some moments before he could speak and during that time the few lines he knew of the part of richard the third had entirely escaped his memory it was a trying moment both to him and his brother actors who were watching him as he stood there with drawn sword first on one foot and then on the other waving his hand and then the weapon as if he were about to speak and yet making no sound  go on mopseysay something whispered ben in a hoarse voice and the audience hearing him suggested kindly  yes give us somethin old man  thus urged mopsey made one mighty effort and shouted in his loudest tones as he waved the sword still more frantically than ever  ive lost my hoss ive lost my hoss an i want some one to tie up my headbutbutbut im a match for any feller round here andand  it was not only evident to the audience but to mopsey himself that it was of no use for him to try to remember the words he should have spoken and he waved his sword frantically for johnny to come on hoping to save his good name by the bloody combat which could be prolonged until their patrons were in goodhumor but just at this moment it was impossible for johnny to be of any service he had tried to alter the position of some of the pins in his trousers so that they would not prick him so badly and the consequence was that the entire work was undone while one leg fell down over his foot in a manner that prevented him from stepping unless at the risk of tumbling flat on his face ben did his best to repair the damage while mopsey stood waving his sword whispering very audibly for johnny not to mind the pins but to come on meantime the audience in the loudest tones coaxed johnny to come out and take mopsey away  but ben succeeded finally in getting the illcostumed othello arranged so that it was possible for him to walk and he rushed on to the stage the gun in one hand and the sword in the other just as mopsey was meditating a retreat from the freelyexpressed criticism of his audience  the relief of the authoractor when he saw othello was greater than could be expressed by words and he resolved to regain the good opinion of the audience by the ferocity with which he would wage the combat it is probable that some such thought was expressed in his face when he rushed towards johnny for startled by the furious bearing of his partner othello became frightened and holding both weapons in front of him he looked ready for instant flight it seemed as if this very timidity restored to the prototype of the cruel richard all his assurance for now suddenly remembering the words he should have spoken at johnnys first appearance he waved his sword still more furiously and shouted  it looks as if there was more than a dozen of this same feller for ive killed four or five already an heres a lot more of him  illustration holding both weapons in front of him he looked ready for instant flight  johnny was a trifle alarmed at the words and looked almost timidly behind him to see if he was really there in several forms or if it was only a portion of the play when mopsey struck his gun so severe a blow with the edge of his sword that it fell from his not overstrong grasp striking directly on the toes of the bloodthirsty richard  there was a howl of pain as mopsey dropped his sword with a clang and appeared trying to gather his feet into his arms where he could nurse them while this shock of weapons on the frail stage caused such a motion of the footlights that two of them fell to the floor smashing the bottles the audience in the reserved seats anxious to prevent any disturbance of the performance scrambled for the candles and the two who succeeded in getting them before they were extinguished kindly held them in their hands during the remainder of the scene  dont you know enough to fight when the time comes cried mopsey who having given up the useless task of nursing his bruised feet picked up his sword again and advanced once more upon the timid othello who was trying to decide whether he should remain there or run away  these words had the effect of spurring johnny on to a more perfect acting of his part more especially since some of his friends in the audience cried out in a friendly way go for him shiner an give him fits  then johnny did go for his adversary almost too strongly for he refused to die as mopsey had told him he must but continued to strike out wildly with his sword hitting mopseys weapon a portion of the time and when he failed in that coming so near richards face that it seemed certain he would slice off one of his ears or his nose  it was a furious combat truly and the audience favored it with the most generous applause some inciting mopsey and others johnny to renewed exertions until mrs green started up in alarm fearing that a riot would ensue  why dont you die whispered mopsey hoarsely as he panted from exertion and believed that in justice to the other performers the battle should end  but johnny refused positively to die and it is probable that he would have continued the fight as long as he had strength or breath left had he not been the victim of his own architectural shortcomings he the one who had built the stage actually forgot the pitfalls in the form of spaces left uncovered because of lack of lumber and in the excitement and fury of the battle minding only the shouts of encouragement from the audience he fell into one of these yawning pits and richard had a chance to become himself once more with head down and heels up the unfortunate othello struggled in the prisoning space until every one of the bottle footlights had been displaced and an even dozen of the audience seated themselves on the floor holding the candles in their hands obligingly ben had taken dickey from his leaningplace against the wall and brought him to the side from which he was to make his entrance when richard and othello had first begun to fight so that when johnny fell he rushed on in a sidelong way in order to present his swordarm to the conqueror  king richard was so entirely exhausted from his long struggle that he had apparently forgotten the course he had marked out for the rest of his company and was leaning on his sword gazing at the supposedtobedead othello wondering whether he ought to help him to rise or not when ben launched dickey full at him he had no time to parry the shock nor macbeth to check the force with which ben had sent him and the consequence was that richard and macbeth fell almost directly on top of the struggling othello with a thud that threatened to rend asunder each particular board of the frail stage  mrs green uttered a cry of horror as she realized that the cover of her new washboiler must have been injured but that noise as well as the terrified squeak from othello was drowned in the burst of applause that came from the spectators mopsey sprang to his feet as quickly as possible bowing his acknowledgments to the audience as if he had planned the scene while poor dickey lay prone upon the almost suffocated johnny unable to rise or even to move so that othello might extricate himself  as the audience continued to applaud mopsey felt that he was forced to remain before them bowing and almost expecting to be deluged with bouquets and of course he was not aware that two members of his company needed his immediate assistance  help dickey why dont you help dickey whispered ben from the wings thinking that it would not be seemly in the ghost of hamlets father to rush on to the stage before his time but king richard paid no attention to this call if indeed he heard it and after waiting some moments ben with his ghostly covering still flung over his arm was obliged to go to the assistance of the two warriors thereby causing a fresh burst of applause he rolled dickey over and over until paul could drag him off by the shoulders and then pulling johnny out by the feet he aided him in repairing the damages done to his costume by his descent through the stage  it was now time that the dead othello should do his song and dance and in a very audible whisper he informed mopsey that he had better get off and give him the chance some of the audience suggested the same thing and very reluctantly mopsey left the stage while johnny concluded the act in a highly successful manner by a dance that was considerably better executed than was his swordplay     chapter xi  the evenings entertainment   surely if noise was any proof that the audience was satisfied with the performance given by mopseys company then all must have been highly delighted for such confusion was probably never heard in that house before as when the curtain fell on the first act of this new edition of shakespeares plays the actors were in a perfect whirl of delight and all save dickey showed it by dancing and shaking hands until there was almost as much confusion behind the curtain as in front  mopsey was so delighted at the success that his gigantic brain conceived a startling idea for the entrance of the ghost which was neither more nor less than for ben to crouch under the stage in the very hole where johnny had come to grief and at the proper time to rise up in a ghostly fashion which must surely be very effective ben was disposed to object to this hiding under the flooring more especially since he would be enveloped in the sheet and would doubtless be uncomfortably warm but all his objections were overruled by the author and company and he gave a very unwilling assent to the proposition  in order that the audience might not be kept waiting until their patience was exhausted or their goodhumor began to evaporate the curtain was raised as soon as the ghost could be tucked away in his hidingplace and paul made his first appearance on any stage mopsey had explained to him the part which he was to assume and in a wellthumbed copy of shakespeares works belonging to mrs green he had found the lines which hamlet is supposed to speak after he sees the ghost these he had committed to memory although he had little idea of the meaning of them and when he came upon the stage he addressed the audience as if in them he saw the ghost of his murdered father  now ben had seen the play of hamlet several times and he knew enough about it to know that the speech paul was delivering should be addressed to him in his anxiety to have the scene played properly he marred the effect of his own entrance somewhat by popping his head out of the hole and whispering hoarsely  turn round this way polly turn round to me  paul heard the advice and he turned his back to the audience ben seeing that his suggestion had been carried out ducked his head again very much to hamlets perplexity  mopsey had stated particularly that as soon as he saw the ghost he must run away in alarm and yet ben would persist in keeping out of sight even though he had attracted his attention  paul repeated all of the speech he had committed to memory and then waited for the ghostly visitant ben who had not anticipated that there was so much speaking in hamlets part was rather confused and did not know whether it was time for him to come out and strike terror to the heart of his supposed son or not  he popped out his head two or three times but paul was not standing in such a position as he fancied would be best suited for the reception of a ghost and he went back again out of sight delighting the audience with his agility and confusing hamlet  paul knew that it was not the proper thing for him to stand there silent and fearing lest he might not have said enough he began to repeat the same speech over again  ben realized that it was but a repetition that doomed him still to remain in hiding and believing it to be a mistake on pauls part he whispered loudly  youve said that before say something else  paul was perfectly well aware that he had repeated those words before and he was doing so for the very good reason that he did not know what else to say but the ghosts command confused him and he stood silent and motionless resolved to remain quiet rather than make a mistake  by this time mopsey had discovered that there was something the matter with the two actors who were supposed to be delighting the audience and he found that it was the ghost who was delaying the progress of the play  come out of there ben he whispered loudly and some of the audience hearing him they called in pleasant tones  yes come out ben and show yourself  thus urged the ghost could do no less than make his appearance and he arose from his place of partial concealment as majestically as he could considering the fact that the sheet had been caught upon a nail and he was obliged to stoop two or three times to unfasten it but he did succeed in rising at last and then to make himself look as much like a spectre as possible he held both arms straight out as he walked slowly down the stage  it is very likely that he would have made a good impression if it had not been for that portion of his costume that did not properly belong to the character he was assuming the long ends of tape that he had insisted on allowing to hang down from his ankles persisted in getting under his feet and he tripped himself up with a force that gave hamlet a genuine fright the sheet which covered bens head prevented him from rising as quickly as he would have liked and while he was trying to disengage himself from it paul realizing that he should run away did so by leaping over the prostrate ghost to the great delight of the patrons  the shock of bens fall and pauls leap so shook the frail structure which johnny had built that the curtain came down with a thud tearing away from its fastenings above and the poor ghost was made doubly a prisoner by this additional covering  dont tear it ben shouted johnny fearing lest his artistic labors in the way of the wild indian would be ruined and then he and mopsey sprang on the stage rescuing the curtain from the frantic clutch of the ghost and leaving that worthy to get to his feet as best he might  of course the audience enjoyed all this highly and while they hooted and shrieked in the excess of their delight ben succeeded in escaping from the rather awkward mantle  i can dance if i dont do the ghost very well he shouted almost angrily to the noisy audience and then he began to prove the truth of his words with a force that threatened the immediate destruction of the entire theatrical surroundings  and the audience seemed to realize that ben could dance for they insisted on his continuing that portion of his duties until he was bathed in perspiration and so tired that he could hardly move  of course now that the curtain had been wrecked there was no opportunity for dividing the acts and after the applause which bens efforts had produced died away mopsey sent nelly on to sing again the audience greeted her kindly as before and not only insisted on joining in the chorus but demanded more than she had intended to give they were evidently determined to get the full value of their money and suspecting that she would appear no more that evening dictated to her such songs as they wanted to hear  it was of no use for her to refuse for they insisted upon their demands being complied with so noisily that the performance could not proceed until they were ready she stood there singing until she was hoarse while the entire company waited in battlearray for the time to come when they should make their last appearance in the great combat  it was nearly half an hour before nelly was allowed to go and as soon as she was clear of the stage the waiting forces rushed on displaying the most wonderful skill with their swords  it would not be exactly correct to say that all of the company rushed on for dickey made his appearance very carefully of course he was obliged to come sideways and he moved with great caution lest he should fall down again thus working more damage to the covers of mrs greens washboilers but he got on with the others even if he was slower in his movements and soon was in the very midst of the mimic battle apparently the most wounded one there judging from the blows that were rained upon his armor  the combatants had soon found out that their stage was hardly large enough for the movements of an army of five with such long swords and that the greatest caution must be used to prevent serious injury to some of them therefore when mopsey hit a resounding blow on the frontpiece of dickeys armor with the back of his sword all saw that the din of battle could be represented in that way much better and with less danger than by clashing their swords together  and thus it happened that poor dickey found himself in the midst of a bloodthirsty crowd each one pounding him on the chest or back while he was unable to parry the attack save when some one incautiously moved towards his swordarm he cried for mercy at the full force of his lungs while mrs green shouted the same request because of her tinware the audience were equally divided in opinion as to whether macbeth had been punished enough and still the blows were delivered with such force and noise that one would have thought an army of tinsmiths were at work  how long this unequal combat might have gone on it is impossible to say for when dickey found that he was likely to have no mercy shown him so long as the audience was so well pleased he dropped to his knees and then tried to roll off the stage of course he could roll over no more easily than a turtle but he had stopped the supposed sanguinary fight and he was satisfied having no one on whom they could wreak their vengeance without considerable danger to themselves the combatants dispersed and not until then did mopsey remember that the very one whom they had been using so roughly was the one upon whom they depended to close the performance  when the selfelected manager thought of this he called to ben to help him set the vanquished macbeth on his feet and to get him in dancing condition it was quite an easy matter to get the tinencased hero on his feet but quite another matter to bolster him up so that he could dance dickey was wearied with long standing sore from the effects of the pounding and so thoroughly cured of his desire to wear an armor that all he thought of or wanted was to get where he could take off the trappings of war and become a humble bootblacking citizen once more in fact he utterly refused to dance which would really have been an impossibility unless he had been relieved from the embarrassment of the boiler covers and ben and johnny went on in a double clog to give a proper finish to the performance  illustration dickey found himself in the midst of a bloodthirsty crowd  inasmuch as there was no curtain it was found necessary for mopsey to go forward and announce that the evenings entertainment was finishedan announcement which the audience was not inclined to accept as a fact they utterly refused to leave their seats and it was not until nelly had appeared and sung three more songs that they left the theatre then although they drew some comparisons between that theatre and others which they had attended which were certainly not very favorable to mopsey they departed apparently very well satisfied that they had received the full worth of their money  the entertainment had lasted fully two hours and every one of the performers but more especially dickey was greatly pleased when the last one of the audience passed out of the door it would be stating it all too mildly to say that mrs green was relieved when they had gone the good woman had been in a deplorable condition of fear since the time the first hearty applause was raised and she had been seriously afraid that they would go through the floor of her attic in some of their more vigorous manifestations of pleasure  before the last one of their patrons had left the hall dickey had asked paul to help him cast aside the uncomfortable costume of macbeth when that was done master spry stated most emphatically that if he ever acted again it would be in some part where the use of armor was entirely forbidden  as a matter of course the first thing the partners were anxious about after their patrons had departed was to know how large their profits were from that evenings excessive labor without waiting to change their costumes save as has been related in the case of dickey they gathered around mrs green who was beginning to recover some of the senses that had been frightened from her she and paul counted the money she had in her apron and the amount was found to be three dollars and five cents there was already in treasurer pauls hands eight dollars and sixty cents and when it was announced that the evenings performance had netted them the very handsome amount of eleven dollars and sixtyfive cents the joy of the partners showed itself in many extravagant ways  ben proposed and the boys agreed to it willingly that one dollar of that amount be paid to mrs green for the use of the attic this being so much more than she had expected caused her to look upon the theatrical enterprise as a gigantic success  then quite a discussion arose as to what should be done with the funds on hand mopsey was in favor of making an immediate division but such a plan was thought by the others to be most unwise dickey proposed that a certain sum be set aside as working capital and the balance divided among them all including nelly of course since she had contributed in no slight degree to the success of the entertainment  this appeared satisfactory to the majority of the party and would probably have been done if ben who had taken no part in the discussion but appeared to be thinking deeply of something had not said  ive got a plan that i reckon youll all agree to but i dont want to tell what it is yet awhile now i say lets let paul keep it till monday night it wont spoil if we dont divide it till then  since there was no good reason why this request should not be granted and since ben seemed so anxious to have it left that way the rest of the partners agreed quite willingly then the tired company of actors crept off to bed proud in the belief that their venture had been a success but anxious to rest     chapter xii  a generous act   on monday morning before they parted and while dickey was still their guest ben was very mysterious in his actions he avoided paul so much that one would have said he suspected the treasurer of having embezzled some of the funds of the concern  but if any one knowing him had suspected that such was the case that supposition would have been rejected as soon as a full view had been had of his face he appeared to be in the most perfect goodhumor but considerably excited before he left the house he had succeeded in whispering these same words to mopsey dickey and johnny without having been overheard by paul  meet me at nellys stand bout leven oclock an dont let polly know anything about it  the only one of that party who had not been in the best of spirits during the sabbath when mrs green had exacted a due observance of the day by her boarders was paul and he had been very sad it was the second sunday that had passed since he had been so unfortunately separated from his parents and his distress of mind seemed to have increased instead of being soothed by time in fact as the days passed on and he still found himself very far from accomplishing his purpose he began to despair of ever succeeding  as successful as they had been with their theatrical enterprise the proceeds were not as large as he had expected and when he figured out the amount which was each ones share he realized that it would be very long before he could get from that source money enough to buy his ticket home  a few days previous to the giving of the entertainment he had asked at one of the numerous ticketoffices on broadway how much they would sell him a ticket for and had been told that he could go for half fare which would be fourteen dollarsa sum of money which seemed almost a fortune to him during that day ben had talked with him about his chances of getting home what he would do when he got there and many questions about his relatives all of which paul had answered readily although it added to his distress to speak of such matters  when monday came and the boys started out to attend to their business duties paul noticed that there was an evident anxiety on the part of all his companions to avoid him this pained him more than he would have been willing to admit and it was with a heavy heart that he went about his work wondering what he had done to cause any change in their feelings towards him  as all of that theatrical company had expected they heard many criticisms on the performance they had given and it seemed as though all of their patrons bestowed more time on giving them advice for future guidance than on their regular business some advised that saturday evening performances be given each week assuring the firm of their support during the entire season others were so unkind as to advise that a small theatre be built for mopsey where he could take all the parts himself and very many had suggestions to give dickey as to the kind of armor he should wear the next time he played the part of macbeth  some of this advice dickey received in a kindly spirit assuring his friends of his determination never to play a part again that required any such uncomfortable costume but to others he displayed considerable illfeeling and was so unwise as to be angry when he should have remembered that as the publics servant in the capacity of an actor he was obliged to hear their criticisms but the partners were made happy by knowing that in the majority of individual cases they heard of their performance had given satisfaction and that if they could only get a new play since they had exhausted all of shakespeares in one evening they might feel assured of considerable patronage again  having been told of this at an early hour in the morning mopsey set about the task of writing or thinking of another play immediately and it was said by those who watched him closely that he drove away at least four customers that forenoon by his seeming discourtesy while he was trying to decide how a new play could be arranged  at eleven oclock agreeably to the appointment made by ben all the partners except paul met at mrs greens fruitstand wondering not a little as to why they had been summoned ben was there almost bursting with importance and when he found that all including mrs green and nelly were ready to listen to him he said as if he were again on the stage  ive got a big plan an i hope youll all think jest the same about it that i do you know how bad polly feels cause he cant git back to his folks for you see how he moped round yesterday when we was all feelin so good now i jest come from a place where they sell railroad tickets an i found out that a little feller like him can get to chicager for fourteen dollars  it wont be long before he gets that much if nothin happens to the theatre said mopsey much as if he had been speaking of a goldmine  not long echoed ben almost contemptuously itll take him longer than you think for if he depends on that i asked him yesterday to figger up an see how much every one would have after payin mother green an he made it a dollarn seventy cents now thats a healthy pile ter go to chicager on aint it  well how can he fix it any other way asked dickey in considerable surprise not understanding what ben was trying to get at  ill tell you how we can we can all turn to mother green an all an give him the whole of the money then he wont have to git only a little over two dollars to fix him right an i reckon me an johnny can fix him out on that  the partners looked at each other in surprise as this startling proposition of bens was understood by them for some moments no one spoke and then dickey said as if his mind was made up so firmly that it would be impossible for any one to try to change it  he can have my share an ill gree to put in enough more to make up as much as hes got to have jest as soon as i kin earn it  good for you dickey said nelly admiringly knowing that the ruined merchants offer meant a great deal coming at a time when he was almost penniless mother an ill put in our share wont we mother  indeed we will replied mrs green and before she could say any more johnny spoke up  of course im in for anything ben is cause hes my partner an im mighty glad he thought of such a thing  mopsey was the only one who appeared to be at all averse to the generous deed and there seemed to be a great struggle going on in his mind when he should have been the first to agree to it since he had more money than all the others save mrs green  shame on you mopsey for not speaking right up and saying that youll do as much as the others will cried nelly in great excitement lest one of the party should frustrate the others in their good work  why dont you give a feller a chance to say what hell do replied mopsey angry with himself for having hesitated at such a time im willin to come in with the rest only i want to think it over first  then youll agree to it will you asked ben anxious for the success of his plan  of course i will didnt i say so asked the peanut merchant sulkily  then its all right said ben joyfully an now lets get what money hes got of ours in some way sos he wont know what we want it for an add enough to it sos to buy the ticket an give it to him tonight  the others with the possible exception of mopsey were eager to complete the good work at once and mrs green was called upon to tell them how much money was needed and how much each person would be obliged to give she was not an adept in the art of arithmetic but after some little time during which a good many figures were made she informed them that the total amount needed was two dollars and thirtyfive cents and that as there were six of them including herself and nelly each one would be obliged to give a fraction over thirtynine cents  ben responded at once with forty cents although he then had but ten cents left and in a few moments the entire sum was contributed it was only necessary to get the money which paul had and the ticket could be purchased  it was decided that since ben had formed the plan he should carry it outa task which he was perfectly willing to perform and after promising to let his partners know as soon as he had succeeded he started off happy at the thought of being able to give paul so much pleasure when he met the boy whom he was eager to make happy once more he had not been able to form any plan for getting the theatrical funds from him without running the risk of raising his suspicions but since there was no other course which he could pursue he said as innocently as possible  ive been talkin with the other fellers paul an i want you to let me have the money that come from the theatre were thinkin of doin somethin with it an when you come home tonight well tell you what it is  paul had been thinking so much of his home and of his parents whom he feared he should not see again that he could have had no idea of bens purpose even though he had spoken more plainly and he handed him the money without a word  during the remainder of that day paul was considerably mystified at the singular behavior of his friends they indulged in the most wonderful winks and nods to one another whenever they were where he was and something which ben showed them from time to time seemed to please them immensely whenever he asked the reason for their unusual goodhumor and apparent secrecy about something he was told that he should know at dinnertime but not before  without having the slightest suspicion as to what his friends had done for him paul was so excited by the evident secret which was being kept from him that he was very impatient for the time to come when he could know what it was  never before had the boys seemed so anxious to be with him as they were during that afternoon and he quite forgot their seeming coolness of the morning one or all of themexcepting mopsey of course who was obliged to remain at his stand in the absence of the boy who sometimes acted as clerk for himkept near paul all the day and when it was time to go to dinner it seemed as if they were escorting him home  once or twice while they were eating dinner some one of the party had said now ben now but ben had shaken his head significantly and continued eating as if he had no other duty before him  when the meal was finished instead of getting up from the table as they were in the habit of doing each one of mrs greens boarders as well as herself and nelly remained at the table as if waiting for something and paul looked at them in the greatest surprise  mister weston said ben gravely as he pushed his plate farther on the table and arose from his seat as if he had a long speech to deliver us fellers have seen that you wasnt feelin very nice at havin to stay with us an we kinder thought you wanted to leave us cause things didnt go to suit you  as he paused for a moment paul who had been in a perfect maze of wonder at this preface to the speech said quickly  im sure things go to please me as much as you can make them but you mustnt feel angry if i dont want to stay cause you know just how it happened that i came here an when i think of my father an mother an my sister i canthelpfeeling  illustration mister weston said ben gravely  here paul burst into a flood of tears at the thought that his companions were reproving him for grieving for those whom he loved so dearly and whom he feared he might never meet again ben hesitated at this grief of his friend and for a moment it seemed as if he could not continue until he had tried to console him but like one who has a duty to perform and must do it as quickly as possible he continued  we aint layin anything up agin you cause you dont want to stay round here for we dont blame you seeing how youve got a good home to go to an if we had one we should tear round worsen you do but all the same weve seen how you felt about it an weve come to the clusion that youd better not stay here any longer  paul looked up in fear and surprise for it certainly seemed as if he was being turned away  no continued ben in a loud voice growing more emphatic the nearer he approached the conclusion of his speechweve made up our minds that youve got to go an dickey heres all ready to take your place as one of the boarders we give a pretty good show saturday night an we got so much money out of it that weve bought this for you sos you can go home  ben handed paul the ticket which he had opened to full length as he ceased speaking and it was some moments before the surprised boy could understand it all but when he realized that now he could go to his friends if not to his parents his joy was more than he could control and from its very excess came the tears in an irresistible torrent     chapter xiii  a joyful meeting   it is highly probable that one might have searched over new york city that night and not found a happier household than that of mrs greens paul was so wonderfully happy in the thought that he was going back to chicago where even though he could not see his parents he should find relatives and friends that he could talk of little else even the theatre was forgotten by him for when mopsey spoke of the necessity of getting another boy to take his place in the dramatic company he hardly gave the matter a thought except to say that he hoped they would make plenty of money out of it and pauls partners were happy more happy than they could possibly have been by any other outlay of their money pauls pleasure reflected on them to such a degree that they became almost as much excited as he was before the evening was over  good mrs green alternately laughed and cried until she seemed to realize that such nervousness was not exactly suitable to the occasion and then she busied herself by reading one of the papers ben had brought home  master treat had spent so much time on the good work he had carried through so successfully and then had paid so much more attention to the boy he was going to surprise than to the sale of his goods that instead of helping johnny as had been his purpose when he took some of his papers to sell he was a drawback and the consequence was that mrs green had three evening papers to read while messrs jones and treat had been stuck just that number  after she had joined in the general good time over pauls goodfortune with her daughter and her boarders and found that she was marring rather than adding to it by her nervousness she ceased to pay any more attention to what was said by those about her but became interested in the advertisements of fruit for sale suddenly she came across something that seemed to surprise her greatly for she took off her glasses and wiped them as though she mistrusted that which she saw was on the glass and not in the paper  after satisfying herself that she was not the victim of an optical delusion her face was a remarkable sight exhibiting as it did surprise and delight alternately it appeared as if it was difficult for her to speak for she tried several times before she succeeded in saying  listen to me every one of you an if i aint mistaken paul will be more glad to hear this than he was to get his ticket this is what it says in this paper word for word paul westonthats in big letters any one who can give information of paul weston who strayed from an outwardbound steamer on the afternoon of the seventeenth will receive a handsome reward by calling on the undersigned said boy is ten years old has light hair blue eyes nose slightly turned up and at the time of his disappearance was dressed in dark blue clothes he would most likely be trying to make his way to chicago and any one who has seen such a boy will please communicate at once with rufus weston fifth avenue hotel there what do you think of that and mrs green looked around at her circle of listeners who appeared to have been stricken dumb with astonishment  why that means me exclaimed paul suddenly as if he had thought some one else was spoken of and rufus weston thats my father he didnt go away after all and now somebody tell me where that hotel is  as he spoke he had grasped his coat and hat running from the house at full speed before he even knew which direction he should take there were none of that party who had a very clear idea of what they were saying or doing just then but as the most important thing in their minds was to see this father of pauls who had come at a time when his son was about to go home without his assistance each one of the boys started out in the same rapid way overtaking their more excited companion just as he was stopping to consider which direction he should take  this way polly shouted ben waving his hand and started along as if he were going to a fire  no one thought of walking for it seemed as if every moment was precious then and that they might not find him if they were two or three minutes late on they ran at full speed and when they stood in a row before the clerk of the fifth avenue hotel they were so breathless that they could not speak distinctly  pollys come to see his father said ben after they had stood there so long that the clerk was about to order one of the porters to turn this quite dirty and very ragged crowd who appeared to have come there simply to look at him outofdoors  who is his father asked the man hardly believing that any guest in that hotel would claim a son from that rather disreputablelooking party for paul looked almost as dirty and ragged as the others did  his names rufus weston said paul speaking in a low voice because of the tears that would persist in coming into his eyes so much afraid was he that his father was no longer there  illustration they stood in a row before the clerk of the fifth avenue hotel  almost every one in the hotel knew mr westons story and no sooner did he hear the name than the clerk calling one of the servants ordered him to show this oddlooking party to mr westons room paul almost ran ahead of the man in his eagerness to see his father while the others were inclined to remain quite a distance in the rear awed by the elegant things they saw around them and not quite certain as to whether they ought to follow their friend when finally the man stopped before one of the doors knocked and paul rushed into the room the boys heard a scream of delight and then they were shut out as if their companion had forgotten them entirely  ranged close to the wall opposite the door which paul had entered wondering whether they ought to go or stay four boys stood in bewilderment hardly daring to speak porters servants and guests passed them with looks of wonder at the motionless line who appeared to be trying to make themselves as small as possible so that they should be in no ones way and each time they were favored with a look of scrutiny or surprise they fancied that they were to be ordered to leave the house at once  i guess wed better go whispered dickey after one of the porters had looked at them unusually hard  yes replied mopsey in an injured tone hes got all he can out of us an we shant see him agin  now dont you go to tryin to be a fool mopsey dowd said ben indignantly polly aint the kind of a feller to forget his chums an im going to stay here till he comes out if it aint till mornin sposen you had a father that had got lost an youd jest found him wouldnt it be quite a while afore youd think of such a lot of duffers as we be  mopsey was silent but not convinced he shook his head in a knowing way as if to say that his companions would soon see that he had spoken the truth and then he tried to push himself farther into the wall in order to occupy less space in the hall for fully ten minutes the boys stood there first on one foot and then on the other like motherless chickens in a rainstorm and then the turning of the handle of the door caused them to straighten up into what they intended should be careless attitudes which should say that they had intended to go right away but had been delayed by the discussion of some important question it was paul who came out of the room and if the boys had had any doubts as to whether they had done right in staying they were convinced now for their companion looked around as if he were absolutely certain they would be there  father wants to see you come in he said holding the door open for them to enter  but they were not disposed to accept the invitation they had waited to see paul not his father and they had an idea that they should not feel exactly at their ease in there  come in insisted paul theres no one here but father and he wants to see all of you  mopsey was the first to enter he had settled it in his mind that they ought to be invited to see mr weston and he considered it his right to go in because of the money he had contributed towards pauls ticket to chicago the others followed him but did not appear as confident as he did whatever extravagant idea mopsey may have had as to the way in which they ought to be received by mr weston he was not disappointed pauls father welcomed them in the most cordial manner possible and had they been his most intimate and esteemed friends they could not have been received more kindly  paul had given his father a brief account of his life since the time he learned that the steamer had sailed without him and he had spoken in the warmest terms of the boys who had befriended him when he was in such bitter trouble after the boys had entered the room mr weston explained why it was that he was still in new york city when it seemed almost certain that he had sailed for europe  in a very few moments after the steamer had started from the pier mrs weston had asked him to send paul to their cabin she needing his service in some trifling matter and when mr weston looked around for his son of course he could not be found a hasty and vain search was made and then the boy whom paul had left behind to acquaint his father of the important business of buying tops that had called him away told the story which he would probably have told before had he known which one of the many passengers his newlymade friends father was leaving his wife and daughter to continue the journey alone mr weston had come back with the pilot and from that day until then he had searched for his son never once thinking that almost any newsboy in the vicinity of city hall could have given him full particulars  paul had told him of the generosity which his friends had shown in devoting all the theatrical funds and nearly all of the money they had individually to the purchase of the ticket to chicago and after he had told them how it was that he had remained in the city he said as he took the ticket paul was holding in his hand to give back to his friends  i shall keep this ticket boys even though paul will not need it for we shall sail for europe in the next steamer i want it as a reminder of generosity and nobility as shown by four boys who could not have been censured if they had let the lost boy work his own way back to his home i shall have it framed with your names written on it and when any one asks the meaning of it i shall tell them that it was bought for my son by four noble boys of new york  bens eyes fairly sparkled with delight as mr weston bestowed this praise and mopsey drew himself up at full height as if the idea of doing the charitable deed had originated with him instead of his having been opposed to it  now boys continued mr weston i shall try to do something towards repaying you for your kindness to paul but then i have another matter to settle with you i advertised that i would give a reward to any one who should bring me information of my son you have done that by bringing the boy himself and are therefore entitled to the sum i should have paid any one else  as he spoke he handed some money to paul and he in turn handed it to ben who said as he took it rather unwillingly  we dont want any pay for comin here with polly an besides it warnt very far so we wont say nothin bout it  all we shall say about it my boy is that you will keep that money in order that i may keep my word tomorrow we will see what can be done to reward you for your kindness to paul and he and i will call at your house some time in the evening where i hope you will all wait for us  ben concluded from this that mr weston wanted to be alone with his son and he said as he went towards the door  well keep the money though it dont seem jest right it kinder looks as though we was takin what didnt belong to us an the only way i know of to get square on it is for us to give a show all for you alone an let you come in for nothin  mr weston seemed highly pleased at the novel idea and he told them as he shook their hands in parting that he would be obliged to give the matter some considerable attention before he could accept any such generous offer but that they could talk the matter over the following evening paul bade them goodnight with the assurance that he would see them the next day and the boys marched out of the hotel saying not a word but looking as if they believed they had grown considerably in importance during their call  once in the street mopsey stopped under the nearest gaslight and asked ben to see how much money mr weston had given them ben unfolded the bills which he held crumpled up in his hand and the surprise of all four may be imagined when he unrolled five twentydollar notes  jinks squeaked dickey with delight after he had turned four consecutive handsprings to quiet himself down a little thats a hundred dollars an if we dont swell round with that itll be cause we dont know how to put on style  then quite as fast as they had left mrs greens they ran back to relate the startling news and surprise their landlady and her daughter with the treasure that had come because of their generous act     chapter xiv  a days pleasuring   as may be supposed pauls goodfortune in finding his father was the topic of conversation during the forenoon following that happy event and there was even more excitement regarding it in the newsselling world than there had been when the fact was first circulated that ben and johnny had embarked in a theatrical enterprise  of course the goodfortune that had come to the firm through paul was known as soon as the other and whenever one of the partners passed a group of merchants in his same line of business he was sure to be pointed out as one of the boys who were the happy possessors of a clear hundred dollars  as it was quite likely that paul and his father would come down town during the day no one of the merchants knowing of the facts went very far from the city hall lest they should miss the chance of seeing him there was a great deal of pride manifested because they had had a rich mans son among their number even though it had only been for a few days and those who had tried to drive him away during the first of his attempts to sell papers now tried to show how often they had befriended him  some even allowed such flights to their imaginations that they came to believe pauls father would give them money enough to make them all rich and they came to think of the five cents which they had spent for a theatre ticket as just so much money given directly to paul but the boys who had actually received money from mr weston were so much excited by the wealth which had so suddenly become theirs that they could do no business at all that day from the time they had reached home with the hundred dollars in their pockets they had been in earnest discussion as to what they should do with their money  mopsey had used every argument he could think of to show that it was not only wise but proper for them to invest it all in their theatre and so earnest was he in his attempts to have it so expended that he took upon himself the excessive labor of figuring the cash result of ten performances at the same amount of receipts as those of the previous saturday showing that they would receive in return the amount of their investment and considerably more but he was unable to give any reason as to why they should not have as liberal patronage if they continued their efforts in the same place without any further outlay of money  ben was willing that a small portion of the amount should be spent for the purchase of a curtain and for more secure footlights but he insisted that the greater portion of it should be invested where it would be safe  dickey was of the same opinion as ben and he further proposed since mopsey was so anxious to carry out his ideas that rather than spend it all on their theatre they should divide the money so that each could do with his share as he thought best  johnny advised buying or starting a newsstand in some good location and this mrs green seemed to think was the most sensible plan of all of course the boys knew that she and nelly each had a share in the money and her advice had great weight with them but they had come to no decision when they went to bed that night and the morning found them quite as divided in opinion as to what should be done with their great wealth  none of the boys not even mopsey had been able to go to work that day and the greater portion of the forenoon was spent in city hall square trying to come to some understanding about their money as a matter of course they remembered what mr weston had said about rewarding them still further because of what they had done for paul but since it was ben and johnny who had really cared for the boy when he did not know where to go or what to do they would be the only ones who would probably be benefited although mopsey felt that there was a great deal yet due him for the theatrical education which he had bestowed  while they were still engaged in argument and with no more prospect of coming to any agreement in the matter mr weston and paul stood before them having approached unobserved because of the exciting discussion which had occupied their attention to the exclusion of everything else mr weston had heard enough of the conversation to know that the question of what should be done with the money he had given them was under discussion and after seating himself on one of the benches with the boys all around him he succeeded in gaining their confidence so far that they talked unreservedly before him  when each one had advanced his views on the matter mr weston agreed with dickey that it was better for them to divide it equally and paul figured out to them what each one of the six would have as his portion  then mr weston startled them by an invitation which almost took their breath away he said that he could not keep his appointment with them that evening because of business matters which would require his attention but instead he would invite them as well as mrs green and nelly to go to coney island with himself and paul for a holiday  of course there was but one answer to such a proposal and they accepted it with the greatest pleasure agreeing to meet him at the pier on the following morning  then mr weston and paul went to the steamship office to engage passage to europe for the coming saturday and the partners went to startle mrs green and her daughter with the wonderful news to their great surprise mrs green even though she did own onesixth of the hundred dollars decided that she could not afford to close up her basketstore for the day even when she had been invited to make one of the pleasureparty but she was willing and anxious for nelly to go which was perhaps just as well  nine oclock was the time when mr weston had said that he and paul would meet the party at the pier but they fearing lest they might be late had arrived there a little before eight on the following morning as full of pleasure as any five children that could have been found in new york city  ben and johnny presented very nearly the same gorgeous appearance they had on the night when they first called on mrs green while dickey and mopsey were attired in costumes that were models of their own idea of fashion nelly who looked very sweet and modest in her clean gingham dress had tried in vain to persuade her friends to go in their usual workingclothes rather than put on such a striking array as they did but each one of the boys indignantly repelled the idea of showing so little regard for the gentleman who was to give them so much pleasure by not making themselves look as beautiful as possible and she could not persuade them to do differently  it was hardly more than halfpast eight when they began to express their doubts as to whether mr weston would arrive in time to take the steamer he had designated and they were fearing lest they should be disappointed after all when paul and his father arrived  mopsey was in favor of giving mr weston three cheers as a mark of their appreciation and admiration when that gentleman appeared at the head of the pier and finding that his companions objected to it would have done all the cheering himself if ben had not forcibly prevented him by holding his hand firmly over his mouth  paul greeted his friends as warmly as if he had been separated from them for weeks instead of hours and then the party went on board the steamer feeling that they were justly the observed of all observers  mopsey explained everything they saw with a reckless disregard of accuracy and if his companions had not known to the contrary they would have thought that all his life had been spent on the steamers running from new york to coney island  it was not until mr weston asked him some question about the theatre that he laid aside the duties of guide and historian to launch out in glowing details of their temple of histrionic art which must one day be the resort of the general public the others quietly enjoyed the sail drinking in deep draughts of pleasure from everything around them excepting mopseys loud boasting  johnny seemed plunged in an ecstasy of delight from which he emerged but once and then it was to express the wish that he might always be a passenger on one of these steamers with no other object than to enjoy the continual sail  nelly and dickey sat side by side speaking only at rare intervals while paul and ben discussed the latters prospects in life or spoke of the wonderful journey which the former was to make in order to rejoin his mother and sister as for mr weston he appeared to find as much enjoyment in the delight and wonder of his guests as they did in the sail and there was every prospect that the holiday would be a remarkably pleasant one to all  illustration at coney island  when they landed and were in the very midst of the pleasureseeking crowd which appeared to have no other aim than enjoyment their delight and bewilderment were so great that even mopsey was silenced and could hardly have been induced to talk even if he had been directly approached on the subject of the theatre or the new play he was supposed to be preparing  after leading the way to one of the hotels mr weston thinking that perhaps his presence was some check upon the full enjoyment of his guests told them that they had all better go off by themselves to see what was new or wonderful while he remained there until they should return cautioning them however to come back by dinnertime  it would be almost impossible to describe all they did or what they said during that forenoon when they were indulging in such a day of pleasure as they never had had before as ben afterwards expressed it they saw about everything there was to be seen an they scooped in about as much fun as ever anybody did who went to coney island  owing to pauls watchfulness they were back at the hotel at the time mr weston had said they would have dinner and dickey asked wonderingly as they entered and paul looked around for his father  are we goin to eat here jest as if we was reglar folks  of course we are said paul decidedly were all going to sit down to the table with father and have just as good a dinner as we can get  dickey had nothing more to say he was overwhelmed with the idea of acting like reglar folks and after that nothing could have astonished him  mr weston had engaged a private diningroom in order that his guests might feel more at their ease if they were alone than if they went into the public diningroom the boys and nelly seated themselves at the table with as much solemnity as if they were participating in some very important ceremony opening their eyes wide with astonishment as the waiter brought on the different courses but never neglecting to do full justice to everything that was set before them  mr weston did all he could to make the dinner seem less formal but he did not succeed until after the roast chickens were put on the table and the servant left the room then when they were alone and with three whole chickens before them their tongues seemed suddenly to have been loosened and they talked as fast as the most funloving host could have asked for until each ones plate was piled high with chicken and vegetables when they relapsed again into silent activity  that visit and more especially that dinner was a new experience in their lives and one which they could never forget they ate until it seemed impossible they could eat any more and even then dickey succeeded in disposing of an extra piece of pie together with some nuts and raisins after the meal was ended and before they started out again to take one more look at all that was strange around them mr weston said as he handed dickey and mopsey each five dollars and nelly ten  i want to return to some of you the money you paid for pauls railroad ticket nelly has her mothers share as well as her own  but we didnt pay so much as this said dickey in evident perplexity it only cost fourteen dollars in all  that comes near enough to the amount replied mr weston and you will oblige me by thinking that you have simply had returned to you the money you paid out as for ben and johnny who took charge of paul when he was sadly in need of some ones care i have got what i hope will be a pleasant surprise in store for them and if they will come to the hotel at nine oclock in the morning paul and i will show them what it is  there was very little opportunity for any one to make a reply for as mr weston spoke he arose from the table and then added  now go and see all that you can until five oclock and then we will start for home  it was a tired party who landed in new york quite early that evening some going to mrs greens and two to the hotel but they were quite as happy as they were weary and had had such a day of enjoyment as they had never even dreamed of before which could be set down to the credit of the kind act of befriending a homeless boy     chapter xv  the great surprise   if mrs green had been able to have understood what five children were saying to her at one time she would have had a very clear idea of that day of pleasure but as it was when each was eager to tell the story and all spoke together she had only a general idea until she was alone with nelly  after the attempt to enlighten her as to where they had been and what they had seen the conversation turned upon the surprise which mr weston said he had for ben and johnny and many were the speculations as to what it might be mopsey was very certain that he had purchased one of the largest theatres in the city and was to present it to them in due form and so positive did he become as to the correctness of his idea that he would persist in talking about what they would do after the two boys were installed there to the exclusion of everything else he even awakened them after they had gone to sleep that night in order to make them promise that they would let him direct the entertainments in case he was right regarding the gift of a theatre of course the two most interested were in a high state of excitement as to the gift although they did not try to guess what it might be it was a difficult matter for them to go to sleep after they went to bed so anxious were they to know what goodfortune was to be theirs and after mopsey had awakened them they remained in anything but a sleepy condition for several hours  but the morning came at last as all mornings do come and they were the first ones up and dressed although they spent a great deal of time on their toilet mopsey proposed that the others escort the two fortunate ones to the hotel in order that they might learn what this great surprise was as soon as possible but dickey insisted that ben and johnny go alone since mr weston had not said anything about their bringing any friends with them  it did seem to these two boys after their companions had gone to work that the hands of the clock would never point to nine they had walked slowly from their boardinghouse to the hotel hoping to pass away the time by looking in the shopwindows and yet walking as slowly as they did they were on the sidewalk opposite the house as early as eight oclock  since they could not content themselves anywhere else they remained there until it should be time for them to call still speculating as to what their goodfortune was to be and wishing the minutes would pass more quickly the clock was just striking the hour of nine when they entered the office of the hotel and found mr weston and paul evidently awaiting their arrival  whatever the surprise was that mr weston had in store for them it was not in the hotel that they were to receive it for as soon as they entered paul and his father started towards them leading the way out into the street at once it was quite evident that paul did not intend to allow himself to run any risk of betraying the secret for he walked on ahead with his father glancing over his shoulder every few moments at the puzzledlooking boys behind  down twentythird street to sixth avenue mr weston led the way and after they had gone down the avenue some distance he entered a neatlooking little periodical and stationary store nodding familiarly to the proprietor as if he had been a regular visitor there now more then ever were the two boys perplexed and they had just come to the conclusion that pauls father was going to buy them something as a present when the proprietor said  all the money which has been taken this morning is in the drawer and unless there is something more you want to say to me i will go as i made an engagement down town for ten oclock  i dont think there is anything more to be said replied mr weston of course you will come in whenever you are passing this way to see how matters are going  oh yes and the man started towards the door ill see that everything goes on smoothly although i have no doubt but that the new proprietors will get along all right the goods are all marked at the selling price and there can hardly be any mistake made  then the man went out and they were left alone in the store which to say the least seemed a very strange proceeding to ben and johnny  well boys what do you think of the store asked mr weston and as they hardly knew what reply to make he added i hope you will like it for i think you can make considerable money here  we make money here asked ben in surprise  yes for it all belongs to you i bought the stock in your name with myself as trustee since minors cant hold property and the rent is paid for one year you must be careful to keep the stock well up with good seasonable articles and if you work hard there is no reason why you should not have a goodsized bank account by the end of the year  illustration ben and johnny alone in the new store  the boys looked at each other and then at mr weston but appeared unable to understand what he meant it did not seem possible that all those goods were theirs and they were quite sure that they had misunderstood what he said or that he was not speaking to them  all of these goods are yourspauls present to you for your kindness to him i guess you will understand it after a while and we will come back presently after you feel perfectly sure about the proprietorship  then paul and his father went out leaving the two owners to stand looking at each other as if they were uncertain as to their own identity it was some moments before they spoke after they were alone and then johnny went near the door and stood on his head in a grave businesslike manner until his face was as red as a boiled beet after this feat had been accomplished he appeared to feel considerably relieved and he said as he went close up to ben  do you spose he meant jest what he said  he must have meant it replied ben but the look on his face told that even then he was uncertain about it  then the boys began examining their stock finding beautiful things such as they had admired from outside shopwindows but never believed they should really own  when paul came in alone half an hour laterfor he was too eager to know what his friends thought of their store to be able to wait any longerhe found the newlymade proprietors in a state of delight bordering almost on frenzy they shook him by the hands hugged him and once johnny looked as if he would have kissed him had it not been that he was a little ashamed to do so while they kept asking him over and over again if he was quite sure that his father had really given them that entire stock of goods all for their very own  when paul told them that his father had spoken of doing some such thing as this the first night that he had found him after hearing the story of what the two had done for his son and that the money had been paid over that very morning in his presence they became fully assured of their goodfortune  johnny by bens direction started down town to inform their friends of their magnificent gift and to invite them all up to look the property over which invitation it is almost unnecessary to say was accepted at once  during the greater portion of that day the store was filled with such a crowd of newsboys and bootblacks as was never seen in that vicinity before and the other merchants looked out in alarm as if they feared that a riot was in progress  dickey was almost as delighted as the proprietors themselves at this magnificent gift but mopsey did not hesitate to say that from what he had seen of mr weston he fully expected that he would have been sensible enough to have purchased a theatre and the author also intimated that some folks did not recognize genius when they saw it or he would have been both proprietor and manager of a theatre in the place of ben and johnny being installed behind the counter of a periodical depot  paul had his fathers permission to remain at the store all day for he was as much delighted with it as were the new owners and he received quite as much attention from the visitors as the goods did all seeming to think him a curiosity and all equally certain that they would have cared for him as willingly as ben and johnny did had he met them first  it was quite late in the afternoon when mr weston returned to see how the new merchants were getting along and both of them tried to express their thanks for what he had done for them but it was a difficult matter to find words to convey all they felt  dont try to thank me my lads but live so that you will merit the confidence i now have in you the money which i have paid out to buy these goods is but a small part of what i would have been willing to give to have known that i should find my son alive and well from what he has told me of you i believe that you deserve this start in life and if you continue as honest and kindlyhearted as i think you are you will repay me for this in almost as great a proportion as you already have done  after mr weston had explained to them several details of business which it was necessary they should know he went back to the hotel taking paul with him but promising that he should come back and help them keep store all the next day since it would be the last he would be in new york for some time  neither of the boys thought of going home for anything to eat until it should be time for them to close the store and in the evening mrs green and nelly called upon them to say that they had purposely delayed dinner until they could be there when it would be made a sort of thanksgiving meal as a matter of course they were as much delighted with the store as any of the other visitors had been and mrs green took advantage of the occasion to point out to mopsey what the difference might have been if he had refused to help a companion in distress as he apparently had been on the point of doing when he was appealed to for his share of the money with which to buy the ticket  since there was quite a trade in daily papers at the new store and it would be inconvenient for the two boys to buy and deliver their papers and attend to the store at the same time they made a trade with dickey whereby he should become a partner to the extent of onethird of the profitsthereby making him quite as happy as they were which was more happy than can be described by words  very proud were the three partners as they locked the store that night and with the keys in their pockets walked home with mrs green and nelly surrounded by quite a numerous escort of their particular and intimate friends and as they passed the different stores into which they had hardly dared to enter even when they were pursuing their legitimate business they seemed suddenly to have degenerated into very shabby affairs since they had one of their own which was so beautiful  of the meal which followed mrs green had made quite a feast in order to celebrate the goodfortune which had come to two of her boarders a cold boiled ham with smoking hot potatoes followed by pies and fruit made up a dinner that would have been thought fit for a king had it not been for the remembrance of the swell affair at coney island all were in the best of spirits save mopsey and when dickey asked the cause of his apparent trouble it was learned that the present of the store was a severe blow to him since it deprived him of nearly all his theatrical company as well as partners in the enterprise  ill tell you what it is mopsey said ben after he had whispered with johnny and dickey and they had nodded their heads as if agreeing with what he said well give you our share of the theatrecause of course we cant spend any time actin now that weve got the store an you an nelly can own it alone you can get some other actors an well buy tickets every time you have a show whether we can come or not  this present was all mopsey needed to make him as happy as if he had been given an interest in the store he began to think of such of his friends as he was quite positive would make bright and shining lights in the dramatic world and was so generous as to offer to tell them all about the play as soon as he should have it mapped out in his mind  when the partners went to bed that night impressed with a sense of their growing importance johnny remarked to ben just as his eyes were closing in sleep  now were reglar folks at last aint we  and ben quite agreed with him     chapter xvi  in conclusion   as paul had agreed he spent the next day with ben and johnny in their store and surely no shopman ever felt more pride in selling goods than they did paul acted as clerk and a very inquisitive one he was too for he insisted on looking everywhere so that he should know just what kind of goods his friends had for sale  trade was very good and when the money was counted for about the fifteenth time and it was found that they had sold twenty dollars worth of goods there was not one of the four who did not believe that in less than a year ben and johnny would be numbered among the merchant princes of the country  when it was time for paul to go back to the hotel the question of escorting him to the steamer arose for he was to make one more effort to start with his father for europe and it was quite certain that there would be no mistake this time the steamer was to sail at ten oclock and of course all the boys could not go since some one must be left to attend to the store though who that unfortunate one would be promised to be a vexing question till ben said  im the oldest an so i spose it must be me ill have to say goodbye now polly for i cant see you in the mornin when you come back be sure an come up here wont you and if youll write to us johnny an ill answer you back for were goin to study awful hard now that weve got a store of our own an it wont be long before we can write an figger an do all them things  paul promised that he would send letters regularly to his friends and when he left the store with dickey to be sure that he did not miss the way ben felt more sad at parting with him than he would have thought it possible for a boy to feel who was half owner of such a beautiful store  the business of selling newspapers seemed to have been nearly forsaken the next morning for fully forty newsboys and at least a dozen bootblacks were at the pier to say goodbye to polly weston the boy who had once seemed so forlorn and who had played hamlet so successfully paul was highly pleased at such attention on the part of his acquaintances and he presented nearly all of them to his father who was not a little surprised at the number of friends his son had made in so short a time  after paul had said goodbye to each one individually and was just about going on board the steamer mopsey stopped him taking him aside with a great show of secrecy  i own all the theatre now polly he whispered an when you come back ill let you be one of the actors if you want to an ill fix up a play where youll have all the best chances  paul thanked mopsey for his kindness but before he could say whether he accepted the generous offer or not his father called him and he was obliged to go on board leaving the sole proprietor and author of the theatre at a loss to know whether he should write a play especially for paul or not  then the huge steamer slowly started from the dock and paul stood near the stern where he could see his army of small acquaintances the greater portion of whom had been so kind to him when he most needed friends the ragged crowd were all swinging their hats and paul had just begun to wave his handkerchief when mopsey saw the chance to bestow a very delicate compliment jumping on a pile of merchandise where he could better see and be seen he waved his hat furiously and shouted in his shrillest dramatic key  three cheers for polly an three more for pollys father  then that crowd of boys swarmed up over everything that would raise them more prominently into view pushing aside any one in their way and both looking and acting like a hive of bees getting ready to swarm until they stood high above all the others  now shouted mopsey and then the cheers were given with a will that startled the officers of the ship into looking around to see what distinguished passengers they had on board  then paul waved his hat the boys cheered again and the ship was so far out into the stream that no more courtesies could be exchanged                                       it is now two years since paul weston started for europe and he is expected home in a few weeks as ben or johnny will tell you in case you should make inquiries in that time very many gradual but not startling changes have been made in those boys whom we left in new york therefore it may be assumed that paul has also changed considerably and in all probability for the better  illustration three cheers for polly  ben johnny and dickey are still in business in the same place that mr weston purchased for them but one would hardly recognize the dirty ragged boys whom paul first met in the neat gentlemanly little tradesmen who are so courteous to their patrons and so prompt in all their business transactions that they did study as ben told paul they would is shown by their manner of speaking their accounts which are kept in the most precise order and their general information when one enters into conversation with them  and their business has improved quite as much as they have by strict attention to it and by integrity in all their dealings they have gained new customers so fast that they are now obliged to use every available inch of space and they intend to hire the next store making the two into one large shop as soon as mr weston comes home to advise with them regarding it  they still board with mrs green she has gone out of the fruit business now entirely has moved into the dwelling directly over their store and does nothing but attend to her boarders nelly when she is not at school acts as clerk for the boys and is very useful to the firm during the rush of morning and evening trade  mopsey has gone out of the theatrical business altogether he gave two more performances but they were not as great successes as he had fancied they would be and required more of his time than he could afford to give he has given up both play writing and acting very much to the benefit of his legitimate business he still sells peanuts at fulton ferry and has capital enough to start on a larger scale which he says he shall do in another year  about a year ago dickey met tim dooley the boy who made him bankrupt but he did not try to make him return any of the money he had stolen tim was doing a small business in the way of blackening boots having reaped no benefit from his illgotten gains and dickey so far from showing any feeling of resentment talked kindly to the boy and offered to be his friend again if he would try to be honest  paul kept his promise and wrote to his former partners very regularly he had not neglected his studies while he was away and in the last letter which the firm received from him he stated that in a few weeks he would return for the purpose of going to school in this country he also wrote that his father had promised to let him remain a fortnight in new york during which time he would be with his old friends and again live over the time when he was a newsboy for ten days                                       the story of ben and johnny is a true one their start in life is not without many parallels to be sure it is but seldom that such opportunities for advancement come but each boy has it within himself to win his way in the world quite as well as either ben johnny or dickey may all my young readers who have followed the fortunes of these three try to win the good opinion of those around them by earnest honest purpose and integrity like these boys who knew no home until they made one for themselves   the end     interesting books for young
