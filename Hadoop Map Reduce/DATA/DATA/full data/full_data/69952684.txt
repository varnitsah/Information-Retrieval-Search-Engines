colonel  yes dear       he goes hastily  mrs gwyn sits drawing circles on the ground      with her charming parasol  suddenly she springs to her feet      and stands waiting like an animal at bay  the

hanging      chinese lanterns to the hollow tree  lever  of course if this level pointing with his cigarette peters out to the west we shall be in a tightish place you know what a mine is at this stage colonel hope  colonel  absently  yes yes  tracing a line  what is there to prevent its running out here to the east  lever  well nothing except that as a matter of fact it doesnt  colonel  with some excitement  im very glad you showed me these papers very glad  i say that its a most astonishing thing if the ore suddenly stops there  a gleam of humour visits levers face im not an expert but you ought to prove that ground to the east more thoroughly  lever  quizzically  of course sir if you advise that  colonel  if it were mine id no more sit down under the belief that the ore stopped there than i dtheres a harmony in these things  never  i can only tell you what our experts say  colonel  ah  experts  no faith in themnever had  miners lawyers theologians cowardly lotpays them to be cowardly  when they have nt their own axes to grind theyve got their theories a theorys a dangerous thing  he loses himself in contemplation of the papers  now my theory is you re in strata here of what we call the triassic age  lever  smiling faintly  ah  colonel  youve struck a fault thats whats happened  the ore may be as much as thirty or forty yards out but it s there depend on it  lever  would you back that opinion sir  colonel  with dignity  i never give an opinion that im not prepared to back  i want to get to the bottom of this  whats to prevent the gold going down indefinitely  lever  nothing so far as i know  colonel  with suspicion  eh  lever  all i can tell you is this is as far as weve got and we want more money before we can get any farther  colonel  absently  yes yes thats very usual  lever  if you ask my personal opinion i think its very doubtful that the gold does go down  colonel  smiling  oh  a personal opinion a matter of this sort  lever  as though about to take the papers  perhaps wed better close the sitting sir sorry to have bored you  colonel  now now  dont be so touchy  if im to put money in im bound to look at it all round  lever  with lifted brows  please dont imagine that i want you to put money in  colonel  confound it sir  d you suppose i take you for a company promoter  lever  thank you  colonel  looking at him doubtfully  youve got irish

want you to understand that nobody has a greater objection to gold mines than i  lever  looks down at his host with halfclosed eyes  but it is a gold mine colonel hope  colonel  i know i know but i ve been into it for myself ive formed my opinion personally  now what s the reason you dont want me to invest  lever  well if it doesnt turn out as you expect youll say its my doing  i know what investors are  colonel  dubiously  if it were a westralian or a kaffir i would nt touch it with a pair of tongs  it s not as if i were going to put much in  he suddenly bends above the papers as though magnetically attracted i like these triassic formations       dick who has hung the last lantern moodily departs  lever  looking after him  that young man seems depressed  colonel  as though remembering his principles  i dont like mines never have  suddenly absorbed again  i tell you what leverthis things got tremendous possibilities  you dont seem to believe in it enough  no mines any good without faith until i see for myself however i shant commit myself beyond a thousand  lever  are you serious sir  colonel  certainly  ive been thinking it over ever since you told me henty had

tree  colonel  a man never knows what he is himself  there s my wife she thinks she sby the way dont say anything to her about this please  and lever nervously i dont think you know this is quite the sort of thing for my niece  lever  quietly  i agree  i mean to get her out of it  colonel  a little taken aback  ah  you know sheshes in a very delicate position living by herself in london  lever

dont you think so  lever  forcing a smile  mrs gwyn always seems to me to get on all right  colonel  as though making a discovery  you know ive found that when a womans living alone and unprotected the very least thing will set a lot of hags and jackanapes talking  hotly  the more unprotected and helpless a woman is the more they revel in it  if theres anything i hate in this world its those wretched creatures who babble about their neighbours affairs  lever  i agree with you  colonel  one ought to be very careful not to give themthat is checks himself confused then hurrying oni suppose

and enters it  she takes out a bottle of champagne wipes it and carries it away but seeing mrs gwyns scarf lying across the chair she fingers it and stops listening to the waltz suddenly draping it round her shoulders she seizes the bottle of champagne and waltzes with abandon to the music as though avenging a long starvation of her instincts  thus dancing she is surprised by dick who has come to smoke a cigarette and think at the spot where he was told to have a go  rose startled stops and hugs the bottle  dick  its not claret rose i should nt warm it       rose taking off the scarf replaces it on the chair then with      the halfwarmed bottle she retreats  dick in the swing sits      thinking of his fate  suddenly from behind the hollow tree he      sees joy darting forward in

changes suddenly she buries it      against his shoulder  they stand so just a moment in the moon light then turning to the river move slowly out of sight  again the hollow tree is left alone the music of the waltz has stopped  the voices of miss beech and the colonel are heard approaching from the house  they appear in the opening of the wall  the colonel carries a pair of field glasses with which to look at the moon  colonel  charming to see molly dance with lever their steps go so well together  i can always tell when a womans enjoying herself peachey  miss beech  sharply  can you  youre very clever  colonel  wonderful that moon  im going to have a look at her splendid glasses these peachy he screws them out not a better pair in england  i remember in burmah with these glasses i used to be able to tell a man from a woman at two miles and a quarter  and thats no joke i can tell you  but on his way to the moon he has taken a survey of the earth to the right along the river  in a low but excited voice  i say i sayis it one of the maidsthe baggage  why  its dick  by george shes got her hair down peachey  its joy       miss beech goes to look  he makes as though to hand the      glasses to her but puts them to his own eyes instead      excitedly  it is  what about her headache  by george theyre kissing  i say peachey  i shall have to tell nell  miss beech  are you sure theyre kissing  well thats some comfort  colonel  theyre at the stile now  oughtnt i to stop them eh he stands on tiptoe  we must nt spy on them dash it all  he drops the glasses theyre out of sight now  miss beech  to herself  he said he wouldnt let her  colonel  what  have you been encouraging them  miss beech  dont be in such a hurry       she moves towards the hollow tree  colonel  abstractedly  by george peachey to think that nell and i were oncepoor nell  i remember just such a night as this       he stops and stares before him sighing  miss beech impressively  its a comfort shes got that good young man  shes found out that her mother and this mr lever areyou know  colonel  losing all traces of his fussiness and drawing himself up as though he were on parade  you tell me that my niece  miss beech  out of her own mouth  colonel  bowing his head  i never would have believed shed have forgotten herself  miss beech  very solemnly  ah my dear  were all the same were all as hollow as that tree  when its ourselves its always a special case       the colonel makes a movement of distress and miss beech goes      to him  dont you take it so to heart my dear       a silence  colonel  shaking his head  i couldnt have believed molly would forget that child  miss beech  sadly  they must go their own ways poor things  she cant put herself in the childs place and the child cant put herself in mollys  a woman and a girltheres the tree of life between them  colonel  staring into the tree to see indeed if that were the tree alluded to  its a grief to me peachey its a grief  he sinks into a chair stroking his long moustaches  then to avenge his hurt  shant tell nelldashed if i do anything to make the trouble worse  miss beech  nodding  theres suffering enough without adding to it with our trumpery judgments  if only things would last between them  colonel  fiercely  last  by george theyd better       he stops and looking up with a queer sorry look  i say peachey lifes very funny  miss beech  men and women are  touching his forehead tenderly there theretake care of your poor dear head  tsst  the blessed innocents       she pulls the colonels sleeve  they slip away towards the      house as joy and dick come back  they are still linked      together and stop by the hollow tree  joy  in a whisper  dick is love always like this  dick  putting his arms around her with conviction its never been like this before  its you and me       he kisses her on the lips                                  the curtain falls
