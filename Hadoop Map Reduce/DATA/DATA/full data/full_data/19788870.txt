19788870	passages from the american notebooks volume i  by nathaniel hawthorne     salem june 15 1835a walk down to the juniper the shore of the coves strewn with bunches of seaweed driven in by recent winds  eelgrass rolled and bundled up and entangled with itlarge marine vegetables of an olivecolor with round slender snakelike stalks four or five feet long and nearly two feet broad these are the herbage of the deep sea  shoals of fishes at a little distance from the shore discernible by their fins out of water  among the heaps of seaweed there were sometimes small pieces of painted wood bark and other driftage  on the shore with pebbles of granite there were round or oval pieces of brick which the waves had rolled about till they resembled a natural mineral huge stones tossed about in every variety of confusion some shagged all over with seaweed others only partly covered others bare  the old tengun battery at the outer angle of the juniper very verdant and besprinkled with whiteweed clover and buttercups  the junipertrees are very aged and decayed and mossgrown  the grass about the hospital is rank being trodden probably by nobody but myself  there is a representation of a vessel under sail cut with a penknife on the corner of the house  returning by the almshouse i stopped a good while to look at the pigsa great herdwho seemed to be just finishing their suppers  they certainly are types of unmitigated sensualitysome standing in the trough in the midst of their own and others victualssome thrusting their noses deep into the foodsome rubbing their backs against a postsome huddled together between sleeping and waking breathing hardall wallowing about a great boar swaggering round and a big sow waddling along with her huge paunch  notwithstanding the unspeakable defilement with which these strange sensualists spice all their food they seem to have a quick and delicate sense of smell  what ridiculouslooking animals  swift himself could not have imagined anything nastier than what they practise by the mere impulse of natural genius  yet the shakers keep their pigs very clean and with great advantage  the legion of devils in the herd of swinewhat a scene it must have been  sunday evening going by the jail the setting sun kindled up the windows most cheerfully as if there were a bright comfortable light within its darksome stone wall   june 18tha walk in north salem in the decline of yesterday afternoon beautiful weather bright sunny with a western or northwestern wind just cool enough and a slight superfluity of heat  the verdure both of trees and grass is now in its prime the leaves elastic all life  the grassfields are plenteously bestrewn with whiteweed large spaces looking as white as a sheet of snow at a distance yet with an indescribably warmer tinge than snowliving white intermixed with living green  the hills and hollows beyond the cold spring copiously shaded principally with oaks of good growth and some walnuttrees with the rich sun brightening in the midst of the open spaces and mellowing and fading into the shadeand single trees with their cool spot of shade in the waste of sun quite a picture of beauty gently picturesque  the surface of the land is so varied with woodland mingled that the eye cannot reach far away except now and then in vistas perhaps across the river showing houses or a church and surrounding village in upper beverly  in one of the sunny bits of pasture walled irregularly in with oakshade i saw a gray mare feeding and as i drew near a colt sprang up from amid the grassa very small colt  he looked me in the face and i tried to startle him so as to make him gallop but he stretched his long legs one after another walked quietly to his mother and began to suckjust wetting his lips not being very hungry  then he rubbed his head alternately with each hind leg  he was a graceful little beast  i bathed in the cove overhung with maples and walnuts the water cool and thrilling  at a distance it sparkled bright and blue in the breeze and sun  there were jellyfish swimming about and several left to melt away on the shore  on the shore sprouting amongst the sand and gravel i found samphire growing somewhat like asparagus  it is an excellent salad at this season salt yet with an herblike vivacity and very tender  i strolled slowly through the pastures watching my long shadow making grave fantastic gestures in the sun  it is a pretty sight to see the sunshine brightening the entrance of a road which shortly becomes deeply overshadowed by trees on both sides  at the cold spring three little girls from six to nine were seated on the stones in which the fountain is set and paddling in the water  it was a pretty picture and would have been prettier if they had shown bare little legs instead of pantalets  very large trees overhung them and the sun was so nearly gone down that a pleasant gloom made the spot sombre in contrast with these light and laughing little figures  on perceiving me they rose up tittering among themselves  it seemed that there was a sort of playful malice in those who first saw me for they allowed the other to keep on paddling without warning her of my approach  i passed along and heard them come chattering behind   june 22di rode to boston in the afternoon with mr proctor  it was a coolish day with clouds and intermitting sunshine and a pretty fresh breeze  we stopped about an hour at the maverick house in the sprouting branch of the city at east bostona stylish house with doors painted in imitation of oak a large bar bells ringing the barkeeper calls out when a bell rings number then a waiter replies number answered and scampers up stairs  a ticket is given by the hostler on taking the horse and chaise which is returned to the barkeeper when the chaise is wanted  the landlord was fashionably dressed with the whitest of linen neatly plaited and as courteous as a lord chamberlain visitors from boston thronging the housesome standing at the bar watching the process of preparing tumblers of punchothers sitting at the windows of different parlorssome with faces flushed puffing cigars  the bill of fare for the day was stuck up beside the bar opposite this principal hotel there was another called the mechanics which seemed to be equally thronged  i suspect that the company were about on a par in each for at the maverick house though well dressed they seemed to be merely sunday gentlemenmostly young fellowsclerks in drygoods stores being the aristocracy of them  one very fashionable in appearance with a handsome cane happened to stop by me and lift up his foot and i noticed that the sole of his boot which was exquisitely polished was all worn out  i apprehend that some such minor deficiencies might have been detected in the general showiness of most of them  there were girls too but not pretty ones nor on the whole such good imitations of gentility as the young men  there were as many people as are usually collected at a muster or on similar occasions lounging about without any apparent enjoyment but the observation of this may serve me to make a sketch of the mode of spending the sabbath by the majority of unmarried young middlingclass people near a great town  most of the people had smart canes and bosompins  crossing the ferry into boston we went to the city tavern where the barroom presented a sabbath scene of reposestagefolk lounging in chairs half asleep smoking cigars generally with clean linen and other niceties of apparel to mark the day  the doors and blinds of an oyster and refreshment shop across the street were closed but i saw people enter it  there were two owls in a back court visible through a window of the barroomspeckled gray with darkblue eyesthe queerestlooking birds that existso solemn and wisedozing away the day much like the rest of the people only that they looked wiser than any others  their hooked beaks looked like hooked noses  a dull scene this  a stranger here and there poring over a newspaper  many of the stagefolk sitting in chairs on the pavement in front of the door  we went to the top of the hill which formed part of gardiner greenes estate and which is now in the process of levelling and pretty much taken away except the highest point and a narrow path to ascend to it it gives an admirable view of the city being almost as high as the steeples and the dome of the state house and overlooking the whole mass of brick buildings and slated roofs with glimpses of streets far below it was really a pity to take it down  i noticed the stump of a very large elm recently felled  no house in the city could have reared its roof so high as the roots of that tree if indeed the churchspires did so  on our drive home we passed through charlestown  stages in abundance were passing the road burdened with passengers inside and out also chaises and barouches horsemen and footmen  we are a community of sabbathbreakers   august 31sta drive to nahant yesterday afternoon  stopped at rices and afterwards walked down to the steamboat wharf to see the passengers land  it is strange how few good faces there are in the world comparatively to the ugly ones  scarcely a single comely one in all this collection  then to the hotel  barouches at the doors and gentlemen and ladies going to drive and gentlemen smoking round the piazza  the barkeeper had one of bentons mintdrops for a bosombrooch  it made a very handsome one  i crossed the beach for home about sunset  the tide was so far down as just to give me a passage on the hard sand between the sea and the loose gravel  the sea was calm and smooth with only the surfwaves whitening along the beach  several ladies and gentlemen on horseback were cantering and galloping before and behind me  a hint of a storysome incident which should bring on a general war and the chief actor in the incident to have something corresponding to the mischief he had caused   september 7tha drive to ipswich with b  at the tavern was an old fat country major and another old fellow laughing and playing off jokes on each otherone tying a ribbon upon the others hat  one had been a trumpeter to the majors troop  walking about town we knocked for a whim at the door of a dark old house and inquired if miss hannah lord lived there  a woman of about thirty came to the door with rather a confused smile and a disorder about the bosom of her dress as if she had been disturbed while nursing her child  she answered us with great kindness  entering the burialground where some masons were building a tomb we found a good many old monuments and several covered with slabs of red freestone or slate and with arms sculptured on the slab or an inlaid circle of slate  on one slate gravestone of the rev nathl rogers there was a portrait of that worthy about a third of the size of life carved in relief with his cloak band and wig in excellent preservation all the buttons of his waistcoat being cut with great minutenessthe ministers nose being on a level with his cheeks  it was an upright gravestone  returning home i held a colloquy with a young girl about the right road  she had come out to feed a pig and was a little suspicious that we were making fun of her yet answered us with a shy laugh and goodnaturethe pig all the time squealing for his dinner  displayed along the walls and suspended from the pillars of the original kings chapel were coatsofarms of the king the successive governors and other distinguished men  in the pulpit there was an hourglass on a large and elaborate brass stand  the organ was surmounted by a gilt crown in the centre supported by a gilt mitre on each side  the governors pew had corinthian pillars and crimson damask tapestry  in 1727 it was lined with china probably tiles  saint augustin at mass charged all that were accursed to go out of the church  then a dead body arose and went out of the church into the churchyard with a white cloth on its head and stood there till mass was over  it was a former lord of the manor whom a curate had cursed because he refused to pay his tithes  a justice also commanded the dead curate to arise and gave him a rod and the dead lord kneeling received penance thereby  he then ordered the lord to go again to his grave which he did and fell immediately to ashes  saint augustin offered to pray for the curate that he might remain on earth to confirm men in their belief but the curate refused because he was in the place of rest  a sketch to be given of a modern reformera type of the extreme doctrines on the subject of slaves cold water and other such topics he goes about the streets haranguing most eloquently and is on the point of making many converts when his labors are suddenly interrupted by the appearance of the keeper of a madhouse whence he has escaped  much may be made of this idea  a change from a gay young girl to an old woman the melancholy events the effects of which have clustered around her character and gradually imbued it with their influence till she becomes a lover of sickchambers taking pleasure in receiving dying breaths and in laying out the dead also having her mind full of funeral reminiscences and possessing more acquaintances beneath the burial turf than above it  a wellconcerted train of events to be thrown into confusion by some misplaced circumstance unsuspected till the catastrophe yet exerting its influence from beginning to end  on the common at dusk after a salute from two fieldpieces the smoke lay long and heavily on the ground without much spreading beyond the original space over which it had gushed from the guns  it was about the height of a man  the evening clear but with an autumnal chill  the world is so sad and solemn that things meant in jest are liable by an overpowering influence to become dreadful earnestgayly dressed fantasies turning to ghostly and blackclad images of themselves  a story the hero of which is to be represented as naturally capable of deep and strong passion and looking forward to the time when he shall feel passionate love which is to be the great event of his existence but it so chances that he never falls in love and although he gives up the expectation of so doing and marries calmly yet it is somewhat sadly with sentiments merely of esteem for his bride  the lady might be one who had loved him early in life but whom then in his expectation of passionate love he had scorned  the scene of a story or sketch to be laid within the light of a streetlantern the time when the lamp is near going out and the catastrophe to be simultaneous with the last flickering gleam  the peculiar weariness and depression of spirits which is felt after a day wasted in turning over a magazine or other light miscellany different from the state of the mind after severe study because there has been no excitement no difficulties to be overcome but the spirits have evaporated insensibly  to represent the process by which sober truth gradually strips off all the beautiful draperies with which imagination has enveloped a beloved object till from an angel she turns out to be a merely ordinary woman this to be done without caricature perhaps with a quiet humor interfused but the prevailing impression to be a sad one  the story might consist of the various alterations in the feelings of the absent lover caused by successive events that display the true character of his mistress and the catastrophe should take place at their meeting when he finds himself equally disappointed in her person or the whole spirit of the thing may here be reproduced  last evening from the opposite shore of the north river a view of the town mirrored in the water which was as smooth as glass with no perceptible tide or agitation except a trifling swell and reflux on the sand although the shadow of the moon danced in it  the picture of the town perfect in the watertowers of churches houses with here and there a light gleaming near the shore above and more faintly glimmering under waterall perfect but somewhat more hazy and indistinct than the reality  there were many clouds flitting about the sky and the picture of each could be traced in the waterthe ghost of what was itself unsubstantial  the rattling of wheels heard long and far through the town  voices of people talking on the other side of the river the tones being so distinguishable in all their variations that it seemed as if what was there said might be understood but it was not so  two persons might be bitter enemies through life and mutually cause the ruin of one another and of all that were dear to them  finally meeting at the funeral of a grandchild the offspring of a son and daughter married without their consentand who as well as the child had been the victims of their hatredthey might discover that the supposed ground of the quarrel was altogether a mistake and then be wofully reconciled  two persons by mutual agreement to make their wills in each others favor then to wait impatiently for one anothers death and both to be informed of the desired event at the same time  both in most joyous sorrow hasten to be present at the funeral meet and find themselves both hoaxed  the story of a man cold and hardhearted and acknowledging no brotherhood with mankind  at his death they might try to dig him a grave but at a little space beneath the ground strike upon a rock as if the earth refused to receive the unnatural son into her bosom  then they would put him into an old sepulchre where the coffins and corpses were all turned to dust and so he would be alone  then the body would petrify and he having died in some characteristic act and expression he would seem through endless ages of death to repel society as in life and no one would be buried in that tomb forever  cannon transformed to churchbells  a person even before middle age may become musty and faded among the people with whom he has grown up from childhood but by migrating to a new place he appears fresh with the effect of youth which may be communicated from the impressions of others to his own feelings  in an old house a mysterious knocking might be beard on the wall where had formerly been a doorway now bricked up  it might be stated as the closing circumstance of a tale that the body of one of the characters had been petrified and still existed in that state  a young man to win the love of a girl without any serious intentions and to find that in that love which might have been the greatest blessing of his life he had conjured up a spirit of mischief which pursued him throughout his whole careerand this without any revengeful purposes on the part of the deserted girl  two lovers or other persons on the most private business to appoint a meeting in what they supposed to be a place of the utmost solitude and to find it thronged with people   october 17thsome of the oaks are now a deep brown red others are changed to a light green which at a little distance especially in the sunshine looks like the green of early spring  in some trees different masses of the foliage show each of these hues  some of the walnuttrees have a yet more delicate green  others are of a bright sunny yellow  mr  was married to miss  last wednesday  yesterday mr brazer preaching on the comet observed that not one probably of all who heard him would witness its reappearance  mrs  shed tears poor soul she would be contented to dwell in earthly love to all eternity  some treasure or other thing to be buried and a tree planted directly over the spot so as to embrace it with its roots  a tree tall and venerable to be said by tradition to have been the staff of some famous man who happened to thrust it into the ground where it took root  a fellow without money having a hundred and seventy miles to go fastened a chain and padlock to his legs and lay down to sleep in a field  he was apprehended and carried gratis to a jail in the town whither he desired to go  an old volume in a large libraryevery one to be afraid to unclasp and open it because it was said to be a book of magic  a ghost seen by moonlight when the moon was out it would shine and melt through the airy substance of the ghost as through a cloud  prideaux bishop of worcester during the sway of the parliament was forced to support himself and his family by selling his household goods a friend asked him how doth your lordship  never better in my life said the bishop only i have too great a stomach for i have eaten that little plate which the sequestrators left me  i have eaten a great library of excellent books  i have eaten a great deal of linen much of my brass some of my pewter and now i am come to eat iron and what

themthe rich and the proud finding themselves in the same category with the mean and the despised  a person to consider himself as the prime mover of certain remarkable events but to discover that his actions have not contributed in the least thereto  another person to be the cause without suspecting it   october 25tha person or family long desires some particular good  at last it comes in such profusion as to be the great pest of their lives  a man perhaps with a persuasion that he shall make his fortune by some singular means and with an eager longing so to do while digging or boring for water to strike upon a saltspring  to have one event operate in several placesas for example if a mans head were to be cut off in one town mens heads to drop off in several towns  follow out the fantasy of a man taking his life by instalments instead of at one paymentsay ten years of life alternately with ten years of suspended animation  sentiments in a foreign language which merely convey the sentiment without retaining to the reader any graces of style or harmony of sound have somewhat of the charm of thoughts in ones own mind that have not yet been put into words  no possible words that we might adapt to them could realize the unshaped beauty that they appear to possess  this is the reason that translations are never satisfactoryand less so i should think to one who cannot than to one who can pronounce the language  a person to be writing a tale and to find that it shapes itself against his intentions that the characters act otherwise than he thought that unforeseen events occur and a catastrophe comes which he strives in vain to avert  it might shadow forth his own fatehe having made himself one of the personages  it is a singular thing that at the distance say of five feet the work of the greatest dunce looks just as well as that of the greatest geniusthat little space being all the distance between genius and stupidity  mrs sigourney says after coleridge that poetry has been its own exceeding great reward  for the writing perhaps but would it be so for the reading  four precepts to break off customs to shake off spirits illdisposed to meditate on youth to do nothing against ones genius   salem august 31st 1836a walk yesterday down to the shore near the hospital  standing on the old grassy battery that forms a semicircle and looking seaward  the sun not a great way above the horizon yet so far as to give a very golden brightness when it shone out  clouds in the vicinity of the sun and nearly all the rest of the sky covered with clouds in masses not a gray uniformity of cloud  a fresh breeze blowing from land seaward  if it had been blowing from the sea it would have raised it in heavy billows and caused it to dash high against the rocks but now its surface was not at all commoved with billows there was only roughness enough to take off the gleam and give it the aspect of iron after cooling  the clouds above added to the black appearance  a few seabirds were flitting over the water only visible at moments when they turned their white bosoms towards meas if they were then first created  the sunshine had a singular effect  the clouds would interpose in such a manner that some objects were shaded from it while others were strongly illuminated  some of the islands lay in the shade dark and gloomy while others were bright and favored spots  the white lighthouse was sometimes very cheerfully marked  there was a schooner about a mile from the shore at anchor laden apparently with lumber  the sea all about her had the black iron aspect which i have described but the vessel herself was alight  hull masts and spars were all gilded and the rigging was made of golden threads  a small white streak of foam breaking around the bows which were towards the wind  the shadowiness of the clouds overhead made the effect of the sunlight strange where it fell   septemberthe elmtrees have golden branches intermingled with their green already

instincts of animals questions whether there may not be an abyss of waters within the globe communicating with the ocean and whether the huge animals of the saurian tribegreat reptiles supposed to be exclusively antediluvian and now extinctmay not be inhabitants of it  he quotes a passage from revelation where the creatures under the earth are spoken of as distinct from those of the sea and speaks of a saurian fossil that has been found deep in the subterranean regions  he thinks or suggests that these may be the dragons of scripture  the elephant is not particularly sagacious in the wild state

elderly man laden with two dry yellow rustling bundles of indian cornstalksa good personification of autumn  another man hoeing up potatoes  rows of white cabbages lay ripening  fields of dry indian

deliver his invitations  some of the guests he meets in the streets some he knocks for at the doors of their houses the description must be rapid  but who must be the giver of the feast and what his claims to preside  a man who has never found out what he is fit for who has unsettled aims or objects in life and whose mind gnaws him making him the sufferer of many kinds of misery  he should meet some pious old sorrowful person with more outward calamities than any other and invite him with a reflection that piety would make all that miserable company truly thankful  merry in merry england

a lament for lifes wasted sunshine  a new classification of society to be instituted  instead of rich and poor high and low they are to be classedfirst by their sorrows for instance whenever there are any whether in fair mansion or hovel who are mourning the loss of relations and friends and who wear black whether the cloth be coarse or superfine they are to make one class secondly all who have the same maladies whether they lie under damask canopies or on straw pallets or in the wards of hospitals they are to form one class  thirdly all who are guilty of the same sins whether the world knows them or not whether they languish in prison looking forward to the gallows or walk honored among men they also form a class  then proceed to generalize and classify the whole world together as none

any of the great socalled calamities of human beings were to be abolishedas for instance death  trifles to one are matters of life and death to another  as for instance a farmer desires a brisk breeze

is plotted at last the dead body of one of the lovers or of a dear friend is found there and instead of a pleasurehouse they build a marble tomb  the moralthat there is no place on earth fit for the site of a pleasurehouse because there is no spot that may not have been saddened by human grief stained by crime or hallowed by death  it might be three friends who plan it instead of two lovers and

very singularly  he leads a bachelors life in his paternal mansion only a small part of which is occupied by a family who serve him  he provides his own breakfast and supper and occasionally his dinner though this is oftener i believe taken at the hotel or an eatinghouse or with some of his relatives  i am his guest and my presence makes no alteration in his way of life  our fare thus far has consisted of bread butter and cheese crackers herrings boiled eggs coffee milk and claret wine  he has another inmate in the person of a queer little frenchman who has his breakfast tea and lodging here and finds his dinner elsewhere  monsieur s does not appear to be more than twentyone years olda diminutive figure with eyes askew and otherwise of an ungainly physiognomy he is illdressed also in a coarse blue coat thin cotton pantaloons and unbrushed boots altogether with as little of french coxcombry as can well be imagined though with something of the monkey aspect inseparable from a little frenchman  he is nevertheless an intelligent and wellinformed man apparently of extensive reading in his own languagea philosopher b tells me and an infidel  his insignificant personal appearance stands in the way of his success and prevents him from receiving the respect which is really due to his talents and acquirements wherefore he is bitterly dissatisfied with the country and its inhabitants and often expresses his feelings to b who has gained his confidence to a certain degree in very strong terms  thus here are three characters each with something out of the common way living together somewhat like monks  b our host combines more high and admirable qualities of that sort which make up a gentleman than any other that i have met with  polished yet natural frank open and straightforward yet with a delicate feeling for the sensitiveness of his companions of excellent temper and warm heart well acquainted with the world with a keen faculty of observation which he has had many opportunities of exercising and never varying from a code of honor and principle which is really nice and rigid in its way  there is a sort of philosophy developing itself in him which will not impossibly cause him to settle down in this or some other equally singular course of life  he seems almost to have made up his mind never to be married which i wonder at for he has strong affections and is fond both of women and children  the little frenchman impresses me very strongly tooso lonely as he is here struggling against the world with bitter feelings in his breast and yet talking with the vivacity and gayety of his nation making this his home from darkness to daylight and enjoying here what little domestic comfort and confidence there is for him and then going about all the livelong day teaching french to blockheads who sneer at him and returning at about ten oclock in the evening for i was wrong in saying he supped herehe eats no supper to his solitary room and bed  before retiring he goes to bs bedside and if he finds him awake stands talking french expressing his dislike of the americans je hais je hais les yankeesthus giving vent to the stifled bitterness of the whole day  in the morning i hear him getting up early at sunrise or before humming to himself scuffling about his chamber with his thick boots and at last taking his departure for a solitary ramble till breakfast  then he comes in cheerful and vivacious enough eats pretty heartily and is off again singing french chansons as he goes down the gravelwalk  the poor fellow has nobody to sympathize with him but b and thus a singular connection is established between two utterly different characters  then here is myself who am likewise a queer character in my way and have come to spend a week or two with my friend of half a lifetimethe longest space probably that we are ever destined to spend together for fate seems preparing changes for both of us  my circumstances at least cannot long continue as they are and have been and b too stands between high prosperity and utter ruin  i think i should soon become strongly attached to our way of life so independent and untroubled by the forms and restrictions of society  the house is very pleasantly situatedhalf a mile distant from where the town begins to be thickly settled and on a swell of land with the road running at a distance of fifty yards and a grassy tract and a gravelwalk between  beyond the road rolls the kennebec here two or three hundred yards wide  putting my head out of the window i can see it flowing steadily along straightway between wooded banks but arriving nearly opposite the house there is a large and level sand island in the middle of the stream and just below the island the current is further interrupted by the works of the milldam which is perhaps half finished yet still in so rude a state that it looks as much like the ruins of a dam destroyed by the spring freshets as like the foundations of a dam yet to be  irishmen and canadians toil at work on it and the echoes of their hammering and of the voices come across the river and up to this window  then there is a sound of the wind among the trees round the house and when that is silent the calm full distant voice of the river becomes audible  looking downward thither i see the rush of the current and mark the different eddies with here and there white specks or streaks of foam and often a log comes floating on glistening in the sun as it rolls over among the eddies having voyaged for aught i know hundreds of miles from the wild upper sources of the river passing down down between lines of forest and sometimes a rough clearing till here it floats by cultivated banks and will soon pass by the village sometimes a long raft of boards comes along requiring the nicest skill in navigating it through the narrow passage left by the milldam chaises and wagons occasionally go over the road the riders all giving a passing glance at the dam or perhaps alighting to examine it more fully and at last departing with ominous shakes of the head as to the result of the enterprise  my position is so far retired from the river and milldam that though the latter is really rather a scene yet a sort of quiet seems to be diffused over the whole  two or three times a day this quiet is broken by the sudden thunder from a quarry where the workmen are blasting rocks and a peal of thunder sounds strangely in such a green sunny and quiet landscape with the blue sky brightening the river  i have not seen much of the people  there have been however several incidents which amused me though scarcely worth telling  a passionate tavernkeeper quick as a flash of gunpowder a nervous man and showing in his demeanor it seems a consciousness of his infirmity of temper  i was a witness of a scuffle of his with a drunken guest  the tavernkeeper after they were separated raved like a madman and in a tone of voice having a drolly pathetic or lamentable sound mingled with its rage as if he were lifting up his voice to weep  then he jumped into a chaise which was standing by whipped up the horse and drove off rapidly as if to give his fury vent in that way  on the morning of the fourth of july two printers apprenticelads nearly grown dressed in jackets and very tight pantaloons of check tight as their skins so that they looked like harlequins or circusclowns yet appeared to think themselves in perfect propriety with a very calm and quiet assurance of the admiration of the town  a common fellow a carpenter who on the strength of political partisanship asked bs assistance in cutting out great letters from playbills in order to print martin van buren forever on a flag but b refused  b seems to be considerably of a favorite with the lower orders especially with the irishmen and french canadiansthe latter accosting him in the street and asking his assistance as an interpreter in making their bargains for work  i meant to dine at the hotel with b today but having returned to the house leaving him to do some business in the village i found myself unwilling to move when the dinnerhour approached and therefore dined very well on bread cheese and eggs  nothing of much interest takes place  we live very comfortably in our bachelor establishment on a cold shoulder of mutton with ham and smoked beef and boiled eggs and as to drinkables we had both claret and brown sherry on the dinnertable today  last evening we had along literary and philosophical conversation with monsieur s  he is rather remarkably wellinformed for a man of his age and seems to have very just notions on ethics etc though damnably perverted as to religion  it is strange to hear philosophy of any sort from such a boyish figure  we philosophers he is fond of saying to distinguish himself and his brethren from the christians  one of his oddities is that while steadfastly maintaining an opinion that he is a very small and slow eater and that we in common with other yankees eat immensely and fast he actually eats both faster and longer than we do and devours as bavers more victuals than both of us together   saturday july 8thyesterday afternoon a stroll with b up a large brook he fishing for trout and i looking on  the brook runs through a valley on one side bordered by a high and precipitous bank on the other there is an interval and then the bank rises upward and upward into a high hill with gorges and ravines separating one summit from another and here and there are bare places where the rainstreams have washed away the grass  the brook is bestrewn with stones some bare some partially mossgrown and sometimes so huge asonce at leastto occupy almost the whole breadth of the current  amongst these the stream brawls only that this word does not express its goodnatured voice and murmur is too quiet  it sings along sometimes smooth with the pebbles visible beneath sometimes rushing dark and swift eddying and whitening past some rock or underneath the hither or the farther bank and at these places b cast his line and sometimes drew out a trout small not more than five or six inches long  the farther we went up the brook the wilder it grew  the opposite bank was covered with pines and hemlocks ascending high upwards black and solemn  one knew that there must be almost a precipice behind yet we could not see it at the foot you could spy a little way within the darksome shade the roots and branches of the trees but soon all sight was obstructed amidst the trunks  on the hither side at first the bank was bare then fringed with alderbushes bending and dipping into the stream which farther on flowed through the midst of a forest of maple beech and other trees its course growing wilder and wilder as we proceeded  for a considerable distance there was a causeway built long ago of logs to drag lumber upon it was now decayed and rotten a red decay sometimes sunken down in the midst here and there a knotty trunk stretching across apparently sound  the sun being now low towards the west a pleasant gloom and brightness were diffused through the forest spots of brightness scattered upon the branches or thrown down in gold upon the last years leaves among the trees  at last we came to where a dam had been built across the brook many years ago and was now gone to ruin so as to make the spot look more solitary and wilder than if man had never left vestiges of his toil there  it was a framework of logs with a covering of plank sufficient to obstruct the onward flow of the brook but it found its way past the side and came foaming and struggling along among scattered rocks  above the dam there was a broad and deep pool one side of which was bordered by a precipitous wall of rocks as smooth as if hewn out and squared and piled one upon another above which rose the forest  on the other side there was still a gently shelving bank and the shore was covered with tall trees among which i particularly remarked a stately pine wholly devoid of bark rising white in aged and majestic ruin thrusting out its barkless arms  it must have stood there in death many years its own ghost  above the dam the brook flowed through the forest a glistening and babbling waterpath illuminated by the sun which sent its rays almost straight along its course  it was as lovely and wild and peaceful as it could possibly have been a hundred years ago and the traces of labors of men long departed added a deeper peace to it  i bathed in the pool and then pursued my way down beside the brook growing dark with a pleasant gloom as the sun sank and the water became more shadowy  b says that there was formerly a tradition that the indians used to go up this brook and return after a brief absence with large masses of lead which they sold at the tradingstations in augusta whence there has always been an idea that there is a leadmine hereabouts  great toadstools were under the trees and some small ones as yellow and almost the size of a halfbroiled yolk of an egg  strawberries were scattered along the brookside  dined at the hotel or mansion house today  men were playing checkers in the parlor  the marshal of maine a corpulent jolly fellow famed for humor  a passenger left by the stage hiring an express onward  a bottle of champagne was quaffed at the bar   july 9thwent with b to pay a visit to the shanties of the irish and canadians  he says that they sell and exchange these small houses among themselves continually  they may be built in three or four days and are valued at four or five dollars  when the turf that is piled against the walls of some of them becomes covered with grass it makes quite a picturesque object  it was almost duskjust candlelighting timewhen we visited them  a young frenchwoman with a baby in her arms came to the door of one of them smiling and looking pretty and happy  her husband a dark blackhaired lively little fellow caressed the child laughing and singing to it and there was a redbearded irishman who likewise fondled the little brat  then we could hear them within the hut gabbling merrily and could see them moving about briskly in the candlelight through the window and open door  an old irishwoman sat in the door of another hut under the influence of an extra dose of rumshe being an old lady of somewhat dissipated habits  she called to b and began to talk to him about her resolution not to give up her house for it is his design to get her out of it  she is a true virago and though somewhat restrained by respect for him she evinced a sturdy design to remain here through the winter or at least for a considerable time longer  he persisting she took her stand in the doorway of the hut and stretched out her fist in a very amazonian attitude  nobody quoth she shall drive me out of this house till my praties are out of the ground  then would she wheedle and laugh and blarney beginning in a rage and ending as if she had been in jest  meanwhile her husband stood by very quiet occasionally trying to still her but it is to be presumed that after our departure they came to blows it being a custom with the irish husbands and wives to settle their disputes with blows and it is said the woman often proves the better man  the different families also have battles and occasionally the irish fight with the canadians  the latter however are much the more peaceable never quarrelling among themselves and seldom with their neighbors they are frugal and often go back to canada with considerable sums of money  b has gained much influence both with the irish and the frenchwith the latter by dint of speaking to them in their own language  he is the umpire in their disputes and their adviser and they look up to him as a protector and patronfriend  i have been struck to see with what careful integrity and wisdom he manages matters among them hitherto having known him only as a free and gay young man  he appears perfectly to understand their general character of which he gives no very flattering description  in these huts less than twenty feet square he tells me that upwards of twenty people have sometimes been lodged  a description of a young lady who had formerly been insane and now felt the approach of a new fit of madness  she had been out to ride had exerted herself much and had been very vivacious  on her return she sat down in a thoughtful and despondent attitude looking very sad but one of the loveliest objects that ever were seen  the family spoke to her but she made no answer nor took the least notice but still sat like a statue in her chaira statue of melancholy and beauty  at last they led her away to her chamber  we went to meeting this forenoon  i saw nothing remarkable unless a little girl in the next pew to us three or four years old who fell asleep with her bead in the lap of her maid and looked very pretty a picture of sleeping innocence   july 11th tuesdaya drive with b to hallowell yesterday where we dined and afterwards to gardiner  the most curious object in this latter place was the elegant new mansion of   it stands on the site of his former dwelling which was destroyed by fire  the new building was estimated to cost about thirty thousand dollars but twice as much has already been expended and a great deal more will be required to complete it  it is certainly a splendid structure the material granite from the vicinity  at the angles it has small circular towers the portal is lofty and imposing  relatively to the general style of domestic architecture in our country it well deserves the name of castle or palace  its situation too is fine far retired from the public road and attainable by a winding carriagedrive standing amid fertile fields and with large trees in the vicinity there is also a beautiful view from the mansion adown the kennebec  beneath some of the large trees we saw the remains of circular seats whereupon the family used to sit before the former house was burned down there was no one now in the vicinity of the place save a man and a yoke of oxen and what he was about i did not ascertain  mr  at present resides in a small dwelling little more than a cottage beside the main road not far from the gateway which gives access to his palace  at gardiner on the wharf i witnessed the starting of the steamboat new england for boston  there was quite a collection of people looking on or taking leave of passengersthe steam puffingstages arriving fullfreighted with ladies and gentlemen  a man was one moment too late but running along the gunwale of a mudscow and jumping into a skiff he was put on board by a black fellow  the dark cabin wherein descending from the sunshiny deck it was difficult to discern the furniture lookingglasses and mahogany wainscoting  i met two old college acquaintances o who was going to boston and b with whom we afterwards drank a glass of wine at the hotel  b mons s and myself continue to live in the same style as heretofore  we appear mutually to be very well pleased with each other mons s displays many comical qualities and manages to insure us several hearty laughs every morning and eveningthose being the seasons when we meet  i am going to take lessons from him in the pronunciation of french  of female society i see nothing  the only petticoat that comes within our premises appertains to nancy the pretty darkeyed maidservant of the man who lives in the other part of the house  on the road from hallowell to augusta we saw little booths in two places erected on the roadside where boys offered beer apples etc for sale  we passed an irishwoman with a child in her arms and a heavy bundle and afterwards an irishman with a light bundle sitting by the highway  they were husband and wife and b says that an irishman and his wife on their journeys do not usually walk side by side but that the man gives the woman the heaviest burden to carry and walks on lightly ahead  a thought comes into my mind which sort of house excites the most contemptuous feelings in the beholdersuch a house as mrs all circumstances considered or the boardbuilt and turfbuttressed hovels of these wild irish scattered about as if they had sprung up like mushrooms in the dells and gorges and along the banks of the river mushrooms by the way spring up where the roots of an old tree are hidden under the ground   thursday july 13thtwo small canadian boys came to our house yesterday with strawberries to sell  it sounds strangely to hear children bargaining in french on the borders of yankeeland  among other languages spoken hereabouts must be reckoned the wild irish  some of the laborers on the milldam can speak nothing else  the intermixture of foreigners sometimes gives rise to quarrels between them and the natives as we were going to the village yesterday afternoon we witnessed the beginning of a quarrel between a canadian and a yankeethe latter accusing the former of striking his oxen  b thrust himself between and parted them but they afterwards renewed their fray and the canadian i believe thrashed the yankee soundlyfor which he had to pay twelve dollars  yet he was but a little fellow  coming to the mansion house about suppertime we found somewhat of a concourse of people the governor and council being in session on the subject of the disputed territory  the british have lately imprisoned a man who was sent to take the census and the mainiacs are much excited on the subject  they wish the governor to order out the militia at once and take possession of the territory with the strong hand  there was a british armycaptain at the mansion house and an idea was thrown out that it would be as well to seize upon him as a hostage  i would for the jokes sake that it had been done  personages at the tavern the governor somewhat stared after as he walked through the barroom councillors seated about sitting on benches near the bar or on the stoop along the front of the house the adjutantgeneral of the state two young bluenoses from canada or the provinces a gentleman thumbing his hat for liquor or perhaps playing off the trick of the honest landlord on some stranger  the decanters and winebottles on the move and the beer and soda founts pouring out continual streams with a whiz stagedrivers etc asked to drink with the aristocracy and mine host treating and being treated  rubicund faces breaths odorous of brandyandwater  occasionally the pop of a champagne cork  returned home and took a lesson in french of mons s  i like him very much and have seldom met with a more honest simple and apparently so wellprincipled a man which good qualities i impute to his being by the fathers side of german blood  he looks more like a germanor as he says like a swissthan a frenchman having very light hair and a light complexion and not a french expression  he is a vivacious little fellow and wonderfully excitable to mirth and it is truly a sight to see him laughevery feature partakes of his movement and even his whole body shares in it as he rises and dances about the room  he has great variety of conversation commensurate with his experiences in life and sometimes will talk spanish ore rotundosometimes imitate the catholic priests chanting latin songs for the dead in deep gruff awful tones producing really a very strong impressionthen he will break out into a light french song perhaps of love perhaps of war acting it out as if on the stage of a theatre all this intermingled with continual fun excited by the incidents of the passing moment  he has frenchified all our names calling b monsieur du pont myself m de laubepine and himself m le berger and all knights of the roundtable  and we live in great harmony and brotherhood as queer a life as anybody leads and as queer a set as may be found anywhere  in his more serious intervals he talks philosophy and deism and preaches obedience to the law of reason and morality which law he says and i believe him he has so well observed that notwithstanding his residence in dissolute countries he has never yet been sinful  he wishes me eight or nine weeks hence to accompany him on foot to quebec and then to niagara and new york  i should like it well if my circumstances and other considerations would permit  what pleases much in mons s is the simple and childlike enjoyment he finds in trifles and the joy with which he speaks of going back to his own country away from the dull yankees who here misunderstand and despise him  yet i have never heard him speak harshly of them  i rather think that b and i will be remembered by him with more pleasure than anybody else in the country for we have sympathized with him and treated him kindly and like a gentleman and an equal and he comes to us at night as to home and friends  i went down to the river today to see b fish for salmon with a flya hopeless business for he says that only one instance has been known in the united states of salmon being taken otherwise than with a net  a few chubs were all the fruit of his piscatory efforts  but while looking at the rushing and rippling stream i saw a great fish some six feet long and thick in proportion suddenly emerge at whole length turn a somerset and then vanish again beneath the water  it was of a glistening yellowish brown with its fins all spread and looking very strange and startling darting out so lifelike from the black water throwing itself fully into the bright sunshine and then lost to sight and to pursuit  i saw also a long flatbottomed boat go up the river with a brisk wind and against a strong stream  its sails were of curious construction a long mast with two sails below one on each side of the boat and a broader one surmounting them  the sails were colored brown and appeared like leather or skins but were really cloth  at a distance the vessel looked like or at least i compared it to a monstrous waterinsect skimming along the river  if the sails had been crimson or yellow the resemblance would have been much closer  there was a pretty spacious raised cabin in the after part of the boat  it moved along lightly and disappeared between the woody banks  these boats have the two parallel sails attached to the same yard and some have two sails one surmounting the other  they trade to waterville and thereaboutsnames as paul pry on their sails   saturday july 15thwent with b yesterday to visit several irish shanties endeavoring to find out who had stolen some rails of a fence at the first door at which we knocked a shanty with an earthen mound heaped against the wall two or three feet thick the inmates were not up though it was past eight oclock  at last a middleaged woman showed herself half dressed and completing her toilet  threats were made of tearing down her house for she is a lady of very indifferent morals and sells rum  few of these people are connected with the milldamor at least many are not so but have intruded themselves into the vacant huts which were occupied by the milldam people last year  in two or three places hereabouts there is quite a village of these dwellings with a clay and board chimney or oftener an old barrel smoked and charred with the fire  some of their roofs are covered with sods and appear almost subterranean  one of the little hamlets stands on both sides of a deep dell wooded and bushgrown with a vista as it were into the heart of a wood in one direction and to the broad sunny river in the other there was a little rivulet crossed by a plank at the bottom of the dell  at two doors we saw very pretty and modestlooking young women one with a child in her arms  indeed they all have innumerable little children and they are invariably in good health though always dirty of face  they come to the door while their mothers are talking with the visitors standing straight up on their bare legs with their little plump bodies protruding in one hand a small tin saucepan and in the other an iron spoon with unwashed mouths looking as independent as any child or grown person in the land  they stare unabashed but make no answer when spoken to  ive no call to your fence misser b  it seems strange that a man should have the right unarmed with any legal instrument of tearing down the dwellinghouses of a score of families and driving the inmates forth without a shelter  yet b undoubtedly has this right and it is not a little striking to see how quietly these people contemplate the probability of his exercising itresolving indeed to burrow in their holes as long as may be yet caring about as little for an ejectment as those who could find a tenement anywhere and less  yet the women amid all the trials of their situation appear to have kept up the distinction between virtue and vice those who can claim the former will not associate with the latter  when the women travel with young children they carry the baby slung at their backs and sleeping quietly  the dresses of the newcomers are oldfashioned making them look aged before their time  monsieur s shaving himself yesterday morning  he was in excellent spirits and could not keep his tongue or body still more than long enough to make two or three consecutive strokes at his beard  then he would turn flourishing his razor and grimacing joyously enacting droll antics breaking out into scraps and verses of drinkingsongs a boire a boirethen laughing heartily and crying vive la gaite then resuming his task looking into the glass with grave face on which however a grin would soon break out anew and all his pranks would be repeated with variations  he turned this foolery to philosophy by observing that mirth contributed to goodness of heart and to make us love our fellowcreatures  conversing with him in the evening he affirmed with evident belief in the truth of what he said that he would have no objection except that it would be a very foolish thing to expose his whole heart his whole inner man to the view of the world not that there would not be much evil discovered there but as he was conscious of being in a state of mental and moral improvement working out his progress onward he would not shrink from such a scrutiny  this talk was introduced by his mentioning the ministers black veil which he said he had seen translated into french as an exercise by a miss appleton of bangor  saw by the riverside late in the afternoon one of the abovedescribed boats going into the stream with the water rippling at the prow from the strength of the current and of the boats motion  by and by comes down a raft perhaps twenty yards long guided by two men one at each endthe raft itself of boards sawed at waterville and laden with square bundles of shingles and round bundles of clapboards  friend says one man how is the tide nowthis being important to the onward progress they make fast to a tree in order to wait for the tide to rise a little higher  it would be pleasant enough to float down the kennebec on one of these rafts letting the river conduct you onward at its own pace leisurely displaying to you all the wild or ordered beauties along its banks and perhaps running you aground in some peculiarly picturesque spot for your longer enjoyment of it  another object perhaps is a solitary man paddling himself down the river in a small canoe the light lonely touch of his paddle in the water making the silence seem deeper every few minutes a sturgeon leaps forth sometimes behind you so that you merely hear the splash and turning hastily around see nothing but the disturbed water  sometimes he darts straight on end out of a quiet black spot on which your eyes happen to be fixed and when even his tail is clear of the surface he falls down on his side and disappears  on the riverbank an irishwoman washing some clothes surrounded by her children whose babbling sounds pleasantly along the edge of the shore and she also answers in a sweet kindly and cheerful voice though an immoral woman and without the certainty of bread or shelter from day to day  an irishman sitting angling on the brink with an alder pole and a clothesline  at frequent intervals the scene is suddenly broken by a loud report like thunder rolling along the banks echoing and reverberating afar  it is a blast of rocks  along the margin sometimes sticks of timber made fast either separately or several together stones of some size varying the pebbles and sand a clayey spot where a shallow brook runs into the river not with a deep outlet but finding its way across the bank in two or three single runlets  looking upward into the deep glen whence it issues you see its shady current elsewhere a high acclivity with the beach between it and the river the ridge broken and caved away so that the earth looks fresh and yellow and is penetrated by the nests of birds  an old shining treetrunk half in and half out of the water  an island of gravel long and narrow in the centre of the river  chips blocks of wood slabs and other scraps of lumber strewed along the beach logs drifting down  the high bank covered with various trees and shrubbery and in one place two or three irish shanties   thursday july 20tha drive yesterday afternoon to a pond in the vicinity of augusta about nine miles off to fish for white perch remarkables the

over a city called spartahis advice to b to come amongst the laborers on the milldam because it stimulated them to see a man grinning amongst them  the man took hearty tugs at a bottle of good scotch whiskey and became pretty merry  the fish caught were the yellow perch which are not esteemed for eating the white perch a beautiful silvery roundbacked fish which bites eagerly runs about with the line while being pulled up makes good sport for the angler and an admirable dish a great chub and three horned pouts which swallow the hook into their lowest entrails  several dozen fish were taken in an hour or two and then we returned to the shop where we had left our horse and wagon the pilot very eccentric behind us  it was a small dingy shop dimly lighted by a single inch of candle faintly disclosing various boxes barrels standing on end articles hanging from the ceiling the proprietor at the counter whereon appear gin and brandy respectively contained in a tin pintmeasure and an earthenware jug with two or three tumblers beside them out of which nearly all the party drank some coming up to the counter frankly others lingering in the background waiting to be pressed two paying for their own liquor and withdrawing  b treated them twice round  the pilot after drinking his brandy gave a history of our fishing expedition and how many and how large fish we caught  b making acquaintances and renewing them and gaining great credit for liberality and freeheartednesstwo or three boys looking on and listening to the talkthe shopkeeper smiling behind his counter with the tarnished tin scales beside himthe inch of candle burning down almost to extinction so we got into our wagon with the fish and drove to robinsons tavern almost five miles off where we supped and passed the night  in the barroom was a fat old countryman on a journey and a quack doctor of the vicinity and an englishman with a peculiar accent  seeing bs jointed and brassmounted fishingpole he took it for a theodolite and supposed that we had been on a surveying expedition at supper which consisted of bread butter cheese cake doughnuts and gooseberrypie we were waited upon by a tall very tall woman young and maidenlooking yet with a strongly outlined and determined face  afterwards we found her to be the wife of mine host  she poured out our tea came in when we rang the tablebell to refill our cups and again retired  while at supper the fat old traveller was ushered through the room into a contiguous bedroom  my own chamber apparently the best in the house had its walls ornamented with a small giltframed footsquare lookingglass with a hairbrush hanging beneath it a record of the deaths of the family written on a black tomb in an engraving where a father mother and child were represented in a graveyard weeping over said tomb the mourners dressed in black countrycut clothes the engraving executed in vermont  there was also a wood engraving of the declaration of independence with facsimiles of the autographs a portrait of the empress josephine and another of spring  in the two closets of this chamber were mine hostesss cloak best bonnet and gotomeeting apparel  there was a good bed in which i slept tolerably well and rising betimes ate breakfast consisting of some of our own fish and then started for augusta  the fat old traveller had gone off with the harness of our wagon which the hostler had put on to his horse by mistake  the tavernkeeper gave us his own harness and started in pursuit of the old man who was probably aware of the exchange and well satisfied with it  our drive to augusta six or seven miles was very pleasant a heavy rain having fallen during the night and laid the oppressive dust of the day before  the road lay parallel with the kennebec of which we occasionally had near glimpses  the country swells back from the river in hills and ridges without any interval of level ground and there were frequent woods filling up the valleys or crowning the summits  the land is good the farms look neat and the houses comfortable  the latter are generally but of one story but with large barns and it was a good sign that while we saw no houses unfinished nor out of repair one man at least had found it expedient to make an addition to his dwelling  at the distance of more than two miles we had a view of white augusta with its steeples and the statehouse at the farther end of the town observable matters along the road were the stageall the dust of yesterday brushed off and no new dust contractedfull of passengers inside and out among them some gentlemanly people and pretty girls all looking fresh and unsullied rosy cheerful and curious as to the face of the country the faces of passing travellers and the incidents of their journey not yet damped in the morning sunshine by long miles of jolting over rough and hilly roadsto compare this with their appearance at midday and as they drive into bangor at dusktwo women

about a fortnights absence  he is a plain country squire with a good figure but with rather a heavy brow a rough complexion a gait stiff and a general rigidity of manner something like that of a schoolmaster  he originated in a country town and is a selfeducated man  as he walked down the gravelpath today after dinner he took up a scythe which one of the mowers had left on the sward and began to mow with quite a scientific swing  on the coming of the mower he laid it down perhaps a little ashamed of his amusement  i was interested in this to see a man after twentyfive years of scientific occupation thus trying whether his arms retained their strength and skill for the labors of his youth mindful of the day when he wore striped trousers and toiled in his shirtsleevesand now tasting again for pastime this drudgery beneath a fervid sun  he stood awhile looking at the workmen and then went to oversee the laborers at the milldam   monday july 24thi bathed in the river on thursday evening and in the brook at the old dam on saturday and sundaythe former time at noon  the aspect of the solitude at noon was peculiarly impressive there being a cloudless sunshine no wind no rustling of the forestleaves no waving of the boughs no noise but the brawling and babbling of the stream making its way among the stones and pouring in a little cataract round one side of the mouldering dam  looking up the brook there was a long vistanow ripples now smooth and glassy spaces now large rocks almost blocking up the channel while the trees stood upon either side mostly straight but here and there a branch thrusting itself out irregularly and one tree a pine leaning over not bendingbut leaning at an angle over the brook rough and ragged birches alders the tallest of all the trees an old dead leafless pine rising white and lonely though closely surrounded by others along the brook now the grass and herbage extended close to the water now a small sandy beach  the wall of rock before described looking as if it had been hewn but with irregular strokes of the workman doing his job by rough and ponderous strengthnow chancing to hew it away smoothly and cleanly now carelessly smiting and making gaps or piling on the slabs of rock so as to leave vacant spaces  in the interstices grow brake and broadleaved forestgrass  the trees that spring from the top of this wall have their roots pressing close to the rock so that there is no soil between they cling powerfully and grasp the crag tightly with their knotty fingers  the trees on both sides are so thick that the sight and the thoughts are almost immediately lost among confused stems branches and clustering green leavesa narrow strip of bright blue sky above the sunshine falling lustrously down and making the pathway of the brook luminous below  entering among the thickets i find the soil strewn with old leaves of preceding seasons through which may be seen a black or dark mould the roots of trees stretch frequently across the path often a mossgrown brown log lies athwart and when you set your foot down it sinks into the decaying substanceinto the heart of oak or pine  the leafy boughs and twigs of the underbrush enlace themselves before you so that you must stoop your head to pass under or thrust yourself through amain while they sweep against your face and perhaps knock off your hat  there are rocks mossy and slippery sometimes you stagger with a great rustling of branches against a clump of bushes and into the midst of it  from end to end of all this tangled shade goes a pathway scarcely worn for the leaves are not trodden through yet plain enough to the eye winding gently to avoid treetrunks and rocks and little hillocks  in the more open ground the aspect of a tall fireblackened stump standing alone high up on a swell of land that rises gradually from one side of the brook like a monument yesterday i passed a group of children in this solitary valleytwo boys i think and two girls  one of the little girls seemed to have suffered some wrong from her companions for she was weeping and complaining violently  another time i came suddenly on a small canadian boy who was in a hollow place among the ruined logs of an old causeway picking raspberrieslonely among bushes and gorges far up the wild valleyand the lonelier seemed the little boy for the bright sunshine that showed no one else in a wide space of view except him and me  remarkable items the observation of mons s when b was saying something against the character of the french peopleyou ought not to form an unfavorable judgment of a great nation from mean fellows like me strolling about in a foreign country  i thought it very noble thus to protest against anything discreditable in himself personally being used against the honor of his country  he is a very singular person with an originality in all his notionsnot that nobody has ever had such before but that he has thought them out for himself  he told me yesterday that one of his sisters was a waitingmaid in the rocher de cancale  he is about the sincerest man i ever knew never pretending to feelings that are not in himnever flattering  his feelings do not seem to be warm though they are kindly  he is so singleminded that he cannot understand badinage but takes it all as if meant in earnesta german trait  he values himself greatly on being a frenchman though all his most valuable qualities come from germany  his temperament is cool and pure and he is greatly delighted with any attentions from the ladies  a short time since a lady gave him a bouquet of roses and pinks he capered and danced and sang put it in water and carried it to his own chamber but he brought it out for us to see and admire two or three times a day bestowing on it all the epithets of admiration in the french languagesuperbe magnifique  when some of the flowers began to fade he made the rest with others into a new nosegay and consulted us whether it would be fit to give to another lady  contrast this french foppery with his solemn moods when we sit in the twilight or after b is abed talking of christianity and deism of ways of life of marriage of benevolencein short of all deep matters of this world and the next  an evening or two since he began singing all manner of english songssuch as mrs hemanss landing of the pilgrims auld lang syne and some of mooresthe singing pretty fair but in the oddest tone and accent  occasionally he breaks out with scraps from french tragedies which he spouts with corresponding action  he generally gets close to me in these displays of musical and histrionic talent  once he offered to magnetize me in the manner of monsieur p   wednesday july 26thdined at barkers yesterday  before dinner sat with several other persons in the stoop of the tavern  there were b j a chandler clerk of the court a man of middle age or beyond two or three stage people and near by a negro whom they call the doctor a craftylooking fellow one of whose occupations is nameless  in presence of this goodly company a man of a depressed neglected air a soft simplelooking fellow with an anxious expression in a laborers dress approached and inquired for mr barker  mine host being gone to portland the stranger was directed to the barkeeper who stood at the door  the man asked where he should find one mary ann russella question which excited general and hardly suppressed mirth for the said mary ann is one of a knot of women who were routed on sunday evening by barker and a constable  the man was told that the black fellow would give him all the information he wanted  the black fellow asked  do you want to see her  others of the bystanders or bysitters put various questions as to the nature of the mans business with mary ann  one asked  is she your daughter  why a little nearer than that i calkilate said the poor devil  here the mirth was increased it being evident that the woman was his wife  the man seemed too simple and obtuse to comprehend the ridicule of his situation or to be rendered very miserable by it  nevertheless he made some touching points  a man generally places some little dependence on his wife said he whether shes good or not  he meant probably that he rests some affection on her  he told us that she had behaved well till committed to jail for striking a child and i believe he was absent from home at the time and had not seen her since and now he was in search of her intending doubtless to do his best to get her out of her troubles and then to take her back to his home  some advised him not to look after her others recommended him to pay the doctor aforesaid for guiding him to her which finally the doctor did in consideration of a treat and the fellow went off having heard little but gibes and not one word of sympathy  i would like to have witnessed his meeting with his wife  there was a moral picturesqueness in the contrasts of the scenea man moved as deeply as his nature would admit in the midst of hardened gibing spectators heartless towards him  it is worth thinking over and studying out  he seemed rather hurt and pricked by the jests thrown at him yet bore it patiently and sometimes almost joined in the laugh being of an easy unenergetic temper  hints for charactersnancy a pretty blackeyed intelligent servantgirl living in captain hs family  she

formerly intimate friend  for the first time since we graduated  he has met with good success in life in spite of circumstance having struggled upward against bitter opposition by the force of his own abilities to be a member of congress after having been for some time the leader of his party in the state legislature  we met like old friends and conversed almost as freely as we used to do in college days twelve years ago and more  he is a singular person shrewd crafty insinuating with wonderful tact seizing on each man by his manageable point and using him for his own purpose often without the mans suspecting that he is made a tool of and yet artificial as his character would seem to be his conversation at least to myself was full of natural feeling the expression of which can hardly be mistaken and his revelations with regard to himself had really a great deal of frankness  he spoke of his ambition of the obstacles which he had encountered of the means by which he had overcome them imputing great efficacy to his personal intercourse with people and his study of their characters then of his course as a member of the legislature and speaker and his style of speaking and its effects of the dishonorable things which had been imputed to him and in what manner he had repelled the charges  in short he would seem to have opened himself very freely as to his public life  then as to his private affairs he spoke of his marriage of his wife his children and told me with tears in his eyes of the death of a dear little girl and how it affected him and how impossible it had been for him to believe that she was really to die  a man of the most open nature might well have been more reserved to a friend after twelve years separation than  was to me  nevertheless he is really a crafty man concealing like a murdersecret anything that it is not good for him to have known  he by no means feigns the goodfeeling that he professes nor is there anything affected in the frankness of his conversation and it is this that makes him so very fascinating  there is such a quantity of truth and kindliness and warm affections that a mans heart opens to him in spite of himself  he deceives by truth and not only is he crafty but when occasion demands bold and fierce as a tiger determined and even straightforward and undisguised in his measuresa daring fellow as well as a sly one  yet notwithstanding his consummate art the general estimate of his character seems to be pretty just  hardly anybody probably thinks him better than he is and many think him worse  nevertheless if no overwhelming discovery of rascality be made he will always possess influence though i should hardly think that he would take any prominent part in congress  as to any rascality i rather believe that he has thought out for himself a much higher system of morality than any natural integrity would have prompted him to adopt that he has seen the thorough advantage of morality and honesty and the sentiment of these qualities has now got into his mind and spirit and pretty well impregnated them  i believe him to be about as honest as the great run of the world with something even approaching to highmindedness  his person in some degree accords with his characterthin and with a thin face sharp features sallow a projecting brow not very high deepset eyes an insinuating smile and look when he meets you and is about to address you  i should think that he would do away with this peculiar expression for it reveals more of himself than can be detected in any other way in personal intercourse with him  upon the whole i have quite a good liking for him and mean to go toto see him  observation  a steamengine across the river which almost continually during the day and sometimes all night may

the path and up the opposite rise   tuesday august 1stthere having been a heavy rain yesterday a nest of chimneyswallows was washed down the chimney into the fireplace of one of the front rooms  my attention was drawn to them by a most obstreperous twittering and looking behind the fireboard there were three young birds clinging with their feet against one of the jambs looking at me openmouthed and all clamoring together so as quite to fill the room with the short eager frightened sound  the old birds by certain signs upon the floor of the room appeared to have fallen victims to the appetite of the cat  la belle nancy provided a basket filled with cottonwool into which the poor little devils were put and i tried to feed them with soaked bread of which however they did not eat with much relish  tom the irish boy gave it as his opinion that they were not old enough to be weaned  i hung the basket out of the window in the sunshine and upon looking in an hour or two after found that two of the birds had escaped  the other i tried to feed and sometimes when a morsel of bread was thrust into its open mouth it would swallow it  but it appeared to suffer very much vociferating loudly when disturbed and panting in a sluggish agony with eyes closed or half opened when let alone  it distressed me a good deal and i felt relieved though somewhat shocked when b put an end to its misery by squeezing its head and throwing it out of the window  they were of a slatecolor and might i suppose have been able to shift for themselvesthe other day a little yellow bird flew into one of the empty rooms of which there are half a dozen on the lower floor and could not find his way out again flying at the glass of the windows instead of at the door thumping his head against the panes or against the ceiling  i drove him into the entry and chased him from end to end endeavoring to make him fly through one of the open doors  he would fly at the circular light over the door clinging to the casement sometimes alighting on one of the two glass lamps or on the cords that suspended them uttering an affrighted and melancholy cry whenever i came near and flapped my handkerchief and appearing quite tired and sinking into despair  at last he happened to fly low enough to pass through the door and immediately vanished into the gladsome sunshineludicrous situation of a man drawing his chaise down a sloping bank to wash in the river  the chaise got the better of him and rushing downward as if it were possessed compelled him to run at full speed and drove him up to his chin into

of the river close by the site of an old burialground and near where an ancient fort had been erected for defence against the french and indians  general knox once owned a square of thirty miles in this part of the country and he wished to settle it with a tenantry after the fashion of english gentlemen  he would permit no edifice to be erected within a certain distance of his mansion  his patent covered of course the whole present town of waldoborough and divers other flourishing commercial and country villages and would have been of incalculable value could it have remained unbroken to the present time  but the general lived in grand style and received throngs of visitors from foreign parts and was obliged to part with large tracts of his possessions till now there is little left but the ruinous mansion and the ground immediately around it  his tomb stands near the housea spacious receptacle an iron door at the end of a turfcovered mound and surmounted by an obelisk of marble  there are inscriptions to the memory of several of his family for he had many children all of whom are now dead except one daughter a widow of fifty recently married to hon john h  there is a stone fence round the monument  on the outside of this are the gravestones and large flat tombstones of the ancient burialgroundthe tombstones being of red freestone with vacant spaces formerly inlaid with slate on which were the inscriptions and perhaps coatsofarms  one of these spaces was in the shape of a heart the people were very wrathful that the general should have laid out his grounds over this old burialplace and he dared never throw down the gravestones though his wife a haughty english lady often teased him to do so  but when the old general was dead lady knox as they called her caused them to be prostrated as they now lie  she was a woman of violent passions and so proud an aristocrat that as long as she lived she would never enter any house in the town except her own  when a married daughter was ill she used to go in her carriage to the door and send up to inquire how she did  the general was personally very popular but his wife ruled him  the house and its vicinity and the whole tract covered by knoxs patent may be taken as an illustration of what must be the result of american schemes of aristocracy  it is not forty years since this house was built and knox was in his glory but now the house is all in decay while within a stonesthrow of it there is a street of smart white edifices of one and two stories occupied chiefly by thriving mechanics which has been laid out where knox meant to have forests and parks  on the banks of the river where he intended to have only one wharf for his own west indian vessels and yacht there are two wharves with stores and a lime kiln  little appertains to the mansion except the tomb and the old burialground and the old fort  the descendants are all poor and the inheritance was merely sufficient to make a dissipated and drunken fellow of the only one of the old generals sons who survived to middle age  the mans habits were as bad as possible as long as he had any money but when quite ruined he reformed  the daughter the only survivor among knoxs children herself childless is a mild amiable woman therein totally differing from her mother  knox when he first visited his estate arriving in a vessel was waited upon by a deputation of the squatters who had resolved to resist him to the death  he received them with genial courtesy made them dine with him aboard the vessel and sent them back to their constituents in great love and admiration of him  he used to have a vessel running to philadelphia i think and bringing him all sorts of delicacies  his way of raising money was to give a mortgage on his estate of a hundred thousand dollars at a time and receive that nominal amount in goods which he would immediately sell at auction for perhaps thirty thousand  he died by a chickenbone  near the house are the remains of a covered way by which the french once attempted to gain admittance into the fort but the work caved in and buried a good many of them and the rest gave up the siege  there was recently an

reports of the cannon we heard a horn blown at no great distance the sound coming soon after the report  doubtful whether it came from the shore or a vessel  continued our ringing and snorting and by and by something was seen to mingle with the fog that obscured everything beyond fifty yards from us  at first it seemed only like a denser wreath of fog it darkened still more till it took the aspect of sails then the hull of a small schooner came beating down towards us the wind laying her over towards us so that her gunwale was almost in the water and we could see the whole of her sloping deck

interstices of the clouds and illuminated some of the distant objects very vividly  the white sails of a ship caught it and gleamed brilliant as sunny snow the hull being scarcely visible and the sea around dark other smaller vessels too so that they looked like heavenlywinged things just alighting on a dismal world  shifting their sails perhaps or going on another tack they almost disappear at

looked not unlike a flock of pigeons  on friday a visit to the navy yard at charlestown in company with the naval officer of boston and cilley  dined aboard the revenuecutter hamilton  a pretty cabin finished off with birdseye maple and mahogany two lookingglasses  two officers in blue frocks with a stripe of lace on each shoulder  dinner chowder fried fish corned beefclaret afterwards champagne  the waiter tells the captain of the cutter that captain percival commander of the navy yard is sitting on the deck of the anchor boy which lies inside of the cutter smoking his cigar  the captain sends him a glass of champagne and inquires of the waiter what percival says to it  he said sir what does he send me this damned stuff for but drinks nevertheless  the captain characterizes percival as the roughest old devil that ever was in his manners but a kind goodhearted man at bottom  by and by comes in the steward  captain percival is coming aboard of you sir  well ask him to walk down into the cabin and shortly down comes old captain percival a whitehaired thinvisaged weatherworn old gentleman in a blue quakercut coat with tarnished lace and brass buttons a pair of drab pantaloons and brown waistcoat  there was an eccentric expression in his face which seemed partly wilful partly natural  he has not risen to his present rank in the regular line of the profession but entered the navy as a sailingmaster and has all the roughness of that class of officers  nevertheless he knows how to behave and to talk like a gentleman  sitting down and taking in hand a glass of champagne he began a lecture on economy and how well it was that uncle sam had a broad back being compelled to bear so many burdens as were laid on it alluding to the table covered with winebottles  then he spoke of the fitting up of the cabin with expensive woodsof the brooch in captain scotts bosom  then he proceeded to discourse of politics taking the opposite side to cilley and arguing with much pertinacity  he seems to have moulded and shaped himself to his own whims till a sort of rough affectation has become thoroughly imbued throughout a kindly nature  he is full of antique prejudices against the modern fashions of the younger officers their mustaches and such fripperies and prophesies little better than disgrace in case of another war owning that the boys would fight for their country and die for her but denying that there are any officers now like hull and stuart whose exploits nevertheless he greatly depreciated saying that the boxer and enterprise fought the only equal battle which we won during the war and that in that action an officer had proposed to haul down the stars and stripes and a common sailor threatened to cut him to pieces if he should do so  he spoke of bainbridge as a sot and a poltroon who wanted to run from the macedonian pretending to take her for a lineofbattle ship of commodore elliot as a liar but praised commodore downes in the highest terms  percival seems to be the very pattern of old integrity taking as much care of uncle sams interests as if all the money expended were to come out of his own pocket  this quality was displayed in his resistance to the demand of a new patent capstan for the revenuecutter which however scott is resolved in such a sailorlike way to get that he will probably succeed  percival spoke to me of how his business in the yard absorbed him especially the fitting of the columbus seventyfour of which ship he discoursed with great enthusiasm  he seems to have no ambition beyond his present duties perhaps never had any at any rate he now passes his life with a sort of gruff contentedness grumbling and growling yet in good humor enough  he is conscious of his peculiarities for when i asked him whether it would be well to make a naval officer secretary of the navy he said god forbid for that an old sailor was always full of prejudices and stubborn whimwhams instancing himself whereto i agreed  we went round the navy yard with percival and commodore downes the latter a sailor and a gentleman too with rather more of the ocean than the drawingroom about him but courteous frank and goodnatured  we looked at ropewalks rigginglofts ships in the stocks and saw the sailors of the station laughing and sporting with great mirth and cheerfulness which the commodore said was much increased at sea  we returned to the wharf at boston in the cutters boat  captain scott of the cutter told me a singular story of what occurred during the action between the constitution and macedonianhe being powdermonkey aboard the former ship  a cannonshot came through the ships side and a mans head was struck off probably by a splinter for it was done without bruising the head or body as clean as by a razor  well the man was walking pretty briskly at the time of the accident and scott seriously affirmed that he kept walking onward at the same pace with two jets of blood gushing from his headless trunk till after going about twenty feet without a head he sunk down at once with his legs under him  the corroboration of the truth of this see lord bacon century iv of his sylva sylvarum or natural history in ten centuries paragraph 400  on saturday i called to see e h having previously appointed a meeting for the purpose of inquiring about our name  he is an old bachelor and truly forlorn  the pride of ancestry seems to be his great hobby  he had a good many old papers in his desk at the customhouse which he produced and dissertated upon and afterwards went with me to his sisters and showed me an old book with a record of the children of the first emigrant who came over two hundred years ago in his own handwriting  es manners are gentlemanly and he seems to be very well informed  at a little distance i think one would take him to be not much over thirty but nearer at hand one finds him to look rather venerableperhaps fifty or more  he is nervous and his hands shook while he was looking over the papers as if he had been startled by my visit and when we came to the crossings of streets he darted across cautioning me as if both were in great danger to be run over nevertheless being very quicktempered he would face the devil if at all irritated  he gave a most forlorn description of his life how when he came to salem there was nobody except mr  whom he cared about seeing how his position prevented him from accepting of civilities because he had no home where he could return them in short he seemed about as miserable a being as is to be found anywherelonely and with sensitiveness to feel his loneliness and capacities now withered to have enjoyed the sweets of life  i suppose he is comfortable enough when busied in his duties at the customhouse for when i spoke to him at my entrance he was too much absorbed to hear me at first  as we walked he kept telling stories of the family which seemed to have comprised many oddities eccentric men and women recluses and other kindsone of old philip english a jersey man the name originally langlais who had been persecuted by john hawthorne of witchtime memory and a violent quarrel ensued  when philip lay on his deathbed he consented to forgive his persecutor but if i get well said he ill be damned if i forgive him  this philip left daughters one of whom married i believe the son of the persecuting john and thus all the legitimate blood of english is in our family  e passed from the matters of birth pedigree and ancestral pride to give vent to the most arrant democracy and locofocoism that i ever happened to hear saying that nobody ought to possess wealth longer than his own life and that then it should return to the people etc  he says s i has a great fund of traditions about the family which she learned from her mother or grandmother i forget which one of them being a hawthorne  the old lady was a very proud woman and as e says proud of being proud and so is s i   october 7tha walk in northfields in the afternoon  bright sunshine and autumnal warmth giving a sensation quite unlike the same degree of warmth in summer  oakssome brown some reddish some still green walnuts yellowfallen leaves and acorns lying beneath the footsteps crumple them in walking  in sunny spots beneath the trees where green grass is overstrewn by the dry fallen foliage as i passed i disturbed multitudes of grasshoppers basking in the warm sunshine and they began to hop hop hop pattering on the dry leaves like big and heavy drops of a thundershower  they were invisible till they hopped  boys gathering walnuts  passed an orchard where two men were gathering the apples  a wagon with barrels stood among the trees the mens coats flung on the fence the apples lay in heaps and each of the men was up in a separate tree  they conversed together in loud voices which the air caused to ring still louder jeering each other boasting of their own feats in shaking down the apples  one got into the very top of his tree and gave a long and mighty shake and the big apples came down thump thump bushels hitting on the ground at once  there did you ever hear anything like that cried he  this sunny scene was pretty  a horse feeding apart belonging to the wagon  the barberrybushes have some red fruit on them but they are frostbitten  the rosebushes have their scarlet hips  distant clumps of trees now that the variegated foliage adorns them have a phantasmagorian an apparitionlike appearance  they seem to be of some kindred to the crimson and gold cloudislands  it would not be strange to see phantoms peeping forth from their recesses  when the sun was almost below the horizon his rays gilding the upper branches of a yellow walnuttree had an airy and beautiful effectthe gentle contrast between the tint of the yellow in the shade and its ethereal gold in the fading sunshine  the woods that crown distant uplands were seen to great advantage in these last rays for the sunshine perfectly marked out and distinguished every shade of color varnishing them as it were while the country round both hill and plain being in gloomy shadow the woods looked the brighter for it  the tide being high had flowed almost into the cold spring so its small current hardly issued forth from the basin  as i approached two little eels about as long as my finger and slender in proportion wriggled out of the basin  they had come from the salt water  an indiancorn field as yet unharvestedhuge golden pumpkins scattered among the hills of corna noblelooking fruit  after the sun was down the sky was deeply dyed with a broad sweep of gold high towards the zenith not flaming brightly but of a somewhat dusky gold  a piece of water extending towards the west between high banks caught the reflection and appeared like a sheet of brighter and more glistening gold than the sky which made it bright  dandelions and blue flowers are still growing in sunny places  saw in a barn a prodigious treasure of onions in their silvery coats exhaling a penetrating perfume  how exceeding bright looks the sunshine casually reflected from a lookingglass into a gloomy region of the chamber distinctly marking out the figures and colors of the paperhangings which are scarcely seen elsewhere  it is like the light of mind thrown on an obscure subject  mans finest workmanship the closer you observe it the more imperfections it shows as in a piece of polished steel a microscope will discover a rough surface  whereas what may look coarse and rough in natures workmanship will show an infinitely minute perfection the closer you look into it  the reason of the minute superiority of natures work over mans is that the former works from the innermost germ while the latter works merely superficially  standing in the crossroad that leads by the mineral spring and looking towards an opposite shore of the lake an ascending bank with a douse border of trees green yellow red russet all bright colors brightened by the mild brilliancy of the descending sun it was strange to recognize the sober old friends of spring and summer in this new dress  by the by a pretty riddle or fable might be made out of the changes in apparel of the familiar trees round a house adapted for children  but in the lake beneath the aforesaid border of treesthe water being not rippled but its glassy surface somewhat moved and shaken by the remote agitation of a breeze that was breathing on the outer lakethis being in a sort of bayin the slightly agitated mirror the variegated trees were reflected dreamily and indistinctly a broad belt of bright and diversified colors shining in the water beneath sometimes the image of a tree might be almost traced then nothing but this sweep of broken rainbow  it was like the recollection of the real scene in an observers minda confused radiance  a whirlwind whirling the dried leaves round in a circle not very violently  to well consider the characters of a family of persons in a certain conditionin poverty for instanceand endeavor to judge how an altered condition would affect the character of each  the aromatic odor of peatsmoke in the sunny autumnal air is very pleasant   salem october 14tha walk through beverly to brownes hill and home by the ironfactory  a bright cool afternoon  the trees in a large part of the space through which i passed appeared to be in their fullest glory bright red yellow some of a tender green appearing at a distance as if bedecked with new foliage though this emerald tint was likewise the effect of frost  in some places large tracts of ground were covered as with a scarlet cloththe underbrush being thus colored the general character of these autumnal colors is not gaudy scarcely gay there is something too deep and rich in it it is gorgeous and magnificent but with a sobriety diffused  the pastures at the foot of brownes hill were plentifully covered with barberrybushes the leaves of which were reddish and they were hung with a prodigious quantity of berries  from the summit of the hill looking down a tract of woodland at a considerable distance so that the interstices between the trees could not be seen their tops presented an unbroken level and seemed somewhat like a richly variegated carpet  the prospect from the hill is wide and interesting but methinks it is pleasanter in the more immediate vicinity of the hill than miles away  it is agreeable to look down at the square patches of cornfield or of potatoground or of cabbages still green or of beets looking redall a mans farm in shorteach portion of which he considers separately so important while you take in the whole at a glance  then to cast your eye over so many different establishments at once and rapidly compare thornhere a house of gentility with shady old yellowleaved elms hanging around it there a new little white dwelling there an old farmhouse to see the barns and sheds and all the outhouses clustered together to comprehend the oneness and exclusiveness and what constitutes the peculiarity of each of so many establishments and to have in your mind a multitude of them each of which is the most important part of the world to those who live in itthis really enlarges the mind and you come down the hill somewhat wiser than you go up  pleasant to look over an orchard far below and see the trees each casting its own shadow the white spires of meetinghouses a sheet of water partly seen among swelling lands this brownes hill is a long ridge lying in the midst of a large level plain it looks at a distance somewhat like a whale with its head and tail under water but its immense back protruding with steep sides and a gradual curve along its length  when you have climbed it on one side and gaze from the summit at the other you feel as if you had made a discoverythe landscape being quite different on the two sides  the cellar of the house which formerly crowned the hill and used to be named brownes folly still remains two grassgrown and shallow hollows on the highest part of the ridge  the house consisted of two wings each perhaps sixty feet in length united by a middle part in which was the entrancehall and which looked lengthwise along the hill  the foundation of a spacious porch may be traced on either side of the central portion some of the stones still remain but even where they are gone the line of the porch is still traceable by the greener verdure  in the cellar or rather in the two cellars grow one or two barberrybushes with frostbitten fruit there is also yarrow with its white flower and yellow dandelions  the cellars are still deep enough to shelter a person all but his head at least from the wind on the summit of the hill but they are all grassgrown  a line of trees seems to have been planted along the ridge of the hill  the edifice must have made quite a magnificent appearance  characteristics during the walkappletrees with only here and there an apple on the boughs among the thinned leaves the relics of a gathering in others you observe a rustling and see the boughs shaking and hear the apples thumping down without seeing the person who does it  apples scattered by the wayside some with pieces bitten out others entire which you pick up and taste and find them harsh crabbed ciderapples though they have a pretty waxen appearance  in sunny spots of woodland boys in search of nuts looking picturesque among the scarlet and golden foliage  there is something in this sunny autumnal atmosphere that gives a peculiar effect to laughter and joyous voicesit makes them infinitely more elastic and gladsome than at other seasons  heaps of dry leaves tossed together by the wind as if for a couch and loungingplace for the weary traveller while the sun is warming it for him  golden pumpkins and squashes heaped in the angle of a house till they reach the lower windows  oxteams laden with a rustling load of indian corn in the stalk and ear  when all inlet of the sea runs far up into the country you stare to see a large schooner appear amid the rural landscape she is unloading a cargo of wood moist with rain or salt water that has dashed over it  perhaps you hear the sound of an axe in the woodland occasionally the report of a fowlingpiece  the travellers in the early part of the afternoon look warm and comfortable as if taking a summer drive but as eve draws nearer you meet them well wrapped in topcoats or cloaks or rough great surtouts and rednosed withal seeming to take no great comfort but pressing homeward  the characteristic conversation among teamsters and country squires where the ascent of a hill causes the chaise to go at the same pace as an oxteamperhaps discussing the qualities of a yoke of oxen  the cold blue aspects of sheets of water  some of the country shops with the doors closed others still open as in summer  i meet a woodsawyer with his horse and saw on his shoulders returning from work  as night draws on you begin to see the gleaming of fires on the ceilings in the houses which you pass  the comfortless appearance of houses at bleak and bare spotsyou wonder how there can be any enjoyment in them  i meet a girl in a chintz gown with a small shawl on her shoulders white stockings and summer morocco shoesit looks observable  turkeys queer solemn objects in black attire grazing about and trying to peck the fallen apples which slip away from their bills   october 16thspent the whole afternoon in a ramble to the seashore near phillipss beach  a beautiful warm sunny afternoon the very pleasantest day probably that there has been in the whole course of the year  people at work harvesting without their coats  cocks with their squad of hens in the grassfields hunting grasshoppers chasing them eagerly with outspread wings appearing to take much interest in the sport apart from the profit  other hens picking up the ears of indian corn  grasshoppers flies and flying insects of all sorts are more abundant in these warm autumnal days than i have seen them at any other time  yellow butterflies flutter about in the sunshine singly by pairs or more and are wafted on the gentle gales  the crickets begin to sing early in the afternoon and sometimes a locust may be heard  in some warm spots a pleasant buzz of many insects  crossed the fields near brookhouses villa and came upon a long beach at least a mile long i should thinkterminated by craggy rocks at either end and backed by a high broken bank the grassy summit of which year by year is continually breaking away and precipitated to the bottom  at the foot of the bank in some parts is a vast number of pebbles and pavingstones rolled up thither by the sea long ago  the beach is of a brown sand with hardly any pebbles intermixed upon it when the tide is part way down there is a margin of several yards from the waters edge along the whole mile length of the beach which glistens like a mirror and reflects objects and shines bright in the sunshine the sand being wet to that distance from the water  above this margin the sand is not wet and grows less and less damp the farther towards the bank you keep  in some places your footstep is perfectly implanted showing the whole shape and the square toe and every nail in the heel of your boot  elsewhere the impression is imperfect and even when you stamp you cannot imprint the whole as you tread a dry spot flashes around your step and grows moist as you lift your foot again pleasant to pass along this extensive walk watching the surfwavehow sometimes it seems to make a feint of breaking but dies away ineffectually merely kissing the strand then after many such abortive efforts it gathers itself and forms a high wall and rolls onward heightening and heightening without foam at the summit of the green line and at last throws itself fiercely on the beach with a loud roar the spray flying above  as you walk along you are preceded by a flock of twenty or thirty beach birds which are seeking i suppose for food on the margin of the surf yet seem to be merely sporting chasing the sea as it retires and running up before the impending wave  sometimes they let it bear them off their feet and float lightly on its breaking summit sometimes they flutter and seem to rest on the feathery spray they are little birds with gray backs and snowwhite breasts their images may be seen in the wet sand almost or quite as distinctly as the reality  their legs are long  as you draw near they take a flight of a score of yards or more and then recommence their dalliance with the surfwave  you may behold their multitudinous little tracks all along your way  before you reach the end of the beach you become quite attached to these little seabirds and take much interest in their occupations  after passing in one direction it is pleasant then to retrace your footsteps  your tracks being all traceable you may recall the whole mood and occupation of your mind during your first passage here you turned somewhat aside to pick up a shell that you saw nearer the waters edge  here you examined a long seaweed and trailed its length after you for a considerable distance  here the effect of the wide sea struck you suddenly  here you fronted the ocean looking at a sail distant in the sunny blue  here you looked at some plant on the bank here some vagary of mind seems to have bewildered you for your tracks go round and round and interchange each other without visible reason  here you picked up pebbles and skipped them upon the water  here you wrote names and drew faces with a razor seashell in the sand  after leaving the beach clambered over crags all shattered and tossed about everyhow in some parts curiously worn and hollowed out almost into caverns  the rock shagged with seaweedin some places a thick carpet of seaweed laid over the pebbles into which your foot would sink  deep tanks among these rocks which the sea replenishes at high tide and then leaves the bottom all covered with various sorts of seaplants as if it were some seamonsters private garden  i saw a crab in one of them fivefingers too  from the edge of the rocks you may look off into deep deep water even at low tide  among the rocks i found a great bird whether a wildgoose a loon or an albatross i scarcely know  it was in such a position that i almost fancied it might be asleep and therefore drew near softly lest it should take flight but it was dead and stirred not when i touched it  sometimes a dead fish was cast up  a ledge of rocks with a beacon upon it looking like a monument erected to those who have perished by shipwreck  the smoked extempore fireplace where a party cooked their fish  about midway on the beach a

laid upon the table  towards evening comes the transcript   june 15ththe red light which the sunset at this season diffuse there being showery afternoons but the sun setting bright amid clouds and diffusing its radiance over those that are scattered in masses all over the sky  it gives a rich tinge to all objects even to those of sombre lines yet without changing the lines  the complexions of people are exceedingly enriched by it they look warm and kindled with a mild fire the whole scenery and personages acquire methinks a passionate character  a lovescene should be laid on such an evening  the trees and the grass have now the brightest possible green there having been so many showers alternating with such powerful sunshine  there are roses and tulips and honeysuckles with their sweet perfume in short the splendor of a more gorgeous climate than ours might be brought into the picture  the situation of a man in the midst of a crowd yet as completely in the power of another

wharf with two boatmen who had just landed a man  row round to the starboard side of the sloop where we pass up the steps and are received by bridge who introduces us to one of the lieutenantshazard  sailors and midshipmen scattered aboutthe middies having a foul anchor that is an anchor with a cable twisted round it embroidered on the collars of their jackets  the officers generally wear blue jackets with lace on the shoulders white pantaloons and cloth caps  introduced into the cabina handsome room finished with mahogany comprehending the width of the vessel a sideboard with liquors and above it a lookingglass behind the cabin an inner room in which is seated a lady waiting for the captain to come on board on each side of this inner cabin a large and convenient stateroom with bedthe doors opening into the cabin this cabin is on a level with the quarterdeck and is covered by the poopdeck  going down below stairs you come to the wardroom a pretty large room round which are the staterooms of the lieutenants the purser surgeon etc  a stationary table  the ships mainmast comes down through the middle of the room and bridges chair at dinner is planted against it  wine and brandy produced and bridge calls to the doctor to drink with him who answers affirmatively from his stateroom and shortly after opens the door and makes his appearance  other officers emerge from the side of the vessel or disappear into it in the same way  forward of the wardroom adjoining it and on the same level is the midshipmens room on the larboard side of the vessel not partitioned off so as to be shut up  on a shelf a few books one midshipman politely invites us to walk in another sits writing  going farther forward on the same level we come to the crews department part of which is occupied by the cookingestablishment where all sorts of cooking is going on for the officers and men  through the whole of this space wardroom and all there is barely room to stand upright without the hat on  the rules of the quarterdeck which extends aft from the mainmast are that the midshipmen shall not presume to walk on the starboard side of it nor the men to come upon it at all unless to speak to an officer  the poopdeck is still more sacredthe lieutenants being confined to the larboard side and the captain alone having a right to the starboard  a marine was pacing the poopdeck being the only guard that i saw stationed in the vesselthe more stringent regulations being relaxed while she is preparing for sea while standing on the quarterdeck a great piping at the gangway and the second cutter comes alongside bringing the consul and some other gentleman to visit the vessel  after a while we are rowed ashore with them in the same boat  its crew are new hands and therefore require much instruction from the cockswain  we are seated under an awning  the guns of the cyane are medium thirtytwo pounders some of them have percussion locks  at the tremont i had bridge to dine with me iced champagne claret in glass pitchers  nothing very remarkable among the guests  a winemerchant french apparently though he had arrived the day before in a bark from copenhagen a somewhat corpulent gentleman without so good manners as an american would have in the same line of life but goodnatured sociable and civil complaining of the heat  he had rings on his fingers of great weight of metal and one of them had a seal for letters brooches at the bosom three in a row up and down also a gold watchguard with a seal appended  talks of the comparative price of living of clothes etc here and in europe  tells of the prices of wines by the cask and pipe  champagne he says is drunk of better quality here than where it growsa vendor of patent medicines doctor jaques makes acquaintance with me and shows me his recommendatory letters in favor of himself and drugs signed by a long list of people he prefers he says booksellers to druggists as his agents and inquired of me about them in this town  he seems to be an honest man enough with an intelligent face and sensible in his talk but not a gentleman wearing a somewhat shabby brown coat and mixed pantaloons being illshaven and apparently not well acquainted with the customs of a fashionable hotel  a simplicity about him that is likable though i believe he comes from philadelphianaval officers strolling about town bargaining for swords and belts and other military articles with the tailor to have naval buttons put on their shoregoing coats and for their pantaloons suited to the climate of the mediterranean  it is the almost invariable habit of officers when going ashore or staying on shore to divest themselves of all military or naval insignia and appear as private citizens  at the tremont young gentlemen with long earlocksstraw hats light or darkmixedthe theatre being closed the playbills of many nights ago are posted up against its walls   july 4tha very hot bright sunny day town much thronged booths on the common selling gingerbread sugarplums and confectionery spruce beer lemonade  spirits forbidden but probably sold stealthily  on the top of one of the booths a monkey with a tail two or three feet long he is fastened by a cord which getting tangled with the flag over the booth he takes hold and tries to free it  he is the object of much attention from the crowd and played with by the boys who toss up gingerbread to him while he nibbles and throws it down again  he reciprocates notice of some kind or other with all who notice him there is a sort of gravity about him  a boy pulls his long tail whereat he gives a slight squeak and for the future elevates it as much as possible  looking at the same booth by and by i find that the poor monkey has been obliged to betake himself to the top of one of the wooden joists that stick up high above  there are boys going about with molasses candy almost melted down in the sun  shows a mammoth rat a collection of pirates murderers and the like in wax  constables in considerable number parading about with their staves sometimes conversing with each other producing an effect by their presence without having to interfere actively  one or two old salts rather the worse for liquor in general the people are very temperate  at evening the effect of things rather more picturesque some of the boothkeepers knocking down the temporary structures and putting the materials in wagons to carry away other booths lighted up and the lights gleaming through rents in the sailcloth tops  the customers are rather riotous calling loudly and whimsically for what they want a young fellow and a girl coming arm in arm two girls approaching the booth and getting into conversation with the folks thereabout  perchance a knockdown between two halfsober fellows in the crowd a knockdown without a heavy blow the receiver being scarcely able to keep his footing at any rate shoutings and hallooings laughter oathsgenerally a goodnatured tumult and the constables use no severity but interfere if at all in a friendly sort of way  i talk with one about the way in which the day has passed and he bears testimony to the orderliness of the crowd but suspects one booth of selling liquor and relates one scuffle  there is a talkative and witty seller of gingerbread holding forth to the people from his cart making himself quite a noted character by his readiness of remark and humor and disposing of all his wares  late in the evening during the fireworks people are consulting how they are to get hone many having long miles to walk a father with wife and children saying it will be twelve oclock before they reach home the children being already tired to death  the moon beautifully darkbright not giving so white a light as sometimes  the girls all look beautiful and fairylike in it not exactly distinct nor yet dim  the different characters of female countenances during the daymirthful and mischievous slyly humorous stupid looking genteel generally but when they speak often betraying plebeianism by the tones of their voices  two girls are very tired one a pale thin languidlooking creature the other plump rosy rather overburdened with her own little body  gingerbread figures in the shape of jim crow and other popularities  in the old burialground charter street a slate gravestone carved round the borders to the memory of colonel john hathorne esq who died in 1717  this was the witchjudge  the stone is sunk deep into the earth and leans forward and the grass grows very long around it and on account of the moss it was rather difficult to make out the date other hathornes lie buried in a range with him on either side  in a corner of the burialground close under dr ps garden fence are the most ancient stones remaining in the graveyard mossgrown deeply sunken  one to dr john swinnerton physician in 1688 another to his wife  there too is the grave of nathaniel mather the younger brother of cotton and mentioned in the magnalia as a hard student and of great promise  an aged man at nineteen years saith the gravestone  it affected me deeply when i had cleared away the grass from the halfburied stone and read the name  an appletree or two hang over these old graves and throw down the blighted fruit on nathaniel mathers gravehe blighted too  it gives strange ideas to think how convenient to dr ps family this burialground isthe monuments standing almost within arms reach of the side windows of the parlorand there being a little gate from the back yard through which we step forth upon those old graves aforesaid  and the tomb of the p family is right in front and close to the gate  it is now filled the last being the refugee tory colonel p and his wife  m p has trained flowers over this tomb on account of her friendly relations with colonel p  it is not i think the most ancient families that have tombstheir ancestry for two or three generations having been reposited in the earth before such a luxury as a tomb was thought of  men who founded families and grew rich a century or so ago were probably the first  there is a tomb of the lyndes with a slab of slate affixed to the brick masonry on one side and carved with a coat of arms   july 10tha fishing excursion last saturday afternoon eight or ten miles out in the harbor  a fine wind out which died away towards evening and finally became quite calm  we cooked our fish on a rock named satan about forty feet long and twenty broad irregular in its shape and of uneven surface with pools of water here and there left by the tidedark brown rock or whitish there was the excrement of seafowl scattered on it and a few feathers  the water was deep around the rock and swelling up and downward waving the seaweed  we built two fires which as the dusk deepened cast a red gleam over the rock and the waves and made the sea on the side away from the sunset look dismal but by and by up came the moon red as a house afire and as it rose it grew silvery bright and threw a line of silver across the calm sea  beneath the moon and the horizon the commencement of its track of brightness there was a cone of blackness or of very black blue  it was after nine before we finished our supper which we ate by firelight and moonshine and then went aboard our decked boat againno safe achievement in our ticklish little dory  to those remaining in the boat we had looked very picturesque around our fires and on the rock above themour statures being apparently increased to the size of the sons of anak  the tide now coming up gradually dashed over the fires we had left and so the rock again became a desert  the wind had now entirely died away leaving the sea smooth as glass except a quiet swell and we could only float along as the tide bore us almost imperceptibly  it was as beautiful a night as ever shonecalm warm bright the moon being at full  on one side of us was marblehead lighthouse on the other bakers island and both by the influence of the moonlight had a silvery hue unlike their ruddy beacon tinge in dark nights  they threw long reflections across the sea like the moon  there we floated slowly with the tide till about midnight and then the tide turning we fastened our vessel to a pole which marked a rock so as to prevent being carried back by the reflux  some of the passengers turned in below some stretched themselves on deck some walked about smoking cigars  i kept the deck all night  once there was a little catspaw of a breeze whereupon we untied ourselves from the pole but it almost immediately died away and we were compelled to make fast again  at about two oclock up rose the morning star a round red fiery ball very comparable to the moon at its rising and getting upward it shone marvellously bright and threw its long reflection into the sea like the moon and the two lighthouses  it was venus and the brightest star i ever beheld it was in the northeast  the moon made but a very small circuit in the sky though it shone all night  the aurora borealis shot upwards to the zenith and between two and three oclock the first streak of dawn appeared stretching far along the edge of the eastern horizon a faint streak of light then it gradually broadened and deepened and became a rich saffron tint with violet above and then an ethereal and transparent blue  the saffron became intermixed with splendor kindling and kindling bakers island lights being in the centre of the brightness so that they were extinguished by it or at least grew invisible  on the other side of the boat the marblehead lighthouse still threw out its silvery gleam and the moon shone brightly too and its light looked very singularly mingling with the growing daylight  it was not like the moonshine brightening as the evening twilight deepens for now it threw its radiance over the landscape the green and other tints of which were displayed by the daylight whereas atevening all those tints are obscured  it looked like a milder sunshinea dreamy sunshinethe sunshine of a world not quite so real and material as this  all night we had heard the marblehead clocks telling the hour anon up came the sun without any bustle but quietly his antecedent splendors having gilded the sea for some time before  it had been cold towards morning but now grew warm and gradually burning hot in the sun a breeze sprang up but our first use of it was to get aground on coney island about five oclock where we lay till nine or thereabout and then floated slowly up to the wharf  the roar of distant surf the rolling of porpoises the passing of shoals of fish a steamboat smoking along at a distance were the scene on my watch  i fished during the night and feeling something on the line i drew up with great eagerness and vigor it was two of those broadleaved seaweeds with stems like snakes both rooted on a stoneall which came up together  often these seaweeds root themselves on muscles  in the morning our pilot killed a flounder with the boathook the poor fish thinking himself secure on the bottom  ladurlad in the curse of kehama on visiting a certain celestial region the fire in his heart and brain died away for a season but was rekindled again on returning to earth  so may it be with me in my projected three months seclusion from old associations  punishment of a miserto pay the drafts of his heir in his tomb   july 13tha show of waxfigures consisting almost wholly of murderers and their victimsgibbs and hansley the pirates and the dutch girl whom gibbs murdered  gibbs and hansley were admirably done as natural as life and many people who had known gibbs would not according to the showman be convinced that this waxfigure was not his skin stuffed  the two pirates were represented with halters round their necks just ready to be turned off and the sheriff stood behind them with his watch waiting for the moment  the clothes halter and gibbss hair were authentic  e k avery and cornellthe former a figure in black leaning on the back of a chair in the attitude of a clergyman about to pray an ugly devil said to be a good likeness  ellen jewett and r p robinson she dressed richly in extreme fashion and very pretty he awkward and stiff it being difficult to stuff a figure to look like a gentleman  the showman seemed very proud of ellen jewett and spoke of her somewhat as if this waxfigure were a real creation  strong and mrs whipple who together murdered the husband of the latter  lastly the siamese twins  the showman is careful to call his exhibition the statuary  he walks to and fro before the figures talking of the history of the persons the moral lessons to be drawn therefrom and especially of the excellence of the waxwork  he has for sale printed histories of the personages  he is a friendly easymannered sort of a halfgenteel character whose talk has been moulded by the persons who most frequent such a show an air of superiority of information a moral instructor with a great deal of real knowledge of the world  he invites his departing guests to call again and bring their friends desiring to know whether they are pleased telling that he had a thousand people on the 4th of july and that they were all perfectly satisfied  he talks with the female visitors remarking on ellen jewetts person and dress to them he having spared no expense in dressing her and all the ladies say that a dress never set better and he thinks he never knew a handsomer female  he goes to and fro snuffing the candles and now and then holding one to the face of a favorite figure  ever and anon hearing steps upon the staircase he goes to admit a new visitor  the visitorsa halfbumpkin half countrysquirelike man who has something of a knowing air and yet looks and listens with a good deal of simplicity and faith smiling between whiles a mechanic of the town several decentlooking girls and women who eye ellen herself with more interest than the other figureswomen having much curiosity about such ladies a gentlemanly sort of person who looks somewhat ashamed of himself for being there and glances at me knowingly as if to intimate that he was conscious of being out of place a boy or two and myself who examine wax faces and faces of flesh with equal interest  a political or other satire might be made by describing a show of waxfigures of the prominent public men and by the remarks of the showman and the spectators their characters and public standing might be expressed  and the incident of judge tyler as related by e might be introduced  a series of strange mysterious dreadful events to occur wholly destructive of a persons happiness  he to impute them to various persons and causes but ultimately finds that he is himself the sole agent  moral that our welfare depends on ourselves  the strange incident in the court of charles ix of france he and five other maskers being attired in coats of linen covered with pitch and bestuck with flax to represent hairy savages  they entered the hall dancing the five being fastened together and the king in front  by accident the five were set on fire with a torch  two were burned to death on the spot two afterwards died one fled to the buttery and jumped into a vessel of water  it might be represented as the fate of a squad of dissolute men  a perception for a moment of ones eventual and moral self as if it were another personthe observant faculty being separated and looking intently at the qualities of the character  there is a surprise when this happensthis getting out of ones selfand then the observer sees how queer a fellow he is   july 27thleft home salem on the 23d instant  to boston by stage and took the afternoon cars for worcester  a little boy returning from the city several miles with a basket of empty custardcups the contents of which he had probably sold at the depot  stopped at the temperance house  an old gentleman mr phillips of boston got into conversation with one and inquired very freely as to my character tastes habits and circumstancesa freedom sanctioned by his age his kindly and beneficent spirit and the wisdom of his advice  it is strange how little impertinence depends on what is actually said but rather on the manner and motives of saying it  i want to do you good said he with warmth after becoming apparently moved by my communications  well sir replied i i wish you could for both our sakes for i have no doubt it will be a great satisfaction to you  he asked the most direct questions of another young man for instance are you married having before ascertained that point with regard to myself he told me by all means to act in whatever way observing that he himself would have no objection to be a servant if no other mode of action presented itself  the landlord of the tavern a decent active grave attentive personage giving me several cards of his house to distribute on my departure  a judge a stout hearty country squire looking elderly a hale and rugged man in a black coat and thin light pantaloons  started for northampton at half past nine in the morning  a respectable sort of man and his son on their way to niagaragrocers i believe and calculating how to perform the tour subtracting as few days as possible from the shop  somewhat inexperienced travellers and comparing everything advantageously or otherwise with boston customs and considering themselves a long way from home while yet short of a hundred miles from it  two ladies rather goodlooking  i rode outside nearly all day and was very sociable with the driver and another outside passenger  towards night took up an essencevendor for a short distance  he was returning home after having been out on a tour two or three weeks and nearly exhausted his stock  he was not exclusively an essencepedler having a large tin box which had been filled with dry goods combs jewelry etc now mostly sold out  his essences were of aniseseed cloves redcedar wormwood together with opodeldoc and an oil for the hair  these matters are concocted at ashfield and the pedlers are sent about with vast quantities  colognewater is among the essences manufactured though the bottles have foreign labels on them the pedler was goodnatured and communicative and spoke very frankly about his trade which he seemed to like better than farming though his experience of it is yet brief  he spoke of the trials of temper to which pedlers are subjected but said that it was necessary to be forbearing because the same road must be travelled again and again  the pedlers find satisfaction for all contumelies in making good bargains out of their customers  this man was a pedler in quite a small way making but a narrow circuit and carrying no more than an open basket full of essences but some go out with wagonloads  he himself contemplated a trip westward in which case he would send on quantities of his wares ahead to different stations  he seemed to enjoy the intercourse and seeing of the world  he pointed out a rough place in the road where his stock of essences had formerly been broken by a jolt of the stage  what a waste of sweet smells on the desert air  the essencelabels stated the efficacy of the stuffs for various complaints of children and grown people  the driver was an acquaintance of the pedler and so gave him his drive for nothing though the pedler pretended to wish to force some silver into his hand and afterwards he got down to water the horses while the driver was busied with other matters  this driver was a little dark ragamuffin apparently of irascible temper speaking with great disapprobation of his waybill not being timed accurately but so as to make it appear as if he were longer upon the road than he was  as he spoke the blood darkened in his cheek and his eye looked ominous and angry as if he were enraged with the person to whom he was speaking yet he had not real grit for he had never said a word of his grievances to those concerned  i mean to tell them of it by and by  i wont bear it more than three or four times more said he  left northampton the next morning between one and two oclock  three other passengers whose faces were not visible for some hours so we went on through unknown space saying nothing glancing forth sometimes to see the gleam of the lanterns on wayside objects  how very desolate looks a forest when seen in this wayas if should you venture one step within its wild tangled manystemmed and darkshadowed verge you would inevitably be lost forever  sometimes we passed a house or rumbled through a village stopping perhaps to arouse some drowsy postmaster who appeared at the door in shirt and pantaloons yawning received the mail returned it again and was yawning when last seen  a few words exchanged among the passengers as they roused themselves from their halfslumbers or dreamy slumberlike abstraction meantime dawn broke our faces became partially visible the morning air grew colder and finally cloudy day came on  we found ourselves driving through quite a romantic country with hills or mountains on all sides a stream on one side bordered by a high precipitous bank up which would have grown pines only that losing their footholds many of them had slipped downward  the road was not the safest in the world for often the carriage approached within two or three feet of a precipice but the driver a merry fellow lolled on his box with his feet protruding horizontally and rattled on at the rate of ten miles an hour  breakfast between four and fivenewly caught trout salmon ham boiled eggs and other nicetiestruly excellent  a bunch of pickerel intended for a tavernkeeper farther on was carried by the stagedriver  the drivers carry a timewatch enclosed in a small wooden case with a lock so that it may be known in what time they perform their stages  they are allowed so many hours and minutes to do their work and their desire to go as fast as possible combined with that of keeping their horses in good order produces about a right medium  one of the passengers was a young man who had been in pennsylvania keeping a schoola genteel enough young man but not a gentleman  he took neither supper nor breakfast excusing himself from one as being weary with riding all day and from the other because it was so early he attacked me for a subscription for building up a destitute church of which he had taken an agency and had collected two or three hundred dollars but wanted as many thousands  betimes in the morning on the descent of a mountain we arrived at a house where dwelt the married sister of the young man whom he was going to visit  he alighted saw his trunk taken off and then having perceived his sister at the door and turning to bid us farewell there was a broad smile even a laugh of pleasure which did him more credit with me than anything else for hitherto there had been a disagreeable scornful twist upon his face perhaps however merely superficial  i saw as the stage drove off his comely sister approaching with a lightedup face to greet him and one passenger on the front seat beheld them meet  is it an affectionate greeting inquired i  yes said he i should like to share it whereby i concluded that there was a kiss exchanged  the highest point of our journey was at windsor where we could see leagues around over the mountain a terribly bare bleak spot fit for nothing but sheep and without shelter of woods  we rattled downward into a warmer region beholding as we went the sun shining on portions of the landscape miles ahead of us while we were yet in chillness and gloom  it is probable that during a part of the stage the mists around us looked like sky clouds to those in the lower regions  think of driving a stagecoach through the clouds  seasonably in the forenoon we arrived at pittsfield  pittsfield is a large village quite shut in by mountain walls generally extending like a rampart on all sides of it but with insulated great hills rising here and there in the outline  the area of the town is level its houses are handsome mostly wooden and white but some are of brick painted deep red the bricks being not of a healthy natural color  there are handsome churches gothic and others and a courthouse and an academy the courthouse having a marble front  there is a small wall in the centre of the town and in the centre of the mall rises an elm of the loftiest and straightest stem that ever i beheld without a branch or leaf upon it till it has soared seventy or perhaps a hundred feet into the air  the top branches unfortunately have been shattered somehow or other so that it does not cast a broad shade probably they were broken by their own ponderous foliage  the central square of pittsfield presents all the bustle of a thriving villagethe farmers of the vicinity in light wagons sulkies or on horseback stages at the door of the berkshire hotel under the stoop of which sit or lounge the guests stagepeople and idlers observing or assisting in the arrivals and departures  huge trunks and bandboxes unladed and laded  the courtesy shown to ladies in aiding them to alight in a shower under umbrellas  the dull looks of passengers who have driven all night scarcely brightened by the excitement of arriving at a new place  the stage agent demanding the names of those who are going onsome to lebanon springs some to albany  the toddystick is still busy at these berkshire publichouses  at dinner soup preliminary in city style guests the court people briggs member of congress attending a trial here horsedealers country squires storekeepers in the village etc my room a narrow crib overlooking a back courtyard where a young man and a lad were drawing water for the maidservantstheir jokes especially those of the lad of whose wit the elder fellow being a blockhead himself was in great admiration and declared to another that he knew as much as them both  yet he was not very witty  once in a while the maidservants would come to the door and hear and respond to their jokes with a kind of restraint yet both permitting and enjoying them  after or about sunset there was a heavy shower the thunder rumbling round and round the mountain wall and the clouds stretching from rampart to rampart  when it abated the clouds in all parts of the visible heavens were tinged with glory from the west some that hung low being purple and gold while the higher ones were gray  the slender curve of the new moon was also visible brightening amidst the fading brightness of the sunny part of the sky  there are marblequarries in and near pittsfield which accounts for the fact that there are none but marble gravestones in the burialgrounds some of the monuments well carved but the marble does not withstand the wear and tear of time and weather so well as the imported marble and the sculpture soon loses its sharp outline  the door of one tomb a wooden door opening in the side of a green mound surmounted by a marble obelisk having been shaken from its hinges by the late explosion of the powderhouse and incompletely repaired i peeped in at the crevices and saw the coffins  it was the tomb of rev thomas allen first minister of pittsfield deceased in 1810  it contained three coffins all with white mould on their tops one a small childs rested upon another and the other was on the opposite side of the tomb and the lid was considerably displaced but the tomb being dark i could see neither corpse nor skeleton  marble also occurs here in north adams and thus some very ordinary houses have marble doorsteps and even the stone walls are built of fragments of marble  wednesday 26thleft pittsfield at about eight oclock in the bennington stage intending to go to williamstown  inside passengersa newmarried couple taking a jaunt  the lady with a clear pale complexion and a rather pensive cast of countenance slender and with a genteel figure the bridegroom a shopkeeper in new york probably a young man with a stout black beard black eyebrows which formed one line across his forehead  they were very loving and while the stage stopped i watched them quite entranced in each other both leaning sideways against the back of the coach and perusing their mutual comeliness and apparently making complimentary observations upon it to one another  the bride appeared the most absorbed and devoted referring her whole being to him  the gentleman seemed in a most paradisiacal mood smiling ineffably upon his bride and when she spoke responding to her with a benign expression of matrimonial sweetness and as it were compassion for the weaker vessel mingled with great love and pleasant humor  it was very droll  the driver peeped into the coach once and said that he had his arm round her waist  he took little freedoms with her tapping her with his canelovepats and she seemed to see nothing amiss  they kept eating gingerbread all along the road and dined heartily notwithstanding  our driver was a slender lathelike roundbacked roughbearded thinvisaged middleaged yankee who became very communicative during our drive  he was not bred a stagedriver but had undertaken the business temporarily as a favor to his brotherinlaw  he was a native of these berkshire mountains but had formerly emigrated to ohio and had returned for a time to try the benefit of her native air on his wifes declining healthshe having complaints of a consumptive nature  he pointed out the house where he was married to her and told the name of the country squire who tied the knot  his wife has little or no chance of recovery and he said he would never marry againthis resolution being expressed in answer to a remark of mine relative to a second marriage  he has no children  i pointed to a hill at some distance before us and asked what it was  that sir said he is a very high hill  it is known by the name of graylock  he seemed to feel that this was a more poetical epithet than saddleback which is a more usual name for it  graylock or saddleback is quite a respectable mountain and i suppose the former name has been given to it because it often has a gray cloud or lock of gray mist upon its head  it does not ascend into a peak but heaves up a round ball and has supporting ridges on each side its summit is not bare like that of mount washington but covered with forests  the driver said that several years since the students of williams college erected a building for an observatory on the top of the mountain and employed him to haul the materials for constructing it and he was the only man who had driven an oxteam up graylock  it was necessary to drive the team round and round in ascending  president griffin rode up on horseback  along our road we passed villages and often factories the machinery whirring and girls looking out of the windows at the stage with heads averted from their tasks but still busy  these factories have two three or more boardinghouses near them two stories high and of double lengthoften with beanvines running up round the doors and with altogether a domestic look  there are several factories in different parts of north adams along the banks of a streama wild highland rivulet which however does vast work of a civilized nature  it is strange to see such a rough and untamed stream as it looks to be so subdued to the purposes of man and making cottons and woollens sawing boards and marbles and giving employment to so many men and girls  and there is a sort of picturesqueness in finding these factories supremely artificial establishments in the midst of such wild scenery  for now the stream will be flowing through a rude forest with the trees erect and dark as when the indians fished there and it brawls and tumbles and eddies over its rockstrewn current  perhaps there is a precipice hundreds of feet high beside it down which by heavy rains or the melting of snows great pinetrees have slid or fallen headlong and lie at the bottom or halfway down while their brethren seem to be gazing at their fall from the summit and anticipating a like fate  and then taking a turn in the road behold these factories and their range of boardinghouses with the girls looking out of the windows as aforesaid and perhaps the wild scenery is all around the very site of the factory and mingles its impression strangely with those opposite ones  these observations were made during a walk yesterday  i bathed in a pool of the stream that was out of sight and where its brawling waters were deep enough to cover me when i lay at length  a part of the road along which i walked was on the edge of a precipice falling down straight towards the stream and in one place the passage of heavy loads had sunk it so that soon probably there will be an avalanche perhaps carrying a stagecoach or heavy wagon down into the bed of the river  i met occasional wayfarers once two women in a cartdecent brownvisaged country matronsand then an apparent doctor of whom there are seven or thereabouts in north adams for though this vicinity is very healthy yet the physicians are obliged to ride considerable distances among the mountain towns and their practice is very laborious a nod is always exchanged between strangers meeting on the road  this morning an underwitted old man met me on a walk and held a pretty long conversation insisting upon shaking hands to which i was averse lest his band should not be clean and insisting on his right to do so as being a friend of mankind  he was a gray baldheaded wrinkledvisaged figure decently dressed with cowhide shoes a coat on one arm and an umbrella on the other and said that he was going to see a widow in the neighborhood  finding that i was not provided with a wife he recommended a certain maiden of forty years who had three hundred acres of land  he spoke of his children who are proprietors of a circus establishment and have taken a granddaughter to bring up in their way of life and he gave me a message to tell them in case we should meet  while this old man is wandering among the hills his children are the gaze of multitudes  he told me the place where he was born directing me to it by pointing to a wreath of mist which lay on the side of a mountain ridge which he termed the smoke yonder  speaking of the widow he said my wife has been dead these seven years and why should not i enjoy myself a little  his manner was full of quirks and quips and eccentricities waving his umbrella and gesticulating strangely with a great deal of action  i suppose to help his natural foolishness he had been drinking  we parted he exhorting me not to forget his message to his sons and i shouting after him a request to be remembered to the widow  conceive something tragical to be talked about and much might be made of this interview in a wild road among the hills with graylock at a great distance looking sombre and angry by reason of the gray heavy mist upon his head  the morning was cloudy and all the near landscape lay unsunned but there was sunshine on distant tracts in the valleys and in specks upon the mountaintops  between the ridges of hills there are long wide deep valleys extending for miles and miles with houses scattered along them  a bulky company of mountains swelling round head over round head rises insulated by such broad vales from the surrounding ridges  i ought to have mentioned that i arrived at north adams in the forenoon of the 26th and liking the aspect of matters indifferently well determined to make my headquarters here for a short time  on the road to northampton we passed a tame crow which was sitting on the peak of a barn  the crow flew down from its perch and followed us a great distance hopping along the road and flying with its large black flapping wings from post to post of the fence or from tree to tree  at last he gave up the pursuit with a croak of disappointment the driver said perhaps correctly that the crow had scented some salmon which was in a basket under the seat and that this was the secret of his pursuing us  this would be a terrific incident if it were a dead body that the crow scented instead of a basket of salmon  suppose for instance in a coach travelling along that one of the passengers suddenly should die and that one of the indications of his death would be this deportment of the crow   july 29thremarkable charactersa disagreeable figure waning from middle age clad in a pair of tow homespun pantaloons and a very soiled shirt barefoot and with one of his feet maimed by an axe also an arm amputated two or three inches below the elbow  his beard of a weeks growth grim and grisly with a general effect of black altogether a disgusting object  yet he has the signs of having been a handsome man in his idea though now such a beastly figure that probably no living thing but his great dog would touch him without an effort  coming to the stoop where several persons were sitting good morning gentlemen said the wretch  nobody answered for a time till at last one said i dont know whom you speak to not to me im sure meaning that he did not claim to be a gentleman  why i thought i spoke to you all at once replied the figure laughing  so he sat himself down on the lower step of the stoop and began to talk and the conversation being turned upon his bare feet by one of the company he related the story of his losing his toes by the glancing aside of an axe and with what great fortitude he bore it  then he made a transition to the loss of his arm and setting his teeth and drawing in his breath said that the pain was dreadful but this too he seems to have borne like an indian and a person testified to his fortitude by saying that he did not suppose there was any feeling in him from observing how he bore it  the man spoke of the pain of cutting the muscles and the particular agony at one moment while the bone was being sawed asunder and there was a strange expression of remembered anguish as he shrugged his halflimb and described the matter  afterwards in a reply to a question of mine whether he still seemed to feel the hand that had been amputated he answered that he did always and baring the stump he moved the severed muscles saying there is the thumb there the forefinger and so on then he talked to me about phrenology of which he seems a firm believer and skilful practitioner telling how he had hit upon the true character of many people  there was a great deal of sense and acuteness in his talk and something of elevation in his expressionsperhaps a studied elevationand a sort of courtesy in his manner but his sense had something out of the way in it there was something wild and ruined and desperate in his talk though i can hardly say what it was  there was a trace of the gentleman and man of intellect through his deep degradation and a pleasure in intellectual pursuits and an acuteness and trained judgment which bespoke a mind once strong and cultivated  my study is man said he  and looking at me i do not know your name he said but there is something of the hawkeye about you too  this man was formerly a lawyer in good practice but taking to drinking was reduced to the lowest state  yet not the lowest for after the amputation of his arm being advised by divers persons to throw himself upon the public for support he told them that even if he should lose his other arm he would still be able to support himself and a servant certainly he is a strongminded and ironconstitutioned man hut looking at the stump of his arm he said that the pain of the mind was a thousand times greater than the pain of the body  that hand could make the pen go fast said he  among people in general he does not seem to have any greater consideration in his ruin because of his former standing in society  he supports himself by making soap and on account of the offals used in that business there is probably rather an evil odor in his domicile  talking about a dead horse near his house he said that he could not bear the scent of it  i should not think you could smell carrion in that house said a stage agent  whereupon the soapmaker dropped his head with a little snort as it were of wounded feeling but immediately said that he took all in good part  there was an old squire of the village a lawyer probably whose demeanor was different with a distance yet with a kindliness for he remembered the times when they met on equal terms  you and i said the squire alluding to their respective troubles and sicknesses would have died long ago if we had not had the courage to live  the poor devil kept talking to me long after everybody else had left the stoop giving vent to much practical philosophy and just observation on the ways of men mingled with rather more assumption of literature and cultivation than belonged to the present condition of his mind  meantime his great dog a cleanly looking and not illbred dog being the only decent attribute appertaining to his mastera wellnatured dog too and receiving civilly any demonstration of courtesy from other people though preserving a certain distance of deportmentthis great dog grew weary of his masters lengthy talk and expressed his impatience to be gone by thrusting himself between his legs rolling over on his back seizing his ragged trousers or playfully taking his maimed bare foot into his mouthusing in short the kindly and humorous freedom of a friend with a wretch to whom all are free enough but none other kind  his master rebuked him but with kindness too and not so that the dog felt himself bound to desist though he seemed willing to allow his master all the time that could possibly be spared  and at last having said many times that he must go and shave and dress himselfand as his beard had been at least a week growing it might have seemed almost a weeks work to get rid of ithe rose from the stoop and went his waya forlorn and miserable thing in the light of the cheerful summer morning  yet he seems to keep his spirits up and still preserves himself a man among men asking nothing from them nor is it clearly perceptible what right they have to scorn him though he seems to acquiesce in a manner in their doing so  and yet he cannot wholly have lost his selfrespect and doubtless there were persons on the stoop more grovelling than himself  another charactera blacksmith of fifty or upwards a corpulent figure big in the paunch and enormous in the rear yet there is such an appearance of strength and robustness in his frame that his corpulence appears very proper and necessary to him  a pound of flesh could not be spared from his abundance any more than from the leanest man and he walks about briskly without any panting or symptom of labor or pain in his motion  he has a round jolly face always mirthful and humorous and shrewd and the air of a man well to do and well respected yet not caring much about the opinions of men because his independence is sufficient to itself  nobody would take him for other than a man of some importance in the community though his summer dress is a towcloth pair of pantaloons a shirt not of the cleanest open at the breast and the sleeves rolled up at the elbows and a straw hat  there is not such a vast difference between this costume and that of lawyer h above mentioned yet never was there a greater diversity of appearance than between these two men and a glance at them would be sufficient to mark the difference  the blacksmith loves his glass and comes to the tavern for it whenever it seems good to him not calling for it slyly and shyly but marching steadily to the bar or calling across the room for it to be prepared  he speaks with great bitterness against the new license law and vows if it be not repealed by fair means it shall be by violence and that he will be as ready to cock his rifle for such a cause as for any other  on this subject his talk is really fierce but as to all other matters he is goodnatured and goodhearted fond of joke and shaking his jolly sides with frequent laughter  his conversation has much strong unlettered sense imbued with humor as everybodys talk is in new england  he takes a queer position sometimesqueer for his figure particularly straddling across a chair facing the back with his arms resting thereon and his chin on them for the benefit of conversing closely with some one  when he has spent as much time in the barroom or under the stoop as he chooses to spare he gets up at once and goes off with a brisk vigorous pace  he owns a mill and seems to be prosperous in the world  i know no man who seems more like a man more indescribably human than this sturdy blacksmith  there came in the afternoon a respectable man in gray homespun cloth who arrived in a wagon i believe and began to inquire after supper about a certain new kind of mill machinery  being referred to the blacksmith who owned one of these mills the stranger said that he had come from vermont to learn about the matter  what may i call your name said he to the blacksmith  my name is hodge replied the latter  i believe i have heard of you said the stranger  then they colloquied at much length about the various peculiarities and merits of the new invention the stranger continued here two or three days making his researches and forming acquaintance with several millwrights and others  he was a man evidently of influence in his neighborhood and the tone of his conversation was in the style of one accustomed to be heard with deference though all in a plain and homely way  lawyer h took notice of this manner for the talk being about the nature of soap and the evil odor arising from that process the stranger joined in  there need not be any disagreeable smell in making soap said he  now we are to receive a lesson said h and the remark was particularly apropos to the large wisdom of the strangers tone and air  then he gave an account of the process in his domestic establishment saying that he threw away the whole offals of the hog as not producing any soap and preserved the skins of the intestines for sausages  he seemed to be hospitable inviting those with whom he did business to take a mouthful of dinner with him and treating them with liquors for he was not an utter temperance man though moderate in his potations  i suspect he would turn out a pattern character of the upper class of new england yeomen if i had an opportunity of studying him  doubtless he had been selectman representative and justice and had filled all but weighty offices  he was highly pleased with the new mill contrivance and expressed his opinion that when his neighbors saw the success of his it would be extensively introduced into that vicinity  mem  the hostlers at taverns call the money given them pergasus corrupted from perquisites  otherwise knockdown money  remarkable charactera travelling surgeondentist who has taken a room in the north adams house and sticks up his advertising bills on the pillars of the piazza and all about the town  he is a tall slim young man six feet two dressed in a countrymade coat of light blue taken as he tells me in exchange for dental operations black pantaloons and clumsy cowhide hoots  selfconceit is very strongly expressed in his air and a doctor once told him that he owed his life to that quality for by keeping himself so stiffly upright he opens his chest and counteracts a consumptive tendency  he is not only a dentist which trade he follows temporarily but a licensed preacher of the baptist persuasion and is now on his way to the west to seek a place of settlement in his spiritual vocation  whatever education he possesses he has acquired by his own exertions since the age of twentyonehe being now twentyfour  we talk together very freely and he has given me an account among other matters of all his loveaffairs which are rather curious as illustrative of the life of a smart young country fellow in relation to the gentle sex  nothing can exceed the exquisite selfconceit which characterizes these confidences and which is expressed inimitably in his face his upturned nose and mouth so as to be truly a caricature and he seems strangely to find as much food for his passion in having been jilted once or twice as in his conquests  it is curious to notice his revengeful feeling against the false ones hidden from himself however under the guise of religious interest and desire that they may be cured of their follies  a little boy named joe who haunts about the barroom and the stoop four years old in a thin short jacket and fullbreeched trousers and bare feet  the men tease him and put quids of tobacco in his mouth under pretence of giving him a fig and he gets curaged and utters a peculiar sharp spiteful cry and strikes at them with a stick to their great mirth  he is always in trouble yet will not keep away  they despatch him with two or three cents to buy candy and nuts and raisins  they set him down in a niche of the door and tell him to remain there a day and a half he sits down very demurely as if he meant to fulfil his penance but a moment after behold there is little joe capering across the street to join two or three boys who are playing in a wagon  take this boy as the germ of a tavernhaunter a country roue to spend a wild and brutal youth ten years of his prime in the state prison and his old age in the poorhouse  there are a great many dogs kept in the village and many of the travellers also have dogs  some are almost always playing about and if a cow or a pig be passing two or three of them scamper forth for an attack  some of the younger sort chase pigeons wheeling as they wheel if a contest arises between two dogs a number of others come with huge barking to join the fray though i believe that they do not really take any active part in the contest but swell the uproar by way of encouraging the combatants  when a traveller is starting from the door his dog often gets in front of the horse placing his forefeet down looking the horse in the face and barking loudly then as the horse comes on running a little farther and repeating the process and this he does in spite of his masters remonstrances till the horse being fairly started the dog follows on quietly  one dog a diminutive little beast has been taught to stand on his hind legs and rub his face with his paw which he does with an aspect of much endurance and deprecation another springs at people whom his master points out to him barking and pretending to bite  these tricks make much mirth in the barroom  all dogs of whatever different sizes and dissimilar varieties acknowledge the common bond of species among themselves and the largest one does not disdain to suffer his tail to be smelt of nor to reciprocate that courtesy to the smallest  they appear to take much interest in one another but there is always a degree of caution between two strange dogs when they meet   july 31sta visit to what is called hudsons cave or hudsons falls the tradition being that a man by the name of henry hudson many years ago chasing a deer the deer fell over the place which then first became known to white men  it is not properly a cave but a fissure in a huge ledge of marble through which a stream has been for ages forcing its way and has left marks of its gradually wearing power on the tall crags having made curious hollows from the summit down to the level which it has reached at the present day  the depth of the fissure in some places is at least fifty or sixty feet perhaps more and at several points it nearly closes over and often the sight of the sky is hidden by the interposition of masses of the marble crags  the fissure is very irregular so as not to be describable in words and scarcely to be paintedjetting buttresses mossgrown impending crags with tall trees growing on their verge nodding over the head of the observer at the bottom of the chasm and rooted as it were in air  the part where the water works its way down is very narrow but the chasm widens after the descent so as to form a spacious chamber between the crags open to the sky and its floor is strewn with fallen fragments of marble and trees that have been precipitated long ago and are heaped with driftwood left there by the freshets when the scanty stream becomes a considerable waterfall  one crag with a narrow ridge which might be climbed without much difficulty protrudes from the middle of the rock and divides the fall  the passage through the cave made by the stream is very crooked and interrupted not only by fallen wrecks but by deep pools of water which probably have been forded by few  as the deepest pool occurs in the most uneven part of the chasm where the hollows in the sides of the crag are deepest so that each hollow is almost a cave by itself i determined to wade through it  there was an accumulation of soft stuff on the bottom so that the water did not look more than kneedeep but finding that my feet sunk in it i took off my trousers and waded through up to my middle  thus i reached the most interesting part of the cave where the whirlings of the stream had left the marks of its eddies in the solid marble all up and down the two sides of the chasm  the water is now dammed for the construction of two marble sawmills else it would have been impossible to effect the passage and i presume that for years after the cave was discovered the waters roared and tore their way in a torrent through this part of the chasm while i was there i heard voices and a small stone tumbled down and looking up towards the narrow strip of bright light and the sunny verdure that peeped over the toplooking up thither from the deep gloomy depthi saw two or three men and not liking to be to them the most curious part of the spectacle i waded back and put on my clothes the marble crags are overspread with a concretion which makes them look as gray as granite except where the continual flow of water keeps them of a snowy whiteness  if they were so white all over it would be a splendid show  there is a marblequarry close in the rear above the cave and in process of time the whole of the crags will be quarried into tombstones doorsteps fronts of edifices fireplaces etc  that will be a pity  on such portions of the walls as are within reach visitors have sculptured their initials or names at full length and the white letters showing plainly on the gray surface they have more obvious effect than such inscriptions generally have  there was formerly i believe a complete arch of marble forming a natural bridge over the top of the cave but this is no longer so  at the bottom of the broad chamber of the cave standing in its shadow the effect of the morning sunshine on the dark or bright foliage of the pines and other trees that cluster on the summits of the crags was particularly beautiful and it was strange how such great trees had rooted themselves in solid marble for so it seemed  after passing through this romantic and most picturesque spot the stream goes onward to turn factories  here its voice resounds within the hollow crags there it goes onward talking to itself with babbling din of its own wild thoughts and fantasiesthe voice of solitude and the wildernessloud and continual but which yet does not seem to disturb the thoughtful wanderer so that he forgets there is a noise  it talks along its stormstrewn path it talks beneath tall precipices and high banksa voice that has been the same for innumerable ages and yet if you listen you will perceive a continual change and variety in its babble and sometimes it seems to swell louder upon the ear than at othersin the same spot i mean  by and by man makes a dam for it and it pours over it still making its voice heard while it labors  at one shop for manufacturing the marble i saw the disk of a sundial as large as the top of a hogshead intended for williams college also a small obelisk and numerous gravestones  the marble is coarsegrained but of a very brilliant whiteness  it is rather a pity that the cave is not formed of some worthless stone  in the deep valleys of the neighborhood where the shadows at sunset are thrown from mountain to mountain the clouds have a beautiful effect flitting high over them bright with heavenly gold  it seems as if the soul might rise up from the gloom and alight upon them and soar away walking along one of the valleys the other evening while a pretty fresh breeze blew across it the clouds that were skimming over my head seemed to conform themselves to the valleys shape  at a distance mountain summits look close together almost as if forming one mountain though in reality a village lies in the depths between them  a steamengine in a factory to be supposed to possess a malignant spirit it catches one mans arm and pulls it off seizes another by the coattails and almost grapples him bodily catches a girl by the hair and scalps her and finally draws in a man and crushes him to death  the onearmed soapmaker lawyer h wears an iron hook which serves him instead of a hand for the purpose of holding on  they nickname him black hawk  north adams stillthe village viewed from the top of a hill to the westward at sunset has a peculiarly happy and peaceful look  it lies on a level surrounded by hills and seems as if it lay in the hollow of a large hand  the union village may be seen a manufacturing place extending up a gorge of the hills  it is amusing to see all the distributed property of the aristocracy and commonalty the various and conflicting interests of the town the loves and hates compressed into a space which the eye takes in as completely as the arrangement of a teatable  the rush of the streams comes up the hill somewhat like the sound of a city  the hills about the village appear very high and steep sometimes when the shadows of the clouds are thrown blackly upon them while there is sunshine elsewhere so that seen in front the effect of their gradual slope is lost  these hills surrounding the town on all sides give it a snug and insulated air and viewed from certain points it would be difficult to tell how to get out without climbing the mountain ridges but the roads wind away and accomplish the passage without ascending very high  sometimes the notes of a horn or bugle may be heard sounding afar among these passes of the mountains announcing the coming of the stagecoach from bennington or troy or greenfield or pittsfield  there are multitudes of sheep among the hills and they appear very tame and gentle though sometimes like the wicked they flee when no man pursueth  but climbing a rude rough rocky stumpy ferny height yesterday one or two of them stood and stared at me with great earnestness  i passed on quietly but soon heard an immense baaing up the hill and all the sheep came galloping and scrambling after me baaing with all their might in innumerable voices running in a compact body expressing the utmost eagerness as if they sought the greatest imaginable favor from me and so they accompanied me down the hillside a most ridiculous cortege  doubtless they had taken it into their heads that i brought them salt  the aspect of the village is peculiarly beautiful towards sunset when there are masses of cloud about the skythe remnants of a thunderstorm  these clouds throw a shade upon large portions of the rampart of hills and the hills towards the west are shaded of course the clouds also make the shades deeper in the village and thus the sunshine on the houses and trees and along the street is a bright rich gold  the green is deeper in consequence of the recent rain  the doctors walk about the village with their saddlebags on their arms one always with a pipe in his mouth  a little dog named snapper the same who stands on his hind legs appears to be a roguish little dog and the other day he stole one of the servantgirls shoes and ran into the street with it  being pursued he would lift the shoe in his mouth while it almost dragged on the ground and run a little way then lie down with his paws on it and wait to be pursued again   august 11ththis morning it being cloudy and boding of rain the clouds had settled upon the mountains both on the summits and ridges all round the town so that there seemed to be no way of gaining access to the rest of the world unless by climbing above the clouds  by and by they partially dispersed giving glimpses of the mountain ramparts through their obscurity the separate clouds lying heavily upon the mountains breast  in warm mornings after rain the mist breaks forth from the forests on the ascent of the mountains like smokethe smoke of a volcano then it soars up and becomes a cloud in heaven  but these clouds today were real rainclouds  sometimes it is said while laboring up the mountainside they suddenly burst and pour down their moisture in a cataract sweeping all before it  every new aspect of the mountains or view from a different position creates a surprise in the mind  scenes and charactersa young country fellow twenty or thereabouts decently dressed pained with the toothache  a doctor passing on horseback with his black leather saddlebags behind him a thin frostyhaired man

instrument is introduced  a turn of the doctors hand the patient begins to utter a cry but the tooth comes out first with four prongs the patient gets up half amazed pays the doctor ninepence pockets

praiseworthy neatness  a man with a cradle on his shoulder having been cradling oats  i attended a childs funeral yesterday afternoon  there was an assemblage of people in a plain homely apartment  most of the men were dressed in their ordinary clothes and one or two were in shirtsleeves  the coffin was placed in the midst of us covered with a velvet pall  a bepaid clergyman prayed the audience remaining seated while he stood up at the head of the coffin read a passage of scripture and commented upon it while he read and prayed and expounded there was a heavy thunderstorm rumbling among the surrounding hills and the lightning flashed fiercely through the gloomy room and the preacher alluded to gods voice of thunder  it is the custom in this part of the countryand perhaps extensively in the interior of new englandto bury the dead first in a charnelhouse or common tomb where they remain till decay has so far progressed as to secure them from the resurrectionists  they are then

hardfeatured man with a sly expression of almost hidden grave humor as if there were some deviltry pretty constantly in his mindwhich is probably the case  his brother tells me that he was driven

 a walk this forenoon up the mountain ridge that walls in the town towards the east  the road is cut zigzag the mountain being generally as steep as the roof of a house yet the stage to greenfield passes over this road two or three times a week  graylock rose up behind me appearing with its two summits and a long ridge between like a huge monster crouching down slumbering with its head slightly elevated  graylock is properly the name for the highest elevation  it appeared to better advantage the higher the point from which i viewed it  there were houses scattered here and there up the mountainside growing poorer as i ascended the last that i passed was a mean loghut rough rude and dilapidated with the smoke issuing from a chimney of small stones plastered with clay around it a garden of beans with some attempt at flowers and a green creeper running over the side of the cottage  above this point there were various excellent views of mountain scenery far off and near and one village lying below in the hollow vale  having climbed so far that the road seemed now to go downward i retraced my steps  there was a wagon descending behind me and as it followed the zigzag of the road i could hear the voices of the men high over my head and sometimes i caught a glimpse of the wagon almost perpendicularly above me while i was looking almost perpendicularly down to the loghut aforementioned  trees were thick on either handoaks pines and others and marble occasionally peeped up in the road and there was a limekiln by the wayside ready for burning  graylock had a cloud on his head this morning the base of a heavy white cloud  the distribution of the sunshine amid mountain scenery is very striking one does not see exactly why one spot should be in deep obscurity while others are all bright  the clouds throw their shadows upon the hillsides as they move slowly alonga transitory blackness  i passed a doctor high up the road in a sulky with his black leather saddlebags  hudsons cave is formed by hudsons brook  there is a natural arch of marble still in one part of it  the cliffs are partly made verdant with green moss chiefly gray with oxidation on some parts the white of the marble is seen in interstices grow brake and other shrubs so that there is naked sublimity seen through a good deal of clustering beauty  above the birch poplars and pines grow on the utmost verge of the cliffs which jut far over so that they are suspended in air and whenever the sunshine finds its way into the depths of the chasm the branches wave across it  there is a lightness however about their foliage which greatly relieves what would otherwise be a gloomy scene  after the passage of the stream through the cliffs of marble the cliffs separate on either side and leave it to flow onward intercepting its passage however by fragments of marble some of them huge ones which the cliffs have flung down thundering into the bed of the stream through numberless ages  doubtless some of these immense fragments had trees growing on them which have now mouldered away  decaying trunks are heaped in various parts of the gorge  the pieces of marble that are washed by the water are of a snowwhite and partially covered with a bright green watermoss making a beautiful contrast  among the cliffs strips of earthbeach extend downward and trees and large shrubs root themselves in that earth thus further contrasting the nakedness of the stone with their green foliage  but the immediate part where the stream forces its winding passage through the rock is stern dark and mysterious  along the road where it runs beneath a steep there are high ridges covered with treesthe dew of midnight damping the earth far towards midnoon  i observed the shadows of waterinsects as they swam in the pools of a stream  looking down a streamlet i saw a trunk of a tree which has been overthrown by the wind so as to form a bridge yet sticking up all its branches as if it were

with their tops downward  there is an old man selling the meats of butternuts under the stoop of the hotel  he makes that his station during a part of the season  he was dressed in a dark thin coat ribbed velvet pantaloons and a sort of moccasins or shoes appended to the legs of woollen stockings  he had on a straw hat and his hair was gray with a long thin visage  his nuts were contained in a square tin box having two compartments one for the nuts and another for maple sugar which he sells in small cakes  he had three small tin measures for nutsone at one cent others at two four and six cents and as fast as they were emptied he filled them again and put them on the top of his box  he smoked a pipe and talked with one man about whether it would be worth while to grow young again and the duty of being contented with old age about predestination and freewill and other metaphysics  i asked him what his sales amounted to in the course of a day  he said that butternuts did not sell so well as walnuts which are not yet in season that he might today have sold fifty cents worth of walnuts never less than a dollars worth often more and when he went round with a caravan he had sold fifteen dollars worth per day and once as much as twenty dollars worth  this promises to be an excellent year for walnuts  chestnuts have been scarce for two or three years  he had one hundred chestnuttrees on his own land and last year he offered a man twentyfive cents if he would find him a quart of good chestnuts on them  a bushel of walnuts would cost about ten dollars  he wears a pair of silverrimmed spectacles  a drunken fellow sat down by him and bought a cents worth of his butternuts and inquired what he would sell out to him for  the old man made an estimate though evidently in jest and then reckoned his box measures meats and what little maple sugar he had at four dollars  he had a very quiet manner and expressed an intention of going to the commencement at williamstown

characteristic part of the scene was where the pedlers gingerbreadsellers etc were collected a few hundred yards from the meetinghouse  there was a pedler there from new york state who sold his wares by auction and i could have stood and listened to him all day long  sometimes he would put up a heterogeny this is a word made by mr hawthorne but one that was neededs h of articles in a lotas a paper of pins a leadpencil and a shavingboxand knock them all down perhaps for ninepence  bunches of leadpencils steelpens poundcakes of shavingsoap gilt fingerrings bracelets clasps and other jewelry cards of pearl buttons or steel there is some steel about them gentlemen for my brother stole em and i bore him out in it bundles of wooden combs boxes of matches suspenders and in short everythingdipping his hand down into his wares with the promise of a wonderful lot and producing perhaps a bottle of opodeldoc and joining it with a leadpenciland when he had sold several things of the same kind pretending huge surprise at finding just one more if the lads lingered saying i could not afford to steal them for the price for the remorse of conscience would be worth moreall the time keeping an eye upon those who bought calling for the pay making change with silver or bills and deciding on the goodness of banks and saying to the boys who climbed upon his cart fall down roll down tumble down only get down and uttering everything in the queer humorous recitative in which he sold his articles  sometimes he would pretend that a person had bid either by word or wink and raised a laugh thus never losing his selfpossession nor getting out of humor when a man asked whether a bill were good no do you suppose id give you good money  when he delivered an article he exclaimed youre the lucky man setting off his wares with the most extravagant eulogies the people bought very freely and seemed also to enjoy the fun  one little boy bought a shavingbox perhaps meaning to speculate upon it this character could not possibly he overdrawn and he was really excellent with his allusions to what was passing intermingled doubtless with a good deal that was studied  he was a man between thirty and forty with a face expressive of other ability as well as of humor  a good many people were the better or the worse for liquor  there was one fellownamed randall i thinka roundshouldered bulky illhung devil with a pale sallow skin black beard and a sort of grin upon his facea species of laugh yet not so much mirthful as indicating a strange mental and moral twist  he was very riotous in the crowd elbowing thrusting seizing hold of people and at last a ring was formed and a regular wrestlingmatch commenced between him and a farmerlooking man  randall brandished his legs about in the most ridiculous style but proved himself a good wrestler and finally threw his antagonist  he got up with the same grin upon his featuresnot a grin of simplicity but intimating knowingness  when more depth or force of expression was required he could put on the most strangely ludicrous and ugly aspect suiting his gesture and attitude to it that can be imagined  i should like to see this fellow when he was perfectly sober  there were a good many blacks among the crowd  i suppose they used to emigrate across the border while new york was a slave state  there were enough of them to form a party though greatly in the minority and a squabble arising some of the blacks were knocked down and otherwise maltreated  i saw one old negro a genuine specimen of the slave negro without any of the foppery of the race in our part of the statean old fellow with a bag i suppose of broken victuals on his shoulder and his pockets stuffed out at his hips with the like provender full of grimaces and ridiculous antics laughing laughably yet without affectation then talking with a strange kind of pathos about the whippings he used to get while he was a slavea singular creature of mere feeling with some glimmering of sense  then there was another gray old negro but of a different stamp politic sage cautious yet with boldness enough talking about the rights of his race yet so as not to provoke his audience discoursing of the advantage of living under laws and the wonders that might ensue in that very assemblage if there were no laws in the midst of this deep wisdom turning off the anger of a halfdrunken fellow by a merry retort a leap in the air and a negros laugh  i was interestedthere being a drunken negro ascending the meetinghouse steps and near him three or four welldressed and decent negro wenchesto see the look of scorn and shame and sorrow and painful sympathy which one of them assumed at this disgrace of her color  the people here show out their character much more strongly than they do with us there was not the quiet silent dull decency of our public assemblages but mirth anger eccentricityall manifesting themselves freely  there were many watermelons for sale and people burying their muzzles deep in the juicy flesh of them  there were cider and beer many of the people had their mouths half opened in a grin which more than anything else i think indicates a low stage of refinement  a lowcrowned hatvery lowis common  they are respectful to gentlemen  a bat being startled probably out of the meetinghouse by the commotion around flew blindly about in the sunshine and alighted on a mans sleeve  i looked at hima droll winged beastinsect creeping up the mans arm not overclean and scattering dust on the mans coat from his vampire wings  the man stared at him and let the spectators stare for a minute and then shook him gently off and the poor devil took a flight across the green to the meetinghouse and then i believe alighted on somebody else  probably he was put to death  bats are very numerous in these parts  there was a drunken man annoying people with his senseless talk and impertinences impelled to perform eccentricities by an evil spirit in him and a pale little boy with a bandaged leg whom his father brought out of the tavern and put into a barouche  then the boy heedfully placed shawls and cushions about his leg to support it his face expressive of pain and carenot transitory but settled pain of long and forcedly patient endurance and this painful look perhaps gave his face more intelligence than it might otherwise have had though it was naturally a sensitive face  welldressed ladies were in the meetinghouse in silks and cambricsthe sunburnt necks in contiguity with the delicate fabrics of the dresses showing the yeomens daughters  country graduatesrough brownfeatured schoolmasterlooking halfbumpkin halfscholarly figures in black illcut broadcloththeir manners quite spoilt by what little of the gentleman there was in them  the landlord of the tavern keeping his eye on a man whom he suspected of an intention to bolt  a word meaning in worcester i find to spring out with speed and suddennesss h  the next day after commencement was bleak and rainy from midnight till midnight and a good many guests were added to our table in consequence among them were some of the williamstown students gentlemanly young fellows with a brotherly feeling for each other a freedom about money concerns a halfboyish halfmanly character and my heart warmed to them  they took their departuretwo for south adams and two across the green mountainsin the midst of the rain  there was one of the graduates with his betrothed and his brotherinlaw and wife who stayed during the daythe graduate the very model of a country schoolmaster in his sunday clothes being his commencement suit of black broadcloth and pumps  he is engaged as assistant teacher of the academy at shelburne falls  there was also the high sheriff of berkshire mr twining with a bundle of writs under his arm and some of them peeping out of his pockets  also several trojan men and women who had been to commencement  likewise a young clergyman graduate of brown college and student of the divinity school at cambridge  he had come across the hoosic or green mountains about eighteen miles on foot from charlemont where he is preaching and had been to commencement  knowing little of men and matters and desiring to know more he was very free in making acquaintance with people but could not do it handsomely  a singular smile broke out upon his face on slight provocation  he was awkward in his manners yet it was not an ungentlemanly awkwardness intelligent as respects booklearning but much deficient in worldly tact  it was pleasant to observe his consciousness of this deficiency and how he strove to remedy it by mixing as much as possible with people and sitting almost all day in the barroom to study character  sometimes he would endeavor to contribute his share to the general amusementas by growling comically to provoke and mystify a dog and by some bashful and halfapropos observations  in the afternoon there came a fresh bevy of students onward from williamstown but they made only a transient visit though it was still raining  these were a roughhewn heavy set of fellows from the hills and woods in this neighborhoodgreat unpolished bumpkins who had grown up farmerboys and had little of the literary man save green spectacles and black broadcloth which all of them had not talking with a broad accent and laughing clownlike while sheepishness overspread all together with a vanity at being students  one of the party was six feet seven inches high and all his herculean dimensions were in proportion his features too were cast in a mould suitable to his stature  this giant was not illlooking but of a rattier intelligent aspect  his motions were devoid of grace but yet had a rough freedom appropriate enough to such a figure  these fellows stayed awhile talked uncouthly about college matters and started in the great open wagon which had brought them and their luggage hither  we had a fire in the barroom almost all daya great blazing fireand it was pleasant to have this day of bleak november weather and cheerful fireside talk and wet garments smoking in the fireside heat still in the summertime  thus the day wore on with a sort of heavy lazy pleasantness and night set in still stormy  in the morning it was cloudy but did not rain and i went with the little clergyman to hudsons cave  the stream which they call the north branch and into which hudsons brook empties was much swollen and tumbled and dashed and whitened over the rocks and formed real cascades over the dams and rushed fast along the side of the cliffs which had their feet in it  its color was deep brown owing to the washing of the banks which the rain had poured into it  looking back we could see a cloud on graylock but on other parts of saddle mountain there were spots of sunshine some of most glorious brightness contrasting with the general gloom of the sky and the deep shadow which lay on the earth  we looked at the spot where the stream makes its entrance into the marble cliff and it was this morning at least the most striking view of the cave  the water dashed down in a misty cascade through what looked like the portal of some infernal subterranean structure and far within the portal we could see the mist and the falling water and it looked as if but for these obstructions of view we might have had a deeper insight into a gloomy region  after our return the little minister set off for his eighteen miles journey across the mountain and i was occupied the rest of the forenoon with an affair of stealinga woman of forty or upwards being accused of stealing a needlecase and other trifles from a factorygirl at a boardinghouse  she came here to take passage in a stage but putnam a justice of the peace examined her and afterwards ordered her to be searched by laura and eliza the chambermaid and tablewaiter  hereupon was much fun and some sympathy  they searched and found nothing that they sought though she gave up a pair of pantalets which she pretended to have taken by mistake  afterwards she being in the parlor i went in and she immediately began to talk to me giving me an account of the affair speaking with the bitterness of a wronged person with a sparkling eye yet with great fluency and selfpossession  she is a yellow thin and battered old thing yet rather countryladylike in aspect and manners  i heard eliza telling another girl about it under my window and she seemed to think that the poor womans reluctance to be searched arose from the poorness of her wardrobe and of the contents of her bandbox  at parting eliza said to the girl what do you think i heard somebody say about you  that it was enough to make anybodys eyes start square out of their head to look at such red cheeks as yours  whereupon the girl turned off the compliment with a laugh and took her leave  there is an old blind dog recognizing his friends by the sense of smell i observe the eager awkwardness with which he accomplishes the recognition his carefulness in descending steps and generally in his locomotion  he evidently has not forgotten that he once had the faculty of sight for he turns his eyes with earnestness towards those who attract his attention though the orbs are plainly sightless  here is an englishmana thoroughgoing tory and monarchistupholding everything english government people habits education manufactures modes of living and expressing his dislike of all americanismsand this in a quiet calm reasonable way as if it were quite proper to live in a country and draw his subsistence from it and openly abuse it  he imports his clothes from england and expatiates on the superiority of english boots hats cravats etc  he is a man of unmalleable habits and wears his dress of the same fashion as that of twenty years ago   august 18ththere has come one of the proprietors or superintendents of a caravan of animalsa large portly paunched darkcomplexioned brandyburnt heavyfaced man of about fifty with a diminutive nose in proportion to the size of his facethick lips nevertheless he has the air of a man who has seen much and derived such experience as was for his purpose  also it is the air of a man not in a subordinate station though vulgar and coarse  he arrived in a wagon with a span of handsome gray horses and ordered dinner  he had left his caravan at worcester and came from thence and over the mountain hither to settle stoppingplaces for the caravan  the nearest place to this  i believe was charlemont the penultimate at greenfield  in stopping at such a village as this they do not expect much profit if any but would be content with enough to pay their travelling expenses while they look to gather gain at larger places  in this village it seems the selectmen had resolved not to license any public exhibition of the kind and it was interesting to attend to the consultations whether it were feasible to overcome the objections and what might be the best means  orrin s and the chance passersby took part in the discussion  the scruple is that the factorygirls having ready money by them spend it for these nonsenses quitting their work whereas were it a mere farmingtown the caravan would take little in proportion to their spendings  the opinion generally was that the license could not be obtained and the portly mans face grew darker and downcast at the prospect and he took out a travellingmap and looked it carefully over to discover some other station  this is something like the planning of the march of an army it was finally resolved to enlist the influence of a brotherinlaw of the head selectman and try to gain his consent  whereupon the caravanman and the brotherinlaw who being a tavernkeeper was to divide the custom of the caravan people with this house went to make the attemptthe caravanman stalking along with stiff awkward bulk and stature yet preserving a respectability withal though with somewhat of the blackguard  before he went he offered a wager of a drink of rum to a thaw of tobacco that he did not succeed  when he came back there was a flush in his face and a sparkle in his eye that did not look like failure but i know not what was the result  he took a glass of wine with the brotherinlawa grave thin frostyhaired shrewdlooking yeoman in his shirtsleevesthen ordered his horses paid his bill and drove off accompanied still by the same yeoman perhaps to get the permission of the other two selectmen  if he does not get a license here he will try at cheshire  a fellow appears with a pink guardchain and two breastpins in his shirtone a masonic one of gold with compass and square and the other of colored glass set in filigree brassand the shirt a soiled one  a tendency to obesity is more common in this part of the country than i have noticed it elsewhere   august 19thi drove with orrin s last evening to an old farmers house to get some chickens  entering the kitchen i observed a fireplace with rough stone jambs and back and a marble hearth cracked and otherwise contrasting a roughness of workmanship with the value of the material  there was a clock without a case the weights being visible and the pendulum swinging in airand a coffeemill fixed against the wall  a religious newspaper lay on the mantelpiece  the old farmer was reluctant to go after the fowls declaring that it would be impossible to find them in the dark but orrin insisting he lighted a lamp and we all went together and quickly found them roosted about the woodpile whereupon orrin speedily laid hands on five and wrung their necks in a twinkling they fluttering long after they should have been dead  when we had taken our departure orrin remarked how fainthearted these old fellows are and it was a good observation for it was the farmers timorous age that made him doubt the practicability of catching the chickens and it contrasted well with the persevering energy of the middleaged orrin  but orrin inquired somewhat dolefully whether i should suppose that he himself bewailed the advances of age  it is a grievous point with him  in the evening there was a strange fellow in the barrooma sort of mock methodista cattledrover who had stopped here for the night with two cows and a durham bull  all his talk turned upon religion and he would ever and anon burst out in some strain of scripturalstyled eloquence chanted through his nose like an exhortation at a campmeeting  a group of universalists and noreligionists sat around him making him their butt and holding wild argument with him and he strangely mingled humor with his enthusiasm and enthusiasm with his humor so that it was almost impossible to tell whether he were in jest or earnest  probably it was neither but an eccentricity an almost monomania that has grown upon himperhaps the result of strong religious excitement  and having been a backslider he is cursed with a halffrenzied humor  in the morning he talked in the same strain at breakfast while quaffing fourteen cups of teaeliza all the while as she supplied him entreating him not to drink any more  after breakfast it being the sabbath he drove his two cows and bull past the stoop raising his stair and running after them with strange uncouth gestures and the last word i heard from him was an exhortation gentlemen now all of you take your bibles and meditate on divine thingsthis being uttered with raised hands and a methodistical tone intermingled as was his expression with something humorous so that to the last the puzzle was still kept up whether he was an enthusiast or a jester  he wore a suit of coarse brown cloth cut in rather a quaker fashion and he had a large nose and his face expressed enthusiasm and honora sort of smile and twinkle of the eye with wildness  he is excellent at a bargain and if in the midst of his ghostly exhortation the talk were turned on cattle he eagerly seized the topic and expatiated on it  while this fellow was enumerating the universalists in neighboring towns who had turned from their errors on their deathbeds some one exclaimed john hodges why he isnt deadhes alive and well  whereat there was a roar of laughter  while holding an argument at table i heard him mutter to himself at something that his adversary said and though i could not distinguish what it was the tone did more to convince me of some degree of earnestness than aught beside  this character might be wrought into a strange portrait of something sad terrific and laughable  the sabbath wore away lazily and therefore wickedly  the heavy caravanman inquired for some book of light reading and having obtained an old volume of a literary paper betook himself to the seat of his wagon to read  at other times he smoked and talked sensibly enough with anybody that offered  he is a man of sense though not quick and seems to be a fair man  when he walks he puts the thumb of each hand into the armhole of his waistcoat and moves along stiffly with a knockkneed gait  his talk was chiefly of hotels and such matters as a man always travelling without any purpose of observation for mental improvement would be interested in  he spoke of his life as a hard one  there was a methodist quarterly meeting here and a lovefeast  there is a fellow hereabout who refuses to pay six dollars for the coffin in which his wife was buried  she died about six months since and i believe he is already engaged to another  he is young and rather comely but has not a straightforward look  one man plods along looking always on the ground without ever lifting his eyes to the mountain scenery and forest and clouds above and around him  another walks the street with a quick prying eye and sharp facethe most expressive possible of one on the lookout for gainof the most disagreeable class of yankees  there is also a sourlooking unwholesome boy the son of this man whose voice is querulous and illnatured precisely suited to his aspect  so is his character  we have another with indian blood in him and the straight black hair something of the tawny skin and the quick shining eye of the indian  he seems reserved but is not illnatured when spoken to  there is so much of the white in him that he gives the impression of belonging to a civilized race which causes the more strange sensation on discovering that he has a wild lineage   august 22di walked out into what is called the notch this forenoon between saddle mountain and another  there are good farms in this notch although the ground is considerably elevatedthis morning indeed above the clouds for i penetrated through one in reaching the higher region although i found sunshine there  graylock was hidden in clouds and the rest of saddle mountain had one partially wreathed about it but it was withdrawn before long  it was very beautiful cloudscenery  the clouds lay on the breast of the mountain dense white welldefined and some of them were in such close vicinity that it seemed as if i could infold myself in them while others belonging to the same fleet were floating through the blue sky above  i had a view of williamstown at the distance of a few milestwo or three perhapsa white village and steeple in a gradual hollow with high mountainous swells heaving themselves up like immense subsiding waves far and wide around it  on these high mountainwaves rested the white summer clouds or they rested as still in the air above and they were formed in such fantastic shapes that they gave the strongest possible impression of being confounded or intermixed with the sky  it was like a daydream to look at it and the students ought to be daydreamers all of themwhen cloudland is one and the same thing with the substantial earth  by degrees all these clouds flitted away and the sultry summer sun burned on hill and valley as i was walking home an old man came down the mountainpath behind me in a wagon and gave me a drive to the village  visitors being few in the notch the women and girls looked from the windows after me the men nodded and greeted me with a look of curiosity and two little girls whom i met bearing tin pails whispered one another and smiled   north adams august 23dthe county commissioners held a court in the barroom yesterday afternoon for the purpose of letting out the making of the new road over the mountain  the commissioners sat together in attitudes of some dignity with one leg laid across another and the people to the number of twenty or thirty sat round about with their hats on in their shirtsleeves with but little yet with some formality  several had come from a distance to bid for the job  they sat with whips in their hands  the first bid was three dollarsthen there was a long silencethen a bid of two dollars eightyfive cents and finally it was knocked down at two eighteen per rod  a disposition to bid was evidenced in one man by his joking on the bid of another  after supper as the sun was setting a man passed by the door with a handorgan connected with which was a row of figures such as dancers pirouetting and turning a lady playing on a piano soldiers a negro wench dancing and opening and shutting a huge red mouthall these keeping time to the lively or slow tunes of the organ  the man had a pleasant but sly dark face he carried his whole establishment on his shoulder it being fastened to a staff which he rested on the ground when he performed  a little crowd of people gathered about him on the stoop peeping over each others heads with huge admirationfat otis hodge and the tall stagedriver and the little boys all declaring that it was the masterpiece of sights  some few coppers did the man obtain as well as much praise  he had come over the high solitary mountain where for miles there could hardly be a soul to hear his music  in the evening a portly old commissioner a cheerful man enough was sitting reading the newspaper in the parlor holding the candle between the newspaper and his eyesits rays glittering on his silverbowed spectacles and silvery hair  a pensive mood of age had come upon him and sometimes he heaved a long sigh while he turned and returned the paper and folded it for convenient reading  by and by a gentleman came to see him and he talked with him cheerfully  the fat old squire whom i have mentioned more than once is an odd figure with his bluff red facecoarsely redset in silver hair his clumsy legs which he moves in a strange straddle using i believe a broomstick for a staff  the breadth of back of these fat men is truly a wonder  a decent man at table the other day took the only remaining potato out of the dish on the end of his knife and offered his friend half of it  the mountains look much larger and more majestic sometimes than at otherspartly because the mind may be variously disposed so as to comprehend them more or less and partly that an imperceptible or almost so haze adds a great deal to the effect  saddleback often looks a huge black massblackgreen or blackblue  the cave makes a fresh impression upon me every time i visit itso deep so irregular so gloomy so sternpart of its walls the pure white of the marbleothers covered with a gray decomposition and with spots of moss and with brake growing where there is a handful of earth i stand and look into its depths at various points and hear the roar of the stream reechoing up  it is like a heart that has been rent asunder by a torrent of passion which has raged and foamed and left its ineffaceable traces though now there is but a little rill of feeling at the bottom  in parts trees have fallen across the fissuretrees with large trunks  i bathed in the stream in this old secluded spot which i frequent for that purpose  to reach it i cross one branch of the stream on stones and then pass to the other side of a little island overgrown with trees and underbrush  where i bathe the stream has partially dammed itself up by sweeping together treetrunks and slabs and branches and a thousand things that have come down its current for years perhaps so that there is a deep pool full of eddies and little whirlpools which would carry me away did i not take hold of the stem of a small tree that lies opportunely transversely across the water  the bottom is uneven with rocks of various size against which it is difficult to keep from stumbling so rapid is the stream  sometimes it bears along branches and strips of barksometimes a green leaf or perchance a dry one occasionally overwhelmed by the eddies and borne deep under water then rushing atop the waves  the forest bordering the stream produces its effect by a complexity of causesthe old and stern trees with stately trunks and dark foliage as the almost black pinesthe young trees with lightsome green foliageas sapling oaks maples and poplarsthen the old decayed trunks that are seen lying here and there all mouldered so that the foot would sink into them  the sunshine falling capriciously on a casual branch considerably within the forest verge while it leaves nearer trees in shadow leads the imagination into the depths  but it soon becomes bewildered there  rocks strewn about half hidden in the fallen leaves must not be overlooked   august 26tha funeral last evening nearly at sunseta coffin of a boy about ten years old laid on a onehorse wagon among some strawtwo or three barouches and wagons following  as the funeral passed through the village street a few men formed a short procession in front of the coffin among whom were orrin s and i  the burialground there are two in the town is on the sides and summit of a round hill which is planted with cypress and other trees among which the white marble gravestones show pleasantly  the grave was dug on the steep slope of a hill and the gravedigger was waiting there and two or three other shirtsleeved yeomen leaning against the trees  orrin s a wanton and mirthmaking middleaged man who would not seem to have much domestic feeling took a chief part on the occasion assisting in taking the coffin from the wagon and in lowering it into the grave  there being some superfluous earth at the bottom of the grave the coffin was drawn up again after being once buried and the obstacle removed with a hoe then it was lowered again for the last time  while this was going on the father and mother stood weeping at the upper end of the grave at the head of the little processionthe mother sobbing with stifled violence and peeping forth to discover why the coffin was drawn up again  it being fitted in its place orrin s strewed some straw upon itthis being the custom here because the clods on the coffinlid have an ugly sound  then the baptist minister having first whispered to the father removed his hat the spectators all doing the same and thanked them in the name of these mourners for this last act of kindness to them  in all these rites orrin s bore the chief part with real feeling and sadly decorous demeanor  after the funeral i took a walk on the williamstown road towards the west  there had been a heavy shower in the afternoon and clouds were brilliant all over the sky around graylock and everywhere else  those over the hills of the west were the most splendid in purple and gold and there being a haze it added immensely to their majesty and dusky magnificence  this morning i walked a little way along the mountain road and stood awhile in the shadow of some oak and chestnut treesit being a warm bright sunshiny morning  the shades lay long from trees and other objects as at sunset but how different this cheerful and light radiance from the mild repose of sunset  locusts crickets and other insects were making music  cattle were feeding briskly with morning appetites the wakeful voices of children were heard in a neighboring hollow  the dew damped the road and formed manycolored drops in the grass  in short the world was not weary with a long sultry day but in a fresh recruited state fit to carry it through such a day  a roughlooking sunburnt soiledskirted odd middleaged little man came to the house a day or two ago seeking work  he had come from ohio and was returning to his native place somewhere in new england stopping occasionally to earn money to pay his way  there was something rather ludicrous in his physiognomy and aspect  he was very free to talk with all and sundry  he made a long eulogy on his dog tiger yesterday insisting on his good moral character his not being quarrelsome his docility and all other excellent qualities that a huge strong fierce mastiff could have  tiger is the bully of the village and keeps all the other dogs in awe  his aspect is very spirited trotting massively along with his tail elevated and his head likewise  when he sees a dog thats anything near his size hes apt to growl a littletiger had the marks of a battle on himyet hes a good dog   friday august 31sta drive on tuesday to shelburne falls twentytwo miles or thereabouts distant  started at about eight oclock in a wagon with mr leach and mr birch  our road lay over the green mountains the long ridge of which was made awful by a dark heavy threatening cloud apparently rolled and condensed along the whole summit  as we ascended the zigzag road we looked behind at every opening in the forest and beheld a wide landscape of mountainswells and valleys intermixed and old graylock and the whole of saddleback  over the wide scene there was a general gloom but there was a continual vicissitude of bright sunshine flitting over it now resting for a brief space on portions of the heights now flooding the valleys with green brightness now making out distinctly each dwelling and the hotels and then two small brick churches of the distant village denoting its prosperity while all around seemed under adverse fortunes  but we who stood so elevated above mortal things and saw so wide and far could see the sunshine of prosperity departing from one spot and rolling towards another so that we could not think it much matter which spot were sunny or gloomy at any one moment  the top of this hoosic mountain is a long ridge marked on the county map as two thousand one hundred and sixty feet above the sea on this summit is a valley not very deep but one or two miles wide in which is the town of l  here there are respectable farmers though it is a rough and must be a bleak place  the first house after reaching the summit is a small homely tavern  we left our horse in the shed and entering the little unpainted barroom we heard a voice in a strange outlandish accent exclaiming diorama  it was an old man with a full graybearded countenance and mr leach exclaimed ah heres the old dutchman again  and he answered yes captain heres the old dutchmanthough by the way he is a german and travels the country with this diorama in a wagon and had recently been at south adams and was now returning from saratoga springs  we looked through the glass orifice of his machine while he exhibited a succession of the very worst scratches and daubings that can be imaginedworn out too and full of cracks and wrinkles dimmed with tobaccosmoke and every other wise dilapidated  there were none in a later fashion than thirty years since except some figures that had been cut from tailors showbills  there were views of cities and edifices in europe of napoleons battles and nelsons seafights in the midst of which would be seen a gigantic brown hairy hand the hand of destiny pointing at the principal points of the conflict while the old dutchman explained  he gave a good deal of dramatic effect to his descriptions but his accent and intonation cannot be written  he seemed to take interest and pride in his exhibition yet when the utter and ludicrous miserability thereof made us laugh he joined in the joke very readily  when the last picture had been shown he caused a country boor who stood gaping beside the machine to put his head within it and thrust out his tongue  the head becoming gigantic a singular effect was produced  the old dutchmans exhibition being over a great dog apparently an elderly dog suddenly made himself the object of notice evidently in rivalship of the dutchman  he had seemed to be a goodnatured quiet kind of dog offering his head to be patted by those who were kindly disposed towards him  this great old dog unexpectedly and of his own motion began to run round after his not very long tail with the utmost eagerness and catching hold of it he growled furiously at it and still continued to circle round growling and snarling with increasing rage as if one half of his body were at deadly enmity with the other faster and faster went he round and roundabout growing still fiercer till at last he ceased in a state of utter exhaustion but no sooner had his exhibition finished than he became the same mild quiet sensible old dog as before and no one could have suspected him of such nonsense as getting enraged with his own tail  he was first taught this trick by attaching a bell to the end of his tail but he now commences entirely of his own accord and i really believe he feels vain at the attention he excites  it was chill and bleak on the mountaintop and a fire was burning in the barroom  the old dutchman bestowed on everybody the title of captain perhaps because such a title has a great chance of suiting an american  leaving the tavern we drove a mile or two farther to the eastern brow of the mountain whence we had a view over the tops of a multitude of heights into the intersecting valleys down which we were to plungeand beyond them the blue and indistinctive scene extended to the east and north for at least sixty miles  beyond the hills it looked almost as if the blue ocean might be seen  monadnock was visible like a sapphire cloud against the sky  descending we by and by got a view of the deerfield river which makes a bend in its course from about north and south to about east and west coming out from one defile among the mountains and flowing through another  the scenery on the eastern side of the green mountains is incomparably more striking than on the western where the long swells and ridges have a flatness of effect and even graylock heaves itself so gradually that it does not much strike the beholder  but on the eastern part peaks one or two thousand feet high rush up on either bank of the river in ranges thrusting out their shoulders side by side  they are almost precipitous clothed in woods through which the naked rock pushes itself forth to view  sometimes the peak is bald while the forest wraps the body of the hill and the baldness gives it an indescribably stern effect  sometimes the precipice rises with abruptness from the immediate side of the river sometimes there is a cultivated valley on either sidecultivated long and with all the smoothness and antique rurality of a farm near citiesthis gentle picture strongly set off by the wild mountainframe around it often it would seem a wonder how our road was to continue the mountains rose so abruptly on either side and stood so direct a wall across our onward course while looking behind it would be an equal mystery how we had gotten thither through the huge base of the mountain that seemed to have reared itself erect after our passage  but passing onward a narrow defile would give us egress into a scene where new mountains would still appear to bar us  our road was much of it level but scooped out among mountains  the river was a brawling stream shallow and roughened by rocks now we drove on a plane with it now there was a sheer descent down from the roadside upon it often unguarded by any kind of fence except by the trees that contrived to grow on the headlong interval between the mountains there were gorges that led the imagination away into new scenes of wildness  i have never driven through such romantic scenery where there was such variety and boldness of mountain shapes as this and though it was a broad sunny day the mountains diversified the view with sunshine and shadow and glory and gloom  in charlemont i think after passing a bridge we saw a very curious rock on the shore of the river about twenty feet from the roadside clambering down the bank we found it a complete arch hollowed out of the solid rock and as high as the arched entrance of an ancient church which it might be taken to be though considerably dilapidated and weatherworn  the water flows through it though the rock afforded standing room beside the pillars  it was really like the archway of an enchanted palace all of which has vanished except the entrancenow only into nothingness and empty space  we climbed to the top of the arch in which the traces of water having eddied are very perceptible this curiosity occurs in a wild part of the rivers course and in a solitude of mountains  farther down the river becoming deeper broader and more placid little boats were seen moored along it for the convenience of crossing sometimes too the wellbeaten track of wheels and hoofs passed down to its verge then vanished and appeared on the other side indicating a ford  we saw one house pretty small with green blinds and much quietness in its environments on the other side of the river with a flatbottomed boat for communication  it was a pleasant idea that the world was kept off by the river  proceeding onward we reached shelburne falls  here the river in the distance of a few hundred yards makes a descent of about a hundred and fifty feet over a prodigious bed of rock  formerly it doubtless flowed unbroken over the rock merely creating a rapid and traces of water having raged over it are visible in portions of the rock that now lie high and dry  at present the river roars through a channel which it has worn in the stone leaping in two or three distinct falls and rushing downward as from flight to flight of a broken and irregular staircase the mist rises from the highest of these cataracts and forms a pleasant object in the sunshine  the best view i think is to stand on the verge of the upper and largest fall and look down through the whole rapid descent of the river as it hurries foaming through its rockworn paththe rocks seeming to have been hewn away as when mortals make a road  these falls are the largest in this state and have a very peculiar character  it seems as if water had had more power at some former period than now to hew and tear its passage through such an immense ledge of rock as here withstood it  in this crag or parts of it now far beyond the reach of the water it has worn what are called potholesbeing circular hollows in the rock where for ages stones have been whirled round and round by the eddies of the water so that the interior of the pot is as circular and as smooth as it could have been made by art  often the mouth of the pot is the narrowest part the inner space being deeply scooped out  water is contained in most of these potholes sometimes so deep that a man might drown himself therein and lie undetected at the bottom  some of them are of a convenient size for cooking which might be practicable by putting in hot stones  the tavern at shelburne falls was about the worst i ever sawthere being hardly anything to eat at least nothing of the meat kind  there was a party of students from the rensselaer school at troy who had spent the night there a set of rough urchins from sixteen to twenty years old accompanied by the wagondriver a short stubbed little fellow who walked about with great independence thrusting his hands into his breechespockets beneath his frock  the queerness was such a figure being associated with classic youth  they were on an excursion which is yearly made from that school in search of minerals  they seemed in rather better moral habits than students used to be but wildspirited rude and unpolished somewhat like german students which resemblance one or two of them increased by smoking pipes  in the morning my breakfast being set in a corner of the same room with them i saw their breakfasttable with a huge washbowl of milk in the centre and a basin and spoon placed for each guest  in the barroom of this tavern were posted up written advertisements the smoked chimneypiece being thus made to serve for a newspaper i have rye for sale i have a fine mare colt etc  there was one quaintly expressed advertisement of a horse that had strayed or been stolen from a pasture  the students from year to year have been in search of a particular rock somewhere on the mountains in the vicinity of shelburne falls which is supposed to contain some valuable ore but they cannot find it one man in the barroom observed that it must be enchanted and spoke of a tinker during the revolutionary war who met with a somewhat similar instance  roaming along the hudson river he came to a precipice which had some bunches of singular appearance embossed upon it  he knocked off one of the hunches and carrying it home or to a camp or wherever he lived he put it on the fire and incited it down into clear lead  he sought for the spot again and again but could never find it  mr leachs brother is a student at shelburne falls  he is about thirtyfive years old and married and at this mature age he is studying for the ministry and will not finish his course for two or three years he was bred a farmer but has sold his farm and invested the money and supports himself and wife by dentistry during his studies  many of the academy students are men grown and some they say well towards forty years old  methinks this is characteristic of american lifethese rough weatherbeaten hardhanded farmerbred students  in nine cases out of ten they are incapable of any effectual cultivation for men of ripe years if they have any pith in them will have long ago got beyond academy or even college instruction  i suspect nothing better than a very wretched smattering is to be obtained in these country academies  mr jerkins an instructor at amherst speaking of the western mounds expressed an opinion that they were of the same nature and origin as some small circular hills which are of very frequent occurrence here in north adams  the burialground is on one of them and there is another on the summit of which appears a single tombstone as if there were something natural in making these hills the repositories of the dead  a question of old h led to mr jenkinss dissertation on this subject to the great contentment of a large circle round the barroom fireside on the last rainy day  a tailor is detected by mr leach because his coat had not a single wrinkle in it  i saw him exhibiting patterns of fashions to randall the village tailor  mr leach has much tact in finding out the professions of people  he found out a blacksmith because his right hand was much larger than the other  a man getting subscriptions for a religious and abolition newspaper in new yorksomewhat elderly and grayhaired quick in his movements hasty in his walk with an eager earnest stare through his spectacles hurrying about with a pocketbook of subscriptions in his handseldom speaking and then in brief expressionssitting down before the stage comes to write a list of subscribers obtained to his employers in new york  withal a city and business air about him as of one accustomed to hurry through narrow alleys and dart across thronged streets and speak hastily to one man and another at jostling corners though now transacting his affairs in the solitude of mountains  an old gray man seemingly astray and abandoned in this wide world sitting in the barroom speaking to none nor addressed by any one  not understanding the meaning of the supperbell till asked to supper by word of mouth  however he called for a glass of brandy  a pedler with girls silk neckerchiefsor gauzemens silk pockethandkerchiefs red bandannas and a variety of horn combs trying to trade with the servantgirls of the house  one of them laura attempts to exchange a worked vandyke which she values at two dollars and a half eliza being reproached by the pedler vows that she buys more of pedlers than any other person in the house  a drove of pigs passing at dusk  they appeared not so much disposed to ramble and go astray from the line of march as in daylight but kept together in a pretty compact body  there was a general grunting not violent at all but low and quiet as if they were expressing their sentiments among themselves in a companionable way  pigs on a march do not subject themselves to any leader among themselves but pass on higgledypiggledy without regard to age or sex   september 1stlast evening during a walk graylock and the whole of saddleback were at first imbued with a mild halfsunshiny tinge then grew almost blacka huge dark mass lying on the back of the earth and encumbering it  stretching up from behind the black mountain over a third or more of the sky there was a heavy sombre blue heap or ledge of clouds looking almost as solid as rocks  the volumes of which it was composed were perceptible by translucent lines and fissures but the mass as a whole seemed as solid bulky and ponderous in the cloudworld as the mountain was on earth  the mountain and cloud together had an indescribably stern and majestic aspect  beneath this heavy cloud there was a fleet or flock of light vapory mists flitting in middle air and these were tinted from the vanished sun with the most gorgeous and living purple that can be conceiveda fringe upon the stern blue  in the opposite quarter of the heavens a roselight was reflected whence i know not which colored the clouds around the moon then well above the horizon so that the nearly round and silver moon appeared strangely among roseate cloudssometimes half obscured by them  a man with a smart horse upon which the landlord makes laudatory remarks  he replies that he has a better at home  dressed in a brown brightbuttoned coat smartly cut  he immediately becomes familiar and begins to talk of the license law and other similar topicsmaking himself at home as one who being much of his time upon the road finds himself at ease at any tavern  he inquired after a stage agent named brigham who formerly resided here but now has gone to the west  he himself was probably a horsejockey  an old lady stopping here over the sabbath waiting for tomorrows stage for greenfield having been deceived by the idea that she could proceed on her journey without delay  quiet making herself comfortable taken into the society of the women of the house   september 3don the slope of bald mountain a clearing set in the frame of the forest on all sidesa growth of clover upon it which having been mowed once this year is now appropriated to pasturage  stumps remaining in the ground one tall barkless stem of a tree standing upright branchless and with a shattered summit  one or two other stems lying prostrate and partly overgrown with bushes and shrubbery some of them bearing a yellow flowera color which autumn loves  the stumps and trunks fireblackened yet nothing about them that indicates a recent clearing but the roughness of an old clearing that being removed from convenient labor has none of the polish of the homestead  the field with slight undulations slopes pretty directly down  near the lower verge a rude sort of barn or rather haystack roofed over and with hay protruding and hanging out  an ox feeding and putting up his muzzle to pull down a mouthful of hay but seeing me a stranger in the upper part of the field he remains long gazing and finally betakes himself to feeding again  a solitary butterfly flitting to and fro blown slightly on its course by a cool september windthe coolness of which begins to be tempered by a bright glittering sun  there is dew on the grass  in front beyond the lower spread of forest saddle mountain rises and the valleys and long swelling hills sweep away  but the impression of this clearing is solitude as of a forgotten land  it is customary here to toll the bell at the death of a person at the hour of his death whether a m or p m  not however i suppose if it happen in deep night  there are three times in a mans life when he is talked aboutwhen he is born when he is married and when he dies  yes said orrin s and only one of the times has he to pay anything for it out of his own pocket  in reference to a claim by the guests of the barroom on the man amasa richardson for a treat  a woodchopper travelling the country in search of jobs at chopping his baggage a bundle a handkerchief and a pair of coarse boots  his implement an axe most keenly ground and sharpened which i had noticed standing in a corner and thought it would almost serve as a razor  i saw another woodchopper sitting down on the ascent of bald mountain with his axe on one side and a jug and provisions on the other on the way to his days toil  the revolutionary pensioners come out into the sunshine to make oath that they are still above ground  one whom mr s saluted as uncle john went into the barroom walking pretty stoutly by the aid of a long oaken staffwith an old creased broken and ashen bellcrowned hat on his head and wearing a brown oldfashioned suit of clothes pretty portly fleshy in the face and with somewhat of a paunch cheerful and his senses bodily and mental in no very bad order though he is now in his ninetieth year  an old mans withered and wilted apple quoth uncle john keeps a good while  mr s says his grandfather lived to be a hundred and that his legs became covered with moss like the trunk of an old tree  uncle john would smile and cackle at a little jest and what life there was in him seemed a goodnatured and comfortable one enough  he can walk two or three miles he says taking it moderate  i suppose his state is that of a drowsy man but partly conscious of lifewalking as through a dim dream but brighter at some seasons than at others  by and by he will fall quite asleep without any trouble  mr s unbidden gave him a glass of gin which the old man imbibed by the warm fireside and grew the younger for it   september 4ththis day an exhibition of animals in the vicinity of the village under a pavilion of sailcloththe floor being the natural grass with here and there a rock partially protruding  a pleasant mild shade a strip of sunshine or a spot of glimmering brightness in some parts  crowdedrow above row of women on an amphitheatre of seats on one side  in an inner pavilion an exhibition of anacondasfourwhich the showman took one by one from a large box under some blankets and hung round his shoulders  they seemed almost torpid when first taken out but gradually began to assume life to stretch to contract twine and writhe about his neck and person thrusting out their tongues and erecting their heads  their weight was as much as he could bear and they hung down almost to the ground when not contortedas big round as a thigh almostspotted and richly variegated  then he put them into the box again their heads emerging and writhing forth which the showman thrust back again  he gave a descriptive and historical account of them and a fanciful and poetical one also  a man put his arm and head into the lions mouthall the spectators looking on so attentively that a breath could not be heard  that was impressiveits effect on a thousand personsmore so than the thing itself  in the evening the caravan people were at the tavern talking of their troubles in coming over the mountainthe overturn of a cage containing two leopards and a hyena  they are a rough ignorant set of men apparently incapable of taking any particular enjoyment from the life of variety and adventure which they lead  there was the man who put his head into the lions mouth and i suppose the man about whom the anacondas twined talking about their suppers and blustering for hot meat and calling for something to drink without anything of the wild dignity of men familiar with the nobility of nature  a character of a desperate young man who employs high courage and strong faculties in this sort of dangers and wastes his talents in wild riot addressing the audience as a snakemankeeping the ring while the monkey rides the ponysinging negro and other songs  the country boors were continually getting within the barriers and venturing too near the cages  the great lion lay with his fore paws extended and a calm majestic but awful countenance  he looked on the people as if he had seen many such concourses  the hyena was the most ugly and dangerous looking beast full of spite and on ill terms with all nature looking a good deal like a hog with the devil in him the ridge of hair along his back bristling  he was in the cage with a leopard and a panther and the latter seemed continually on the point of laying his paw on the hyena who snarled and showed his teeth  it is strange though to see how these wild beasts acknowledge and practise a degree of mutual forbearance and of obedience to man with their wild nature yet in them  the great white bear seemed in distress from the heat moving his head and body in a peculiar fantastic way and eagerly drinking water when given it  he was thin and lank  the caravan men were so sleepy orrin s says that he could hardly wake them in the morning  they turned over on their faces to show him  coming out of the caravansary there were the mountains in the quiet sunset and many men drunk swearing and fighting  shanties with liquor for sale  the elephant lodged in the barn   september 5thi took a walk of three miles from the village which brought me into vermont  the line runs athwart a bridgea rude bridge which crosses a mountain stream  the stream runs deep at the bottom of a gorge plashing downward with rapids and pools and bestrewn with large rocks deep and shady not to be reached by the sun except in its meridian as well on account of the depth of the gorge as of the arch of wilderness trees above it  there was a stumpy clearing beyond the bridge where some men were building a house  i went to them and inquired if i were in massachusetts or vermont and asked for some water whereupon they showed great hospitality and the masterworkman went to the spring and brought delicious water in a tin basin and produced another jug containing new rum and very good and rum does nobody any harm if they make a good use of it quoth he  i invited them to call on me at the hotel if they should cone to the village within two or three days  then i took my way back through the forest for this is a byroad and is much of its course a sequestrated and wild one with an unseen torrent roaring at an unseen depth along the roadside  my walk forth had been an almost continued ascent and returning i had an excellent view of graylock and the adjacent mountains at such a distance that they were all brought into one group and comprehended at one view as belonging to the same companyall mighty with a mightier chief  as i drew nearer home they separated and the unity of effect was lost  the more distant then disappeared behind the nearer ones and finally graylock itself was lost behind the hill which immediately shuts in the village  there was a warm autumnal haze which i think seemed to throw the mountains farther off and both to enlarge and soften them  to imagine the gorges and deep hollows in among the group of mountains their huge shoulders and protrusions  they were just beginning to pitch over the mountains as i came along stagedrivers expression about the caravan  a fantastic figure of a village coxcomb striding through the barroom and standing with folded arms to survey the caravan men  there is much exaggeration and rattlebrain about this fellow  a mad girl leaped from the top of a tremendous precipice in pownall hundreds of feet high if the tale be true and being buoyed up by her clothes came safely to the bottom  inquiries about the coming of the caravan and whether the elephant had got to town and reports that he had  a smart plump crimsonfaced gentleman with a travellingportmanteau of peculiar neatness and convenience  he criticises the road over the mountain having come in the greenfield stage perhaps an engineer  bears still inhabit saddleback and the neighboring mountains and forests six were taken in pownall last year and two hundred foxes  sometimes they appear on the hills in close proximity to this village   september 7thmr leach and i took a walk by moonlight last evening on the road that leads over the mountain  remote from houses far up on the hillside we found a limekiln burning near the road and approaching it a watcher started from the ground where he had been lying at his length  there are several of these limekilns in this vicinity  they are circular built with stones like a round tower eighteen or twenty feet high having a hillock heaped around in a great portion of their circumference so that the marble may be brought and thrown in by cartloads at the top  at the bottom there is a doorway large enough to admit a man in a stooping posture  thus an edifice of great solidity is constructed which will endure for centuries unless needless pains are taken to tear it down  there is one on the hillside close to the village wherein weeds grow at the bottom and grass and shrubs too are rooted in the interstices of the stones and its low doorway has a dungeonlike aspect and we look down from the top as into a roofless tower  it apparently has not been used for many years and the lime and weatherstained fragments of marble are scattered about  but in the one we saw last night a hardwood fire was burning merrily beneath the superincumbent marblethe kiln being heaped full and shortly after we came the man a dark blackbearded figure in shirtsleeves opened the iron door through the chinks of which the fire was gleaming and thrust in huge logs of wood and stirred the immense coals with a long pole and showed us the glowing limestonethe lower layer of it  the heat of the fire was powerful at the distance of several yards from the open door  he talked very sensibly with us being doubtless glad to have two visitors to vary his solitary nightwatch for it would not do for him to fall asleep since the fire should be refreshed as often as every twenty minutes  we ascended the hillock to the top of the kiln and the marble was redhot and burning with a bluish lambent flame quivering up sometimes nearly a yard high and resembling the flame of anthracite coal only the marble being in large fragments the flame was higher  the kiln was perhaps six or eight feet across  four hundred bushels of marble were then in a state of combustion  the expense of converting this quantity into lime is about fifty dollars and it sells for twentyfive cents per bushel at the kiln we asked the man whether he would run across the top of the intensely burning kiln barefooted for a thousand dollars and he said he would for ten  he told us that the lime had been burning fortyeight hours and would be finished in thirtysix more  he liked the business of watching it better by night than by day because the days were often hot but such a mild and beautiful night as the last was just right  here a poet might make verses with moonlight in them and a gleam of fierce firelight flickering through  it is a shame to use this brilliant white almost transparent marble in this way  a man said of it the other day that into some pieces of it when polished one could see a good distance and he instanced a certain gravestone  visited the cave  a large portion of it where water trickles and falls is perfectly white  the walls present a specimen of how nature packs the stone crowding huge masses as it were into chinks and fissures and here we see it in the perpendicular or horizontal layers as nature laid it   september 9tha walk yesterday forenoon through the notch formed between saddle mountain and another adjacent one  this notch is otherwise called the bellowspipe being a long and narrow valley with a steep wall on either side  the walls are very high and the fallen timbers lie strewed adown the precipitous descent  the valley gradually descends from the narrowest part of the notch and a stream of water flows through the midst of it which farther onward in its course turns a mill  the valley is cultivated there being two or three farmhouses towards the northern end and extensive fields of grass beyond where stand the haymows of last year with the hay cut away regularly around their bases  all the more distant portion of the valley is lonesome in the extreme and on the hither side of the narrowest part the land is uncultivated partly overgrown with forest partly used as sheeppastures for which purpose it is not nearly so barren as sheeppastures usually are  on the right facing southward rises graylock all beshagged with forest and with headlong precipices of rock appearing among the black pines  southward there is a most extensive view of the valley in which saddleback and its companion mountains are crouchedwide and fara broad misty valley fenced in by a mountain wall and with villages scattered along it and miles of forest which appear but as patches scattered here and there upon the landscape  the descent from the notch southward is much more abrupt than on the other side  a stream flows down through it and along much of its course it has washed away all the earth from a ledge of rock and then formed a descending pavement smooth and regular which the scanty flow of water scarcely suffices to moisten at this period though a heavy rain probably would send down a torrent raging roaring and foaming  i descended along the course of the stream and sometimes on the rocky path of it and turning off towards the south village followed a cattlepath till i came to a cottage  a horse was standing saddled near the door but i did not see the rider i knocked and an elderly woman of very pleasing and intelligent aspect came at the summons and gave me directions how to get to the south village through an orchard and across lots which would bring me into the road near the quaker meetinghouse with gravestones round it  while she talked a young woman came into the pantry from the kitchen with a dirty little brat whose squalls i had heard all along the reason of his outcry being that his mother was washing hima very unusual process if i may judge by his looks  i asked the old lady for some water and she gave me i think the most delicious i ever tasted  these mountaineers ought certainly to be temperance people for their mountain springs supply them with a liquor of which the cities and the low countries can have no conception  pure fresh almost sparkling exhilaratingsuch water as adam and eve drank  i passed the south village on a byroad without entering it and was taken up by the stage from pittsfield a mile or two this side of it platt the driver a friend of mine talked familiarly about many matters intermixing his talk with remarks on his team and addresses to the beasts composing it who were three mares and a horse on the near wheelall bays  the horse he pronounced a dreadful nice horse to go but if he could shirk off the work upon the others he wouldwhich unfairness platt corrected by timely strokes of the whip whenever the horses traces were not tightened  one of the mares wished to go faster hearing another horse tramp behind her and nothing made her so mad quoth platt as to be held in when she wanted to go  the near leader started  o the little devil said he how skittish she is  another stumbled and platt bantered her thereupon  then he told of foundering through snowdrifts in winter and carrying the mail on his backfour miles from bennington  and thus we jogged on and got to mine inn just as the dinnerbell was

discontented for this is not the case  my life only is a burden in the same way that it is to every toilsome man and mine is a healthy weariness such as needs only a nights sleep to remove it  but from henceforth forever i shall be entitled to call the sons of toil my brethren and shall know how to sympathize with them seeing that i likewise have risen at the dawn and borne the fervor of the midday sun nor turned my heavy footsteps homeward till eventide  years hence perhaps the experience that my heart is acquiring now will flow out in truth and wisdom   august 27thi have been stationed all day at the end of long wharf and i rather think that i had the most eligible situation of anybody in boston  i was aware that it must be intensely hot in the midst of the city but there was only a short space of uncomfortable heat in my region halfway towards the centre of the harbor and almost all the time there was a pure and delightful breeze fluttering and palpitating sometimes shyly kissing my brow then dying away and then rushing upon me in livelier sport so that i was fain to settle my straw hat more tightly upon my head  late in the afternoon there was a sunny shower which came down so like a benediction that it seemed ungrateful to take shelter in the cabin or to put up an umbrella  then there was a rainbow or a large segment of one so exceedingly brilliant and of such long endurance that i almost fancied it was stained into the sky and would continue there permanently  and there were clouds floating all about great clouds and small of all glorious and lovely hues save that imperial crimson which was revealed to our united gazeso glorious indeed and so lovely that i had a fantasy of heavens being broken into fleecy fragments and dispersed through space with its blest inhabitants dwelling blissfully upon those scattered islands   february 7th 1840what beautiful weather this isbeautiful at least so far as sun sky and atmosphere are concerned though a poor wingless biped is sometimes constrained to wish that he could raise himself a little above the earth  how much mud and mire how many pools of unclean water how many slippery footsteps and perchance heavy tumbles might be avoided if we could tread but six inches above the crust of this world  physically we cannot do this our bodies cannot but it seems to me that our hearts and minds may keep themselves above moral mudpuddles and other discomforts of the souls pathway   february 11thi have been measuring coal all day on board of a black little british schooner in a dismal dock at the north end of the city most of the time i paced the deck to keep myself warm for the wind northeast i believe blew up through the dock as if it had been the pipe of a pair of bellows  the vessel lying deep between two wharfs there was no more delightful prospect on the right hand and on the left than the posts and timbers half immersed in the water and covered with ice which the rising and falling of successive tides had left upon them so that they looked like immense icicles  across the water however not more than half a mile off appeared the bunker hill monument and what interested me considerably more a churchsteeple with the dial of a clock upon it whereby i was enabled to measure the march of the weary hours  sometimes i descended into the dirty little cabin of the schooner and warmed myself by a redhot stove among biscuitbarrels pots and kettles seachests and innumerable lumber of all sortsmy olfactories meanwhile being greatly refreshed by the odor of a pipe which the captain or some one of his crew was smoking  but at last came the sunset with delicate clouds and a purple light upon the islands and i blessed it because it was the signal of my release   february 12thall day long again have i been engaged in a very black businessas black as a coal and though my face and hands have undergone a thorough purification i feel not altogether fit to hold communion with doves  methinks my profession is somewhat akin to that of a chimneysweeper but the latter has the advantage over me because after climbing up through the darksome flue of the chimney he emerges into the midst of the golden air and sings out his melodies far over the heads of the whole tribe of weary earthplodders  my toil today has been cold and dull enough nevertheless i was neither cold nor dull   march 15thi pray that in one year more i may find some way of escaping from this unblest customhouse for it is a very grievous thraldom  i do detest all officesall at least that are held on a political tenure and i want nothing to do with politicians  their hearts wither away and die out of their bodies  their consciences are turned to indiarubber or to some substance as black as that and which will stretch as much one thing if no more i have gained by my customhouse experienceto know a politician  it is a knowledge which no previous thought or power of sympathy could have taught me because the animal or the machine rather is not in nature   march 23di do think that it is the doom laid upon me of murdering so many of the brightest hours of the day at the customhouse that makes such havoc with my wits for here i am again trying to write worthily     yet with a sense as if all the noblest part of man had been left out of my composition or had decayed out of it since my nature was given to my own keeping    never comes any bird of paradise into that dismal region  a salt or even a coal ship is ten million times preferable for there the sky is above me and the fresh breeze around me and my thoughts having hardly anything to do with my occupation are as free as air  nevertheless you are not to fancy that the above paragraph gives a correct idea of my mental and spiritual state    it is only once in a while that the image and desire of a better and happier life makes me feel the iron of my chain for after all a human spirit may find no insufficiency of food fit for it even in the customhouse  and with such materials as these i do think and feel and learn things that are worth knowing and which i should not know unless i had learned them there so that the present portion of my life shall not be quite left out of the sum of my real existence    it is good for me on many accounts that my life has had this passage in it  i know much more than i did a year ago  i have a stronger sense of power to act as a man among men  i have gained worldly wisdom and wisdom also that is not altogether of this world  and when i quit this earthly cavern where i am now buried nothing will cling to me that ought to be left behind men will not perceive i trust by my look or the tenor of my thoughts and feelings that i have been a customhouse officer   april 7thit appears to me to have been the most uncomfortable day that ever was inflicted on poor mortals    besides the bleak unkindly air i have been plagued by two sets of coalshovellers at the same time and have been obliged to keep two separate tallies simultaneously  but i was conscious that all this was merely a vision and a fantasy and that in reality i was not half frozen by the bitter blast nor tormented by those grimy coalbeavers but that i was basking quietly in the sunshine of eternity    any sort of bodily and earthly torment may serve to make us sensible that we have a soul that is not within the jurisdiction of such shadowy demonsit separates the immortal within us from the mortal  but the wind has blown my brains into such confusion that i cannot philosophize now   april 19th    what a beautiful day was yesterday  my spirit rebelled against being confined in my darksome dungeon at the customhouse  it seemed a sina murder of the joyful young daya quenching of the sunshine  nevertheless there i was kept a prisoner till it was too late to fling myself on a gentle wind and be blown away into the country    when i shall be again free i will enjoy all things with the fresh simplicity of a child of five years old  i shall grow young again made all over anew  i will go forth and stand in a summer shower and all the worldly dust that has collected on me shall be washed away at once and my heart will be like a bank of fresh flowers for the weary to rest upon     6 p mi went out to walk about an hour ago and found it very pleasant though there was a somewhat cool wind  i went round and across the common and stood on the highest point of it where i could see miles and miles into the country  blessed be god for this green tract and the view which it affords whereby we poor citizens may be put in mind sometimes that all his earth is not composed of blocks of brick houses and of stone or wooden pavements  blessed be god for the sky too though the smoke of the city may somewhat change its aspectbut still it is better than if each street were covered over with a roof  there were a good many people walking on the mallmechanics apparently and shopkeepers clerks with their wives and boys were rolling on the grass and i would have liked to lie down and roll too   april 30th    i arose this morning feeling more elastic than i have throughout the winter for the breathing of the ocean air has wrought a very beneficial effect    what a beautiful most beautiful afternoon this has been  it was a real happiness to live if i had been merely a vegetablea hawthornbush for instance i must have been happy in such an air and sunshine but having a mind and a soul     i enjoyed somewhat more than mere vegetable happiness    the footsteps of may can be traced upon the islands in the harbor and i have been watching the tints of green upon them gradually deepening till now they are almost as beautiful as they ever can be   may 19th    lights and shadows are continually flitting across my inward sky and i know neither whence they come nor whither they go nor do i inquire too closely into them  it is dangerous to look too minutely into such phenomena  it is apt to create a substance where at first there was a mere shadow    if at any time there should seem to be an expression unintelligible from one soul to another it is best not to strive to interpret it in earthly language but wait for the soul to make itself understood and were we to wait a thousand years we need deem it no more time than we can spare    it is not that i have any love of mystery but because i abhor it and because i have often felt that words may be a thick and darksome veil of mystery between the soul and the truth which it seeks  wretched were we indeed if we had no better means of communicating ourselves no fairer garb in which to array our essential being than these poor rags and tatters of babel  yet words are not without their use even for purposes of explanationbut merely for explaining outward acts and all sorts of external things leaving the souls life and action to explain itself in its own way  what a misty disquisition i have scribbled i would not read it over for sixpence   may 29threjoice with me for i am free from a load of coal which has been pressing upon my shoulders throughout all the hot weather  i am convinced that christians burden consisted of coal and no wonder he felt so much relieved when it fell off and rolled into the sepulchre his load however at the utmost could not have been more than a few bushels whereas mine was exactly one hundred and thirtyfive chaldrons and seven tubs   may 30th    on board my saltvessels and colliers there are many things happening many pictures which in future years when i am again busy at the loom of fiction i could weave in but my fancy is rendered so torpid by my ungenial way of life that i cannot sketch off the scenes and portraits that interest me and i am forced to trust them to my memory with the hope of recalling them at some more favorable period for these three or four days i have been observing a little mediterranean boy from malaga not more than ten or eleven years old but who is already a citizen of the world and seems to be just as gay and contented on the deck of a yankee coalvessel as he could be while playing beside his mothers door  it is really touching to see how free and happy he ishow the little fellow takes the whole wide world for his home and all mankind for his family  he talks spanishat least that is his native tongue but he is also very intelligible in english and perhaps he likewise has smatterings of the speech of other countries whither the winds may have wafted this little seabird  he is a catholic and yesterday being friday he caught some fish and fried them for his dinner in sweetoil and really they looked so delicate that i almost wished he would invite me to partake  every once in a while he undresses himself and leaps overboard plunging down beneath the waves as if the sea were as native to him as the earth  then he runs up the rigging of the vessel as if he meant to fly away through the air  i must remember this little boy and perhaps i may make something more beautiful of him than these rough and imperfect touches would promise   june 11th    i could wish that the eastwind would blow every day from ten oclock till five for there is great refreshment in it to us poor mortals that toil beneath the sun  we must not think too unkindly even of the eastwind  it is not perhaps a wind to be loved even in its benignest moods but there are seasons when i delight to feel its breath upon my cheek though it be never advisable to throw open my bosom and take it into my heart as i would its gentle sisters of the south and west  today if i had been on the wharves the slight chill of an eastwind would have been a blessing like the chill of death to a worldweary man      but this has been one of the idlest days that i ever spent in boston    in the morning soon after breakfast i went to the athenaeum gallery and during the hour or two that i stayed not a single visitor came in  some people were putting up paintings in one division of the room but i had the other all to myself  there are two pictures there by our friend sarah clarkescenes in kentucky  from the picturegallery i went to the readingrooms of the athenaeum and there read the magazines till nearly twelve thence to the customhouse and soon afterwards to dinner with colonel hall then back to the customhouse but only for a little while  there was nothing in the world to do and so at two oclock i cane home and lay down with the faerie queene in my hand   august 21stlast night i slept like a child of five years old and had no dreams at allunless just before it was time to rise and i have forgotten what those dreams were  after i was fairly awake this morning i felt very bright and airy and was glad that i had been compelled to snatch two additional hours of existence from annihilation  the suns disk was but half above the oceans verge when i ascended the ships side  these early morning hours are very lightsome and quiet  almost the whole day i have been in the shade reclining on a pile of sails so that the life and spirit are not entirely worn out of me    the wind has been east this afternoonperhaps in the forenoon tooand i could not help feeling refreshed when the gentle chill of its breath stole over my cheek  i would fain abominate the eastwind     but it persists in doing me kindly offices now and then  what a perverse wind it is  its refreshment is but another mode of torment   salem oct 4th  union street family mansion    here i sit in my old accustomed chamber where i used to sit in days gone by    here i have written many tales many that have been burned to ashes many that doubtless deserved the same fate  this claims to be called a haunted chamber for thousands upon thousands of visions have appeared to me in it and some few of them have become visible to the world  if ever i should have a biographer he ought to make great mention of this chamber in my memoirs because so much of my lonely youth was wasted here and here my mind and character were formed and here i have been glad and hopeful and here i have been despondent  and here i sat a long long time waiting patiently for the world to know me and sometimes wondering why it did not know me sooner or whether it would ever know me at all at least till i were in my grave  and sometimes it seemed as if i were already in the grave with only life enough to be chilled and benumbed but oftener i was happyat least as happy as i then knew how to be or was aware of the possibility of being  by and by the world found me out in my lonely chamber and called me forthnot indeed with a loud roar of acclamation but rather with a still small voiceand forth i went but found nothing in the world that i thought preferable to my old solitude till now    and now i begin to understand why i was imprisoned so many years in this lonely chamber and why i could never break through the viewless bolts and bars for if i had sooner made my escape into the world i should have grown hard and rough and been covered with earthly dust and my heart might have become callous by rude encounters with the multitude    but living in solitude till the fulness of time was come i still kept the dew of my youth and the freshness of my heart    i used to think i could imagine all passions all feelings and states of the heart and mind but how little did i know     indeed we are but shadows we are not endowed with real life and all that seems most real about us is but the thinnest substance of a dreamtill the heart be touched  that touch creates usthen we begin to bethereby we are beings of reality and inheritors of eternity     when we shall be endowed with our spiritual bodies i think that they will be so constituted that we may send thoughts and feelings any distance in no time at all and transfuse them warm and fresh into the consciousness of those whom we love    but after all perhaps it is not wise to intermix fantastic ideas with the reality of affection let us content ourselves to be earthly creatures and hold communion of spirit in such modes as are ordained to us     i was not at the end of long wharf today but in a distant regionmy authority having been put in requisition to quell a rebellion of the captain and gang of shovellers aboard a coalvessel  i would you could have beheld the awful sternness of my visage and demeanor in the execution of this momentous duty  welli have conquered the rebels and proclaimed an amnesty so tomorrow i shall return to that paradise of measurers the end of long wharfnot to my former saltship she being now discharged but to another which will probably employ me wellnigh a fortnight longer    salt is white and purethere is something holy in salt     i have observed that butterfliesvery broadwinged and magnificent butterfliesfrequently come on board of the saltship where i am at work  what have these bright strangers to do on long wharf where there are no flowers nor any green thingnothing but brick storehouses stone piers black ships and the bustle of toilsome men who neither look up to the blue sky nor take note of these wandering gems of the air  i cannot account for them unless they are the lovely fantasies of the mind   november    how delightfully long the evenings are now  i do not get intolerably tired any longer and my thoughts sometimes wander back to literature and i have momentary impulses to write stories  but this will not be at present  the utmost that i can hope to do will be to portray some of the characteristics of the life which i am now living and of the people with whom i am brought into contact for future use    the days are cold now the air eager and nipping yet it suits my health amazingly  i feel as if i could run a hundred miles at a stretch and jump over all the houses that happen to be in my way     i have never had the good luck to profit much or indeed any by attending lectures so that i think the ticket had better be bestowed on somebody who can listen to mr  more worthily  my evenings are very precious to me and some of them are unavoidably thrown away in paying or receiving visits or in writing letters of business and therefore i prize the rest as if the sands of the hourglass were gold or diamond dust  i was invited to dine at mr baucrofts yesterday with miss margaret fuller but providence had given me some business to do for which i was very thankful  is not this a beautiful morning  the sun shines into my soul   april 1841    i have been busy all day from early breakfasttime till late in the afternoon and old father time has gone onward somewhat less heavily than is his wont when i am imprisoned within the walls of the customhouse  it has been a brisk breezy day an effervescent atmosphere and i have enjoyed it in all its freshnessbreathing air which had not been breathed in advance by the hundred thousand pairs of lungs which have common and indivisible property in the atmosphere of this great city  my breath had never belonged to anybody but me  it came fresh from the wilderness of ocean    it was exhilarating to see the vessels how they bounded over the waves while a sheet of foam broke out around them  i found a good deal of enjoyment too in the busy scene around me for several vessels were disgorging themselves what an unseemly figure is thisdisgorge quotha as if the vessels were sick on the wharf and everybody seemed to be working with might and main  it pleased me to think that i also had a part to act in the material and tangible business of this life and that a portion of all this industry could not have gone on without my presence  nevertheless i must not pride myself too much on my activity and utilitarianism  i shall doubtless soon bewail myself at being compelled to earn my bread by taking some little share in the toils of mortal men     articulate words are a harsh clamor and dissonance  when man arrives at his highest perfection he will again be dumb for i suppose he was dumb at the creation and must go round an entire circle in order to return to that blessed state   end of vol i
