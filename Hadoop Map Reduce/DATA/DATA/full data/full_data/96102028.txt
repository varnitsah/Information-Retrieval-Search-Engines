96102028	old times at otterbourne   by charlotte m yonge  second edition  winchester warren and son printers and publishers high street  london simpkin and co limited stationers hall court 1891     old times at otterbourne   not many of us remember otterbourne before the railroad the church or the penny post  it may be pleasant to some of us to try to catch a few recollections before all those who can tell us anything about those times are quite gone  to begin with the first that is known about it or rather that is guessed  a part of a roman road has been traced in otterbourne park and near it was found a piece of a quern one of the old stones of a hand mill such as was used in ancient times for grinding corn so that the place must have been inhabited at least seventeen hundred years ago  in the last century a medallion bearing the head of a roman emperor was found here sixteen feet beneath the surface  it seems to be one of the medallions that were placed below the eagle on the roman standards and it is still in the possession of the family of fitt of westley  after the roman and british times were over this part of the country belonged to wessex the kingdom of the west saxons of which winchester was the capital  lying so near the chief town which was the bishops throne this place was likely soon to be made into a parish when archbishop theodore divided england in dioceses and parishes just twelve hundred years ago for he died 690  the name no doubt means the village of the otters and even now these creatures are sometimes seen in the itchen so that no doubt there were once many more of them  the shapes and sizes of most of our parishes were fixed by those of the estates of the lords who first built the church for themselves and their households with the churls and serfs on their manor  the first lord of otterbourne must have had a very long narrow property to judge by the form of the parish which is at least three miles long and nowhere a mile in breadth  most likely he wanted to secure as much of the river and meadow land as he could with some high open heathy ground on the hill as common land where the cattle could graze and some wood to supply timber and fuel  probably all the slopes of the hills on each side of the valley of the otter were covered with wood  the top of the gravelly hill to the southward was all heather and furze as indeed it is still and this reached all the way to southampton and the forest  the whole district was called itene or itchen like the river  the name meant in the old english language the giants forest and the giants wood  the hill to the north was as it still remains chalk down  the village lay near the river and the stream that runs into it upon the bed of clay between the chalk and the gravel  most likely the moathouse was then in existence though a very different building from what it is at present and its moat very deep and full of water serving as a real defence there is nothing left but broad hedge rows of the woods to the northeast but one of these is called dane lane and is said to be the road by which the danes made their way to winchester being then a woodland path  it is said that whenever the yellow cow wheat grows freely the land has never been cultivated  there was a hamlet at boyatt for both it and otterbourne are mentioned in domesday book  this is the great census that william the conqueror caused to be taken 1083 of all his kingdom  from it we learn that otterbourne had a church which belonged to roger de montgomery a great norman baron whose father had been a friend of william i  well for the parish that it lay at a distance from the giants wood where the king turned out all the inhabitants for the sake of his high deer making it the new forest  he and his sons could ride through down and heath all the way to their hunting  we all know how william rufus was brought back from his last hunt lying dead in the charcoal burner purkiss cart in which he was carried to his grave in winchester cathedral  part of the road between hursley and otterbourne near silkstede is called kings lane because it is said to have been the way by which this strange hearse travelled  silkstede is a farm nowit was most likely a grange or outlying house belonging to some monasteryand there is a remnant of the gardens and some fine trees and a hollow called china dell where snowdrops and double daffodils grow  but this is in hursley parish as is also merdon castle  the green mounds and deep trenches and the fragments of ruinous wall have a story reaching far back into the ages  there is little doubt from their outline that once there was an entrenched camp of the romans on this ground but nothing is known thereof  merantune as our saxon ancestors called it first is heard of when in 755 cynewolf king of wessex was murdered there by his kinsman cyneheard who was in his turn killed by the thanes of the victim  with this savage story it first appears but no more is known of its fate except that it became the property of the bishops of winchester some say by the grant of cynegyls the first christian king of wessex others by a later gift  it was then a manor to which hurstleigh the woodland was only an appendage and the curious old manorial rights and customs plainly go back to these ancient praenorman times  to go through all the thirty customs would be impossible but it is worth noting that the tenure of the lands descended by right to the youngest son in a family instead of the eldest  such cradle fiefs exist in other parts of england and in switzerland on the principle that the elder ones go out into the world while their father is vigorous but the youngest is the stay of his old age  the rents were at first paid in kind or in labour with a heriot namely the most valuable animal in stock on a death but these became latterly commuted for quit rent and fines  the trees were carefully guarded  only one good timber tree on each holding in the life time of a tenant might be cut by the lord of the manor and the tenants themselves might only cut old rotten trees  but this is as much as you will wish to hear of these old customs which prove that the norman feudal system was kept out of this episcopal manor  it was not even mentioned in domesday book near as it was to winchester  there it lay peacefully on its island of chalk down shut in by the wellpreserved trees till stephens brother bishop henry de blois of winchester bethought him of turning the old roman camp into a fortified castle  the three norman kings had wisely hindered the building of castles but these sprung up like mushrooms under the feeble rule of stephen  the tenants must have toiled hard judging by the massiveness of the small remnant all built of the only material at hand chalk to make mortar in which flints are imbedded  this fragment still standing used to be considered as part of the keep but of late years better knowledge of the architecture of castles has led to the belief that it was part of the northern gateway tower  i borrow the description of the building from one written immediately after the comments of a gentleman who had studied the subject  henry de blois king stephens brother bishop of winchester probably wished for a stronghold near at hand during his brothers wars with the empress maud  he would have begun by having the nearly circular embankment thrown up with a parapet along the top and in the ditch thus formed a stockade of sharp pointed stakes  within the court the well 300 feet deep was dug and round it would have been the buildings needed by the bishop his household and guards much crowded together  the entrance would have been a drawbridge across the great ditch which on this side was not less than 60 feet wide and perhaps 25 deep and through a great gateway between two high square towers which must have stood where now there is a slope leading down from the inner court into the southern one  this slope is probably formed by the ruins of the gateway and tower being pitched into the ditch  the castle was then very small and did not command the country except towards the south  the next work therefore would be to throw out an embankment to the south with a ditch outside  the great gap whence hursley house is seen did not then exist but there was an unbroken semicircle of rampart and ditch which would protect a large number of men  in case of an enemy forcing this place the defenders could retreat into the castle by the drawbridge  the entrance was on the eastern side and in order to protect this and the back or northern side of the castle an embankment was thrown up outside the first moat and with an outer moat of its own  then as in case of this being carried by the enemy the defenders would be cut off from the main southern gateway a square tower was built on this outer embankment exactly opposite to the ruin which yet remains and only divided from it by the great ditch  on either side of the tower cutting the embankment across therefore at right angles was a little ditch spanned by a drawbridge which if the defenders found it necessary to retire to the tower could at any time be raised  the foundations of the tower and the position of the ditch can still be distinctly traced  supposing farther that it became impossible to hold the tower the besieged could retreat into the main body of the castle by another drawbridge across the great ditch  this would lead them through the arch which can still be seen in the ruin though it is partially blocked up the room on the east side of this passage was probably a guard room  these are all the remains  the embankments to the south and west command a great extent of country and on the north and northwest we trace the precautions by the great depth of the ditch and steepness of the earthworks though now overgrown with trees  all this must have been done between the years 1138 and 1154 and great part of the defences were thrown down in the lifetime of the founder  merdon was not destined to shine in sieges in spite of its strength  henry ii came in and forbad the multiplication of castles and merdon seems to have been dismantled as quickly as it had been built  the bishops of winchester however still seem to have resided there from time to time though it gradually fell into decay and was ruinous by the end of the plantagenet period  after the younger olivers death his sisters endeavoured to obtain the hursley property to which their father had succeeded as his sons heir he was past eighty and the judge allowed him to wear his hat at the trial in court an act of consideration commended by queen anne  after his death in 1708 the estate was sold to the heathcote family the old house whose foundations can be traced on the lawn and which was approached by the two avenues of walnut trees still standing was then pulled down and the present one erected  doorway of old church p6jpg  most likely the oldest thing in otterbourne is the arch that forms the doorway of the boys school and which came from the door of the old church  by the carving on that arch and the form of the little clustered columns that support it we can tell that it must have been put up about the time of king richard i or king john somewhere about the year 1200  there was certainly a church before this date but most likely this was the first time that much pains had been taken about its beauty and carved stone had been brought from a distance  it was a good spot that was chosen lying a little above the meadows and not far from the moated manor house  the east wall of the nave is still standing but it now forms the west wall of the small remnant that is still covered in it still has three arches in it to lead to the old chancel and above those arches there were some paintings  they came to light when the old church was pulled down  first a great deal of plaster and whitewash came off  then appeared part of the commandments in old english black letter and below that again were some paintings traced out in red upon the wall  they have been defaced so much that all that could be found out was that there was a quatrefoil shape within a square  the corners were filled up apparently with the emblems of the four cherubim though only the winged ox showed plainly  there was a sitting figure in the centre with the hand raised and it was thought to be a very rude representation of our blessed lord in judgment  in another compartment was an outline of a man and another in a hairy garment so that this last may have been intended for the baptism of our blessed lord unfortunately being on the outside wall there was no means of protecting these curious paintings and sad to say one evening i myself saw a party of rough boys standing in a row throwing stones at them  there being a pathway through the churchyard it was not possible to keep them out and thus these curious remains have been destroyed  we may think of the people who resorted to the little old church as wearing long gowns both men and women on sunday spun woven and dyed blue at home most likely with woad a plant like mignonette which still grows in the lanes  the gentry were in gayer colours but most likely none lived nearer than winchester and it was only when they plodded into market that the people would see the longhanging sleeves the pointed hoods and the queer longtoed shoes of the young gentlemen or the towers that the ladies put on their heads  the name of otterbourne does not come forward in history but as it lies so near winchester it must have had some share in what happened in the cathedral city  the next thing we know about it is that bishop edyngton joined it to hursley  william de edyngton was bishop of winchester in the middle part of the reign of edward iii from 1357 to 1366  bishop de pontissara founded a college at winchester called st elizabeths and to assist in providing for the expenses he decreed that the greater tithes of hursley those of the corn fields should be paid to the dean and chapter and that the rest of the tithe should go to the vicar  then lest the vicar should be too poor otterbourne was to be joined with hursley and held by the same parish priest and this arrangement lasted for five hundred years  it was made in times when there was little heed taken to the real good of country places  the arrangement was confirmed by his successor bishop edyngton who lies buried in the nave of winchester cathedral not far from where lies the much greater man who succeeded him  william of wykeham went on with the work edyngton had begun and built the pillars of the cathedral nave as we now see them  he also founded the two colleges of st mary one at winchester for 70 boys one at oxford to receive the scholars as they grew older meaning that they should be trained up to become priests  it seems that the old name of the field where the college stands was otterbourne meadow and that it was bought of a master dummer  bishop wykehams college at oxford is still called new college though there are now many much newer  one small estate at otterbourne was given by him to help to endow winchester college to which it still belongs  good men had come to think that founding colleges was the very best thing they could do for the benefit of the church and william of waynflete who was made bishop of winchester in 1447 founded another college at oxford in honour of st mary magdalen  to this college he gave large estates for its maintenance and in especial a very large portion of our long narrow parish of otterbourne  ever since his time two of the fellows of magdalen if not the president himself have come with the steward on a progress through the estates every year to hold their court and give audit to all who hold lands of them till quite recently the court was always held at the manor house the old moat house which must once have been the principal house in the parish though now it is so much gone to decay  old dr plank the president of magdalen used to come thither in farmer colsons time  what used to be the principal room has a short staircase leading to it and in the wainscot over the fire place is a curious old picture painted i fancy between 1600 and 1700 showing a fight between turbaned men and european soldiers most likely turks and austrians  it is a pity that it cannot tell its history  the moat goes all round the house garden and farmyard and no doubt used to have a drawbridge  forty or fifty years ago it was clear and had fish in it but the bridge fell in and choked the stream and since that it has become full of reeds and a mere swamp  it must have been a really useful protection in the evil times of the wars of the roses  most likely the commandments were painted over the old fresco on the east wall of the nave of the old church either in the time of edward vi or elizabeth for if they had been later the letters would not have been old english  the foreigners who meddled so much with our church in the latter years of edward vi obtained that the holy communion should not be celebrated in the chancels but that the holy table should be spread in the body of the church and many chancels were thus disused and became ruinous as ours most certainly did at some time or other  st elizabeths college was broken up and the place where it stood given to the college of st mary  it is still called elizabeth meadow  the presentation to the cure of our two parishes went with the estate of hursley  there was a very odd scene somewhere between winchester and southampton in the year 1554  queen mary tudor was waiting at winchester for her bridegroom philip of spain  he landed at southampton on the morning of the 20th of july and set out in a black velvet dress red cloak and black velvet hat with a splendid train of gentlemen to ride to winchester  it was a very wet day and the queen sent a gentleman with a ring from her to beg him to come no farther in the rain  but the gentleman knew no spanish and the king no english  so philip thought some warning of treachery was meant and halted in great doubt and difficulty till the messenger recollected his french and said in that tongue that the queen was only afraid of his graces getting wet  so on went philip and the high sheriff of hampshire rode before him with a long white wand in his hand and his hat off the rain running in streams off his bare head  they went so slowly as not to reach winchester till six or seven oclock in the evening so that the people of otterbourne compton and twyford must have had a good view of the spanish prince who was so unwelcome to them all  thomas sternhold who together with hopkins put the psalms into metre for singing lived in the outskirts of hursley  when the plunder of the monasteries was exhausted the tudor sovereigns or perhaps their favourites took themselves to exacting gifts and grants from the bishops and thus poynet who was intended in the stead of gardiner gave merdon to edward vi who presented it to sir philip hobby it was recovered by bishop gardiner but granted back again by queen elizabeth  sir philip is believed to have first built a mansion at hursley and his nephew sold the place to sir thomas clarke who was apparently a hard lord of the manor  his tenants still had to labour at his crops instead of paying rent but provisions had to be found them about the year 1600 on the arrival of a hogshead of porridge unsavoury and full of worms the reapers struck and their part was taken by mr robert coram who then owned cranbury so hotly that he and mr pye sir thomas clarkes steward rode at one another through the wheat with drawn daggers  lady clarke yielded and cooked two or three baconhogs for the reapers  the old road from winchester to southampton then went along what we now call the old hollow leading from shawford down to oakwood  then it seems to have gone along towards the old church its course being still marked by the long narrow meadows called the jar mead and hundred acres or more properly under an acre  then it led down to the ford at brambridge for there was then no canal to be crossed  the only great personage who was likely to have come along this road in the early 17th century was king james the firsts wife queen anne of denmark who spent a winter at the old castle of winchester and was dreadfully dull there though the ladies tried to amuse her by all sorts of games among which one was called rise pig and go  james i gave us one of the best of bishops lancelot andrewes by name who wrote a beautiful book of devotions  he lived on to the time of charles i and did much to get the ruins made in the bad days round winchester cathedral cleared and set to rights  most likely he saw that the orders for putting the altars back into their right places were carried out and very likely the chancel was then mended but with no attention to architecture for the head of the east window was built up anyhow with broken bits of tracery from a larger and handsomer one  the heir of the clarkes sold the property at hursley to mr mayor to whose only daughter oliver cromwell married his son richard  what happened here in the great rebellion we do not know  an iron ball was once dug up in the grounds at otterbourne house which may have come from olivers battery but it is also said to be only the knob of an old pump handle              when from the guarded down    fierce cromwells rebel soldiery kept watch oer wykehams town    they spoiled the tombs of valiant men warrior and saint and sage    but at the tomb of wykeham good angels quenched their rage  colonel nathanael fiennes prevented harm from being done to the college or the monuments in the cathedral but there was some talk of destroying that holy place for i have seen a petition from the citizens of winchester that it might be spared  it is said that some loyal person took out all the stained glass in the great west window hid it in a chest and buried it but when better times came it could not be restored to what it was before and was put in confusedly as we now see it  stoneham had a brave old clergyman who kept possession of his church and rectory all through the war and went on with the service till he died no man daring to meddle with him  but otterbourne was sure to follow the fate of hursley  the kings head inn at hursley is thought to have been so called in allusion to the death of king charles i  a strange compliment to the cromwells  richard had a large family most of whom died young as may be seen on their monument in hursley church  it was at this time that the customs of the manor were put on record in writing  the son oliver lived till 1705 and was confounded in the country peoples minds with his grandfather  there is an odd wild story that cromwell sunk all his treasure in the great well at merdon castle in hursley park 300 feet deep  it was further said if it were drawn up again that no one must speak till it was safe otherwise it would be lost  a great chest was raised to the mouth of the well when one of the men said here it comes  the rope broke it fell back and no one ever saw it more  most likely this is an old legend belonging to the castle long before and only connected with oliver cromwell because he was an historical person  certain it is that when the well was cleared out about 30 or 40 years ago nothing was found but two curious old candlesticks and a great number of pins which had been thrown down because they caused those curious reverberations in the great depth  another legend is that merdon well is connected with the beautiful clear spring at otterbourne called pole hole or pool hole so that when a couple of ducks were thrown down the well they came out at pole hole with all their feathers scraped off  it was in the time of the commonwealth in 1653 that our first parish register begins  some parishes have much older ones so perhaps ours may have been destroyed  the first entry in this old parchment book is that elizabeth daughter of edward cox of otterbourne and anne his wife was born   a large stain has made the rest of this entry illegible  there are only three births in 1653 and seven in 1654 one of these william son of mr william downe of otterbourne farm and joane his wife is however marked with two black lines beneath the entry as are his sisters elizabeth and jane 1656 and 1658 apparently to do honour to the principal inhabitant  it is to be observed that all the entries here are of births not of baptisms departing from the general rule of church registers and they are all in english but in 1663 each child is recorded as baptized and the latin language is used  this looks much as if a regular clergyman a scholar too had after the restoration become curate of the parish  he does not sign his registers so we do not know his name  in 1653 the banns of william downe and jane newman were published september 17th and the two lords days ensuing but their wedding is not entered and the first marriage recorded is that of matthew dummer and jane burt in 1663 the first funeral was emelin wife of robert purser in 1653  also there was plenty of brickmaking for king charles ii had planned to build a grand palace at winchester on the model of the great french palace of versailles and it is said that dell copse was formed by the digging out of bricks for the purpose  it was to reach all over the downs with fountains and water playing in them and a great tower on olivers battery with a light to guide the ships in the channel  there is a story that charles who was a capital walker sometimes walked over from southampton to look at his buildings  one of the gentlemen who attended him let the people at twyford know who was going that way  so they all turned out to look at him which was what the king by no means wished  so he avoided them and punished his indiscreet courtier by taking a run and crossing one of the broad streams with a flying leap then proceeding on to winchester leaving his attendant to follow as best he might  after all only one wing of the intended palace was built  for a long time it was called the kings house but now it is only known as the barracks  the work must have led to an increase in the population for more baptisms are recorded in the register though not more than six or seven in each year all carefully set down in latin though with no officiating minister named  there is an augustine thomas who seems to have had a large family and who probably was the owner of the ground on which the vicarage now stands the name of which used to be thomass bargain  there must have been a great quickening of activity in otterbourne soon after the restoration for it was then that the itchen canal or barge river as it used to be called was dug to convey coals from southampton and of course this much improved the irrigation of the water meadows  this canal was one of the first made in england and was very valuable for nearly two hundred years until the time of railways  in 1690 a larger parchment register was provided and every two years it appears to have been shown up to the magistrates at the petty sessions and signed by two of them  at this time there seem to have been some repairs of the church certainly a great square board painted with the royal arms was then erected for it bore the date 1698 and the initials w m for william and mary  there it was on a beam above the chancel arch and the lion and unicorn on either side the first with a huge tongue hanging out at the corner of his mouth looking very complacent as though he were displaying the royal arms the unicorn slim and dapper with a chain hanging from his neck  several of our old surnames appear about this time cox comley collins goodchild woods wareham  john newcombe rector of otterbourne who afterwards became bishop of llandaff signs his register carefully but drops the latin as various names may be mentioned scientia or science olden philadelphia comley and dennis winter who married william westgate  anne and abraham were the twin children of john and anne didimus in 1741  the first church rate book only begins in 1776 but it is curious as showing to whom the land then belonged  the spelling is also odd and as the handwriting is beautiful so there is no doubt that it really is an account of the church raiting nor that the rait was mead  walter smythe esquire of brambridge appears also john colson john comley and charles vine  lincolns belonged to mr kentish and gun plot to thilman  the expenditure begins thusapril 9 1776 pd short for 6 dozen sparw heds and the sparw heds are repeated all down the page varied with what would shock the h h3d for foxheads  also expenses ad visitation 9s 6d and at the bottom of the page the parish is thus mentioned as creditor out of pockets 5s 1d  in 1777 however though the vestry paid didums 1 badgers head 1 polecats head hary bell for 2 marten cats and spares innumerable and the clarck warges 1 pounds 5s there was 1 pounds 3s in hand  the polecats and marten cats were soon exterminated but foxes hedgehogs and sparrows continue to appear though in improved spelling till april 24th 1832 when this entry appearsat a meeting called to elect new churchwardens present the rev r shuckburgh curate and only one other person present the meeting is adjourned  mr shuckburgh protests most strongly against the disgraceful custom of appropriating money collected for church rates towards destroying vermin on the farms  and this put an end to the custom  however there were more rightful expenses  before easter there is paid for

spelling there were some repairs donepaid for communion cloth 10 pence and for washing and marking it 6p  in 1786 there was a new church bell costing 5 pounds 5s 10d  aaron chalk whom some of the elder inhabitants may remember a very feeble old man walking with two sticks was in that year one of the foremost traders in sparrow heads  it gives a curious sense of the lapse of time to think of those tottering limbs active in bird catching  may 2 in 1783 we find the entry paid for the caraidge of the old bell and the new one downe from london 11s 10d  may 22paid william branding bill for hanging the new bell 1 pounds 13s  altogether at the end of the year it is recorded the book in debt 1 pounds 11s but the disburstments as they are spelt righted themselves in 1784 when we find paid

connection otterbourne has with any historical person is not a pleasant one  the family of smythe roman catholics long held brambridge and they endowed a little roman catholic chapel at highbridge  at one time a number of their tenants and servants were of the same communion and there is a note in the parish register by the curate to say that there were several families at allbrook and highbridge whose children he had not christened though he believed they had been baptized by the roman catholic priest  one of the daughters of the smythe family was the beautiful mrs fitzherbert whom the prince of wales afterwards george iv was well known to have privately married  he never openly avowed this because by the law made in the time of william iii a marriage with a roman catholic disqualifies for the succession to the crown besides which under george iii members of the royal family had been prohibited from marrying without the kings consent and such marriages were declared null and void  the story is mentioned here because an idea has gone abroad that the wedding took place in the chapel at highbridge but this is quite untrue  the ceremony was performed at brighton and it is curious that the story of it having happened here only began to get afloat after the death of mr newton the last of the old servants who had known mrs fitzherbert  walter smythe her brother was one of the detenus whom napoleon i kept prisoners though only english travellers on the rupture of the peace of amiens  his brother charles while taking care of the estate had all the lime trees in the avenue pollarded and sold the tops to make stocks for muskets  view near hursley p16jpg  in those days there was only a foot bridge across the itchen at brambridge  carts and carriages had to ford the river not straight across but making a slight curve downwards this led to awkward accidents  there was a gentleman dining with mr walter smythe who was pressed to sleep at brambridge but declined saying that he liked to have all his little comforts about him  when daylight came the poor man was found seated on the top of his chaise the water flowing through the windows below for the post boy had taken a wrong turn and being afraid to move had been forced to remain in the river till the morning  a far worse disaster befel the newton family on their way to a funeral  it is described by one of the bearers when the cart turned over the corpse was on the foot bridge  it was a very wet day and the wind was blowing furiously at the time  it had a great effect on the cart as it was a narrow cart with a tilt on and there was a long wood sill at the side of the river  that dropping of the sill caused the accident  i think there were five females in the cart and the driver  the water was as much as 4ft deep and running very sharp so myself and others went into the water to fetch them out and when we got to the cart they were all on the top of the other with their heads just out of the water  they could not go on to church with the corpse and we had a very hard job to save the horse from being drowned as his head was but just out of the water  all through the time of the long war with france there was here as well as everywhere else around the coast fear of a landing of the french  the flatbottomed boats to bring the french over were actually ready at boulogne and the troops mustered to come across in them  on our side volunteers were in training in case of need and preparations were made for sending off the women and children inland on the first news of the enemy landing  not very many years ago there were still to be seen in a barn at hursley the planks prepared to fit as seats into the waggons that were to carry them away  and a family living here are said to have kept everything packed up even the fireirons and to have stirred up the fire with a stick during a whole winter  however by gods blessing and our fleets and armies the danger was kept from our doors  with the activity that followed upon the peace came a great deal of road making  the present high road between winchester and southampton was then made and the way cut through the hillsotterbourne hill and compton hill on either side  this led to the main part of the inhabitants settling in the village street instead of round the old church as before  another great road was made at the same timethat which crosses golden common and leads ultimately to portsmouth  it used to be called cobbetts road because william cobbett a clever selftaught man had much to do with laying it out  cobbett had a good many theories which he tried to put into practice some sensible others mistaken  the principal traces we see of him now are in the trees that he planted chiefly introduced from america  he thought the robinia or false acacia would make good hedges because of its long thorns and power of throwing up suckers and many people planted them but they proved too brittle to be of much use though some are still growing  he was a friend of mr harley who then owned otterbourne house and planted many curious trees there of which two long remaineda hickory nut and a large tree in the drive  there was also an oak with enormous leaves but it was planted so near the house that it had to be moved and died in consequence  these roads were for the coaches  young folks who never saw anything nearer approaching to a stage coach than the drags some gentlemen keep can hardly fancy what these stage coaches weretall vehicles holding four inside passengers and at least twelve outside and quantities of luggage  they were drawn by four of the strongest and quickest horses that could be procured and these were changed about every five or six miles so as to keep up full speed  the coachman generally a big burly man with a face reddened by exposure to the weather and often by a glass of ale at every stage sat on the box in a drab coat with many capes one over the other  the seat next to him was the favourite one with the passengers and gentlemen would sometimes bribe coachmen to let them drive nay some gentlemen actually took to the trade themselves there was also a guard who in mail coaches took care of the post bags and dropped them at the places where they were intended for  in the days when highwaymen infested the roads the guard had carried pistols and still the guard of the mail wore a red coat and blew a horn on entering any place to warn the people to bring out their post bags and exchange them for others  one or two coaches kept their horses at the white horse so as to be fresh for going up the hill others at the cricketers while others changed at compton and the new hut  some of the stables still remain converted into cottages  the horses were fine animals beautifully kept but the habit of hanging about publichouses to attend to them was not good for the ostlers and people concerned  about fifteen coaches came through this place in the morning and their fellows in the evening each proprietor keeping two coaches starting from the two opposite ends at the same time  there was the mail the telegraph the independent the red rover the hirondelle all london coaches besides the oxford coach and some that only ran between winchester and southampton  the driver and owner of one masons coach was only a few years ago living here when people intended to go on a journey they booked their places a day or two beforehand but for short journeys or going into winchester they would watch for a vacant space in a coach as it passed by  it is odd to look back at an old article in a quarterly review describing coach travelling as something so swift and complete that it could not be surpassed in its perfection  yet accidents with the spirited horses and rapid driving were not uncommon and a fall from an overloaded coach was a dangerous thing  when the mail went by coach the sending of letters and parcels could not but be expensive  heavy goods travelled by waggon barge or ship parcels went by carriers or by coaches and nothing could be posted but what was quite light  so postage was very expensive and it is strange to look back on the regulations connected with it  our readers under forty years old will hardly believe the rates that were paid for postage varying according to distance  there was a company in london that carried letters from one part of that town to another for twopence apiece and this was the cheapest post in england  a letter from london to otterbourne cost eightpence and one from winchester either threepence or fourpence one from devonshire elevenpence and this was paid not by the sender but by the receiver  it was reckoned impolite to prepay a letter  moreover the letter had to be on a single sheet  the sheet might be of any size that could be had but it must be only one  a small sheet enclosed within another or the lightest thing such as a lock of hair or a feather made it a double letter for which double postage had to be given  the usual custom was to write on quarto sheets twice the size of what is used now and after filling three sides to fold the fourth leaving a space for the direction and the seal and then to write on the flaps and in the space over my dear  sometimes crossing the writing till the whole letter was chequer work  for if the letter was to cost the receiver so much it seemed fair to let him get as much as possible  letters were almost always sealed and it took neat and practised hands to fold and seal them nicely without awkward corners sticking out  newspapers if folded so as to show the red government stamp went for a penny but nothing might be put into them and not a word beyond the address written on them  the reason of all this was that the cost of carriage was then so great that it could only be made to answer by those high rates and by preventing everything but real letters and newspapers from being thus taken  as government then as now was at the expense of postage its own correspondence went free and therefore all members of parliament had the privilege of sending letters freely  they were allowed to post eleven a day which might contain as much as would weigh an ounce without charge if they wrote the date at the top and their name in the right hand corner  this was called franking and plenty of letters by no means on public business travelled in that way  there was no post office in otterbourne till between 1836 and 1840 for of course there were few letters written or received and thus it did not seem to many persons worth while for village children to learn to write if they did go into service at a distance from home their letters would cost more than their friends could afford to pay  this was a sad thing and broke up and cut up families very much more than any distance does now  it really is easier to keep up intercourse with a person in america or even new zealand now than it was then with one in scotland northumberland or cornwall for travelling was so expensive that visits could seldom be made and servants could not go to their homes unless they were within such a short distance as to be able to travel by coach or by carriers cart or even walking all the way getting a cast now and then by a cart  people who did not travel by coaches or who went where there was no coach hired postchaises close carriages something like flies  most inns where the coaches kept their horses possessed a postchaise and were licensed to let out post horses for hire  most of the gentlefolks families kept a close carriage called a chariot and if they did not keep horses of their own took a pair of posthorses one of which was ridden by a man who whatever might be his age was always called a post boy  some inns dressed their postboys in light blue jackets some in yellow ones according to their politics but the shape was always the same corduroy tights top boots and generally white or rather drab coloured hats  it used to be an amusement to watch whether the postboy would be a blue or a yellow one at each fresh stage  hardly any one knows what a postboy was like now far less an oldfashioned travelling carriage or chariot and its boxes  the travelling carriage was generally yellow  it had two good seats inside and a double one had a second seat where two persons sat backwards  the cushion behind lifted up and disclosed a long narrow recess called the swordcase because when there were highwaymen on the roads people kept their weapons there  there were sometimes two sometimes one seat outside called the box and the dickeymuch the pleasantest places for it was very easy to feel sick and giddy inside  a curved splashboard went up from the bottom of the chariot to a level with the window and within it fitted what was called the cap box with a curved bottom so that when in a house it had to be set down in a frame to hold it upright  a big flat box called the imperial in which ladies put their dresses was on the top of the carriage two more long narrow ones generally used for shoes and linen fitted under the seat and another square one was hung below the dickey at the back and called the drop box  such a mischance has been known as on an arrival a servant coming in with the remains of this black box between his arms sayingsir should not this box have a bottom to it  the chariot thus carried plenty of goods and was a sort of family home on a journey  to go to plymouth which now can be done in six or seven hours then occupied two long days halting for the night to sleep at an inn     the old church   some of us can still remember the old church and the old sunday habits prevailing before 1830  the churchyard was large and very pretty though ill kept surrounded with a very open railing and with the banks sloping towards the water meadows clothed with fine elm treesone with a large and curious excrescence on the bark  there was a deep porch on the south side of the church with seats on each side  then on red tiles one entered between two blocks of pews of old brown unpainted oak their doors are panels to the roof of the boys school  in the space between them were two or three low benches for the children  there were three arches leading to the chancel but that on the south side was closed by the pulpit and reading desk and that on the north by a square pew belonging to cranbury  within the chancel on the north side was a large pew lined with red belonging to cranbury and on the south first the clerks desk then a narrow seat of the clergymans and then a large square pew  boys in the morning and men in the afternoon used to sit on the benches placed outside these and beyond was the rail shutting in the altar which was covered with red cloth and stood below a large window on each side of which were the commandments in yellow letters on a blue ground and on the wall were painted the two texts the cup of blessing is it not the communion of the blood of christ and the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of christ  the vestry was built out to the north and was entered from the sanctuary  further space was provided by two galleries one on the north side supported on iron poles and entered from the outside by a step ladder studded with large squareheaded nails to prevent it from being slippery the other went across the west end and was entered by a dark staircase leading up behind the pews which further led to the little square weatherboarded tower containing two beautifully toned bells  these were rung from the outer gallery where the men sat  there was a part boarded off for the singers  the font was nearly under the gallery  it was of white marble and still lines our present font  tradition says it was given by a former clerk perhaps mr fidler but there is no record of it  an older and much ruder font was hidden away under the gallery stairs close to an old chest where women sometimes found a seat against the west wall  in those days now more than half a century ago when archdeacon heathcote was vicar he or his curate used to ride over from hursley on sunday for the service at otterbourne  there was only one service alternately in the morning and afternoon at halfpast ten or at three or in the winter at halfpast two  the time was not much fixed for on a new comer asking when the service would take place the answer was at halfpast two sir or at three or else no time at all by which was meant no exact hour or halfhour  this uncertainty led to the bells never being rung till the minister was seen turning the corner of kiln lane just where the large boulder stone used to be  the congregation was however collecting almost all the men in white smocks with beautifully worked breasts and backs the more welltodo in velveteen the women in huge bonnets  the elder ones wore black silk or satin bonnets with high crowns and big fronts the younger ones straw with ribbon crossed over always with a bonnet cap under  a red cloak was the regular old womens dress or a black or blue one and sometimes a square shawl folded so as to make a triangle over a gown of stuff in winter print in summer  a blue printed cotton with white or yellow sprays was the regular week day dress and the poorest wore it on sundays  the little girls in the aisle had the like big coarse straw bonnets with a strip of glazed calico hemmed and crossed over for strings round tippets and straight print frocks down to their feet  the boys were in small smocks of either white or green canvas with fustian or corduroy jackets or trowsers below never cloth  gloves and pocket handkerchiefs were hardly known among the children hardly an umbrella far less parasols or muffs  ladies had pelisses for outofdoor wear fitting close like ulsters but made of dark green or purple silk or merino and white worked dresses under them in summer  well the congregation got into churchthree families by the step ladder to one gallery and the men into another where the front row squeezed their knees through the rails and leant on the top bar the rest of the world in the pews and the children on benches  the clerk was in his desk behind the reading deskgood george oxford with his calm good gentle face and tall figure sadly lame from rheumatism caught when working in the brick kilns  his voice was always heard above the others in the responses but our congregation never had dropped the habit of responding and though there was no chanting the amens and some of the versicles used to have a grand full musical sound peculiar to that church  people also all turned to the east for the creed few knelt but some of the elder men stood during the prayers and though there was far too much sitting down during the singing every body got up and stood if hallelujah occurred as it often did in anthems  there were eight or ten singers and they had a bassoon a flute and a clarionet  they used to sing before the communion service in the morning after the second lesson in the afternoon and before each sermon  master oxford had a good voice and was wanted in the choir so as soon as the general thanksgiving began he started off from his seat and might be heard going the length of the nave climbing the stairs and crossing the outer gallery  sometimes he took his long stick with him and gave a good stripe across the straw bonnet of any particularly naughty child  in the gallery he proclaimedlet us sing to the praise and glory of god in the psalm then giving the first line  the psalms were always from the new or old versions  a slate with the number in chalk was also hung out23 ov 112 nv as the case might be  about four verses of each were sung the last lines over and over again some very oddly divided  for instance     shall fix the place where we must dwell    the pride of jacob his delight  was sung thus     the pride of jathe pride of jathe pride of ja at least three    times before the line was ended  but rough as these were some of these psalms were very dear to us all specially the old twentythird     my shepherd is the living lord       nothing therefore i need    in pastures fair by pleasant streams       he setteth me to feed     he shall convert and glad my soul       and bring my soul in frame    to walk in paths of holiness       for his most holy name     i pass the gloomy vale of death       from fear and danger free    for there his guiding rod and staff       defend and comfort me  another muchloved one was the 121st     to zions hill i lift my eyes       from thence expecting aid    from zions hill and zions god       who heaven and earth hath made     sheltered beneath the almightys wings       thou shall securely rest    where neither sun nor moon shall thee       by day nor night molest     then thou my soul in safety rest       thy guardian will not sleep    his watchful care that israel guards       shall israels monarch keep     at home abroad in peace or war       thy god shall thee defend    conduct thee through lifes pilgrimage       safe to thy journeys end  will the sight of these lines bring back to any one the old tune the old sounds the old sights of the whitewashed church and old john green in the gallery singing with his bass voice with all his might his eyebrows moving as he sung  and then the commandments and antecommunion read not from the altar but the desk the surplice taken off in the desk instead of the vestry master oxfords announcements shouted out from his place generally after the second lessoni hereby give notice that a vestry meeting will be held on tuesday at twelve oclock to make a new rate for the relief of the poooor  i hereby give notice that evening service will be at halfpast two as long as the winter days are short well we should think these things odd now and we have much to be thankful for in the changes but there were holy and faithful ones then and master oxford was one of them  in the days here described from 1820 to 1827 few small villages had anything but dame schools and otterbourne children such as had any schooling at all were sent to mrs yatess school on the hill where she sat the very picture of the oldfashioned mistress in her black silk bonnet with the children on benches before her and her rod at hand  several families however did not send the children to school at all and there were many who could not read many more who could not write and there was very little religious teaching except that in the sunday afternoons in lent the catechism was said in church by the best instructed children but without any explanation  about the year 1819 mrs bargus and her daughter came to live at otterbourne and in 1822 miss bargus married william crawley yonge who had retired from the army after serving in the peninsula and at waterloo  both mr and mrs yonge had clergymen for their fathers and were used to think much of the welfare of their neighbours  it was not however till 1823 that mrs yonge saw her way to beginning a little sunday school for girls teaching it all by herself in a room by what is now mr j misselbrooks house  while there was still only one service on sundays she kept the school on the vacant half of the day reading the psalms and lessons to the children who were mostly biggish girls this was when archdeacon heathcote was the vicar of hursley and otterbourne and the rev robert shuckburgh was his curate  archdeacon and mrs heathcote who were most kind and liberal gave every help and assisted in setting up the clothing club  mrs yonges first list of easter prizes contains twenty names of girls and the years that have passed have left but few of them here  a large bible bound in plain brown leather was the highest prize prayer books equally unornamented new testaments and psalters being books containing only the psalms and matins and evensong were also given and were then perhaps more highly valued than the dainty little coloured books every one now likes to have for sunday  then there were frocks coarse straw bonnets and sometimes pocket handkerchiefs for these were not by any means such universal possessions as could be wished and only came out on sunday  as to gloves silk handkerchiefs parasols muffs or even umbrellas the children thought them as much out of their reach as a set of pearls or diamonds but what was worse their outer clothing was very insufficent seldom more than a thin cotton frock and tippet and the grey duffle cloaks which were thought a great possession were both slight and scanty  about 1826 mrs yonge was looking at the bit of waste land that had once served as a roadway to the field at the back of otterbourne house when she said how i wish i had money enough to build a school here  well said mrs bargus you shall have what i can give  the amount was small but with it mr yonge contrived to put up one room with two new small ones at the back built of mud rough cast and with a brick floor except for the little bedroom being raised a step and boarded  the schoolroom was intended to hold all the children who did not go to mrs yates both boys and girls and it was sufficient for in the first place nobody from fryernhill came  mrs green had a separate little school there  then the age for going to school was supposed to be six if anyone sent a child younger the fee was threepence instead of a penny  the fee for learning writing and arithmetic was threepence for there was a general opinion that they were of little real use and that writing letters would waste time as it sometimes certainly does besides this the eldest daughter of a family was always minding the baby and never went to school and boys were put to do what their mothers called keeping a few birds when very small indeed while other families were too rough to care about education so that the numbers were seldom over thirty  there were no such people as trained mistresses then  the national society had a school for masters but they were expensive and could only be employed in large towns so all that could be looked for was a kind motherly good person who could read and do needlework well  and the first mistress was mrs creswick a pleasantlooking person with a pale face and dark eyes who had been a servant at archdeacon heathcotes and had since had great troubles  she did teach the catechism reading and work when the children were tolerably good and obeyed her but boys were a great deal too much for her and she had frail health and such a bad leg that she never could walk down the lane to the old church  so after sunday school the children used to straggle down to church without anyone to look after them and sit on the benches in the aisle and do pretty much what they pleased except when admonished by master oxfords stick  mr shuckburgh had by this time come to reside in the parish in the house which is now the postoffice and there was at last a double service on the sunday  the next thing was to consider what was to be done about the boys who could not be made to mind mrs creswick  a row of the biggest sat at the back of the school with their heels to the wall and by constant kicking had almost knocked a hole through the mud wall so the vicar who was now the archdeacons son the rev gilbert wall heathcote gave permission for the putting up another mud and rough cast school house near the old church for the boys in an empty part of the churchyard to the north east where no one had ever been buried  however there master oxford was installed as schoolmaster coming all the way down from his house on the hill a prettytimbered cottage now pulled down  he and his boys had a long way to walk to their school but he taught them all he knew and set them a good example  the boys were all supposed to go to him at six years old and most were proud of the promotion  one little fellow was known to go to bed an hour or two earlier that he might be six years old the sooner  but some dreaded the good order enforced by the stick  there was one boy in particular who had outgrown the girls school and was very troublesome there  he would not go to the boys and his mother would not make him saying she feared he would fall into the water  well said mrs bargus who was a most bright kindly old lady of eighty ill make him go  so she took a large piece of yellow glazed calico intended for furniture lining walked up to school and held it up to the little boy  she said she heard that he would only go to the girls school and since everybody went there in petticoats she had brought some stuff to make him a petticoat too  the young man got up and walked straight off to the boys school  here are some verses written by mrs yonge in 1838 on one of the sights that met her eye in the old churchyard     while on the ear the solemn note    of prayer and praises heavenward float    a butterfly with brilliant wings    a lesson full of meaning brings             a sermon to the eye     there on an infants grave it stands    for it hath burst the shrouds dull bands    its vile worms body there is left    of gross earths habits now bereft             it soars into the sky     thus when the grave her dead shall give    the little form below shall live    clothed in a robe of dazzling white    shall spring aloft on wings of light             to realms above shall fly  changes were setting in all this time  the rickburnings in which so many foolish persons indulged was going on in 1831 in many parts of hampshire  they were caused partly by dislike to the threshing machines that were beginning to be used and partly by the notion that such disturbances would lead to the passing of the reform bill which ignorant men believed would give every poor man a fat pig in his stye  there was no rickburning here though some of the villagers joined the bands of men who wandered about the country demanding money and arms at the large houses  but happily none of them were actually engaged in any violence and none of them swelled the calendar of the special assize that took place at winchester for the trial of the rioters  one poor maidservant in the parish from the north of hampshire had however two brothers who were intelligent men of some education and who having been ringleaders were both sentenced to death  the sentence was however commuted to transportation for life  at sydney being of a very different class from the ordinary convict they prospered greatly and their letters were very interesting  they were wonderful feats of penmanship for postage from australia was ruinously expensive and they filled sheets of paper with writing that could hardly be read without a microscope  if we had those letters now they would be curious records of the early days of the colony but all now recollected is the account of a little kangaroo jumping into a hunters open shirt thinking it was his mothers pouch  the reform bill after all when passed made no present difference in otterbourne lifenothing like the difference that a measure a few years after effected namely the poorlaw amendment bill  not many people here remember the days of the old poorlaw when whatever a pauper family wanted was supplied from the rates and thus an idle man often lived more at his ease on other peoples money than an industrious man on his own earnings  it was held that if wages were small they might be helped out of the rates and thus the ratepayers were often ruined  in the midst of the street stood the old poorhouse  it had no governor nor anyone to see that order was kept or work done there and everybody that was homeless or lazy or disreputable drifted in there  they went in and out as they pleased and had a weekly allowance of money  now and then there was a great row among them  one room was inhabited by an old man named strong who was considered a wonder because he ate adders cut up like eels and stewed with a bit of bacon  every now and then a message would come in that old strong had got a couple of nice adders and wanted a bit of bacon to cook with them  then there was a large family whose father never worked for any one long together and lived in the workhouse with a wife and six or seven children supported by the parish  these people were pursuaded to go to manchester where there was sure to be work in the factories for all their many girls  the men in receipt of parish pay were supposed to have work found for them on the roads but there was not much of this to employ them and as they were paid all the same whether they worked or not some were said to hammer the stones as if they were afraid of hurting them or to make the wheeling a couple of barrows of chalk their whole days work  a good deal depended on the vestry management of each parish and there was less of flagrant idleness supported by the rates here than at many places  there was also a wellbuilt and arranged workhouse at hursley and the poor law commissioners consented to make one small union of hursley otterbourne farley and baddesley instead of throwing them into a large one  the discontinuance of outdoor relief to help out the wages was a great shock at first but when the ratepayers were no longer weighed down they could give more work and better wages and the labourers thus profited in the end and likewise began to learn more independence  still the times were hard then  few families could get on unless the mother as well as the father did field work and thus she had no time to attend thoroughly to making home comfortable mending the clothes or taking care of the little ones  the eldest girl was kept at home dragging about with the baby and often grew rough as well as ignorant and the cottage was often very little cared for  the notion of what was comfortable and suitable was very different then  the country began to be intersected by railways and the southwestern line was marked out to southampton  the course was dug out from shawford and compton downs and the embankment made along our valley  it was curious to see the white line creeping on as carts filled with chalk ran from the diggings to the end tipped over their contents and returned again  when the foundations were dug for the arch spanning the lane the holes filled with water as fast as they were made and nothing could be done till the two long ditches had been dug to carry off the water to allbrook  in the course of making them in the light peaty earth some bones of animals and i believe stags horns were found but unluckily were thrown away instead of being shown to anyone who would have made out from them much of the history of the formation of the boggy earth that forms the water meadows  the old church otterbourne p32jpg  it is amusing to remember the kind of dread that was felt at first of railway travelling  it was thought that the engines would blow up and as an old coachman is reported to have said when a coach is overturned there you are but when an engine blows up where are you  he certainly was so far right that a coach accident was fatal to fewer persons than a railway accident generally is  the railway passed so near the old church that the noise of the trains would be inconvenient on sundays  at least so thought those with inexperienced ears though many a church has since been built much nearer to the line  however this fixed the purpose that had already been forming of endeavouring to build a new church  the first idea had been of trying to raise 300 pounds to enlarge the old church but the distance from the greater part of the parish was so inconvenient and the railroad so near that the building of a new church was finally decided on  there really was not room for the men and boys at the same time on the backless forms they occupied between the pews in the chancel  moreover if a person was found sitting in a place to which another held that he or she had a right the owner never thought of looking for another place elsewhere and the one who was turned out went away displeased and declared that it was impossible to come to church for fear of being upset  it is strange and sad that people are so prone to forget what our master told us about taking the highest room even in his own house  but besides the want of accommodation the old church was at an inconvenient distance from the parish  no doubt there had once been more houses near but when the cottage inhabited by old aaron chalk was pulled down nothing remained near but otterbourne farm and the moat house every one living elsewhere had to walk half a mile some much more and though kiln lane was then much better shaded with fine trees than it is now it was hard work on a hot or wet sunday to go twice  some of us may recollect one constant churchgoer john rogers who was so lame as to require two sticks to walk with and had to set out an hour beforehand yet who seldom missed  just at this time the reverend john keble became vicar of hursley and otterbourne and forwarded the plan of church building with all his might  few new churches had been built at that time so that there was everything to be learnt while subscriptions were being collected from every quarter  magdalen college at oxford gave the site as well as a handsome subscription and every endeavour was made to render the new building truly church like  it was during the building that dr rowth the president of magdalen college coming to hold his court at the moat house had the model of the church brought out to him and took great interest in it  he is worth remembering for he was one of the wisest and most learned men in oxford and he lived to be nearly a hundred years old  church building was a much more difficult thing then than it is now when there are many architects trained in the principles of church building and materials of all kinds are readily provided  the cross form was at once fixed on as most suitable and the little bell turret was copied from one at a place called corston  mr owen carter an architect at winchester drew the plans with the constant watching and direction of mr yonge who attended to every detail  the white stone so fit for carving decorations which had been used in the cathedral is imported from caen in normandy  none had been brought over for many years till a correspondence was opened with the people at the quarries and blocks bought for the reredos and font  now it is constantly used  the panels of the pulpit with the carvings of the blessed virgin and the four latin fathers ss ambrose augustine jerome and gregory the great were found in a shop for antiquities in london  the shape was adapted to a sounding board which had been made for the cathedral but was rejected there  the altarrail also was found in a shop  it must previously have been in a church as it has the sacramental corn and grapes  it is thought to be old flemish work and represents a prince on one side with a crown laid down as he kneels in devotion and some ladies on the opposite side  the crown is an emperors and there is the collar of the golden fleece round his neck so that it is probably meant for either the emperor maximilian or his grandson charles v  one of the gentlemen kneeling behind the emperor has a beautiful face of adoration  the building of the church took about two years the first stone being laid at the northeast corner  it was begun on the 16th of may 1837 and it was ready for consecration on the 30th of july 1839  the building had been prosperous the only accident being the crushing of a thumb when the pulpit was set in its place  the new boys school was built at the same time the archway of the south door of the old church being used for the doorway so as to preserve the beautiful and peculiar decoration and the roof was lined with the doors and backs of the old oakpewing  in the flints collected for the building of this and of the wall round the churchyard there was a water wagtails nest in which a young cuckoo was reared having of course turned out the rightful nestling  probably it flew safely for the last time it was seen its foster parents were luring it out with green caterpillars held a little way from the nest  the expense of the building of the boys school and of a new room for the girls was defrayed chiefly by a bazaar held at winchester  there were at that time no education acts nor government requirements and the buildings would be deemed entirely unfit at this time even for the numbers who then used them and who did not amount to more than between thirty and forty boys and fifty or sixty girls and infants together about a third of the present numbers at school in otterbourne and allbrook  miss tucker was then the mistress master oxford still the master  the church was consecrated on the 30th of july 1839 by bishop sumner who preached a sermon on the text no man careth for my soul warning us that we could not plead such an excuse for ourselves if we neglected to walk in the right way  one of the earliest funerals in the churchyard was that of good old oxford old as he was called because he was crippled by rheumatism but he was only fiftytwo  he lies buried near the south gate of the churchyard under a large slate recording his name  he was followed in his office by mr william stainer who had hitherto been known as a baker living in the house which is now mr james godwins  his bread was excellent and he was also noted for what were called otterbourne buns the art of making which seems to have gone with him  they were small faircomplexioned buns which stuck together in parties of three and when soaked expanded to twice or three times their former size  he used to send them once or twice a week to winchester but though baking was his profession he did much besides  he was a real oldfashioned herbalist and had a curious book on the virtues of plants and he made decoctions of many kinds which he administered to those in want of medicine  before the poor law provided union doctors medical advice except at the hospital was almost out of reach of the poor  mr and mrs yonge like almost all other beneficent gentlefolks in villages kept a medicine chest and book and doctored such cases as they could venture on and mr stainer was in great favour as practitioner as many of our elder people can remember  he was exceedingly charitable and kind and ready to give his help so far as he could  he was a great lover of flowers and had contrived a sort of little greenhouse over the great oven at the back of his house and there he used to bring up lovely geraniums and other flowers which he sometimes sold  he was a deeply religious and devout man and during master oxfords illness took his place in church which was more important when there was no choir and the singers sat in the gallery  he was very happy in this office moving about on felt shoes that he might make no noise and most reverently keeping the church clean and watching over it in every way  he also continued in the post of schoolmaster which at first he had only taken temporarily giving up part of his business to his nephew  but he still sat up at night baking and he also had other troubles there was insanity in his family and he was much harassed  his kindness and simplicity were sometimes abused  he never had the heart to refuse to lend money or to deny bread on credit to hopeless debtors and altogether debts distress baking all night and school keeping all day were too much for him  the first hint of an examination of his school completed the mischief and he died insane  it is a sad story but many of us will remember with affectionate regard the good kind quaint and most excellent little man  by that time our schoolmistress was mrs durndell the policemans wife a severe woman but she certainly made the girls do thoroughly whatever she taught especially repetition and needlework  the examiner on religious subjects mr allen afterwards an archdeacon reported that the girls had an unusual knowledge of the text of scripture but that he did not think them equally intelligent as to the meaning  daily service had been commenced when the new church was opened and the children of the schools attended it  there was also a much larger congregation of old men than have ever come in later years  at one time there were nine constantly there  one of these named passingham who used to ring the bell for matins and evensong was said to have been the strongest man in the parish and to have carried two sacks of corn over the common on the top of the hill in his youth  he was still a hearty old man at eightysix when after ringing the bell one morning as usual he dropped down on the hill in a fit and died in a few seconds  there was not much change for a good many years  in 1846 the parsonage house was built and given to the living by mr keble  the stained glass of the south window of the church was given by the reverend john yonge of puslinch rector of newton ferrers in devonshire in memory of his youngest son edmund charles who died at otterbourne house in 1847 thirteen years previously in 1834 the eldest son james yonge had likewise died at otterbourne house  both the brothers lie buried here one in the old churchyard one in the new  they are commemorated in their own church at newton by a tablet with the inscriptionwhat i do thou knowest not now but thou shall know hereafter  in 1834 their father gave what made as it were the second foundation of the lending library for there were about fourandtwenty very serious books given in archdeacon heathcotes time kept in the vestry at the old church  they looked as if they had been read but only by the elder people who liked a grave book and there was nothing there meant for the young people  so there were a good many new books bought and weekly given out at the penny club with more or less vigour for the next thirty years or so  the next public matter that greatly affected this place was the crimean war  it was a large proportion of our young men who were more or less concerned in it  captain denzill chamberlayne in the cavalry lieut julian b yonge john hawkins joseph knight james and william mason and it was in the midst of the hurry and confusion of the departure that the death of mr w c yonge took place february 26th 1854  three of those above mentioned lived to return home  captain chamberlayne shared in the famous charge of the light brigade at balaclava when     into the jaws of death    rode the six hundred    cannon to right of them    cannon to left of them    volleyed and thundered  his horse pimento was killed under him but he escaped without a wound and on his return home was drawn up to the house by the people and had a reception which made such an impression on the children that when one was asked in school what a hero was she answered captain chamberlayne  john hawkins joseph knight and william mason died in the crimea  a tablet to commemorate them was built into the wall of the churchyard with the textit is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth for the discipline of the army had been very good for these youths and therefore this verse was chosen for them by mr keble  the next event that concerned the parish much was the death of the great and holy man who had been our rector for thirty years  mr keble died at bournemouth on the 29th of march 1866  his manners and language were always so simple and his humility so great that many of those who came in contact with him never realized how great a man he was not being able to perceive that the very deepest thoughts might be clothed in the plainest language  some felt in the words of the poem     i came and saw and having seen       weak heart i drew offence    from thy prompt smile thy humble mien       thy lowly diligence  but none who really knew him could fail to be impressed with the sense of his power his wisdom his love and above all his holiness and his christian year will always be a fund of consolation full of suggestions of good and devotional thoughts and deeds  mrs keble who was already very ill followed him to her rest on the 11th of may  it may be worth remembering that the last time she wrote her name was a signature to a petition against licensing marriage with a deceased wifes sister  sir william heathcote then appointed the reverend james g young as vicar of hursley and otterbourne  a fresh tide of change began to set in  as times altered and population increased and as old things and people passed away there were various changes in the face of the village  the government requirements made it necessary to erect a new girls school and land was permanently secured for the purpose and this was done chiefly by subscription among the inhabitants affording a room large enough for parish meetings and lectures as well as for its direct purpose  the subscription was as a testimonial to the rev william bigg wither who had been thirty years curate of the parish and under whom many of the changes for the better were worked out  the building was provided with a tower in case there should ever be a clock given to the parish  the clock was given in a manner worthy of remembrance  mr william pink as a thatcher and his two sisters in service had saved enough to provide for their old age and to leave a considerable overplus out of which the last survivor mrs elizabeth pink when passing away at a good old age bequeathed enough to provide the parish with the clock whose voice has already become one of our most familiar sounds  allbrook was by this time growing into a large hamlet and a school chapel was then built chiefly by mr wheeler  we must not forget that we had for five years the great and excellent samuel wilberforce for our bishop and that he twice held confirmations in our parish  no one can forget the shock of his sudden call  one moment he was calling his companions attention to the notes of a late singing nightingale the next his horse had stumbled and he was gone  it was remarkable that shortly before he had after going over the hospital spoken with dread of what he called the humiliation of a lingering illnessexactly what he was spared  bishop harold browne came from ely to take the see of winchester  he reconsecrated our church when the chancel was enlarged and the new aisle added  he carried on vigorously work only begun under bishop wilberforce  under him diocesan synods the girls friendly society and the examination of senior scholars in religious knowledge have all shown his diligent oversight as shepherd of the flock  in the year 1875 sir william heathcote succeeded in bringing about an arrangement by which otterbourne could be separated from hursley and have a vicar of its own the difference of income being made up to the vicar of hursley  this was done by the aid of a munificent lady mrs gibbs the widow of one of the great merchant princes whose wealth was always treated as a trust from god  she became the patron of the living and the advowson remains in her family  the first vicar was the reverend walter francis elgie who had already been six years curate and had won the love and honour of all his flock deeply did they all mourn him when it was gods will to take him from them on the 25th of february 1881 in the 43rd year of his age after ten years of zealous work  it was felt as remarkable that a young pupil teacher in consumption whom he had sent to the home at bournemouth was taken on the same day and buried here the day after and that the schoolmaster walter fisher a man of gentle and saintly nature followed him six weeks after     we left them in the churchs shade       our standardbearer true    and near at hand the gentle maid       who well his guidance knew     he fainted in the noon of life       nor knew his victory won    she was fresh girded for the strife       her battle scarce begun     long had we known deaths angel hand       the maidens brow had seald    he fell like chief of warrior band       struck down on battlefield     so in gods acre here they meet       as they have met above    tasting beneath their saviours feet       the treasures of his love     for what they learnt and taught of here       is present with them there    may we speed on in faith and fear       then heavenly rest to share  with the coming of our present vicar the rev h w brock our otterbourne story ends as the times are no longer old times  the water works for the supply of southampton are our last novelty by which such of us benefit as either themselves or their landlords pay a small contribution  they have given us some red buildings at one end and on the hill a queer little round tower containing the staircase leading to the underground reservoir a wonderful construction of circles of brick pillars and arches as those remember who visited it before the water was let in  and verily we may be thankful that our record has so few events in it no terrible disasters but that there has been peace and health and comfort more than falls to the lot of many a parish  truly we may thankfully say the lot is fallen unto me in a fair ground yea i have a goodly heritage  birds on fence p42jpg     old remembrances   bridges over river p43jpg  i remember i remember    old times at otterbourne before the building of the church    and when smock frocks were worn  i remember i remember    when railroads there were none when by stage coach at early dawn    the journey was begun  and through the turnpike roads till eve    trotted the horses four with inside passengers and out    they carried near a score  red rover and the telegraph    we knew them all by name and masons and the oxford coach    full thirty of them came  the coachman wore his many capes    the guard his bugle blew the horses were a gallant sight    dashing upon our view  i remember i remember    the posting days of old the yellow chariot lined with blue    and lace of colour gold  the postboys jackets blue or buff    the inns upon the road the hills up which we used to walk    to lighten thus the load  the rattling up before the inn    the horses led away the postboy as he touched his hat    and came to ask his pay  the perch aloft upon the box    delightful for the view the turnpike gates whose keepers stood    demanding each his due  i remember i remember    when ships were beauteous things the floating castles of the deep    borne upon snowwhite wings  ere ironclads and turret ships    ugly as evil dream became the hideous progeny    of iron and of steam  you crossed the itchen ferry    all in an open boat now on a panting hissing bridge    you scarcely seem afloat  southampton docks were sheets of mud    grim colliers at the quay no tramway and no slender pier    to stretch into the sea  i remember i remember    long years ere rowland hill when letters covered quarto sheets    writ with a grey goose quill  both hard to fold and hard to read    crossed to the scarlet seal hardest of all to pay for ere    their news they might reveal  no stamp with royal head was there    but eightpence was the sum for every letter all alike    that did from london come  i remember i remember    the mowing of the hay scythes sweeping through the heavy grass    at breaking of the day  the haymakers in merry ranks    tossing the swaths so sweet the haycocks tanning olivebrown    in glowing summer heat  the reapers mid the ruddy wheat    the thumping of the flail the winnowing within the barn    by whirling round a sail  long ere the whirr and buz and rush    became a harvest sound or monsters trailed their tails of spikes    or ploughed the fallow ground  our sparks flew from the flint and steel    no lucifers were known snuffers with tallow candles came    to prune the wick oergrown  hands did the work of engines then    but now some new machine must hatch the eggs and sew the seams    and make the cakes i ween  i remember i remember    the homely village school the dame with spelling book and rod    the sceptre of her rule  a black silk bonnet on her head    buff kerchief on her neck with spectacles upon her nose    and apron of blue check  ah then were no inspection days    no standards then were known children could freely make dirt pies    and learning let alone  those sundays i remember too    when service there was one for living in the parish then    of clergy there were none  and oh i can recall to mind    the church and every pew william and marys royal arms    hung up in fullest view  the lion smiling with his tongue    like a pug dogs hung out the unicorn with twisted horn    brooding upon his rout  exalted in the gallery high    the tuneful village choir with flute bassoon and clarionet    their notes rose high and higher  they shewed the number of the psalm    in white upon a slate and many a time the last lines sung    of brady and of tate  while far below upon the floor    along the narrow aisle the children on then benches sat    arranged in single file  and there the clerk would stump along    and strike with echoing blow each idle guilty little head    that chattered loud or low  ah i remember many things    old middleaged and new is the new better than the old    more bright more wise more true  the old must ever pass away    the new must still come in when these new things are old to you    be they unstained by sin  so will their memory be sweet    a treasury of bliss to be borne with us in the days    when we their presence miss  trifles connected with the love    of many a vanished friend will thrill the heart and wake the sense    for memory has no end
