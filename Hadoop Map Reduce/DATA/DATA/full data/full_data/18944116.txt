same walter scott who      was so passionately ambitious of fame when i wrote the song of      young lochinvar at bothwell and if i could recall the same      feelings where was i to find an audience so kind and patient and      whose applause was at the same time so well worth having as lady      dalkeith and lady douglas when one thinks of these things there      is no silencing ones regret but by corporal nyms philosophy      things must be as they may one generation goeth and another      comethto lord montagu june 28th 1825     preface   on the death of sir walter scott in 1832 his entire literary remains were placed at the disposal of his soninlaw mr john gibson lockhart among these remains were two volumes of a journal which had been kept by sir walter from 1825 to 1832 mr lockhart made large use of this journal in his admirable life of his fatherinlaw writing however so short a time after scotts death he could not use it so freely as he might have wished and according to his own statement it was by regard for the feelings of living persons that he both omitted and altered and indeed he printed no chapter of the diary in full  there is no longer any reason why the journal should not be published in its entirety and by the permission of the hon mrs maxwellscott it now appears exactly as scott left itbut for the correction of obvious slips of the pen and the omission of some details chiefly of family and domestic interest  the original journal consists of two small 4to volumes 9 inches by 8 bound in vellum and furnished with strong locks the manuscript is closely written on both sides and towards the end shows painful evidence of the physical prostration of the writer the journal abruptly closes towards the middle of the second volume with the following entryprobably the last words ever penned by scott  illustration by one of the old pontiffs but which i forget and so paraded the streets by moonlight to discover if possible some appearance of the learned sir william gell or the pretty mrs ashley at length we found our old servant who guided us to the lodgings taken by sir william gell where all was comfortable a good fire included which our fatigue and the chilliness of the night required we dispersed as soon as we had taken some food wine and water  we slept reasonably but on the next morning  in the annotations it seemed most satisfactory to follow as closely as possible the method adopted by mr lockhart in the case of those parts of the journal that have been already published almost all mr lockharts notes have been reproduced and these are distinguished by his initials extracts from the life from james skene of rubislaws unpublished reminiscences and from unpublished letters of scott himself and his contemporaries have been freely used wherever they seemed to illustrate particular passages in the journal  with regard to scotts quotations a certain difficulty presented itself in his journal he evidently quoted from memory and he not unfrequently makes considerable variations from the originals occasionally indeed it would seem that he deliberately made free with the exact words of his author to adapt them more pertinently to his own mood or the impulse of the moment in any case it seemed best to let scotts quotations appear as he wrote them his reading lay in such curious and unfrequented quarters that to verify all the sources is a nearly impossible task it is to be remembered also that he himself held very free notions on the subject of quotation  i have to thank the hon mrs maxwellscott for permitting me to retain for the last three years the precious volumes in which the journal is contained and for granting me access to the correspondence of sir walter preserved at abbotsford and i have likewise to acknowledge the courtesy of his grace the duke of buccleuch for allowing me the use of the scott letters at dalkeith to mr wf skene historiographer royal for scotland my thanks are warmly rendered for intrusting me with his precious heirloom the volume which contains sir walters letters to his father and the reminiscences that accompany themone of many kind offices towards me during the last thirty years in our relations as author and publisher i am also obliged to mr archibald constable for permitting me to use the interesting memorandum by james ballantyne  finally i have to express my obligation to many other friends who never failed cordially to respond to any call i made upon them  dd       edinburgh 22 drummond place october 1 1890     illustrations

i have myself lost recollection of much that was interesting and i have deprived my family and the public of some curious information by not carrying this resolution into effect i have bethought me on seeing lately some volumes of byrons notes that he probably had hit upon the right way of keeping such a memorandumbook by throwing aside all pretence to regularity and order and marking down events just as they occurred to recollection i will try this plan and behold i have a handsome locked volume such as might serve for a ladys album nota bene john lockhart and anne and i are to raise a society for the suppression of albums it is a most troublesome shape of mendicity sir your autographa line of poetryor a prose sentenceamong all the sprawling sonnets and blotted trumpery that dishonours these miscellanies a man must have a good stomach that can swallow this botheration as a compliment  i was in ireland last summer and had a most delightful tour it cost me upwards of £500 including £100 left with walter and jane for we travelled a large party and in style there is much less exaggerated about the irish than is to be expected their poverty is not exaggerated it is on the extreme verge of human misery their cottages would scarce serve for pigstyes even in scotland and their rags seem the very refuse of a ragshop and are disposed on their bodies with such ingenious variety of wretchedness that you would think nothing but some sort of perverted taste could have assembled so many shreds together you are constantly fearful that some knot or loop will give and place the individual before you in all the primitive simplicity of paradise then for their food they have only potatoes and too few of them yet the men look stout and healthy the women buxom and wellcoloured  dined with us being sunday will clerk and charles kirkpatrick sharpe wc is the second son of the celebrated author of naval tactics1 i have known him intimately since our college days and to my thinking never met a man of greater powers or more complete information on all desirable subjects in youth he had strongly the edinburgh pruritus disputandi but habits of society have greatly mellowed it and though still anxious to gain your suffrage to his views he endeavours rather to conciliate your opinion than conquer it by force still there is enough of tenacity of sentiment to prevent in london society where all must go slack and easy wc from rising to the very top of the tree as a conversation man who must not only wind the thread of his argument gracefully but also know when to let go but i like the scotch taste better there is more matter more information above all more spirit in it clerk will i am afraid leave the world little more than the report of his fame he is too indolent to finish any considerable work2 charles kirkpatrick sharpe is another very remarkable man he was bred a clergyman but did not take orders owing i believe to a peculiar effeminacy of voice which must have been unpleasant in reading prayers some family quarrels occasioned his being indifferently provided for by a small annuity from his elder brother extorted by an arbitral decree he has infinite wit and a great turn for antiquarian lore as the publications of kirkton3 etc bear witness his drawings are the most fanciful and droll imaginablea mixture between hogarth and some of those foreign masters who painted temptations of st anthony and such grotesque subjects as a poet he has not a very strong touch strange that his fingerends can describe so well what he cannot bring out clearly and firmly in words if he were to make drawing a resource it might raise him a large income but though a lover of antiquities and therefore of expensive trifles cks is too aristocratic to use his art to assist his revenue he is a very complete genealogist and has made many detections in douglas and other books on pedigree which our nobles would do well to suppress if they had an opportunity strange that a man should be curious after scandal of centuries old not but charles loves it fresh and fresh also for being very much a fashionable man he is always master of the reigning report and he tells the anecdote with such gusto that there is no helping sympathising with himthe peculiarity of voice adding not a little to the general effect my idea is that cks with his oddities tastes satire and high aristocratic feelings resembles horace walpoleperhaps in his person also in a general waysee miss hawkins anecdotes4 for a description of the author of the castle of otranto  no other company at dinner except my cheerful and goodhumoured friend missie macdonald5 so called in fondness one bottle of champagne with the ladies assistance two of claret i observe that both these great connoisseurs were very nearly if not quite agreed that there are no absolutely undoubted originals of queen mary but how then should we be so very distinctly informed as to her features what has become of all the originals which suggested these innumerable copies surely mary must have been as unfortunate in this as in other particulars of her life6  november 21i am enamoured of my journal i wish the zeal may but last once more of ireland i said their poverty was not exaggerated neither is their witnor their goodhumournor their whimsical absurditynor their courage  witi gave a fellow a shilling on some occasion when sixpence was the fee remember you owe me sixpence pat may your honour live till i pay you there was courtesy as well as wit in this and all the clothes on pats back would have been dearly bought by the sum in question  goodhumourthere is perpetual kindness in the irish cabin buttermilk potatoes a stool is offered or a stone is rolled that your honour may sit down and be out of the smoke and those who beg everywhere else seem desirous to exercise free hospitality in their own houses their natural disposition is turned to gaiety and happiness while a scotchman is thinking about the termday or if easy on that subject about hell in the next worldwhile an englishman is making a little hell of his own in the present because his muffin is not well roastedpats mind is always turned to fun and ridicule they are terribly excitable to be sure and will murther you on slight suspicion and find out next day that it was all a mistake and that it was not yourself they meant to kill at all at all  absurditythey were widening the road near lord claremonts seat as we passed a number of cars were drawn up together at a particular point where we also halted as we understood they were blowing a rock and the shot was expected presently to go off after waiting two minutes or so a fellow called out something and our carriage as a planet and the cars for satellites started all forward at once the irishmen whooping and crying and the horses galloping unable to learn the meaning of this i was only left to suppose that they had delayed firing the intended shot till we should pass and that we were passing quickly to make the delay as short as possible no such thing by dint of making great haste we got within ten yards of the rock when the blast took place throwing dust and gravel on our carriage and had our postillion brought us a little nearer it was not for want of hallooing and flogging that he did not we should have had a still more serious share of the explosion the explanation i received from the drivers was that they had been told by the overseer that as the mine had been so long in going off he dared say we would have time to pass itso we just waited long enough to make the danger imminent i have only to add that two or three people got behind the carriage just for nothing but to see how our honours got past  went to the oil gas committee7 this morning of which concern i am president or chairman it has amused me much by bringing me into company with a body of active businessloving moneymaking citizens of edinburgh chiefly whigs by the way whose sentiments and proceedings amuse me the stock is rather low in the market 35s premium instead of £5 it must rise however for the advantages of the light are undeniable and folks will soon become accustomed to idle apprehensions or misapprehensions from £20 to £25 should light a house capitally supposing you leave town in the vacation the three last quarters cost me £10 10s and the first £8 was greatly overcharged we will see what this the worst and darkest quarter costs  dined with sir robert dundas8 where we met lord and lady melville my little nieces ex officio gave us some pretty music i do not know and cannot utter a note of music and complicated harmonies seem to me a babble of confused though pleasing sounds yet songs and simple melodies especially if connected with words and ideas have as much effect on me as on most people but then i hate to hear a young person sing without feeling and expression suited to the song i cannot bear a voice that has no more life in it than a pianoforte or a buglehorn there is something about all the fine arts of soul and spirit which like the vital principle in man defies the research of the most critical anatomist you feel where it is not yet you cannot describe what it is you want sir joshua or some other great painter was looking at a picture on which much pains had been bestowedwhy yes he said in a hesitating manner it is very cleververy well donecant find fault but it wants something it wantsit wants damn meit wants thatthrowing his hand over his head and snapping his fingers tom moores is the most exquisite warbling i ever heard next to him david macculloch9 for scots songs the last when a boy at dumfries was much admired by burns who used to get him to try over the words which he composed to new melodies he is brother of macculloch of ardwell  november 22moore i saw moore for the first time i may say this season we had indeed met in public twenty years ago there is a manly frankness and perfect ease and good breeding about him which is delightful not the least touch of the poet or the pedant a littlevery little man less i think than lewis and somewhat like him in person god knows not in conversation for matt though a clever fellow was a bore of the first description moreover he looked always like a schoolboy i remember a picture of him being handed about at dalkeith house it was a miniature i think by sanders10 who had contrived to muffle lewiss person in a cloak and placed some poignard or dark lanthorn appurtenance i think in his hand so as to give the picture the cast of a bravo that like mat lewis said duke henry to whom it had passed in turn why that is like a man imagine the effect lewis was at his elbow11 now moore has none of this insignificance to be sure his person is much stouter than that of mgl his countenance is decidedly plain but the expression is so very animated especially in speaking or singing that it is far more interesting than the finest features could have rendered it  i was aware that byron had often spoken both in private society and in his journal of moore and myself in the same breath and with the same sort of regard so i was curious to see what there could be in common betwixt us moore having lived so much in the gay world i in the country and with people of business and sometimes with politicians moore a scholar i none he a musician and artist i without knowledge of a note he a democrat i an aristocratwith many other points of difference besides his being an irishman i a scotchman and both tolerably national yet there is a point of resemblance and a strong one we are both goodhumoured fellows who rather seek to enjoy what is going forward than to maintain our dignity as lions and we have both seen the world too widely and too well not to contemn in our souls the imaginary consequence of literary people who walk with their noses in the air and remind me always of the fellow whom johnson met in an alehouse and who called himself the great twalmleyinventor of the floodgate iron for smoothing linen he also enjoys the mot pour rire and so do i  moore has i think been illtreated about byrons memoirs he surrendered them to the family lord byrons executors and thus lost £2000 which he had raised upon them at a most distressing moment of his life it is true they offered and pressed the money on him afterwards but they ought to have settled it with the booksellers and not put poor toms spirit in arms against his interest12 i think at least it might have been so managed at any rate there must be an authentic life of byron by somebody why should they not give the benefit of their materials to tom moore whom byron had made the depositary of his own memoirsbut tm thinks that cam hobhouse has the purpose of writing byrons life himself he and moore were at sharp words during the negotiation and there was some explanation necessary before the affair ended it was a pity that nothing save the total destruction of byrons memoirs would satisfy his executors13 but there was a reasonpremat nox alta  it would be a delightful addition to life if tm had a cottage within two miles of one we went to the theatre together and the house being luckily a good one received tm with rapture i could have hugged them for it paid back the debt of the kind reception i met with in ireland14  here is a matter for a may morning but much fitter for a november one the general distress in the city has affected h and r15 constables great agents should they go it is not likely that constable can stand and such an event would lead to great distress and perplexity on the part of jb and myself thank god i have enough at least to pay forty shillings in the pound taking matters at the very worst but much distress and inconvenience must be the consequence i had a lesson in 1814 which should have done good upon me but success and abundance erased it from my mind but this is no time for journalising or moralising either necessity is like a sourfaced cookmaid and i a turnspit whom she has flogged ere now till he mounted his wheel if wstk16 can be out by 25th january it will do much and it is possible  s son has saved his comrade on shipboard by throwing himself overboard and keeping the other afloata very gallant thing but the gran giag asso17 asks me to write a poem on the civic crown of which he sends me a description quoted from adams antiquities which mellifluous performance is to persuade the admiralty to give the young conservator promotion oh he is a rare headpiece an admirable merron i do not believe there is in nature such a fullacorned boar18  could not write to purpose for thickcoming fancies the wheel would not turn easily and cannot be forced      my spinningwheel is auld and stiff       the rock ot winna stand sir     to keep the temperpin in tiff       employs aft my hand sir19  went to dine at the lord justiceclerks20 as i thought by invitation but it was for tuesday sennight returned very well pleased not being exactly in the humour for company and had a beefsteak my appetite is surely excepting in quantity that of a farmer for eating moderately of anything my epicurean pleasure is in the most simple diet wine i seldom taste when alone and use instead a little spirits and water i have of late diminished the quantity for fear of a weakness inductive to a diabetesa disease which broke up my fathers health though one of the most temperate men who ever lived i smoke a couple of cigars instead which operates equally as a sedative      just to drive the cold winter away     and drown the fatigues of the day  i smoked a good deal about twenty years ago when at ashestiel but coming down one morning to the parlour i found as the room was small and confined that the smell was unpleasant and laid aside the use of the nicotian weed for many years but was again led to use it by the example of my son a hussar officer and my soninlaw an oxford student i could lay it aside tomorrow i laugh at the dominion of custom in this and many things      we make the giants first and thendo not kill them  november 23on comparing notes with moore i was confirmed in one or two points which i had always laid down in considering poor byron one was that like rousseau he was apt to be very suspicious and a plain downright steadiness of manner was the true mode to maintain his good opinion will rose told me that once while sitting with byron he fixed insensibly his eyes on his feet one of which it must be remembered was deformed looking up suddenly he saw byron regarding him with a look of concentrated and deep displeasure which wore off when he observed no consciousness or embarrassment in the countenance of rose murray afterwards explained this by telling rose that lord byron was very jealous of having this personal imperfection noticed or attended to in another point moore confirmed my previous opinion namely that byron loved mischiefmaking moore had written to him cautioning him against the project of establishing the paper called the liberal in communion with such men as pb shelley and hunt21 on whom he said the world had set its mark byron showed this to the parties shelley wrote a modest and rather affecting expostulation to moore22 these two peculiarities of extreme suspicion and love of mischief are both shades of the malady which certainly tinctured some part of the character of this mighty genius and without some tendency towards which geniusi mean that kind which depends on the imaginative powerperhaps cannot exist to great extent the wheels of a machine to play rapidly must not fit with the utmost exactness else the attrition diminishes the impetus  another of byrons peculiarities was the love of mystifying which indeed may be referred to that of mischief there was no knowing how much or how little to believe of his narratives instancemr bankes23 expostulating with him upon a dedication which he had written in extravagant terms of praise to cam hobhouse byron told him that cam had teased him into the dedication till he had said well it shall be soproviding you will write the dedication yourself and affirmed that cam hobhouse did write the highcoloured dedication accordingly i mentioned this to murray having the report from will rose to whom bankes had mentioned it murray in reply assured me that the dedication was written by lord byron himself and showed it me in his own hand i wrote to rose to mention the thing to bankes as it might have made mischief had the story got into the circle byron was disposed to think all men of imagination were addicted to mix fiction or poetry with their prose he used to say he dared believe the celebrated courtezan of venice about whom rousseau makes so piquante a story was if one could see her a draggletailed wench enough i believe that he embellished his own amours considerably and that he was in many respects le fanfaron de vices quil navoit pas he loved to be thought awful mysterious and gloomy and sometimes hinted at strange causes i believe the whole to have been the creation and sport of a wild and powerful fancy in the same manner he crammed people as it is termed about duels etc which never existed or were much exaggerated  constable has been here as lame as a duck upon his legs but his heart and courage as firm as a cock he has convinced me we will do well to support the london house he has sent them about £5000 and proposes we should borrow on our joint security £5000 for their accommodation jb and r cadell present i must be guided by them and hope for the best certainly to part company would be to incur an awful risk  what i liked about byron besides his boundless genius was his generosity of spirit as well as purse and his utter contempt of all the affectations of literature from the schoolmagisterial style to the lackadaisical byrons example has formed a sort of upper house of poetry there is lord leveson gower a very clever young man24 lord porchester too25 nephew to mrs scott of harden a young man who lies on the carpet and looks poetical and dandyishfine lad too but      there will be many peers     ere such another byron  talking of abbotsford it begins to be haunted by too much company of every kind but especially foreigners i do not like them i hate fine waistcoats and breastpins upon dirty shirts i detest the impudence that pays a stranger compliments and harangues about his works in the authors house which is usually illbreeding moreover they are seldom long of making it evident that they know nothing about what they are talking of except having seen the lady of the lake at the opera  dined at st catherines26 with lord advocate lord and lady melville lord justiceclerk27 sir archibald campbell of succoth all class companions and acquainted well for more than forty years all except lord jc were at frasers class high school28 boyle

nantes in gurgite vasto29  november 24talking of strangers london held some four or five years since one of those animals who are lions at first but by transmutation of two seasons become in regular course boarsugo foscolo by name a haunter of murrays shop and of literary parties ugly as a baboon and intolerably conceited he spluttered blustered and disputed without even knowing the principles upon which men of sense render a reason and screamed all the while like a pig when they cut its throat another such animaluccio is a brute of a sicilian marquis de  who wrote something about byron he inflicted two days on us at abbotsford they never know what to make of themselves in the forenoon but sit tormenting the women to play at proverbs and such trash  foreigner of a different castcount olonym olonynethats it son of the president of the royal society and a captain in the imperial guards he is meanlooking and sickly but has much sense candour and general information there was at abbotsford and is here for education just now a young count davidoff with a tutor mr collyer he is a nephew of the famous orloffs it is quite surprising how much sense and sound thinking this youth has at the early age of sixteen without the least selfconceit or forwardness on the contrary he seems kind modest and ingenuous30 to questions which i asked about the state of russia he answered with the precision and accuracy of twice his years i should be sorry the saying were verified in him      so wise so young they say do neer live long31  saw also at abbotsford two frenchmen whom i liked friends of miss dumergue one called le noir is the author of a tragedy which he had the grace never to quote and which i though poked by some malicious persons had not the grace even to hint at they were disposed at first to be complimentary but i convinced them it was not the custom here and they took it well and were agreeable  a little bilious this morning for the first time these six months it cannot be the london matters which stick on my stomach for that is mending and may have good effects on myself and others  dined with robert cockburn company lord melville and family sir john and lady hope lord and lady r kerr and so forth combination of colliers general and coals up to double price the men will not work although or rather because they can make from thirty to forty shillings per week lord rk told us that he had a letter from lord forbes son of earl granard ireland that he was asleep in his house at castle forbes when awakened by a sense of suffocation which deprived him of the power of stirring a limb yet left him the consciousness that the house was on fire at this moment and while his apartment was in flames his large dog jumped on the bed seized his shirt and dragged him to the staircase where the fresh air restored his powers of exertion and of escape this is very different from most cases of preservation of life by the canine race when the animal generally jumps into the water in which element he has force and skill that of fire is as hostile to him as to mankind  november 25read jeffreys neat and wellintended address32 to the mechanics upon their combinations will it do good umph it takes only the hand of a lilliputian to light a fire but would require the diuretic powers of gulliver to extinguish it the whigs will live and die in the heresy that the world is ruled by little pamphlets and speeches and that if you can sufficiently demonstrate that a line of conduct is most consistent with mens interest you have therefore and thereby demonstrated that they will at length after a few speeches on the subject adopt it of course in this case we would have no need of laws or churches for i am sure there is no difficulty in proving that moral regular and steady habits conduce to mens best interest and that vice is not sin merely but folly but of these men each has passions and prejudices the gratification of which he prefers not only to the general weal but to that of himself as an individual under the action of these wayward impulses a man drinks today though he is sure of starving tomorrow he murders tomorrow though he is sure to be hanged on wednesday and people are so slow to believe that which makes against their own predominant passions that mechanics will combine to raise the price for one week though they destroy the manufacture for ever the best remedy seems to be the probable supply of labourers from other trades jeffrey proposes each mechanic shall learn some other trade than his own and so have two strings to his bow he does not consider the length of a double apprenticeship to make a man a good weaver and a good tailor would require as much time as the patriarch served for his two wives and after all he would be but a poor workman at either craft each mechanic has indeed a second trade for he can dig and do rustic work perhaps the best reason for breaking up the association will prove to be the expenditure of the money which they have been simple enough to levy from the industrious for the support of the idle how much provision for the sick and the aged the widow and the orphan has been expended in the attempt to get wages which the manufacturer cannot afford them with any profitable chance of selling his commodity  i had a bad fall last night coming home there were unfinished houses at the east end of atholl place33 and as i was on foot i crossed the street to avoid the material which lay about but deceived by the moonlight i stepped ankledeep in a sea of mud honest earth and water thank god and fell on my hands never was there such a representative of wall in pyramus and thisbei was absolutely roughcast luckily lady s had retired when i came home so i enjoyed my tub of water without either remonstrance or condolences cockburns hospitality will get the benefit and renown of my downfall and yet has no claim to it in future though i must take a coach at nighta control on ones freedom but it must be submitted to i found a letter from r cadell giving a cheering account of things in london their correspondent is getting into his strength three days ago i would have been contented to buy this consola as judy says34 dearer than by a dozen falls in the mud for had the great constable fallen o my countrymen what a fall were there  sidenote nb within eight weeks after recording this graceful act of submission i found i was unable to keep a carriage at all  mrs coutts with the duke of st albans and lady charlotte beauclerk called to take leave of us when at abbotsford his suit throve but coldly she made me i believe her confidant in sincerity35 she had refused him twice and decidedly he was merely on the footing of friendship i urged it was akin to love she allowed she might marry the duke only she had at present not the least intention that way is this frank admission more favourable for the duke than an absolute protestation against the possibility of such a marriage i think not it is the fashion to attend mrs coutts parties and to abuse her i have always found her a kind friendly woman without either affectation or insolence in the display of her wealth and most willing to do good if the means be shown to her she can be very entertaining too as she speaks without scruple of her stage life so much wealth can hardly be enjoyed without some ostentation but what then if the duke marries her he ensures an immense fortune if she marries him she has the first rank if he marries a woman older than himself by twenty years she marries a man younger in wit by twenty degrees i do not think he will dilapidate her fortunehe seems quiet and gentle i do not think that she will abuse his softnessof disposition shall i say or of heart the disparity of ages concerns no one but themselves so they have my consent to marry if they can get each others just as this is written enter my lord of st albans and lady charlotte to beg i would recommend a book of sermons to mrs coutts much obliged for her good opinion recommended logans36one poet should always speak for another the mission i suppose was a little display on the part of good mrs coutts of authority over her high aristocratic suitor i do not suspect her of turning dévote and retract my consent given as above unless she remains lively brisk and jolly37  dined quiet with wife and daughter robert cadell looked in in the evening on business  i here register my purpose to practise economics i have little temptation to do otherwise abbotsford is all that i can make it and too large for the property so i resolve  no more building  no purchases of land till times are quite safe  no buying books or expensive triflesi mean to any extent and  clearing off encumbrances with the returns of this years labour  which resolutions with health and my habits of industry will make me sleep in spite of thunder  after all it is hard that the vagabond stockjobbing jews should for their own purposes make such a shake of credit as now exists in london and menace the credit of men trading on sure funds like hurst and robinson it is just like a set of pickpockets who raise a mob in which honest folks are knocked down and plundered that they may pillage safely in the midst of the confusion they have excited  sidenote i was obliged to give this up in consequence of my own

least i will not fail for want of application i have lent her £300 on a second and therefore doubtful security over her house in newington bought for £1000 and on which £600 is already secured i have no connection with the family except that of compassion and may not be rewarded even by thanks when the young man comes of age i have known my father often so treated by those whom he had laboured to serve but if we do not run some hazard in our attempts to do good where is the merit of them so i will bring through my orkney laird if i can dined at home quiet with lady s and anne  november 27some time since john murray entered into a contract with my soninlaw john g lockhart giving him on certain ample conditions the management and editorship of the quarterly review for which they could certainly scarcely find a fitter person both from talents and character it seems that barrow38 and one or two stagers have taken alarm at lockharts character as a satirist and his supposed accession to some of the freaks in blackwoods magazine and down comes young disraeli39 to scotland imploring lockhart to make interest with my friends in london to remove objections and so forth i have no idea of telling all and sundry that my soninlaw is not a slanderer or a silly thoughtless lad although he was six or seven years ago engaged in some light satires i only wrote to heber and to southeythe first upon the subject of the reports which had startled murray the most timorous as byron called him of all gods booksellers and such a letter as he may show barrow if he judges proper to southey i wrote more generally acquainting him of my sons appointment to the editorship and mentioning his qualifications touching at the same time on his very slight connection with blackwoods magazine and his innocence as to those gambades which may have given offence and which i fear they may ascribe too truly to an eccentric neighbour of their own i also mentioned that i had heard nothing of the affair until the month of october i am concerned that southey should know this for having been at the lakes in september i would not have him suppose that i had been using interest with canning or ellis to supersede young mr coleridge40 their editor and place my soninlaw in the situation indeed i was never more surprised than when this proposal came upon us i suppose it had come from canning originally as he was sounding anne when at colonel boltons41 about lockharts views etc to me he never hinted anything on the subject other views are held out to lockhart which may turn to great advantage only one person john cay42 of charlton knows their object and truly i wish it had not been confided to any one yesterday i had a letter from murray in answer to one i had written in something a determined style for i had no idea of permitting him to start from the course after my son giving up his situation and profession merely because a contributor or two chose to suppose gratuitously that lockhart was too imprudent for the situation my physic has wrought well for it brought a letter from murray saying all was right that disraeli was sent to me not to lockhart and that i was only invited to write two confidential letters and other incoherencieswhich intimate his fright has got into another quarter it is interlined and franked by barrow which shows that all is well and that johns induction into his office will be easy and pleasant i have not the least fear of his success his talents want only a worthy sphere of exertion he must learn however to despise petty adversaries no good sportsman ought to shoot at crows unless for some special purpose to take notice of such men as hazlitt and hunt in the quarterly would be to introduce them into a world which is scarce conscious of their existence it is odd enough that many years since i had the principal share in erecting this review which has been since so prosperous and now it is placed under the management of my soninlaw upon the most honourable principle of detur digniori yet there are sad drawbacks so far as family comfort is concerned today is sunday when they always dined with us and generally met a family friend or two but we are no longer to expect them in the country where their little cottage was within a mile or two of abbotsford we shall miss their society still more for chiefswood was the perpetual object of our walks rides and drives lockhart is such an excellent family man so fond of his wife and child that i hope all will go well a letter from lockhart in the evening all safe as to his unanimous reception in london his predecessor young coleridge handsomely and like a gentleman offers his assistance as a contributor etc  november 28i have the less dread or rather the less anxiety about the consequences of this migration that i repose much confidence in sophias tact and good sense her manners are good and have the appearance of being perfectly natural she is quite conscious of the limited range of her musical talents and never makes them common or produces them out of placea rare virtue moreover she is proud enough and will not be easily netted and patronised by any of that class of ladies who may be called lionproviders for town and country she is domestic besides and will not be disposed to gad about then she seems an economist and on £300043 living quietly there should be something to save lockhart must be liked where his good qualities are known and where his fund of information has room to be displayed but notwithstanding a handsome exterior and face i am not sure he will succeed in london society he sometimes reverses the proverb and gives the volte strette e pensiere sciolti withdraws his attention from the company or attaches himself to some individual gets into a corner and seems to be quizzing the rest this is the want of early habits of being in society and a life led much at college nothing is however so popular and so deservedly so as to take an interest in whatever is going forward in society a wise man always finds his account in it and will receive information and fresh views of life even in the society of fools abstain from society altogether when you are not able to play some part in it this reserve and a sort of hidalgo air joined to his character as a satirist have done the besthumoured fellow in the world some injury in the opinion of edinburgh folks in london it is of less consequence whether he please in general society or not since if he can establish himself as a genius it will only be called pretty fannys way  people make me the oddest requests it is not unusual for an oxonian or cantab who has outrun his allowance and of whom i know nothing to apply to me for the loan of £20 £50 or £100 a captain of the danish naval service writes to me that being in distress for a sum of money by which he might transport himself to columbia to offer his services in assisting to free that province he had dreamed i generously made him a present of it i can tell him his dream by contraries i begin to find like joseph surface that too good a character is inconvenient i dont know what i have done to gain so much credit for generosity but i suspect i owe it to being supposed as puff44 says one of those whom heaven has blessed with affluence not too much of that neither my dear petitioners though i may thank myself that your ideas are not correct  dined at melville castle whither i went through a snowstorm i was glad to find myself once more in a place connected with many happy days met sir r dundas and my old friend george now lord abercromby45 with his lady and a beautiful girl his daughter he is what he always wasthe besthumoured man living and our meetings now more rare than usual are seasoned with a recollection of old frolics and old friends i am entertained to see him just the same he has always been never yielding up his own opinion in fact and yet in words acquiescing in all that could be said against it george was always like a willowhe never offered resistance to the breath of argument but never moved from his rooted opinion blow as it listed exaggeration might make these peculiarities highly dramatic conceive a man who always seems to be acquiescing in your sentiments yet never changes his own and this with a sort of bonhomie which shows there is not a particle of deceit intended he is only desirous to spare you the trouble of contradiction  november 29a letter from southey malcontent about murray having accomplished the change in the quarterly without speaking to him and quoting the twaddle of some old woman male or female about lockharts earlier jeux desprit but concluding most kindly that in regard to my daughter and me he did not mean to withdraw that he has done yeomans service to the review is certain with his genius his universal reading his powers of regular industry and at the outset a name which though less generally popular than it deserves is still too respectable to be withdrawn without injury i could not in reply point out to him what is the truth that his rigid toryism and high church prejudices rendered him an unsafe counsellor in a matter where the spirit of the age must be consulted but i pointed out to him what i am sure is true that murray apprehensive of his displeasure had not ventured to write to him out of mere timidity and not from any intention to offend i treated lightly his old womans apprehensions and cautions and all that gossip about friends and enemies to which a splendid number or two will be a sufficient answer and i accepted with due acknowledgment his proposal of continued support i cannot say i was afraid of his withdrawing lockhart will have hard words with him for great as southeys powers are he has not the art to make them work popularly he is often diffuse and frequently sets much value on minute and unimportant facts and useless pieces of abstruse knowledge living too exclusively in a circle where he is idolised both for his genius and the excellence of his disposition he has acquired strong prejudices though all of an upright and honourable cast he rides his high church hobby too hard and it will not do to run a tilt upon it against all the world gifford used to crop his articles considerably and they bear mark of it being sometimes décousues southey said that gifford cut out his middle joints when john comes to use the carvingknife i fear dr southey will not be so tractable nous verrons i will not show southeys letter to lockhart for there is to him personally no friendly tone and it would startle the hidalgos pride it is to be wished they may draw kindly together southey says most truly that even those who most undervalue his reputation would were he to withdraw from the review exaggerate the loss it would thereby sustain the bottom of all these feuds though not named is blackwoods magazine all the squibs of which which have sometimes exploded among the lakers lockhart is rendered accountable for he must now exert himself at once with spirit and prudence46 he has good backingcanning bishop blomfield gifford wright croker will roseand is there not besides the douglas47 an excellent plot excellent friends and full of preparations it was no plot of my making i am sure yet men will say and believe that it was though i never heard a word of the matter till first a hint from wright and then the formal proposal of murray to lockhart announced i believe canning and charles ellis were the prime movers ill puzzle my brains no more about it  dined at

november 30i am come to the time when those who look out of the windows shall be darkened i must now wear spectacles constantly in reading and writing though till this winter i have made a shift by using only their occasional assistance although my health cannot be better i feel my lameness becomes sometimes painful and often inconvenient walking on the pavement or causeway gives me trouble and i am glad when i have accomplished my return on foot from the parliament house to castle street though i can taking a competent time as old braxie48 said on another occasion walk five or six miles in the country with pleasure wellsuch things must come and be received with cheerful submission my early lameness considered it was impossible for a man labouring under a bodily impediment to have been stronger or more active than i have been and that for twenty or thirty years seams will slit and elbows will out quoth the tailor and as i was fiftyfour on 15th august last my mortal vestments are none of the newest then walter charles and lockhart are as active and handsome young fellows as you can see and while they enjoy strength and activity i can hardly be said to want it i have perhaps all my life set an undue value on these gifts yet it does appear to me that high and independent feelings are naturally though not uniformly or inseparably connected with bodily advantages strong men are usually goodhumoured and active men often display the same elasticity of mind as of body these are superiorities however that are often misused but even for these things god shall call us to judgment  some months since i joined with other literary folks in subscribing a petition for a pension to mrs g of l49 which we thought was a tribute merited by her works as an authoress and in my opinion much more by the firmness and elasticity of mind with which she had borne a succession of great domestic calamities unhappily there was only about £100 open on the pension list and this the minister assigned in equal portions to mrs g and a distressed lady granddaughter of a forfeited scottish nobleman mrs g proud as a highlandwoman vain as a poetess and absurd as a bluestocking has taken this partition in malam partem and written to lord melville about her merits and that her friends do not consider her claims as being fairly canvassed with something like a demand that her petition be submitted to the king this is not the way to make her plack a bawbee and lord m a little miffed in turn sends the whole correspondence to me to know whether mrs gwill accept the £50 or not now hating to deal with ladies when they are in an unreasonable humour i have got the goodhumoured man of feeling to find out the ladys mind and i take on myself the task of making her peace with lord

he had passed the early part of his life with a set of clever rattling drinking fellows whose thoughts and talents lay wholly out of the region of poetry thirty years after having met lewis in edinburgh for the first time in 1798 he said to allan cunningham that he thought he had never felt such elation as when the monk invited him to dine with him at his hotel lewis died in 1818 and scott says of him he did much good by stealth and was a most generous creaturefonder of great people than he ought to have been either as a man of talent or as a man of fashion he had always ladies and duchesses in his mouth and was pathetically fond of any one that had a title mat had queerish eyesthey projected like those of some insects and were flattish on the orbit  12 moores friends seem to

afterwards majorgeneral sir james russell gcb he died at ashestiel in 1859 in his 78th year     december   december 1stcolonel russell told me that the european government had discovered an ingenious mode of diminishing the number of burnings of widows it seems the shaster positively enjoins that the pile shall be so constructed that if the victim should repent even at the moment when it is set on fire she may still have the means of saving herself the brahmins soon found it was necessary to assist the resolution of the sufferers by means of a little pit into which they contrive to let the poor widow sink so as to prevent her reaping any benefit from a late repentance but the government has brought them back to the regard of their law and only permit the burning to go on when the pile is constructed with full opportunity of a locus penitentiæ yet the widow is so degraded if she dare to survive that the number of burnings is still great the quantity of female children destroyed by the rajput tribes colonel r describes as very great indeed they are strangled by the mother the principle is the aristocratic pride of these high castes who breed up no more daughters than they can reasonably hope to find matches for in their own tribe singular how artificial systems of feeling can be made to overcome that love of offspring which seems instinctive in the females not of the human race only but of the lower animals this is the reverse of our system of increasing game by shooting the old cockbirds it is a system would aid malthus rarely  nota bene the day before yesterday i signed the bond for £5000 with constable for relief of robinsons house52 i am to be secured by good bills  i think this journal will suit me well if i can coax myself into an idea that it is purely voluntary it may go onnulla dies sine lineâ but never a being from my infancy upwards hated taskwork as i hate it and yet i have done a great deal in my day it is not that i am idle in my nature neither but propose to me to do one thing and it is inconceivable the desire i have to do something elsenot that it is more easy or more pleasant but just because it is escaping from an imposed task i cannot trace this love of contradiction to any distinct source but it has haunted me all my life i could almost suppose it was mechanical and that the imposition of a piece of dutylabour operated on me like the mace of a bad billiardplayer which gives an impulse to the ball indeed but sends it off at a tangent different from the course designed by the player now if i expend such eccentric movements on this journal it will be turning this wretched propensity to some tolerable account if i had thus employed the hours and halfhours which i have whiled away in putting off something that must needs be done at last my conscience i should have had a journal with a witness sophia and lockhart came to edinburgh today and dined with us meeting hector macdonald buchanan his lady and missie james skene and his lady lockharts friend cay etc they are lucky to be able to assemble so many real friends whose good wishes i am sure will follow them in their new undertaking  december 2rather a

indifferent health from two till three transacting business with jb all seems to go smoothly sophia dined with us alone lockhart being gone to the west to bid farewell to his father and brothers evening spent in talking with sophia on their future prospects god bless her poor girl she never gave me a moments reason to complain of her but o my god that poor delicate child so clever so animated yet holding by this earth with so fearfully slight a tenure never out of his mothers thoughts almost never out of his fathers arms when he has but a single moment to give to anything deus providebit  december 3rpg53 came to call last night to excuse himself from dining with lockharts friends today i really fear he is near an actual standstill he has been extremely improvident when i first knew him he had an excellent estate and now he is deprived i fear of the whole reversion of the price and this from no vice or extreme except a wasteful mode of buying pictures and other costly trifles at high prices and selling them again for nothing besides an extravagant housekeeping and profuse hospitality an excellent disposition with a considerable fund of acquired knowledge would have rendered him an agreeable companion had he not affected singularity and rendered himself accordingly singularly affected he was very near being a poetbut a miss is as good as a mile and he always fell short of the mark i knew him first many years ago when he was desirous of my acquaintance but he was too poetical for me or i was not poetical enough for him so that we continued only ordinary acquaintance with goodwill on either side which rpg really deserves as a more friendly generous creature never lived lockhart hopes to get something done for him being sincerely attached to him but says he has no hopes till he is utterly ruined that point i fear is not far distant but what lockhart can do for him then i cannot guess his last effort failed owing to a curious reason he had made some translations from the german which he does extremely wellfor give him ideas and he never wants choice of good wordsand lockhart had got constable to offer some sort of terms for them rpg has always though possessing a beautiful power of handwriting had some whim or other about imitating that of some other person and has written for months in the imitation of one or other of his friends at present he has renounced this amusement and chooses to write with a brush upon large cartridge paper somewhat in the chinese fashionso when his work which was only to extend to one or two volumes arrived on the shoulders of two porters in immense bales our jolly bibliopolist backed out of the treaty and would have nothing more to do with rp54 he is a creature that is or would be thought of imagination all compact and is influenced by strange whims but he is a kind harmless friendly soul and i fear has been cruelly plundered of money which he now wants sadly  dined with lockharts friends about fifty in number who gave him a parting entertainment john hope solicitorgeneral in the chair and robert dundas of arniston croupier the company most highly respectable and any man might be proud of such an indication of the interest they take in his progress in life tory principles rather too violently upheld by some speakers i came home about ten the party sat late  december 4lockhart and sophia with his brother william dined with us and talked over our separation and the mode of their settling in london and other family topics  december 5this morning lockhart and sophia left us early and without leavetaking when i rose at eight oclock they were gone this was very right i hate red eyes and blowing of noses agere et pati romanum est of all schools commend me to the stoics we cannot indeed overcome our affections nor ought we if we could but we may repress them within due bounds and avoid coaxing them to make fools of those who should be their masters i have lost some of the comforts to which i chiefly looked for enjoyment well i must make the more of such as remaingod bless them and so i will unto my holy work again55 which at present is the description of that heilige kleeblatt that worshipful triumvirate danton robespierre and marat  i cannot conceive what possesses me over every person besides to mislay papers i received a letter saturday at een enclosing a bill for £750 no deaf nuts well i read it and note the contents and this day as if it had been a windbill in the literal sense of the words i search everywhere and lose three hours of my morningturn over all my confusion in the writingdeskbreak open one or two letters lest i should have enclosed the sweet and quickly convertible document in themsend for a joiner and disorganise my scrutoire lest it should have fallen aside by mistake i find it at lastthe place where is of little consequence but this trick must be amended  dined at the royal society club where as usual was a pleasant meeting of from twenty to twentyfive it is a very good institution we pay two guineas only for six dinners in the year present or absent dine at five or rather halfpast five at the royal hotel where we have an excellent dinner with soups fish etc and all in good order port and sherry till halfpast seven then coffee and we go to the society this has great influence in keeping up the attendance it being found that this preface of a good

life of the company with anecdote and fun sometimes his daughter tells me he is in low spirits at home but really i never see anything of it in society  there is a maxim almost universal in scotland

at fiveandtwenty instead of eighteen with a turn for expense perhapsalmost certainly for profligacy and with a heart embittered against the loving parents or friends who compelled them to lose six or seven years in dusting the rails of the stair with their black gowns or scribbling nonsense for twopence a page all day and laying out twice their earnings at night in whiskypunch here is rl now four or five years ago from certain indications i assured his friends he would never be a writer goodnatured lad too when bacchus is out of the question but at other times so pugnacious that it was wished he could only be properly placed where fighting was to be a part of his duty regulated by time and place and paid for accordingly well time money and instruction have been thrown away and now after fighting two regular boxing matches and a duel with pistols in the course of one week he tells them roundly he will be no writer which commonsense might have told them before he has now perhaps acquired habits of insubordination unfitting him for the army where he might have been tamed at an earlier period he is too old for the navy and so he must go to india a guineapig on board a chinaman with what hope or view it is melancholy to guess his elder brother did all man could to get his friends to consent to his going into the army in time the lad has goodhumour courage and most gentlemanlike feelings but he is incurably dissipated i hear so goes to die in youth in a foreign land thank god i let walter take his own way and i trust he will be a useful honoured soldier being for his time high in the service whereas at home he would probably have been a winebibbing moorfowlshooting foxhunting fife squireliving at lochore without either aim or endand well if he were no worse dined at home with lady s and anne wrote in the evening  december 7teind day58at home of course wrote answers to one or two letters which have been lying on my desk like snakes hissing at me for my dilatoriness bespoke a tun of palmoil for sir john forbes received a letter from sir w knighton mentioning that the king acquiesced in my proposal that constables miscellany should be dedicated to him enjoined however not to make this public till the draft of dedication shall be approved this letter tarried so long i thought some one had insinuated the proposal was infra dig i dont think so the purpose is to bring all the standard works both in sciences and the liberal arts within the reach of the lower classes and enable them thus to use with advantage the education which is given them at every hand to make boys learn to read and then place no good books within their reach is to give men an appetite and leave nothing in the pantry save unwholesome and poisonous food which depend upon it they will eat rather than starve sir william it seems has been in germany  mighty dark this morning it is past ten and i am using my lamp the vast number of houses built beneath us to the north certainly render our street darker during the days when frost or haze prevents the smoke from rising after all it may be my older eyes i remember two years ago when lord h began to fail somewhat in his limbs he observed that lord s59 came to court at a more early hour than usual whereas it was he himself who took longer time to walk the usual distance betwixt his house and the parliament square i suspect old gentlemen often make such mistakes a letter from southey in a very pleasant strain as to lockhart and myself of murray he has perhaps ground to complain as well for consulting him late in the business as for the manner in which he intimated to young coleridge who had no reason to think himself handsomely treated though he has acquiesced in the arrangement in a very gentlemanlike tone with these matters we of course have nothing to do having no doubt that the situation was vacant when m offered it as such southey says in alteration of byrons phrase that m is the most timorous not of gods but of the devils booksellers the truth i take to be that murray was pushed in the change of editor which was really become necessary probably by gifford canning ellis etc and when he had fixed with lockhart by their advice his constitutional nervousness made him delay entering upon a full explanation with coleridge but it is all settled nowi hope lockhart will be able to mitigate their high church bigotry it is not for the present day savouring too much of jure divino  dined quiet with lady s and anne anne is practising scots songs which i take as a kind compliment to my own taste as hers leads her chiefly to foreign music i think the good girl sees that i want and must miss her sisters peculiar talent in singing the airs of our native country which imperfect as my musical ear is make and always have made the most pleasing impression on me and so if she puts a constraint on herself for my sake i can only say in requital god bless her  i have much to comfort me in the present aspect of my family my eldest son independent in fortune united to an affectionate wifeand of good hopes in his profession my second with a good deal of talent and in the way i trust of cultivating it to good purpose anne an honest downright good scots lass in whom i would only wish to correct a spirit of satire and lockhart is lockhart to whom i can most willingly confide the happiness of the daughter who chose him and whom he has chosen my dear wife the partner of early cares and successes is i fear frail in healththough i trust and pray she may see me out indeed if this troublesome complaint goes onit bodes no long existence my brother was affected with the same weakness which before he was fifty brought on mortal symptoms the poor major had been rather a free liver but my father the most abstemious of men save when the duties of hospitality required him to be very moderately free with his bottle and that was very seldom had the same weakness which now annoys me and he i think was not above seventy when cut off square the odds and goodnight sir walter about sixty i care not if i leave my name unstained and my family properly settled sat est vixisse  december 8talking of the vixisse it may not be impertinent to notice that knox a young poet of considerable talent died here a week or two since his father was a respectable yeoman and he himself succeeding to good farms under the duke of buccleuch became too soon his own master and plunged into dissipation and ruin his poetical talent a very fine one then showed itself in a fine strain of pensive poetry called i think the lonely hearth far superior to those of michael bruce whose consumption by the way has been the life of his verses but poetry nay good poetry is a drug in the present day i am a wretched patron i cannot go with a subscriptionpaper like a pocketpistol about me and draw unawares on some honest countrygentleman who has as much alarm as if i had used the phrase stand and deliver and parts with his money with a grimace indicating some suspicion that the crownpiece thus levied goes ultimately into the collectors own pocket this i see daily done and i have seen such collectors when they have exhausted papa and mamma continue their trade among the misses and conjure out of their pockets those little funds which should carry them to a play or an assembly it is well people will go through thisit does some good i suppose and they have great merit who can sacrifice their pride so far as to attempt it in this way for my part i am a bad promoter of subscriptions but i wished to do what i could for this lad whose talent i really admired and i am not addicted to admire heavenborn poets or poetry that is reckoned very good considering i had him knox60 at abbotsford about ten years ago but found him unfit for that sort of society i tried to help him but there were temptations he could never resist he scrambled on writing for the booksellers and magazines and living like the otways and savages and chattertons of former days though i do not know that he was in actual want his connection with me terminated in begging a subscription or a guinea now and then his last works were spiritual hymns and which he wrote very well in his own line of society he was said to exhibit infinite humour but all his works are grave and pensive a style perhaps like master stephens melancholy61 affected for the nonce  mrs grant of l intimates that she will take her puddingher pension i mean see 30th november and is contrite as henry mackenzie vouches i am glad the stout old girl is not foreclosed faith cabbing a pension in these times is like hunting a pig with a soapd tail monstrous apt to slip through your fingers62 dined at home with lady s and anne  december 9yesterday i read and wrote the whole day and evening today i shall not be so happy having gaslight company to attend at two i must be brief in journalising  the gay world has been kept in hot water lately by the impudent publication of the celebrated harriet wilson  from earliest possibility i suppose who lived with half the gay world at hack and manger and now obliges such as will not pay hushmoney with a history of whatever she knows or can invent about them she must have been assisted in the style spelling and diction though the attempt at wit is very poor that at pathos sickening but there is some good retailing of conversations in which the style of the speakers so far as known to me is exactly imitated and some things told as said by individuals of each other which will sound unpleasantly in each others ears i admire the address of lord ay himself very severely handled from time to time some one asked him if hw had been pretty correct on the whole why faith he replied i believe sowhen raising his eyes he saw quentin dick whom the little jilt had treated atrociouslywhat concerns the present company always excepted you know added lord ay with infinite presence of mind as he was in pari casu with qd no more could be said after all hw beats con philips anne bellamy and all former demireps out and out i think i supped once in her company more than twenty years since at mat lewiss in argyle street where the company as the duke says to lucio chanced to be fairer than honest63 she was far from beautiful if it be the same chiffonne but a smart saucy girl with good eyes and dark hair and the manners of a wild schoolboy i am glad this accidental meeting has escaped her memoryor perhaps is not accurately recorded in minefor being a sort of french falconer who hawk at all they see i might have had a distinction which i am far from desiring  dined at sir john haysa large party skenes there the newenhams and others strangers in the morning a meeting of oil gas committee the concern lingers a little      it may do weel for ought its done yet     but onlyits no just begun yet64  december 10a stormy and rainy day walked from the court through the rain i dont dislike this egad i rather like it for no man that ever stepped on heather has less dread than i of catchcold and i seem to regain in buffeting with the wind a little of the high spirit with which in younger days i used to enjoy a tamoshanter ride through darkness wind and rainthe boughs groaning and cracking over my head the good horse free to the road and impatient for home and feeling the weather as little as i did      the storm around might roar and rustle     we didna mind the storm a whistle  answered two lettersone answer to a schoolboy who writes himself captain of giggleswick school a most imposing title entreating the youngster not to commence editor of a magazine to be entitled the yorkshire muffin i think at seventeen years old second to a soldier of the 79th showing why i cannot oblige him by getting his discharge and exhorting him rather to bear with the wickedness and profanity of the service than take the very precarious step of desertion this is the old receipt of durandartepatience cousin and shuffle the cards65 and i suppose the correspondents will think i have been too busy in offering my counsel where i was asked for assistance  a third rogue writes to tell merather of the latest if the matter was of consequencethat he approves of the first three volumes of the heart of midlothian but totally condemns the fourth doubtless he thinks his opinion worth the sevenpence sterling which his letter costs however authors should be reasonably well pleased when threefourths of their work are acceptable to the reader the knave demands of me in a postscript to get back the sword of sir william wallace from england where it was carried from dumbarton castle i am not mastergeneral of the ordnance that i know it was wrong however to take away that and mons meg if i go to town this spring i will renew my negotiation with the great duke for recovery of mons meg  there is no theme more awful than to attempt to cast a glance among the clouds and mists which hide the broken extremity of the celebrated bridge of mirza66 yet when every day brings us nearer that termination one would almost think that our views should become clearer as the regions we are approaching are brought nigher alas it is not so there is a curtain to be withdrawn a veil to be rent before we shall see things as they really are there are few i trust who disbelieve the existence of a god nay i doubt if at all times and in all moods any single individual ever adopted that hideous creed though some have professed it with the belief of a deity that of the immortality of the soul and of the state of future rewards and punishments is indissolubly linked more we are not to know but neither are we prohibited from our attempts however vain to pierce the solemn sacred gloom the expressions used in scripture are doubtless metaphorical for penal fires and heavenly melody are only applicable to bodies endowed with senses and at least till the period of the resurrection of the body the spirits of men whether entering into the perfection of the just or committed to the regions of punishment are incorporeal neither is it to be supposed that the glorified bodies which shall arise in the last day will be capable of the same gross indulgences with which they are now solaced that the idea of mahomets paradise is inconsistent with the purity of our heavenly religion will be readily granted and see mark xii 25 harmony is obviously chosen as the least corporeal of all gratifications of the sense and as the type of love unity and a state of peace and perfect happiness but they have a poor idea of the deity and the rewards which are destined for the just made perfect who can only adopt the literal sense of an eternal concerta neverending birthday ode i rather suppose there should be understood some commission from the highest some duty to discharge with the applause of a satisfied conscience that the deity who himself must be supposed to feel love and affection for the beings he has called into existence should delegate a portion of those powers i for one cannot conceive altogether so wrong a conjecture we would then find reality in miltons sublime machinery of the guardian saints or genii of kingdoms nay we would approach to the catholic idea of the employment of saints though without approaching the absurdity of saintworship which degrades their religion there would be we must suppose in these employments difficulties to be overcome and exertions to be made for all which the celestial beings employed would have certain appropriate powers i cannot help thinking that a life of active benevolence is more consistent with my ideas than an eternity of music but it is all speculation and it is impossible even to guess what we shall do unless we could ascertain the equally difficult previous question what we are to be but there is a god and a just goda judgment and a future lifeand all who own so much let them act according to the faith that is in them i would not of course limit the range of my genii to this confined earth there is the universe with all its endless extent of worlds  company at homesir adam ferguson and his lady colonel and miss russell count davidoff and mr collyer by the by i observe that all men whose names are obviously derived from some mechanical trade endeavour to disguise and antiquate as it were their names by spelling them after some quaint manner or other thus we have collyer smythe tailleure as much as to say my ancestor was indeed a mechanic but it was a world of time ago when the word was spelled very differently then we had young whytbank and will allan the artist67 a very agreeable simplemannered and pleasant man  december 11a touch of the morbus eruditorum to which i am as little subject as most folks and have it less now than when young it is a tremor of the heart the pulsation of which becomes painfully sensiblea disposition to causeless alarmmuch lassitudeand decay of vigour of mind and activity of intellect the reins feel weary and painful and the mind is apt to receive and encourage gloomy apprehensions and causeless fears fighting with this fiend is not always the best way to conquer him i have always found exercise and the open air better than reasoning but such weather as is now without doors does not encourage la petite guerre so we must give him battle in form by letting both mind and body know that supposing one the house of commons and the other the house of peers my will is sovereign over both there is a good description of this species of mental weakness in the fine play of beaumont and fletcher called the lovers progress where the man warned that his death is approaching works himself into an agony of fear and calls for assistance though there is no apparent danger the apparition of the innkeepers ghost in the same play hovers between the ludicrous and the terrible to me the touches of the former quality which it contains seem to augment the effect of the latter they seem to give reality to the supernatural as being circumstances with which an inventor would hardly have garnished his story68  will clerk says he has a theory on the vitrified forts i wonder if he and i agree i think accidental conflagration is the cause  december 12hogg came to breakfast this morning having taken and brought for his companion the galashiels bard david thomson69 as to a meeting of huzz tividale poets the honest grunter opines with a delightful naïveté that moores verses are far owre sweetanswered by thomson that moores ear or notes i forget which were finely strung they are far owre finely strung replied he of the forest for mine are just reeght it reminded me of queen bess when questioning melville sharply and closely whether queen mary was taller than her and extracting an answer in the affirmative she replied then your queen is too tall for i am just the proper height  was engaged the whole day with sheriff court processes there is something sickening in seeing poor devils drawn into great expense about trifles by interested attorneys but too cheap access to litigation has its evils on the other hand for the proneness of the lower class to gratify spite and revenge in this way would be a dreadful evil were they able to endure the expense very few cases come before the sheriffcourt of selkirkshire that ought to come anywhere wretched wranglings about a few pounds begun in spleen and carried on from obstinacy and at length from fear of the conclusion to the banquet of illhumour dnn of expenses70 i try to check it as well as i can but so twill be when i am gone  december 12dined at home and spent the evening in writinganne and lady scott at the theatre to see mathews a very clever man my friend mathews but it is tiresome to be funny for a whole evening so i was content and stupid at home  an odd optical delusion has amused me these two last nights i have been of late for the first time condemned to the constant use of spectacles now when i have laid them aside to step into a room dimly lighted out of the strong light which i use for writing i have seen or seemed to see through the rims of the same spectacles which i have left behind me at first the impression was so lively that i put my hand to my eyes believing i had the actual spectacles on at the moment but what i saw was only the eidolon or image of said useful servants this fortifies some of dr hibberts positions about spectral appearances  december 13letter from lady staffordkind and friendly after the wont of banzumohrarchat71 this is wrong spelled i know her countenance is something for sophia whose company should beas ladies are said to choose their liquorlittle and good to be acquainted with persons of mere ton is a nuisance and a scrapeto be known to persons of real fashion and fortune is in london a very great advantage she is besides sure of the hereditary and constant friendship of the buccleuch ladies as well as those of montagu and of the harden family of the marchioness of northampton lady melville and others also the miss ardens upon whose kind offices i have some claim and would count upon them whether such claim existed or no so she is well enough established among the righthand file which is very necessary in london where secondrate fashion is like false jewels  went to the yearly court of the edinburgh assurance company to which i am one of those graceful and useless appendages called directors extraordinaryan extraordinary director i should prove had they elected me an ordinary one there were there moneyers and great oneyers72 men of metaldiscounters and counterssharp grave prudential faceseyes weak with ciphering by lamplightmen who say to gold be thou paper and to paper be thou turned into fine gold many a bustling sharpfaced keeneyed writer toosome perhaps speculating with their clients property my reverend seigniors had expected a motion for printing their contract which i as a piece of light artillery was brought down and got into battery to oppose i should certainly have done this on the general ground that while each partner could at any time obtain sight of the contract at a call on the directors or managers it would be absurd to print it for the use of the companyand that exposing it to the world at large was in all respects unnecessary and might teach novel companies to avail themselves of our rules and calculationsif false for the purpose of exposing our errorsif correct for the purpose of improving their own schemes on our model but my eloquence was not required no one renewing the motion under question so off i came my ears still ringing with the sounds of thousands and tens of thousands and my eyes dazzled with the golden gleam offered by so many capitalists  walked home with the solicitor73decidedly the most hopeful young man of his time high connection great talent spirited ambition a ready and prompt elocution with a good voice and dignified manner prompt and steady courage vigilant and constant assiduity popularity with the young men and the good opinion of the old will if i mistake not carry him as high as any man who has been since the days of old hal dundas74 he is hot though and rather hasty this should be amended they who would play at singlestick must bear with patience a rap over the knuckles dined quietly with lady scott and anne  december 14affairs very bad in the moneymarket in london it must come here and i have far too many engagements not to feel it to end the matter at once i intend to borrow £10000 with which my sons marriagecontract allows me to charge my estate at whitsunday and martinmas i will have enough to pay up the incumbrance of £3000 due to old mosss daughter and £5000 to misses ferguson in whole or part this will enable us to dispense in a great measure with bank assistance and sleep in spite of thunder i do not know whether it is this business which makes me a little bilious or rather the want of exercise during the season of late and change of the weather to too much heat thank god my circumstances are goodupon a fair balance which i have made certainly not less than £40000 or nearly £50000 above the world but the sun and moon shall dance on the green ere carelessness or hope of gain or facility of getting cash shall make me go too deep again were it but for the disquiet of the thing dined lady scott and anne quietly  december 15rp gillies came sicut mos est at five oclock to make me confidant of the extremities of his distress it is clear all he has to do is to make the best agreement he can with his creditors i remember many years since the poor fellow told me he thought there was something interesting in having difficulties poor lad he will have enough of them now he talks about writing translations for the booksellers from the german to the amount of five or six hundred pounds but this is like a man proposing to run a whole day at top speed yet if he had good subjects rpg is one of the best translators i know and something must be done for him certainly though i fear it will be necessary to go to the bottom of the ulcer palliatives wont do he is terribly imprudent yet a worthy and benevolent creaturea great bore withal dined alone with family i am determined not to stand mine host to all scotland and england as i have done this shall be a saving since it must be a borrowing year we heard from sophia they are got safe to town but as johnnie had a little bag of meal with him to make his porridge on the road the whole innyard assembled to see the operation junor his maid was of opinion that england was an awfu country to make parritch in god bless the poor baby and restore his perfect health  december 16rpg and his friend robert wilson75 camethe former at five as usualthe latter at three as appointed robert wilson frankly said that rpgs case was quite desperate that he was insolvent and that any attempt to save him at present would be just so much cash thrown away god knows at this moment i have none to throw away uselessly for poor gillies there was a melancholy mixture of pathos and affectation in his statement which really affected me while it told me that it would be useless to help him to money on such very empty plans i endeavoured to persuade him to make a virtue of necessity resign all to his creditors and begin the world on a new leaf i offered him chiefswood for a temporary retirement lady scott thinks i was wrong and nobody could less desire such a neighbour all his affectations being caviare to me but then the wife and children went again to the solicitor on a wrong night being asked for tomorrow lady scott undertakes to keep my engagements recorded in future sed quis custodiet ipsam custodem  december 17dined with the solicitorlord chiefbaron76sir william boothby nephew of old sir brooke the dandy poet etc annoyed with anxious presentiments which the nights post must dispel or confirmall in london as bad as possible  december 18ballantyne called on me this morning venit illa suprema dies my extremity is come cadell has received letters from london which all but positively announce the failure of hurst and robinson so that constable  co must follow and i must go with poor james ballantyne for company i suppose it will involve my all but if they leave me £500 i can still make it £1000 or £1200 a year and if they take my salaries of £1300 and £300 they cannot but give me something out of them i have been rash in anticipating funds to buy land but then i made from £5000 to £10000 a year and land was my temptation i think nobody can lose a pennythat is one comfort men will think pride has had a fall let them indulge their own pride in thinking that my fall makes them higher or seems so at least i have the satisfaction to recollect that my prosperity has been of advantage to many and that some at least will forgive my transient wealth on account of the innocence of my intentions and my real wish to do good to the poor this news will make sad hearts at darnick and in the cottages of abbotsford which i do not nourish the least hope of preserving it has been my delilah and so i have often termed it and now the recollection of the extensive woods i planted and the walks i have formed from which strangers must derive both the pleasure and profit will excite feelings likely to sober my gayest moments i have half resolved never to see the place again how could i tread my hall with such a diminished crest how live a poor indebted man where i was once the wealthy the honoured my children are provided thank god for that i was to have gone there on saturday in joy and prosperity to receive my friends my dogs will wait for me in vain it is foolishbut the thoughts of parting from these dumb creatures have moved me more than any of the painful reflections i have put down poor things i must get them kind masters there may be yet those who loving me may love my dog because it has been mine i must end this or i shall lose the tone of mind with which men should meet distress                                       i find my dogs feet on my knees i hear them whining and seeking me everywherethis is nonsense but it is what they would do could they know how things are poor will laidlaw poor tom purdie this will be news to wring your heart and many a poor fellows besides to whom my prosperity was daily bread  ballantyne behaves like himself and sinks his own ruin in contemplating mine i tried to enrich him indeed and now allall is gone he will have the journal still that is a comfort for sure they cannot find a better editor theyalas who will they bethe unbekannten obern who are to dispose of my all as they will some hardeyed banker some of those men of millions whom i described cadell showed more kind and personal feeling to me than i thought he had possessed he says there are some properties of works that will revert to me the copymoney not being paid but it cannot be any very great matter i should think  another person did not afford me all the sympathy i expected perhaps because i seemed to need little support yet that is not her nature which is generous and kind she thinks i have been imprudent trusting men so far perhaps sobut what could i do i must sell my books to some one and these folks gave me the largest price if they had kept their ground i could have brought myself round fast enough by the plan of 14th december i now view matters at the very worst and suppose that my all must go to supply the deficiencies of constable i fear it must be so his connections with hurst and robinson have been so intimate that they must be largely involved this is the worst of the concern our own is comparatively plain sailing  poor gillies called yesterday to tell me he was in extremity god knows i had every cause to have returned him the same answer i must think his situation worse than mine as through his incoherent miserable tale i could see that he had exhausted each access to credit and yet fondly imagines that bereft of all his accustomed indulgences he can work with a literary zeal unknown to his happier days i hope he may labour enough to gain the mere support of his family for myself the magic wand of the unknown is shivered in his grasp he must henceforth be termed the toowellknown the feast of fancy is over with the feeling of independence i can no longer have the delight of waking in the morning with bright ideas in my mind haste to commit them to paper and count them monthly as the means of planting such groves and purchasing such wastes replacing my dreams of fiction by other prospective visions of walks by      fountain heads and pathless groves     places which pale passion loves77  sidenote footnote to page 44 in the original msturn back to page 41 and 42 i turned the page accidentally and the partner of a bankrupt concern ought not to waste two leaves of paper  this cannot be but i may work substantial husbandry work history and such concerns they will not be received with the same enthusiasm at least i much doubt the general knowledge that an author must write for his bread at least for improving his pittance degrades him and his productions in the public eye he falls into the secondrate rank of estimation      while the harness sore galls and the spurs his sides goad     the highmettled racers a hack on the road78  it is a bitter thought but if tears start at it let them flow i am so much of this mind that if any one would now offer to relieve all my embarrassments on condition i would continue the exertions which brought it there dear as the place is to me i hardly think i could undertake the labour on which i entered with my usual alacrity only this morning though not without a boding feeling of my exertions proving useless yet to save abbotsford i would attempt all that was possible my heart clings to the place i have created there is scarce a tree on it that does not owe its being to me and the pain of leaving it is greater than i can tell i have about £10000 of constables for which i am bound to give literary value but if i am obliged to pay other debts for him i will take leave to retain this sum at his credit we shall have made some kittle questions of literary property amongst us once more patience cousin and shuffle the cards  i have endeavoured at times to give vent to thoughts naturally so painful by writing these notices partly to keep them at bay by busying myself with the history of the french convention i thank god i can do both with reasonable composure i wonder how anne will bear this affliction she is passionate but stouthearted and courageous in important matters though irritable in trifles i am glad lockhart and his wife are gone why i cannot tell but i am pleased to be left to my own regrets without being melted by condolences though of the most sincere and affectionate kind                                       anne bears her misfortune gallantly and well with a natural feeling no doubt of the rank and consideration she is about to lose lady scott is incredulous and persists in cherishing hope where there is no ground for hope i wish it may not bring on the gloom of spirits which has given me such distress if she were the active person she once was that would not be now i fear it more than what constable or cadell will tell me this evening so that my mind is made up  oddly enough it happened mine honest friend hector came in before dinner to ask a copy of my seal of arms with a sly kindliness of intimation that it was for some agreeable purpose  halfpast eighti closed this book under the consciousness of impending ruin i open it an hour after thanks be to god with the strong hope that matters may be got over safely and honourably in a mercantile sense cadell came at eight to communicate a letter from hurst and robinson intimating they had stood the storm and though clamorous for assistance from scotland saying they had prepared their strongholds without need of the banks  sidenote this was a mistake  this is all so far well but i will not borrow any money on my estate till i see things reasonably safe stocks have risen from  to  a strong proof that confidence is restored but i will yield to no delusive hopes and fall back fall edge my resolutions hold  i shall always think the better of cadell for this not merely because his feet are beautiful on the mountains who brings good tidings but because he showed feelingdeep feeling poor fellowhe who i thought had no more than his numeration table and who if he had had his whole countinghouse full of sensibility had yet his wife and children to bestow it uponi will not forget this if i get through i love the virtues of rough and round men the others are apt to escape in salt rheum salvolatile and a white pockethandkerchief an odd thought strikes me when i die will the journal of these days be taken out of the ebony cabinet at abbotsford and read as the transient pout of a man worth £60000 with wonder that the wellseeming baronet should ever have experienced such a hitch or will it be found in some obscure lodginghouse where the decayed son of chivalry has hung up his scutcheon for some 20s a week and where one or two old friends will look grave and whisper to each other poor gentleman a wellmeaning man nobodys enemy but his own thought his parts could never wear out family poorly left pity he took that foolish title who can answer this question                                       what a life mine has beenhalf educated almost wholly neglected or left to myself stuffing my head with most nonsensical trash and undervalued in society for a time by most of my companions getting forward and held a bold and clever fellow contrary to the opinion of all who thought me a mere dreamer brokenhearted for two years my heart handsomely pieced again but the crack will remain to my dying day rich and poor four or five times once on the verge of ruin yet opened new sources of wealth almost overflowing now taken in my pitch of pride and nearly winged unless the good news hold because london chooses to be in an uproar and in the tumult of bulls and bears a poor inoffensive lion like myself is pushed to the wall and what is to be the end of it god knows and so ends the catechism  december 19ballantyne here before breakfast he looks on cadells last nights news with more confidence than i do but i must go to work be my thoughts sober or lively constable came in and sat an hour the old gentleman is firm as a rock and scorns the idea of hurst and robinsons stopping he talks of going up to london next week and making sales of our interest in woodstock and boney which would put a hedge round his finances he is a very clever fellow and will i think bear us through  dined at lord chiefbarons79 lord justiceclerk lord president80 captain scarlett81 a gentlemanlike young man the son of the great counsel82 and a friend of my son walter lady charlotte hope and other womankind r dundas of arniston and his pleasant and goodhumoured little wife whose quick intelligent look pleases me more though her face be plain than a hundred mechanical beauties  december 20i like ch ba shepherd very much as much i think as any man i have learned to know of late years there is a neatness and precision a closeness and truth in the tone of his conversation which shows what a lawyer he must have been perfect goodhumour and suavity of manner with a little warmth of temper on suitable occasions his great deafness alone prevented him from being lord chiefjustice i never saw a man so patient under such a malady he loves society and converses excellently yet is often obliged in a mixed company particularly to lay aside his trumpet retire into himself and withdraw from the talk he does this with an expression of patience on his countenance which touches one much he has occasion for patience otherwise i should think for lady s is fine and fidgety and too anxious to have everything pointe devise  constables licence for the dedication is come which will make him happy83  dined with james ballantyne and met my old friend mathews the comedian with his son now grown up a clever rather forward lad who makes songs in the style of james smith or colman and sings them with spirit rather lengthy though  december 21there have been odd associations attending my two last meetings with mathews the last time i saw him before yesterday evening he dined with me in company with poor sir alexander boswell who was killed within two or three months84 i never saw sir alexander more85 the time before was in 1815 when john scott of gala and i were returning from france and passed through london when we brought mathews down as far as leamington poor byron lunched or rather made an early dinner with us at longs and a most brilliant day we had of it i never saw byron so full of fun frolic wit and whim he was as playful as a kitten well i never saw him again86 so this man of mirth with his merry meetings has brought me no luck i like better that he should throw in his talent of mimicry and humour into the present current tone of the company than that he should be required to give this that and tother bit selected from his public recitations they are good certainlyexcellent but then you must laugh and that is always severe to me when i do laugh in sincerity the joke must be or seem unpremeditated i could not help thinking in the midst of the glee what gloom had lately been over the minds of three of the company cadell jb and the journalist what a strange scene if the surge of conversation could suddenly ebb like the tide and show us the state of peoples real minds savary87 might have been gay in such a party with all his forgeries in his heart      no eyes the rooks discover     which lurk beneath the deep88  life could not be endured were it seen in reality  things are mending in town and hurst and robinson write with confidence and are it would seem strongly supported by wealthy friends cadell and constable are confident of their making their way through the storm and the impression of their stability is general in london i hear the same from lockhart indeed i now believe that they wrote gloomy letters to constable chiefly to get as much money out of them as they possibly could but they had wellnigh overdone it this being teind wednesday must be a day of leisure and labour sophia has got a house 25 pall mall dined at home with lady scott and anne  december 22i wrote six of my close pages yesterday which is about twentyfour pages in print what is more i think it comes off twangingly the story is so very interesting in itself that there is no fear of the book answering89 superficial it must be but i do not disown the charge better a superficial book which brings well and strikingly together the known and acknowledged facts than a dull boring narrative pausing to see further into a millstone at every moment than the nature of the millstone admits nothing is so tiresome as walking through some beautiful scene with a minute philosopher a botanist or pebblegatherer who is eternally calling your attention from the grand features of the natural scenery to look at grasses and chuckystones yet in their way they give useful information and so does the minute historian gad i think that will look well in the preface my bile is quite gone i really believe it arose from mere anxiety what a wonderful connection between the mind and body  the air of bonnie dundee running in my head today i wrote a few verses to it before dinner taking the keynote from the story of clavers leaving the scottish convention of estates in 1688990 i wonder if they are good ah poor will erskine91 thou couldst and wouldst have told me i must consult jb who is as honest as was we but then though he has good taste too there is a little of big bowwow about it cant say what made me take a frisk so uncommon of late years as to write verses of freewill i suppose the same impulse which makes birds sing when the storm seems blown over  dined at lord mintos there were lord and lady ruthven will clerk and thomas thomsona right choice party there was also my very old friend mrs brydone the relict of the traveller92 and daughter of principal robertson and really worthy of such a connectionlady minto who is also peculiarly agreeableand her sister mrs admiral adam in the evening  december 23the present lord minto is a very agreeable wellinformed and sensible man but he possesses neither the high breeding ease of manner nor eloquence of his father the first earl that sir gilbert was indeed a man among a thousand i knew him very intimately in the beginning of the century and which was very agreeable was much at his house on very easy terms he loved the muses and worshipped them in secret and used to read some of his poetry which was but middling  tom campbell lived at minto but it was in a state of dependence which he brooked very ill he was kindly treated but would not see it in the right view and suspected slights and so on where no such thing was meant there was a turn of savage about tom though without his blackguardisma kind of waywardness of mind and irritability that must have made a man of his genius truly unhappy lord minto with the mildest manners was very tenacious of his opinions although he changed them twice in the crisis of politics he was the early friend of fox and made a figure towards the end of the american war or during the struggles betwixt fox and pitt then came the revolution and he joined the antigallican party so keenly that he declared against addingtons peace with france and was for a time i believe a wyndhamite he was reconciled to the whigs on the fox and grenville coalition but i have heard that fox contrary to his wont retained such personal feelings as made him object to sir gilbert elliots having a seat in the cabinet so he was sent as governorgeneral to indiaa better thing i take it for his fortune he died shortly after his return93 at hatfield or barnet on his way down to his native country he was a most pleasing and amiable man i was very sorry for his death though i do not know how we should have met for the contested election in 1805 in roxburghshire had placed some coldness betwixt the present lord and me i was certainly anxious for sir alexander don both as friend of my most kind friend charles duke of buccleuch and on political accounts and those thwartings are what men in public life do not like to endure after a cessation of friendship for some years we have come about again we never had the slightest personal dispute or disagreement but politics are the blowpipe beneath whose influence the best cemented friendships too often dissever and ours after all was only a very familiar acquaintance  it is very odd that the common people at minto and the neighbourhood will not believe to this hour that the first earl is dead they think he had done something in india which he could not answer forthat the house was rebuilt on a scale unusually large to give him a suite of secret apartments and that he often walks about the woods and crags of minto at night with a white nightcap and long white beard the circumstance of his having died on the road down to scotland is the sole foundation of this absurd legend which shows how willing the vulgar are to gull themselves when they can find no one else to take the trouble i have seen people who could read write and cipher shrug their shoulders and look mysterious when this subject was mentioned one very absurd addition was made on occasion of a great ball at minto house which it was said was given to draw all people away from the grounds that the concealed earl might have leisure for his exercise this was on the principle in the german play94 where to hide their conspiracy the associates join in a chorus song  we dined at home mr davidoff and his tutor kept an engagement with us to dinner notwithstanding the death of the emperor alexander they went to the play with the womankind i stayed at home to write  december 24wrote walter and jane and gave the former an account of how things had been in the money market and the loan of £10000 constable has a scheme of publishing the works of the author of waverley in a superior style at £1 1s volume he says he will answer for making £20000 of this and liberally offered me any share of the profit i have no great claim to any as i have only to contribute the notes which are light work yet a few thousands coming in will be a good thingbesides the printing office constable though valetudinary and cross with his partner is certainly as good a pilot in these rough seas as ever man put faith in his rally has put me in mind of the old song

days work      i make a vow     and keep it true  i will accept no invitation for dinner save one to newtondon and mertoun tomorrow instead of christmas day on this day of general devotion i have a particular call for gratitude                                       my god what poor creatures we are after all my fair proposals yesterday i was seized with a most violent pain in the right kidney and parts adjacent which joined to deadly sickness which it brought on forced me instantly to go to bed and send for clarkson97 he came and inquired pronouncing the complaint to be gravel augmented by bile i was in great agony till about two oclock but awoke with the pain gone i got up had a fire in my dressingcloset and had dalgleish to shave metwo trifles which i only mention because they are contrary to my hardy and independent personal habits but although a man cannot be a hero to his valet his valet in sickness becomes of great use to him i cannot expect that this first will be the last visit of this cruel complaint but shall we receive good at the hand of god and not receive evil  december 27thslept twelve hours at a stretch being much exhausted totally without pain today but uncomfortable from the effects of calomel which with me at least is like the assistance of an auxiliary army just one degree more tolerable than the enemy it chases away calomel contemplations are not worth recording i wrote an introduction and a few notes to the memoirs of madame la rochejacquelin98 being all that i was equal to  sir adam ferguson came over and tried to marry my verses to the tune of bonnie dundee they seem well adapted to each other dined with lady scott and anne  worked at pepys in the evening with the purpose of review for lockhart99 notwithstanding the depressing effects of the calomel i feel the pleasure of being alone and uninterrupted few men leading a quiet life and without any strong or highly varied change of circumstances have seen more variety of society than ifew have enjoyed it more or been bored as it is called less by the company of tiresome people i have rarely if ever found any one out of whom i could not extract amusement or edification and were i obliged to account for hints afforded on such occasions i should make an ample deduction from my inventive powers still however from the earliest time i can remember i preferred the pleasure of being alone to waiting for visitors and have often taken a bannock and a bit of cheese to the wood or hill to avoid dining with company as i grew from boyhood to manhood i saw this would not do and that to gain a place in mens esteem i must mix and bustle with them pride and an excitation of spirits supplied the real pleasure which others seem to feel in society and certainly upon many occasions it was real still if the question was eternal company without the power of retiring within yourself or solitary confinement for life i should say turnkey lock the cell my life though not without its fits of waking and strong exertion has been a sort of dream spent in      chewing the cud of sweet and bitter fancy100  i have worn a wishingcap the power of which has been to divert present griefs by a touch of the wand of imagination and gild over the future prospect by prospects more fair than can ever be realised somewhere it is said that this castlebuildingthis wielding of the aërial trowelis fatal to exertions in actual life i cannot tell i have not found it so i cannot indeed say like madame genlis that in the imaginary scenes in which i have acted a part i ever prepared myself for anything which actually befell me but i have certainly fashioned out much that made the present hour pass pleasantly away and much that has enabled me to contribute to the amusement of the public since i was five years old i cannot remember the time when i had not some ideal part to play for my own solitary amusement  december 28somehow i think the attack on christmas day has been of a critical kind and having gone off so well may be productive rather of health than continued indisposition if one is to get a renewal of health in his fiftyfourth year he must look to pay fine for it last night george thomson101 came to see how i was poor fellow he has talent is well informed and has an excellent heart but there is an eccentricity about him that defies description i wish to god i saw him provided in a country kirk that with a rational wifethat is if there is such a thing to be gotten for himwould i think bring him to a steady temper at present he is between the tyning and the winning if i could get him to set to any hard study he would do something clever  how to make a critica sly rogue sheltering himself under the generic name of mr campbell requested of me through the pennypost the loan of £50 for two years having an impulse as he said to make this demand as i felt no corresponding impulse i begged to decline a demand which might have been as reasonably made by any campbell on earth and another impulse has determined the man of fifty pounds to send me anonymous abuse of my works and temper and selfish disposition the severity of the joke lies in 14d for postage to avoid which his next epistle shall go back to the clerks of the post office as not for sws how the severe rogue would be disappointed if he knew i never looked at more than the first and last lines of his satirical effusion  when i first saw that a literary profession was to be my fate i endeavoured by all efforts of stoicism to divest myself of that irritable degree of sensibilityor to speak plainly of vanitywhich makes the poetical race miserable and ridiculous the anxiety of a poet for praise and for compliments i have always endeavoured to keep down   december 29base feelings this same calomel

to do anything else in preference commenced preface for new edition of my novels the city of cork send my freedom in a silver box i thought i was out of their grace for going to see blarney rather than the cove for which i was attacked and defended in the papers when in ireland i am sure they are so civil that i would have gone wherever they wished me to go if i had had any one to have told me what i ought to be most inquisitive about      for if i should as lion come in strife     into such place t were pity of my life105  december 30spent at home and in labourwith the weight of unpleasant news from edinburgh jb is like to be pinched next week unless the loan can be brought forward i must and have endeavoured to supply him at present the result of my attempts is uncertain i am even more anxious about constable  co unless they can get assistance from their london friends to whom they gave much all is in gods hands the worst can only be what i have before anticipated but i must i think renounce the cigars they brought back using two this evening the irritation of which i had no feelings while abstaining from them dined alone with gordon106 lady s and anne james curle melrose has handsomely lent me £600 he has done kindly i have served him before and will again if in my power  december 31took a good sharp walk the first time since my illness and found myself the better in

twelvemonth as well as the 31st december the latter is only the solemn pause as when a guide showing a wild and mountainous road calls on a party to pause and look back at the scenes which they have

frosty daycold but dry and pleasant under foot walked into the plantations with anne and anne russell a thought strikes me alluding to this period of the year people say that the whole human frame in all its parts and divisions is gradually in the act of decaying and renewing what a curious timepiece it would be that could indicate to us the moment this gradual and insensible change had so

yawning fatigues of an actual sitting i think if he has talent he may do more my way than in the customary mode at least i cant have the hangdog look which the unfortunate theseus has who is doomed to sit for what seems an eternity113  i wrought till two oclockindeed till i was almost nervous with correcting and scribbling i then walked or rather was dragged through the snow by tom purdie while skene accompanied what a blessing there is in a man like tom whom no familiarity can spoil whom you may scold and praise and joke with knowing the quality of the man is unalterable in his love and reverence to his master use an ordinary servant in the same way and he will be your master in a month we should thank god for the snow as well as summer flowers this brushing exercise has put all my nerves into tone again which were really jarred with fatigue until my very backbone seemed breaking this comes of trying to do too much jbs news are as good as possibleprudence prudence and all will do excellently  january 8frost and snow still write to excuse myself from attending the funeral of my aunt mrs curle which takes place tomorrow at kelso she was a woman of the old sandyknowe breed with the strong sense high principle and indifferent temper which belonged to my fathers family she lived with great credit on a moderate income and i believe gave away a great deal of it114  january 9mathews the comedian and his son came to spend a day at abbotsford the last is a clever young man with much of his fathers talent for mimicry rather forward though115 mr scrope also came out which fills our house  january 10bodily health the mainspring of the microcosm seems quite restored no more flinching or nervous fits but the sound mind in the sound body what poor things does a feverfit or an overflowing of the bile make of the masters of creation  the snow begins to fall thick this morning      the landlord then aloud did say     as how he wished they would go away  to have our friends shut up here would be rather too much of a good thing  the day cleared up and was very pleasant had a good walk and looked at the curling mr mathews made himself very amusing in the evening he has the goodnature to show his accomplishments without pressing and without the appearance of feeling pain on the contrary i dare say he enjoys the pleasure he communicates  january 11i got proofsheets in which it seems i have repeated a whole passage of history which had been told before james is in an awful stew and i cannot blame him but then he should consider the hyoscyamus which i was taking and the anxious botheration about the moneymarket however as chaucer says      there is na workeman     that can bothe worken wel and hastilie     this must be done at leisure parfitly116  january 12mathews last night gave us a very perfect imitation of old cumberland who carried the poetic jealousy and irritability further than any man i ever saw he was a great flatterer too the old rogue will erskine used to admire him i think he wanted originality a very highbred man in point of manners in society  my little artist knight gets on better with his portraitthe features are however too pinched i think  upon the whole the days pass pleasantly enoughwork till one or two then an hour or twos walk in the snow then lighter work or reading late dinner and singing or chat in the evening mathews has really all the will as well as the talent to be amusing he confirms my idea of ventriloquism which is an absurd word as being merely the art of imitating sounds at a greater or less distance assisted by some little points of trick to influence the imagination of the audiencethe vulgar idea of a peculiar organisation beyond fineness of ear and of utterance is nonsense  january 13our party are about to disperse      like youthful steers unyoked east north and south117  i am not sorry being one of those whom too much mirth always inclines to sadness the missing so many of my own family together with the serious inconveniences to which i have been exposed gave me at present a desire to be alone the skenes return to edinburgh so does mr scropeitem the little artist mathews to newcastle his son to liverpool so exeunt omnes118  mathews assures me that sheridan was generally very dull in society and sate sullen and silent swallowing glass after glass rather a hindrance than a help but there was a time when he broke out with a resumption of what had been going on done with great force and generally attacking some person in the company or some opinion which he had expressed i never saw sheridan but in large parties he had a bardolph countenance with heavy features but his eye possessed the most distinguished brilliancy mathews says it is very simple in tom moore to admire how sheridan came by the means of paying the price of drury lane theatre when all the world knows he never paid it at all and that lacy who sold it was reduced to want by his breach of faith119 dined quiet with anne lady scott and gordon  january 14an odd mysterious letter from constable who is gone post to london to put something to rights which is wrong betwixt them their banker and another moneyed friend it strikes me to be that sort of letter which i have seen men write when they are desirous that their disagreeable intelligence should be rather apprehended than avowed i thought he had been in london a fortnight ago disposing of property to meet this exigence and so i think he should well i must have patience but these terrors and frights are truly annoying luckily the funny people are gone and i shall not have the task of grinning when i am serious enough dined as yesterday  a letter from jb mentioning constables journey but without expressing much if any apprehension he knows c well and saw him before his departure and makes no doubt of his being able easily to extricate whatever may be entangled i will not therefore make myself uneasy i can help doing so surely if i will at least i have given up cigars since the year began and have now no wish to return to the habit as it is called i see no reason why one should not be able to vanquish with gods assistance these noxious thoughts which foretell evil but cannot remedy it  january 15like yesterday a hard frost thermometer at 10 water in my dressingroom frozen to flint yet i had a fine walk yesterday the sun dancing delightfully on grim natures visage hoar120 were it not the plague of being dragged along by another person i should like such weather as well as summer but having tom purdie to do this office reconciles me to it i cannot cleik with john as old mrs mure of caldwell used to say i mean that an ordinary menial servant thus hooked to your side reminds me of the twin bodies mentioned by pitscottie being two trunks on the same waist and legs one died before the other and remained a dead burden on the back of its companion121 such is close union with a person whom you cannot well converse with and whose presence is yet indispensable to your getting on an actual companion whether humble or your equal is still worse but tom purdie is just the thing kneaded up between the friend and servant as well as uncle tobys bowlinggreen between sand and clay you are certain he is proud as well as patient under his burthen and you are under no more constraint than with a pony i must ride him today if the weather holds up meantime i will correct that curious fellow pepys diaryi mean the article i have made of it for the quarterly  edinburgh january 16came through cold roads to as cold news hurst and robinson have suffered a bill of £1000 to come back upon constable which i suppose infers the ruin of both houses we shall soon see constable it seems who was to have set off in the last week of december dawdled here till in all human probability his going or staying became a matter of mighty little consequence he could not be there till monday night and his resources must have come too late dined with the skenes122  january 17james ballantyne this morninggood honest fellow with a visage as black as the crook123 he hopes no salvation has indeed taken measures to stop it is hard after having fought such a battle have apologised for not attending the royal society club who have a gaudeamus on this day and seemed to count much on my being the preses  my old acquaintance miss elizabeth clerk sister of willie died suddenly i cannot choose but wish it had been sws and yet the feeling is unmanly i have anne my wife and charles to look after i felt rather sneaking as i came home from the parliament housefelt as if i were liable monstrari digito in no very pleasant way but this must be borne cum caeteris and thank god however uncomfortable i do not feel despondent  i have seen cadell ballantyne and hogarth all advise me to execute a trust of my property for payment of my obligations so does john gibson124 and so i resolve to do my wife and daughter are gloomy but yet patient i trust by my hold on the works to make it every mans interest to be very gentle with me cadell makes it plain that by prudence they will in six months realise £20000 which can be attainable by no effort of their own  january 18he that sleeps too long in the morning let him borrow the pillow of a debtor so says the spaniard and so say i i had of course an indifferent night of it i wish these two days were over but the worst is over the bank of scotland has behaved very well expressing a resolution to serve constables house and me to the uttermost but as no one can say to what extent hurst and robinsons failure may go borrowing would but linger it out  january 19during yesterday i received formal visits from my friends skene and colin mackenzie who i am glad to see looks well with every offer of service the royal bank also sent sir john hope and sir henry jardine125 to offer to comply with my wishes the advocate came on the same errand but i gave all the same answerthat my intention was to put the whole into the hands of a trustee and to be contented with the event and that all i had to ask was time to do so and to extricate my affairs i was assured of every accommodation in this way from all quarters i have had the same kindness letters from constable and robinson have arrived the last persist in saying they will pay all and everybody they say moreover in a postscript that had constable been in town ten days sooner all would have been well when i saw him on 24th december he proposed starting in three days but dallied god knows why in a kind of infatuation i think till things had got irretrievably wrong there would have been no want of support then and his stock under his own management would have made a return immensely greater than it can under any other now i fear the loss must be great as his fall will involve many of the country dealers who traded with him  i feel quite composed and determined to labour there is no remedy i guess as mathews makes his yankees say that we shall not be troubled with visitors and i calculate that i will not go out at all so what can i do better than labour even yesterday i went about making notes on waverley according to constables plan it will do good one day today when i lock this volume i go to woodstock heigho  knight came to stare at me to complete his portrait he must have read a tragic page compared to what he saw at abbotsford126  we dined of course at home and before and after dinner i finished about twenty printed pages of woodstock but to what effect others must judge a painful scene after dinner and another after supper endeavouring to convince these poor dear creatures that they must not look for miracles but consider the misfortune as certain and only to be lessened by patience and labour  january 20indifferent nightvery bilious which may be want of exercise a letter from sir j sinclair whose absurd vanity bids him thrust his finger into every mans pie proposing that hurst and robinson should sell their prints of which he says they have a large collection by way of lottery like boydell      in scenes like these which break our heart     comes punch like you and  mais pourtant cultivons notre jardin the public favour is my only lottery i have long enjoyed the foremost prize and something in my breast tells me my evil genius will not overwhelm me if i stand by myself why should i not i have no enemiesmany attached friends the popular ascendency which i have maintained is of the kind which is rather improved by frequent appearances before the public in fact critics may say what they will but hain your reputation and tyne your reputation is a true proverb127  sir william forbes calledthe same kind honest friend as ever with all offers of assistance128 etc etc all anxious to serve me and careless about their own risk of loss and these are the cold hard moneymaking men whose questions and control i apprehended  lord chief commissioner adam also came to see me and the meeting though pleasing was melancholy it is the first time we have met since the break up of his hopes in the death of his eldest son on his return from india where he was chief in council and highly esteemed129 the commissioner is not a very early friend of mine for i scarce knew him till his settlement in scotland with his present office130 but i have since lived much with him and taken kindly to him as one of the most pleasant kindhearted benevolent and pleasing men i have ever known it is high treason among the tories to express regard for him or respect for the jury court in which he presides i was against that experiment as much as any one but it is an experiment and the establishment which the fools will not perceive is the only thing which i see likely to give some prospects of ambition to our bar which has been otherwise so much diminished as for the chief commissioner i dare say he jobs as all other people of consequence do in elections and so forth but he is the personal friend of the king and the decided enemy of whatever strikes at the constitutional rights of the monarch besides i love him for the various changes which he has endured through life and which have been so great as to make him entitled to be regarded in one point of view as the most fortunatein the other the most unfortunateman in the world he has gained and lost two fortunes by the same good luck and the same rash confidence which raised and now threatens my peculium and his quiet honourable and generous submission under circumstances more painful than minefor the loss of worlds wealth was to him aggravated by the death of his youngest and darling son in the west indiesfurnished me at the time and now with a noble example so the tories and whigs may go be dd together as names that have disturbed old scotland and torn asunder the most kindly feelings since the first day they were invented yes  them they are spells to rouse all our angry passions and i dare say notwithstanding the opinion of my private and calm moments i will open on the cry again so soon as something occurs to chafe my mood and yet god knows i would fight in honourable contest with word or blow for my political opinions but i cannot permit that strife to mix its waters with my daily meal those waters of bitterness which poison all mutual love and confidence betwixt the welldisposed on either side and prevent them if need were from making mutual concessions and balancing the constitution against the ultras of both parties the good man seems something broken by these afflictions  january 21susannah in tristram shandy thinks death is best met in bed i am sure trouble and vexation are not the watches of the night pass wearily when disturbed by fruitless regrets and disagreeable anticipations but let it pass      well goodman time or blunt or keen     move thou quick or take thy leisure     longest day will have its een     weariest life but treads a measure  i have seen cadell who is very much downcast for the risk of their copyrights being thrown away by a hasty sale i suggested that if they went very cheap some means might be fallen on to keep up their value or purchase them in i fear the split betwixt constable and cadell will render impossible what might otherwise be hopeful enough it is the italian racehorses i think which instead of riders have spurs tied to their sides so as to prick them into a constant gallop cadell tells me their gross profit was sometimes £10000 a year but much swallowed up with expenses and his partners draughts which came to £4000 yearly what there is to show for this god knows constables apparent expenses were very much within bounds  colin mackenzie entered and with his usual kindness engages to use his influence to recommend some moderate proceeding to constables creditors such as may permit him to go on and turn that species of property to account which no man alive can manage so well as he  followed mr gibson with a most melancholy tale things are so much worse with constable than i apprehended that i shall neither save abbotsford nor anything else naked we entered the world and naked we leave itblessed be the name of the lord  january 22i feel neither dishonoured nor broken down by the badnow really bad news i have received i have walked my last on the domains i have plantedsate the last time in the halls i have built but death would have taken them from me if misfortune had spared them my poor people whom i loved so well there is just another die to turn up against me in this run of illluck ie if i should break my magic wand in the fall from this elephant and lose my popularity with my fortune then woodstock and bony may both go to the papermaker and i may take to smoking cigars and drinking grog or turn devotee and intoxicate the brain another way in prospect of absolute ruin i wonder if they would let me leave the court of session i would like methinks to go abroad      and lay my bones far from the tweed  but i find my eyes moistening and that will not do i will not yield without a fight for it it is odd when i set myself to work doggedly as dr johnson would say i am exactly the same man that i ever was neither lowspirited nor distrait in prosperous times i have sometimes felt my fancy and powers of language flag but adversity is to me at least a tonic and bracer the fountain is awakened from its inmost recesses as if the spirit of affliction had troubled it in his passage  poor mr pole the harper sent to offer me £500 or £600 probably his all131 there is much good in the world after all but i will involve no friend either rich or poor my own right hand shall do itelse will i be done in the slang language and undone in common parlance  i am glad that beyond my own family who are excepting ls young and able to bear sorrow of which this is the first taste to some of them most of the hearts are past aching which would have once been inconsolable on this occasion i do not mean that many will not seriously regret and some perhaps lament my misfortunes but my dear mother my almost sister christy rutherford132 poor will erskinethese would have been mourners indeed  wellexertionexertion o invention rouse thyself may man be kind may god be propitious the worst is i never quite know when i am right or wrong and ballantyne who does know in some degree will fear to tell me lockhart would be worth gold just now but he too would be too diffident to speak broad out all my hope is in the continued indulgence of the public i have a funeralletter to the burial of the chevalier yelin a foreigner of learning and talent who has died at the royal hotel he wished to be introduced to me and was to have read a paper before the royal society when this introduction was to have taken place i was not at the society that evening and the poor gentleman was taken ill at the meeting and unable to proceed he went to his bed and never rose again and now his funeral will be the first public place i shall appear at he dead and i ruined this is what you call a meeting133  january 23slept ill not having been abroad these eight dayssplendida bilis then a dead sleep in the morning and when the awakening comes a strong feeling how well i could dispense with it for once and for ever this passes away however as better and more dutiful thoughts arise in my mind i know not if my imagination has flagged probably it has but at least my powers of labour have not diminished during the last melancholy week on monday and tuesday my exertions were suspended since wednesday inclusive i have written thirtyeight of my close manuscript pages of which seventy make a volume of the usual novel size  wrote till twelve am finishing half of what i call a good days workten pages of print or rather twelve then walked in princes street pleasuregrounds with good samaritan james skene the only one among my numerous friends who can properly be termed amicus curarum mearum others being too busy or too gay and several being estranged by habit134  the walks have been conducted on the whole with much taste though skene has undergone much criticism the usual reward of public exertions on account of his plans it is singular to walk close beneath the grim old castle and to think what scenes it must have seen and how many generations of three score and ten have risen and passed away it is a place to cure one of too much sensation over earthly subjects of mutation my wife and girls tongues are chatting in a lively manner in the drawingroom it does me good to hear them  january 24constable came yesterday and saw me for half an hour he seemed irritable but kept his temper under command was a little shocked when i intimated that i was disposed to regard the present works in progress as my own i think i saw two things1 that he is desirous to return into the management of his own affairs without cadell if he can 2 that he relies on my connection as the way of helping us out of the slough indeed he said he was ruined utterly without my countenance i certainly will befriend him if i can but constable without cadell is like getting the clock without the pendulumthe one having the ingenuity the other the caution of the business i will see my way before making any bargain and i will help them i am sure if i can without endangering my last cast for freedom worked out my task yesterday my kind friend mrs coutts has got the cadetship for pringle shortreed in which he was peculiarly interested  i went to the court for the first time today and like the man with the large nose thought everybody was thinking of me and my mishaps many were undoubtedly and all rather regrettingly some obviously affected it is singular to see the difference of mens manner whilst they strive to be kind or civil in their way of addressing me some smile as they wish me goodday as if to say think nothing about it my lad it is quite out of our thoughts others greeted me with the affected gravity which one sees and despises at a funeral the best bredall i believe meaning equally welljust shook hands and went on a foolish puff in the papers calling on men and gods to assist a popular author who having choused the public of many thousands had not the sense to keep wealth when he had it if i am hard pressed and measures used against me i must use all means of legal defence and subscribe myself bankrupt in a petition for sequestration it is the course i would have advised a client to take and would have the effect of saving my land which is secured by my sons contract of marriage i might save my library etc by assistance of friends and bid my creditors defiance but for this i would in a court of honour deserve to lose my spurs no if they permit me i will be their vassal for life and dig in the mine of my imagination to find diamonds or what may sell for such to make good my engagements not to enrich myself and this from no reluctance to allow myself to be called the insolvent which i probably am but because i will not put out of the power of my creditors the resources mental or literary which yet remain to me  went to the funeral of chevalier yelin the literary foreigner mentioned on 22d how many and how various are the ways of affliction here is this poor man dying at a distance from home his proud heart broken his wife and family anxiously expecting letters and doomed only to learn they have lost a husband and father for ever he lies buried on the calton hill near learned and scientific dustthe graves of david hume and john playfair being side by side  january 25anne is ill this morning may god help us if it should prove serious as i have known it in such cases where am i to find courage or comfort a thought has struck mecan we do nothing for creditors with the goblin drama called fortunes of devorgoil could it not be added to woodstock as a fourth volume terry refused a gift of it but he was quite and entirely wrong it is not good but it may be made so poor will erskine liked it much135 gave my wife her £12 allowance £24 to last till wednesday fortnight january 26spoke to jb last night about devorgoil who does not seem to relish the proposal alleging the comparative failure of halidon hill ay says selfconceit but he has not read it and when he does it is the sort of wild fanciful work betwixt heaven and earth which men of solid parts do not estimate pepys thought shakespeares midsummer nights dream the most silly play he had ever seen and pepys was probably judging on the same grounds with jb though presumptuous enough to form conclusions against a very different work from any of mine how if i send it to lockhart by and by  i called today at constables both partners seemed secure that hurst and robinson were to go on and pay strange that they should have stopped constable very anxious to have husbanding of the books i told him the truth that i would be glad to have his assistance and that he should have the benefit of the agency but that he was not to consider past transactions as a rule for selling them in future since i must needs make the most out of the labours i could item that i or whoever might act for me would of course after what has happened look especially to the security he said if hurst and robinson were to go on bank notes would be laid down i conceive indeed that they would take woodstock and napoleon almost at loss rather than break the connection in the public eye sir william arbuthnot and mr kinnear were very kind but cui bono136  gibson comes with a joyful face announcing all the creditors had unanimously agreed to a private trust this is handsome and confidential and must warm my best efforts to get them out of the scrape i will not doubtto doubt is to lose sir william forbes took the chair and behaved as he has ever done with the generosity of ancient faith and early friendship they137 are deeper concerned than most in what scenes have sir william and i not borne share togetherdesperate and almost bloody affrays rivalries deep drinkingmatches and finally with the kindest feelings on both sides somewhat separated by his retiring much within the bosom of his family and i moving little beyond mine it is fated our planets should cross though and that at the periods most interesting for me downdowna hundred thoughts  jane russell drank tea with us  i hope to sleep better tonight if i do not i shall get ill and then i cannot keep my engagements is it not odd i can command my eyes to be awake when toil and weariness sit on my eyelids but to draw the curtain of oblivion is beyond my power i remember some of the wild buccaneers in their impiety succeeded pretty well by shutting hatches and burning brimstone and assafœtida in making a tolerable imitation of hellbut the pirates heaven was a wretched affair it is one of the worst things about this system of ours that it is a hundred times more easy to inflict pain than to create pleasure  january 27slept better and less bilious owing doubtless to the fatigue of the preceding night and the more comfortable news i drew my salaries of various kinds amounting to £300 and upwards and sent with john gibsons consent £200 to pay off things at abbotsford which must be paid wrote laidlaw with the money directing him to make all preparations for reduction138 anne ill of rheumatism i believe caught cold by vexation and exposing herself to bad weather  the celtic society present me with the most splendid broadsword i ever saw a beautiful piece of art and a most noble weapon honourable mr stuart second son of the earl of moray general graham stirling and macdougal attended as a committee to present it this was very kind of my friends the celts with whom i have had so many merry meetings it will be a rare legacy to walterfor myself good lack it is like lady dowager dons prize in a lottery of hardware shea venerable lady who always wore a haunchhoop silk négligé and triple ruffles at the elbowhaving the luck to gain a pair of silver spurs and a whip to correspond  january 28ballantyne and cadell wish that mr alex cowan should be constables trustee instead of jbs gibson is determined to hold by cowan i will not interfere although i think cowans services might do us more good as constables trustee than as our own but i will not begin with thwarting the managers of my affairs or even exerting strong influence it is not fair these last four or five days i have wrought little today i set on the steam and ply my paddles  january 29the proofs of vol i139 came so thick in yesterday that much was not done but i began to be hard at work today and must not gurnalise much  mr jollie who is to be my trustee in conjunction with gibson came to see mea pleasant and goodhumoured man and has high reputation as a man of business i told him and i will keep my word that he would at least have no trouble by my interfering and thwarting their management which is the not unfrequent case of trusters and trustees140  constables business seems unintelligible no man thought the house worth less than £150000 constable told me when he was making his will that he was worth £80000 great profits on almost all the adventures no bad speculationsyet neither stock nor debt to show constable might have eaten up his share but cadell was very frugal no doubt trading almost entirely on accommodation is dreadfully expensive141  january 30false delicacy mr gibson mr cowan mr jb were with me last night to talk over important matters and suggest an individual for a certain highly confidential situation i was led to mention a person of whom i knew nothing but that he was an honest and intelligent man all seemed to acquiesce and agreed to move the thing to the party concerned this morning and so mr g and mr c left me when jb let out that it was their unanimous opinion that we should be in great trouble were the individual appointed from faults of temper etc which would make it difficult to get on with him with a hearty curse i hurried jb to let them know that i had no partiality for the man whatever and only named him because he had been proposed for a similar situation elsewhere this is provoking enough that they would let me embarrass my affairs with a bad man an unfit one i mean rather than contradict me i dare say great men are often used so  i laboured freely yesterday the stream rose fastif clearly is another question but there is bulk for it at leastabout thirty printed pages      and now again boys to the oar  january 31there being nothing in the roll today i stay at home from the court and add another days perfect labour to woodstock which is worth five days of snatched intervals when the current of thought and invention is broken in upon and the mind shaken and diverted from its purpose by a succession of petty interruptions i have now no pecuniary provisions to embarrass me and i think now the shock of the discovery is past and over i am much better off on the whole i am as if i had shaken off from my shoulders a great mass of garments rich indeed but cumbrous and always more a burden than a comfort i am free of an hundred petty public duties imposed on me as a man of considerationof the expense of a great hospitalityand what is better of the great waste of time connected with it i have known in my day all kinds of society and can pretty well estimate how much or how little one loses by retiring from all but that which is very intimate i sleep and eat and work as i was wont and if i could see those about me as indifferent to the loss of rank as i am i should be completely happy as it is time must salve that sore and to time i trust it  since the 14th of this month no guest has broken bread in my house save gh gordon142 one morning at breakfast this happened never before since i had a house of my own but i have played abou hassan

had great pleasure in assembling what he called a fireside party where he was always disposed to indulge in the free and unrestrained outpouring of his cheerful and convivial disposition upon one of these occasions the comedian mathews and his son were at abbotsford and most entertaining they were giving us a full display of all their varied powers in scenic representations narrations songs ventriloquism and frolic of every description as well as a string of most amusing anecdote connected with the professional adventures of the elder and the travels of the son who seemed as much a

the day they came to town to take a family dinner at my house which had accordingly been complied with upon the present occasion and i never had seen sir walter in better spirits or more agreeable the fatal intimation of his bankruptcy however awaited him at home and next morning early i was surprised by a verbal message to come to him as soon as i had got up fearful that he had got a fresh attack of the complaint from which he had now for some years been free or that he had been involved in some quarrel i went to see him by seven oclock and found him already by candlelight seated at his writingtable surrounded by papers which he was examining holding out his hand to me as i entered he said skene this is the hand of a beggar constable has failed and i am ruined de fond en comble its a

walters private lawagent mr john gibson junr ws mr james jollie ws and mr alexander monypenny ws were the three gentlemen who ultimately agreed to take charge as trustees of sir walter scotts affairs

of reminiscences of scott which was published in 1871 this old friend died in 1879 in the month of january 1826 says mr gibson sir walter called upon me and explained how matters stood with the two houses referred to adding that he himself was a partner in one of themthat bills were falling due and dishonouredand that some immediate arrangement was indispensably necessary in such circumstances only two modes of proceeding could be thought ofeither that he should avail himself of the bankrupt act and allow his estate to be sequestrated or that he should execute a trust conveyance for behoof of his creditors the latter course was preferred for various reasons but chiefly out of regard for his own feeling reminiscences p 12 see entry in journal under jan 24  125 sir john hope of pinkie and

hoping to meet him at the royal society on this evening  134 on the morning of this day sir walter wrote the following note to his friend  dear skeneif you are disposed for a walk in your gardens any time this morning i would gladly accompany you for an hour since keeping the house so long begins rather to hurt me and you who supported the other day the weight of my body are perhaps best disposed to endure the gloom of my mindyours ever ws  castle street 23 january  i will call when you please all hours after twelve are the same to me  on his return from this walk mr skene wrote out his recollections of the conversation that had taken place of his power to rebuild his shattered fortunes scott said but woes me i much mistrust my vigour for the best of my energies are already expended you have seen my dear skene the roman coursers urged to their speed by a loaded spur attached to their backs to whet the rusty metal of their ageray it is a leaden spur indeed and it goads hard  i added but what do you think scott of the bits of flaming paper that are pasted on the flanks of the poor jades if we could but stick certain small documents on your back and set fire to them i think you might submit for a time to the pricking of the spur he laughed and said ay aythese weary bills if they were but as the thing that is notcome cheer me up with an account of the roman carnival and accordingly with my endeavour to do so he seemed as much interested as if nothing had happened to discompose the usual tenor of his mind but still our conversation ever and anon dropt back into the same subject in the course of which he said to me do you know i experience a sort of determined pleasure in confronting the very worst aspect of this sudden reversein standing as it were in the breach that has overthrown my fortunes and saying here i stand at least an honest man and god knows if i have enemies this i may at least with truth say that i have never wittingly given cause of enmity in the whole course of my life for even the burnings of political hate seemed to find nothing in my nature to feed the flame i am not conscious of having borne a grudge towards any man and at this moment of my overthrow so help me god i wish well and feel kindly to every one and if i thought that any of my works contained a sentence hurtful to any ones feelings i would burn it i think even my novels for he did not disown any of them are free from that blame  he had been led to make this protestation from my having remarked to him the singularly general feeling of goodwill and sympathy towards him which every one was anxious to testify upon the present occasion the sentiments of resignation and of cheerful acquiescence in the dispensation of the almighty which he expressed were those of a christian thankful for the blessings left and willing without ostentation to do his best it was really beautiful to see the workings of a strong and upright mind under the first lash of adversity calmly reposing upon the consolation afforded by his own integrity and manful purposes lately he said you saw me under the apprehension of the decay of my mental faculties and i confess that i was under mortal fear when i found myself writing one word for another and misspelling every word but that wore off and was perhaps occasioned by the effects of the medicine i had been taking but have i not reason to be thankful that that misfortune did not assail meay few have more reason to feel grateful to the disposer of all events than i havemr skenes reminiscences  135 the energy with which sir walter had set about turning his resources both present and past to immediate account with a view to prove to his creditors with as little delay as possible that all that could depend upon himself should be put in operation to retrieve his affairs made him often reluctant to quit his study however much he found himself exhausted however the employment served to occupy his mind and prevent its brooding over the misfortune which had befallen him and joined to the natural contentedness of his disposition prevented any approach of despondency here is an old effort of mine to compose a melodrama showing me one day a bundle of papers which he had found in his repositories this trifle would have been long ago destroyed had it not been for our poor friend kinnedder who arrested my hand as he thought it not bad and for his sake it was kept i have just read it over and do you know with some satisfaction faith i have known many worse things make their way very well in the world so god willing it shall een see the light if it can do aught in the hour of need to help the hand that fashioned it upon asking the name of this production he said i suspect i must change it having already forestalled it by the fortunes of nigel i had called it the fortunes of devorgoil but we must not begin to double up in that way for if you leave anything hanging loose you may be sure that some malicious devil will tug at it i think i shall call it the doom of devorgoil it will make a volume of itself and i do not see why it should not come out by particular desire as a fourth volume to woodstock they have some sort of connection and it would not be a difficult matter to bind the connection a little closer as the market goes i have no doubt of the bibliopolist pronouncing it worth £1000 or £1500 i asked him if he meant it for the stage no no the stage is a sorry job that course will not do for these hard days besides there is too much machinery in the piece for the stage i observed that i was not sure of that for pageant and machinery was the order of the day and had shakespeare been of this date he might have been left to die a deerstealer well then with all my heart if they can get the beast to lead or to drive they may bring it on the stage if they like it is a sort of goblin tale and so was the castle spectre which had its run i asked him if the castle spectre had yielded lewis much little of that in fact to its author absolutely nothing and yet its merits ought to have brought something handsome to poor mat but sheridan then manager you know generally paid jokes instead of cash and the joke that poor mat got was after all not a bad one have you heard it dont let me tell you a story you know as i had not heard it he proceeded well they were disputing about something and lewis had clenched his argument by proposing to lay a bet about it i shall lay what you ought long ago to have paid me for my castle spectre no no mat said sheridan i never lay large bets but come i will bet a trifle with youill bet what the castle spectre was worth now constable managed differently he paid well and promptly but devil take him it was all spectral together

for about £130000this large sum was ultimately paid in full by scott and his representatives the other two firms paid their creditors about 10 per cent of the amounts due it must be kept in mind

of north shields whose lawsuit with a methodist parson of the name of hill made some noise the worthy divine had in the basest manner interfered to prevent this ladys marriage by two anonymous letters in which he contrived to refer the lover to whom they were addressed for further corroboration to himself the whole imposition makes the subject of a little pamphlet published by marshall newcastle the lady ventured for redress into the thicket of english lawlost one suitgained another with £300 damages and was ruined the appearance and person of miss bell are prepossessing she is about thirty years old a brunette with regular and pleasing features marked with melancholyan enthusiast in literature and probably in religion she had been at abbotsford to see me and made her way to me here in the vain hope that she could get her story worked up into a novel and certainly the thing is capable of interesting situations it throws a curious light upon the aristocratic or rather hieratic influence exercised by the methodist preachers within the connection as it is called admirable food this would be for the quarterly or any other reviewers who might desire to feed fat their grudge against these sectarians but there are two reasons against such a publication first it would do the poor sufferer no good secondly it might hurt the methodistic connection very much which i for one would not like to injure they have their faults and are peculiarly liable to those of hypocrisy and spiritual ambition and priestcraft on the other hand they do infinite good carrying religion into classes in society where it would scarce be found to penetrate did it rely merely upon proof of its doctrines upon calm reasoning and upon rational argument methodists add a powerful appeal to the feelings and passions and though i believe this is often exaggerated into absolute enthusiasm yet i consider upon the whole they do much to keep alive a sense of religion and the practice of morality necessarily connected with it it is much to the discredit of the methodist clergy that when this calumniator was actually convicted of guilt morally worse than many men are hanged for they only degraded him from the first to the second class of their preachersleaving a man who from mere hatred at miss bells brother who was a preacher like himself had proceeded in such a deep and infamous scheme to ruin the character and destroy the happiness of an innocent person in possession of the pulpit and an authorised teacher of others if they believed him innocent they did too muchif guilty far too little143  i wrote to my nephew walter today cautioning him against a little disposition which he has to satire or méchanceté which may be a great stumblingblock in his course in life otherwise i presage well of him he is lieutenant of engineers with high character for mathematical scienceis acute very wellmannered and i think goodhearted he has seen enough of the world too to regulate his own course through life better than most lads at his age  february 3this is the first morning since my troubles that i felt at awaking      i had drunken deep     of all the blessedness of sleep144  i made not the slightest pause nor dreamed a single dream nor even changed my side this is a blessing to be grateful for there is to be a meeting of the creditors today but i care not for the issue if they drag me into the court obtorto collo instead of going into this scheme of arrangement they would do themselves a great injury and perhaps eventually do me good though it would give me much pain james ballantyne is severely critical on what he calls imitations of mrs radcliffe in woodstock many will think with him yet i am of opinion he is quite wrong or as friend j ferrier says vrong145 in the first place i am to look on the mere fact of another author having treated a subject happily as a bird looks on a potatobogle which scares it away from a field otherwise as free to its depredations as any ones else in 2d place i have taken a wide difference my object is not to excite fear of supernatural tilings in my reader but to show the effect of such fear upon the agents in the storyone a man of sense and firmnessone a man unhinged by remorseone a stupid uninquiring clownone a learned and worthy but superstitious divine in the third place the book turns on this hinge and cannot want it but i will try to insinuate the refutation of aldiborontis exception into the prefatory matter  from the 19th january to the 2d february inclusive is exactly fifteen days during which time with the intervention of some days idleness to let imagination brood on the task a little i have written a volume i think for a bet i could have done it in ten days then i must have had no court of session to take me up two or three hours every morning and dissipate my attention and powers of working for the rest of the day a volume at cheapest is worth £1000 this is working at the rate of £24000 a year but then we must not bake buns faster than people have appetite to eat them they are not essential to the market like potatoes  john gibson came to tell me in the evening that a meeting today had approved of the proposed trust i know not why but the news gives me little concern i heard it as a party indifferent i remember hearing that mandrin146 testified some horror when he found himself bound alive on the wheel and saw an executioner approach with a bar of iron to break his limbs after the second and third blow he fell alaughing and being asked the reason by his confessor said he laughed at his own folly which had anticipated increased agony at every blow when it was obvious that the first must have jarred and confounded the system of the nerves so much as to render the succeeding blows of little consequence i suppose it is so with the moral feelings at least i could not bring myself to be anxious whether these matters were settled one way or another  february 4wrote to mr laidlaw to come to town upon monday and see the trustees to farm or not to farm that is the question with our careless habits it were best i think to risk as little as possible lady scott will not exceed with ready money in her hand but calculating on the produce of a farm is different and neither she nor i are capable of that minute economy two cows should be all we should keep but i find lady s inclines much for the four if she had her youthful activity and could manage things it would be well and would amuse her but i fear it is too late a week  returned from court by constables and found cadell had fled to the sanctuary being threatened with ultimate diligence by the bank of scotland if this be a vindictive movement it is harsh useless and bad of them and flight on the contrary seems no good sign on his part i hope he wont prove his father or grandfather at prestonpans      cadell dressed among the rest       wi gun and good claymore man     on gelding grey he rode

the quality of the stuff what opportunities for labour does this same system of retreat afford us i am convinced that in three years i could do more than in the last ten but for the mine being i fear exhausted give me my popularityan awful postulateand all my present difficulties shall be a joke in five years and it is not lost yet at least  february 5rose after a sound sleep and here am i without bile or anything to perturb my inward man it is just about three weeks since so great a change took place in my relations in society and already i am indifferent to it but i have been always told my feelings of joy and sorrow pleasure and pain enjoyment and privation are much colder than those of other people       i think the romans call it stoicism148  missie was in the drawingroom and overheard william clerk and me laughing excessively at some foolery or other in the backroom to her no small surprise which she did not keep to herself but do people suppose that he was less sorry for his poor sister149 or i for my lost fortune if i have a very strong passion in the world it is pride and that never hinged upon worlds gear which was always with melight come light go  february 6letters received yesterday from lord montagu john morritt and mrs hugheskind and dear friends allwith solicitous inquiries but it is very tiresome to tell my story over again and i really hope i have few more friends intimate enough to ask me for it i dread letterwriting and envy the old hermit of prague who never saw pen or ink what then one must write it is a part of the law we live on talking of writing i finished my six pages neat and handsome yesterday nb at night i fell asleep and the oil dropped from the lamp upon my manuscript will this extreme unction make it go smoothly down with the public      thus idly we profane the sacred time     by silly prose light jest and lighter rhyme150  i have a song to write too and i am not thinking of it i trust it will come upon me at oncea sort of catch it should be151 i walked out feeling a little overwrought saw constable and turned over clarendon cadell not yet out of hiding this is simple work obliged to borrow £240 to be refunded in spring from john gibson to pay my nephews outfit and passage to bombay i wish i could have got this money otherwise but i must not let the orphan boy and such a clever fellow miscarry through my fault his education etc has been at my expense ever since he came from america  february 7had letters yesterday from lady davy and lady louisa stuart152 two very different persons lady davy daughter and coheiress of a wealthy antigua merchant has been known to me all my life her father was a relation of ours of a scotch calculation he was of a good family kerr of bloodielaws but decayed miss jane kerr married first mr apreece son of a welsh baronet the match was not happy i had lost all acquaintance with her for a long time when about twenty years ago we renewed it in london she was then a widow gay clever and most actively ambitious to play a distinguished part in london society her fortune though handsome and easy was not large enough to make way by dint of showy entertainments and so forth so she took the blue line and by great tact and management actually established herself as a leader of literary fashion soon after she visited edinburgh for a season or two and studied the northern lights one of the best of them poor jack playfair153 was disposed to shoot madly from his sphere154 and i believe asked her but he was a little too old she found a fitter husband in every respect in sir humphry davy to whom she gave a handsome fortune and whose splendid talents and situation as president of the royal society gave her naturally a distinguished place in the literary society of the metropolis now this is a very curious instance of an activeminded woman forcing her way to the point from which she seemed furthest excluded for though clever and even witty she had no peculiar accomplishment and certainly no good taste either for science or letters naturally i was once in the hebrides with her and i admired to observe how amidst seasickness fatigue some danger and a good deal of indifference as to what she saw she gallantly maintained her determination to see everything155 it marked her strength of character and she joined to it much tact and always addressed people on the right side so she stands high and deservedly so for to these active qualities more french i think than english and partaking of the creole vivacity and suppleness of character she adds i believe honourable principles and an excellent heart as a lioncatcher i could pit her against the world she flung her lasso see halls south america over byron himself but then poor soul she is not happy she has a temper and davy has a temper and these tempers are not one temper but two tempers and they quarrel like cat and dog which may be good for stirring up the stagnation of domestic life but they let the world see it and that is not so well now in all this i may be thought a little harsh on my friend but it is between my gurnal and me and moreover i would cry heartily if anything were to ail my little cousin though she be addicted to rule the cerulean atmosphere156 then i suspect the cares of this as well as other empires overbalance its pleasures there must be difficulty in being always in the right humour to hold a court there are usurpers to be encountered and insurrections to be put down an incessant troop bienséances to be discharged a sort of etiquette which is the curse of all courts an old lion cannot get hamstrung quietly at four hundred miles distance but the empress must send him her condolence and a pot of lipsalve to be sure the monster is consanguinean as sir toby says157  looked in at constables coming home cadell emerged from alsatia borrowed clarendon home by halfpast twelve  my old friend sir peter murray158 called to offer his own assistance lord justiceclerks and abercrombys to negotiate for me a seat upon the bench of the court of session instead of my sheriffdom and clerkship i explained to him the use which i could make of my pen was not i thought consistent with that situation and that besides i had neglected the law too long to permit me to think of it but this was kindly and honourably done i can see people think me much worse off than i think myself they may be right but i will not be beat till i have tried a rally and a bold one  february 8slept ill and rather bilious in the morning many of the bench now are my juniors i will not seek ex eleemosynâ a place which had i turned my studies that way i might have aspired to long ago ex meritis my pen should do much better for me than the odd £1000 a year if it fails i will lean on what they leave me another chance might be if it fails in the patronage which might after a year or two place me in exchequer but i do not count on this unless indeed the duke of buccleuch when he comes of age should choose to make play  got to my work again and wrote easier than the two last days  mr laidlaw159 came in from abbotsford and dined with us we spent the evening in laying down plans for the farm and deciding whom we should keep and whom dismiss among the people this we did on the true negrodriving principle of selfinterest the only principle i know which never swerves from its objects we chose all the active young and powerful men turning old age and infirmity adrift i cannot help this for a guinea cannot do the work of five but i will contrive to make it easier to the sufferers  february 9a stormy morning lowering and blustering like our fortunes mea virtute me involvo but i must say to the muse of fiction as the earl of pembroke said to the ejected nuns of wilton go spin you jades go spin perhaps she has no tow on her rock160 when i was at kilkenny last year we went to see a nunnery but could not converse with the sisters because they were in strict retreat i was delighted with the rednosed padre who showed us the place with a sort of proud unctuous humiliation and apparent dereliction of the world that had to me the air of a complete tartuffe a strong sanguine squareshouldered son of the church whom a protestant would be apt to warrant against any sufferings he was like to sustain by privation my purpose however just now was to talk of the strict retreat which did not prevent the nuns from walking in their little garden breviary in hand peeping at us and allowing us to peep at them well now we are in strict retreat and if we had been so last year instead of gallivanting to ireland this affair might not have befallenif literary labour could have prevented it but who could have suspected constables timbers to have been rotten from the beginning  visited the exhibition on my way home from the court the new rooms are most splendid and several good pictures the institution has subsisted but five years and it is astonishing how much superior the worst of the present collection are to the teaboardlooking things which first appeared john thomson of duddingston has far the finest picture in the exhibition of a large sizesubject dunluce a ruinous castle of the antrim family near the giants causeway with one of those terrible seas and skies which only thomson can paint found scrope there improving a picture of his own an italian scene in calabria he is i think greatly improved and one of the very best amateur painters i ever sawsir george beaumont scarcely excepted yet hang it i do except sir george  i would not write today after i came home i will not say could not for it is not true but i was lazy felt the desire far niente which is the sign of ones mind being at ease i read the english in italy161 which is a clever book  byron used to kick and frisk more contemptuously against the literary gravity and slang than any one i ever knew who had climbed so high then it is true i never knew any one climb so high and before you despise the eminence carrying people along with you as convinced that you are not playing the fox and the grapes you must be at the top moore told me some delightful stories of him one was that while they stood at the window of byrons palazzo in venice looking at a beautiful sunset moore was naturally led to say something of its beauty when byron answered in a tone that i can easily conceive oh come dn me tom dont be poetical another time standing with moore on the balcony of the same palazzo a gondola passed with two english gentlemen who were easily distinguished by their appearance they cast a careless look at the balcony and went on byron crossed his arms and half stooping over the balcony said ah dn ye if ye had known what two fellows you were staring at you would have taken a longer look at us this was the man quaint capricious and playful with all his immense genius he wrote from impulse never from effort and therefore i have always reckoned burns and byron the most genuine poetical geniuses of my time and half a century before me we have however many men of high poetical talent but none i think of that evergushing and perennial fountain of natural water  mr laidlaw dined with us says mr gibson told him he would dispose of my affairs were it any but sws162 no doubt so should i and am wellnigh doing so at any rate but fortuna juvante much may be achieved at worst the prospect is not very discouraging to one who wants little methinks i have been like burnss poor labourer      so constantly in ruins sight     the view ot gives me little fright  edinburgh february 10went through for a new day the task of buttoning which seems to me somehow to fill up more of my morning than usualnot certainly that such is really the case but that my mind attends to the process having so little left to hope or fear the half hour between waking and rising has all my life proved propitious to any task which was exercising my invention163 when i get over any knotty difficulty in a story or have had in former times to fill up a passage in a poem it was always when i first opened my eyes that the desired ideas thronged upon me this is so much the case that i am in the habit of relying upon it and saying to myself when i am at a loss never mind we shall have it at seven oclock tomorrow morning if i have forgot a circumstance or a name or a copy of verses it is the same thing there is a passage about this sort of matutinal inspiration in the odyssey164 which would make a handsome figure here if i could read or write greek i will look into pope for it who ten to one will not tell me the real translation i think the first hour of the morning is also favourable to the bodily strength among other feats when i was a young man i was able at times to lift a smiths anvil with one hand by what is called the horn or projecting piece of iron on which things are beaten to turn them round but i could only do this before breakfast and shortly after rising it required my full strength undiminished by the least exertion and those who choose to try it will find the feat no easy one this morning i had some good ideas respecting woodstock which will make the story better the devil of a difficulty is that one puzzles the skein in order to excite curiosity and then cannot disentangle it for the satisfaction of the prying fiend they have raised a letter from sir james mackintosh of condolence prettily expressed and which may be sung to the old tune of welcome welcome brother debtor a brother son of chivalry dismounted by mischance is sure to excite the compassion of one laid on the arena before him  yesterday i had an anecdote from old sir james steuart denham165 which is worth writing down his uncle lord elcho was as is well known engaged in the affair of 1745 he was dissatisfied with the conduct of matters from beginning to end but after the left wing of the highlanders was repulsed and broken at culloden elcho rode up to the chevalier and told him all was lost and that nothing remained except to charge at the head of two thousand men who were still unbroken and either turn the fate of the day or die sword in hand as became his pretensions the chevalier gave him some evasive answer and turning his horses head rode off the field lord elcho called after him i write the very words there you go for a damned cowardly italian and never would see him again though he lost his property and remained an exile in the cause lord elcho left two copies of his memoirs one with sir james steuarts family one with lord wemyss this is better evidence than the romance of chevalier johnstone and i have little doubt it is true yet it is no proof of the princes cowardice though it shows him to have been no john of gaunt princes are constantly surrounded with people who hold up their own life and safety to them as by far the most important stake in any contest and this is a doctrine in which conviction is easily received such an eminent person finds everybodys advice save here and there that of a desperate elcho recommend obedience to the natural instinct of selfpreservation which very often men of inferior situations find it difficult to combat when all the world are crying to them to get on and be damned instead of encouraging them to run away at prestonpans the chevalier offered to lead the van and he was with the second line which during that brief affair followed the first very close johnstones own account carefully read brings him within a pistolshot of the first line at the same time charles edward had not a head or heart for great things notwithstanding his daring adventure and the irish officers by whom he was guided were poor creatures lord george murray was the soul of the undertaking166  february 11court sat till halfpast one i had but a trifle to do so wrote letters to mrs maclean clephane and nephew walter sent the last £40 in addition to £240 sent on the 6th making his full equipment £280 a man calling himself charles gray of carse wrote to me expressing sympathy for my misfortunes and offering me half the profits of what if i understand him right is a patent medicine to which i suppose he expects me to stand trumpeter he endeavours to get over my objections to accepting his liberality supposing me to entertain them by assuring me his conduct is founded on a sage selfishness this is diverting enough i suppose the commissioners of police will next send me a letter of condolence begging my acceptance of a broom a shovel and a scavengers greatcoat and assuring me that they had appointed me to all the emoluments of a wellfrequented crossing it would be doing more than they have done of late for the cleanliness of the streets which witness my shoes are in a piteous pickle i thanked the selfish sage with due decorumfor what purpose can anger serve i remember once before a mad woman from about alnwick baited me with letters and plansfirst for charity to herself or some protégé i gave my guinea then she wanted to have half the profit of a novel which i was to publish under my name and auspices she sent me the manuscript and a moving tale it was for some of the scenes lay in the cabinet à leau i declined the partnership lastly my fair correspondent insisted i was a lover of speculation and would be much profited by going shares in a patent medicine which she had invented for the benefit of little babies i believe i dreaded to have anything to do with such a herodlike affair and begged to decline the honour of her correspondence in future i should have thought the thing a quiz but that the novel was real and substantial anne goes to ravelston today to remain tomorrow sir alexander don called and we had a good laugh together  february 12having ended the second volume of woodstock last night i have to begin the third this morning now i have not the slightest idea how the story is to be wound up to a catastrophe i am just in the same case as i used to be when i lost myself in former days in some country to which i was a stranger i always pushed for the pleasantest road and either found or made it the nearest it is the same in writing i never could lay down a planor having laid it down i never could adhere to it the action of composition always diluted some passages and abridged or omitted others and personages were rendered important or insignificant not according to their agency in the original conception of the plan but according to the success or otherwise with which i was able to bring them out i only tried to make that which i was actually writing diverting and interesting leaving the rest to fate i have been often amused with the critics distinguishing some passages as particularly laboured when the pen passed over the whole as fast as it could move and the eye never again saw them except in proof verse i write twice and sometimes three times over this may be called in spanish the dar donde diere mode of composition in english hab nab at a venture it is a perilous style i grant but i cannot help it when i chain my mind to ideas which are purely imaginativefor argument is a different thingit seems to me that the sun leaves the landscape that i think away the whole vivacity and spirit of my original conception and that the results are cold tame and spiritless it is the difference between a written oration and one bursting from the unpremeditated exertions of the speaker which have always something the air of enthusiasm and inspiration i would not have young authors imitate my carelessness however consilium non currum eape  read a few pages of will davenant who was fond of having it supposed that shakespeare intrigued with his mother i think the pretension can only be treated as phaetons was according to fieldings farce      besides by all the village boys im shamed     you the suns son you rascalyou be damnd  egadill put that into woodstock167 it might come well from the old admirer of shakespeare then fieldings lines were not written what thenit is an anachronism for some sly rogue to detect besides it is easy to swear they were written and that fielding adopted them from tradition walked with skene on the calton hill  february 13the institution for the encouragment of the fine arts opens today with a handsome entertainment in the exhibitionroom as at somerset house it strikes me that the direction given by amateurs and professors to their protégés and pupils who aspire to be artists is upon a pedantic and false principle all the fine arts have it for their highest and more legitimate end and purpose to affect the human passions or smooth and alleviate for a time the more unquiet feelings of the mindto excite wonder or terror or pleasure or emotion of some kind or other it often happens that in the very rise and origin of these arts as in the instance of homer the principal object is obtained in a degree not equalled by his successors but there is a degree of execution which in more refined times the poet or musician begins to study which gives a value of its own to their productions of a different kind from the rude strength of their predecessors poetry becomes complicated in its rulesmusic learned in its cadences and harmoniesrhetoric subtle in its periods there is more given to the labour of executingless attained by the effect produced still the nobler and popular end of these arts is not forgotten and if we have some productions too learned too recherchés for public feeling we have every now and then music that electrifies a whole assembly eloquence which shakes the forum and poetry which carries men up to the third heaven but in painting it is different it is all become a mystery the secret of which is lodged in a few connoisseurs whose object is not to praise the works of such painters as produce effect on mankind at large but to class them according to their proficiency in the inferior rules of the art which though most necessary to be taught and learned should yet only be considered as the gradus ad parnassumthe steps by which the higher and ultimate object of a great popular effect is to be attained they have all embraced the very style of criticism which induced michael angelo to call some pope a poor creature when turning his attention from the general effect of a noble statue his holiness began to criticise the hem of the robe this seems to me the cause of the decay of this delightful art especially in history its noblest branch as i speak to myself i may say that a painting should to be excellent have something to say to the mind of a man like myself welleducated and susceptible of those feelings which anything strongly recalling natural emotion is likely to inspire but how seldom do i see anything that moves me much wilkie the far more than teniers of scotland certainly gave many new ideas so does will allan though overwhelmed with their rebukes about colouring and grouping against which they are not willing to place his general and original merits landseers dogs were the most magnificent things i ever sawleaping and bounding and grinning on the canvas leslie has great powers and the scenes from moliere by newton are excellent yet painting wants a regeneratorsome one who will sweep the cobwebs out of his head before he takes the palette as chantrey has done in the sister art at present we are painting pictures from the ancients as authors in the days of louis quatorze wrote epic poems according to the recipe of madame dacier and co the poor reader or spectator has no remedy the compositions are secundum artem and if he does not like them he is no judgethats all  february 14i had a call from glengarry168 yesterday as kind and friendly as usual this gentleman is a kind of quixote in our age having retained in their full extent the whole feelings of clanship and chieftainship elsewhere so long abandoned he seems to have lived a century too late and to exist in a state of complete law and order like a glengarry of old whose will was law to his sept warmhearted generous friendly he is beloved by those who know him and his efforts are unceasing to show kindness to those of his clan who are disposed fully to admit his pretensions to dispute them is to incur his resentment which has sometimes broken out in acts of violence which have brought him into collision with the law to me he is a treasure as being full of information as to the history of his own clan and the manners and customs of the highlanders in general strong active and muscular he follows the chase of the deer for days and nights together sleeping in his plaid when darkness overtakes him in the forest he was fortunate in marrying a daughter of sir william forbes who by yielding to his peculiar ideas in general possesses much deserved influence with him the number of his singular exploits would fill a volume169 for as his pretensions are high and not always willingly yielded to he is every now and then giving rise to some rumour he is on many of these occasions as much sinned against as sinning for men knowing his temper sometimes provoke him conscious that glengarry from his character for violence will always be put in the wrong by the public i have seen him behave in a very manly manner when thus tempted he has of late prosecuted a quarrel ridiculous enough in the present day to have himself admitted and recognised as chief of the whole clan ranald or surname of macdonald the truth seems to be that the present clanranald is not descended from a legitimate chieftain of the tribe for having accomplished a revolution in the sixteenth century they adopted a tanist or captainthat is a chief not in the direct line of succession a certain ian moidart or john of moidart who took the title of captain of clanranald with all the powers of chief and even glengarrys ancestor recognised them as chiefs de facto if not de jure the fact is that this elective power was in cases of insanity imbecility or the like exercised by the celtic tribes and though ian moidart was no chief by birth yet by election he became so and transmitted his power to his descendants as would king william iii if he had had any so it is absurd to set up the jus sanguinis now which glengarrys ancestors did not or could not make good when it was a right worth combating for i wrought out my full task yesterday  saw cadell as i returned from the court he seems dejected apprehensive of another trustee being preferred to cowan and gloomy about the extent of stock of novels etc on hand he infected me with his want of spirits and i almost wish my wife had not asked mr scrope and charles k sharpe for this day but the former sent such loads of game that lady scotts gratitude became ungovernable i have not seen a creature at dinner since the direful 17th january except my own family and mr laidlaw the love of solitude increases by indulgence i hope it will not diverge into misanthropy it does not mend the matter that this is the first day that a ticket for sale is on my house poor no 39170 one gets accustomed even to stone walls and the place suited me very well all our furniture too is to goa hundred little articles that seemed to me connected with all the happier years of my life it is a sorry business but sursum corda  my two friends came as expected also missie and stayed till halfpast ten promised sharpe the set of piranesis views in the diningparlour they belonged to my uncle so i do not like to sell them171  february 15yesterday i did not write a line of woodstock partly i was a little out of spirits though that would not have hindered partly i wanted to wait for some new ideasa sort of collecting of straw to make bricks of partly i was a little too far beyond the press i cannot pull well in long traces when the draught is too far behind me i love to have the press thumping clattering and banging in my rear it creates the necessity which almost always makes me work best needs must when the devil drivesand drive he does even according to the letter i must work today however attended a meeting of the faculty about our new library i spokesaying that i hoped we would now at length act upon a general plan and look forward to commencing upon such a scale as would secure us at least for a century against the petty and partial management which we have hitherto thought sufficient of fitting up one room after another disconnected and distant these have been costing large sums of money from time to time all now thrown away we are now to have space enough for a very large range of buildings which we may execute in a simple taste leaving government to ornament them if they shall think properotherwise to be plain modest and handsome and capable of being executed by degrees and in such portions as convenience may admit of  poor james hogg the ettrick shepherd came to advise with me about his affairshe is sinking under the times having no assistance to give him my advice i fear will be of little service i am sorry for him if that would help him especially as by his own account a couple of hundred pounds would carry him on  february 16misfortunes gowling bark172 comes louder and louder by assigning my whole property to trustees for behoof of creditors with two works in progress and nigh publication and with all my future literary labours i conceived i was bringing into the field a large fund of payment which could not exist without my exertions and that thus far i was entitled to a corresponding degree of indulgence i therefore supposed on selling this house and various other property and on receiving the price of woodstock and napoleon that they would give me leisure to make other exertions and be content with the rents of abbotsford without attempting a sale this would have been the more reasonable as the very printing of these works must amount to a large sum of which they will reap the profits in the course of this delay i supposed i was to have the chance of getting some insight both into constables affairs and those of hurst and robinson nay employing these houses under precautions to sell the works the publishers profit would have come in to pay part of their debts but gibson last night came in after dinner and gave me to understand that the bank of scotland see this in a different point of view and consider my contribution of the produce of past present and future labours as compensated in full by their accepting of the trustdeed instead of pursuing the mode of sequestration and placing me in the gazette they therefore expected the trustees instantly to commence a lawsuit to reduce the marriage settlement which settles the estate upon walter thus loading me with a most expensive suit and i suppose selling library and whatever they can lay hold on  now this seems unequal measure and would besides of itself totally destroy any power of fancy or genius if it deserves the name which may remain to me a man cannot write in the house of correction and this species of peine forte et dure which is threatened would render it impossible for one to help himself or others so i told gibson i had my mind made up as far back as the 24th of january not to suffer myself to be harder pressed than law would press me if this great commercial company through whose hands i have directed so many thousands think they are right in taking every advantage and giving none it must be my care to see that they take none but what law gives them if they take the sword of the law i must lay hold of the shield if they are determined to consider me as an irretrievable bankrupt they have no title to object to my settling upon the usual terms which the statute requires they probably are of opinion that i will be ashamed to do this by applying publicly for a sequestration now my feelings are different i am ashamed to owe debts i cannot pay but i am not ashamed of being classed with those to whose rank i belong the disgrace is in being an actual bankrupt not in being made a legal one i had like to have been too hasty in this matter i must have a clear understanding that i am to be benefited or indulged in some way if i bring in two such funds as those works in progress worth certainly from £10000 to £15000  clerk came in last night and drank wine and water  slept ill and bilious in the morning nbi smoked a cigar the first for this present year yesterday evening  february 17slept sound for nature repays herself for the vexation the mind sometimes gives her this morning put interlocutors on several sheriffcourt processes from selkirkshire gibson came tonight to say that he had spoken at full length with alexander monypenny proposed as trustee on the part of the bank of scotland and found him decidedly in favour of the most moderate measures and taking burthen on himself for the bank of scotland proceeding with such lenity as might enable me to have some time and opportunity to clear these affairs out i repose trust in mr m entirely his father old colonel monypenny was my early friend kind and hospitable to me when i was a mere boy he had much of old withers about him as expressed in popes epitaph      o youth in arms approved     o soft humanity in age beloved173  his son david and a younger brother frank a soldier who perished by drowning on a boating party from gibraltar were my schoolfellows and with the survivor now lord pitmilly174 i have always kept up a friendly intercourse of this gentleman on whom my fortunes are to depend i know little he was colin mackenzies partner in business while my friend pursued it and he speaks highly of him thats a great deal he is secretary to the pitt club and we have had all our lives the habit idem sentire de republica thats much too lastly he is a man of perfect honour and reputation and i have nothing to ask which such a man would not either grant or convince me was unreasonable i have to be sure some of my constitutional and hereditary obstinacy but it is in me a dormant quality convince my understanding and i am perfectly docile stir my passions by coldness or affronts and the devil would not drive me from my purpose let me record i have striven against this besetting sin when i was a boy and on foot expeditions as we had many no creature could be so indifferent which way our course was directed and i acquiesced in what any one proposed but if i was once driven to make a choice and felt piqued in honour to maintain my proposition i have broken off from the whole party rather than yield to any one time has sobered this pertinacity of mind but it still exists and i must be on my guard against it  it is the same with me in politics in general i care very little about the matter and from years end to years end have scarce a thought connected with them except to laugh at the fools who think to make themselves great men out of little by swaggering in the rear of a party but either actually important events or such as seemed so by their close neighbourhood to me have always hurried me off my feet and made me as i have sometimes afterwards regretted more forward and more violent than those who had a regular jogtrot way of busying themselves in public matters good luck for had i lived in troublesome times and chanced to be on the unhappy side i had been hanged to a certainty what i have always remarked has been that many who have hallooed me on at public meetings and so forth have quietly left me to the odium which a man known to the public always has more than his own share of while on the other hand they were easily successful in pressing before me who never pressed forward at all when there was any distribution of public favours or the like i am horribly tempted to interfere in this business of altering the system of banks in scotland and yet i know that if i can attract any notice i will offend my english friends without propitiating one man in scotland i will think of it till tomorrow it is making myself of too much importance after all  february 18i set about malachi malagrowthers letter on the late disposition to change everything in scotland to an english model but without resolving about the publication they do treat us very provokingly      o land of cakes said the northern bard       though all the world betrays thee     one faithful pen thy rights shall guard       one faithful harp shall praise thee175  called on the lord chief commissioner who understanding there was a hitch in our arrangements had kindly proposed to execute an arrangement for my relief i could not i think have thought of it at any rate but it is unnecessary  february 19finished my letter malachi malagrowther this morning and sent it to james b who is to call with the result this forenoon i am not very anxious to get on with woodstock i want to see what constables people mean to do when they have their trustee for an unfinished work they must treat with the author it is the old story of the varnish spread over the picture which nothing but the artists own hand could remove a finished work might be seized under some legal pretence  being troubled with thickcoming fancies and a slight palpitation of the heart i have been reading the chronicle of the good knight messire jacques de lalaincurious but dull from the constant repetition of the same species of combats in the same style and phrase it is like washing bushels of sand for a grain of gold it passes the time however especially in that listless mood when your mind is half on your book half on something else you catch something to arrest the attention every now and then and what you miss is not worth going back upon idle mans studies in short still things occur to one something might be made out of the pass or fountain of tears176 a tale of chivalrytaken from the passages of arms which jacques de lalain maintained for the first day of every month for a twelvemonth177 the first mention perhaps of redhot balls appears in the siege of oudenarde by the citizens of ghent chronique p 293 this would be light summer work  jb came and sat an hour i led him to talk of woodstock and to say truth his approbation did me much good i am aware it maynay mustbe partial yet is he tom telltruth and totally unable to disguise his real feelings178 i think i make no habit of feeding on praise and despise those whom i see greedy for it as much as i should an underbred fellow who after eating a cherrytart proceeded to lick the plate but when one is flagging a little praise if it can be had genuine and unadulterated by flattery which is as difficult to come by as the genuine mountaindew is a cordial after all so nowvamos corazonlet us atone for the loss of the morning  february 20yesterday though late in beginning i nearly finished my task which is six of my close pages about thirty pages of print to a full and uninterrupted days work today i have already written four and with some confidence thus does flattery or praise oil the wheels it is but two oclock skene was here remonstrating against my taking apartments at the albyn club179 and recommending that i should rather stay with them180 i told him that was altogether impossible i hoped to visit them often but for taking a permanent residence i was altogether the country mouse and voted for      a hollow tree     a crust of bread and liberty181  the chain of friendship however bright does not stand the attrition of constant close contact  february 21corrected the proofs of malachi182 this morning it may fall dead and there will be a squib lost it may chance to light on some ingredients of national feeling and set folks beards in a blazeand so much the better if it does i mean better for scotlandnot a whit for me attended the hearing in parliament house till near four oclock so i shall do little tonight for i am tired and sleepy one person talking for a long time whether in pulpit or at the bar or anywhere else unless the interest be great and the eloquence of the highest character always sets me to sleep i impudently lean my head on my hand in the court and take my nap without shame the lords may keep awake and mind their own affairs quod supra nos nihil ad nos these clerks stools are certainly as easy seats as are in scotland those of the barons of exchequer always excepted  february 22paid lady scott her fortnights allowance £24  ballantyne breakfasted and is to negotiate about malachi with constable and blackwood it reads not amiss and if i can get a few guineas for it i shall not be ashamed to take them for paying lady scott i have just left between £3 and £4 for any necessary occasion and my salary does not become due until 20th march and the expense of removing etc is to be provided for      but shall we go mourn for that my dear       the cold moon shines by night     and when we wander here and there       we then do go most right183  the mere scarcity of money so that actual wants are provided is not povertyit is the bitter draft to owe money which we cannot pay laboured fairly at woodstock today but principally in revising and adding to malachi of which an edition as a pamphlet is anxiously desired i have lugged in my old friend cardrona184i hope it will not be thought unkindly the banks are anxious to have it published they were lately exercising lenity towards me and if i can benefit them it will be an instance of the kings errand lying in the cadgers gate  february 23corrected two sheets of woodstock this morning these are not the days of idleness the fact is that the not seeing company gives me a command of my time which i possessed at no other period in my life at least since i knew how to make some use of my leisure there is a great pleasure in sitting down to write with the consciousness that nothing will occur during the day to break the spell detained in the court till past three and came home just in time to escape a terrible squall i am a good deal jaded and will not work till after dinner there is a sort of drowsy vacillation of mind attends fatigue with me i can command my pen as the school copy recommends but cannot equally command my thought and often write one word for another read a little volume called the omen185very well writtendeep and powerful language aut erasmus aut diabolus it is lockhart or i am strangely deceived it is passed for wilsons though but wilson has more of the falsetto of assumed sentiment less of the depth of gloomy and powerful feeling  february 24went down to printingoffice after the court and corrected malachi jbs name is to be on the imprint so he will subscribe the book he reproaches me with having taken much more pains on this temporary pamphlet than on works which have a greater interest on my fortunes i have certainly bestowed enough of revision and correction but the cases are different in a novel or poem i run the course alonehere i am taking up the cudgels and may expect a drubbing in return besides i do feel that this is public matter in which the country is deeply interested and therefore is far more important than anything referring to my fame or fortune alone the pamphlet will soon be outmeantime malachi prospers and excites much attention186 the banks have bespoke 500 copies the country is taking the alarm and i think the ministers will not dare to press the measure i should rejoice to see the old red lion ramp a little and the thistle again claim its nemo me impune i do believe scotsmen will show themselves unanimous at least where their cash is concerned they shall not want backing i incline to cry with biron in loves labours lost      more atés more atés stir them on  i suppose all imaginative people feel more or less of excitation from a scene of insurrection or tumult or of general expression of national feeling when i was a lad poor davie douglas187 used to accuse me of being cupidus novarum rerum and say that i loved the stimulus of a broil it might be so then and even still      even in our ashes glow their wonted fires188  whimsical enough that when i was trying to animate scotland against the currency bill john gibson brought me the deed of trust assigning my whole estate to be subscribed by me so that i am turning patriot and taking charge of the affairs of the country on the very day i was proclaiming myself incapable of managing my own what of that the eminent politician quidnunc189 was in the same condition who would think of their own trumpery debts when they are taking the support of the whole system of scottish banking on their shoulders odd enough tooon this day for the first time since the awful 17th january we entertain at dinnerlady anna maria elliot190 w clerk john a murray191 and thomas thomson192 as if we gave a dinner on account of my cessio fori  february 25our party yesterday went off very gaily much laugh and fun and i think i enjoyed it more from the rarity of the eventi mean from having seen society at home so seldom of late my head aches slightly though yet we were but a bottle of champagne one of port one of old sherry and two of claret among four gentlemen and three ladies i have been led from this incident to think of taking chambers near clerk in rose court193 methinks the retired situation should suit me well there a man and woman would be my whole establishment my superfluous furniture might serve and i could ask a friend or two to dinner as i have been accustomed to do i will look at the place today  i must set now to a second epistle of malachi to the athenians if i can but get the sulky scottish spirit set up the devil wont turn them      cock up your beaver and cock it fu sprush     well over the border and give them a brush     theres somebody there well teach better behaviour     hey johnnie lad cock up your beaver194  february 26spent the morning and till dinner on malachis second epistle to the athenians it is difficult to steer betwixt the natural impulse of ones national feelings setting in one direction and the prudent regard to the interests of the empire and its internal peace and quiet recommending less vehement expression i will endeavour to keep sight of both but were my own interests alone concerned dn me but i would give it them hot had some valuable communications from colin mackenzie and lord medwyn which will supply my plentiful lack of facts  received an anonymous satire in doggrel which having read the first verse and last i committed to the flames peter murray son of the clever lord elibank called and sat halfanhouran old friend and who from the peculiarity and originality of his genius is one of the most entertaining companions i have ever known195 but i must finish malachi  february 27malachi is getting on i must finish him tonight i dare say some of my london friends will be displeasedcanning perhaps for he is engoué of huskisson cant help it  the place i looked at wont do but i really must get some lodging for reason or none dalgleish196 will not leave me and cries and makes a scene now if i stayed alone in a little set of chambers he would serve greatly for my accommodation there are some nice places of the kind in the new buildings but they are distant from the court and i cannot walk well on the pavement it is odd enough that just when i had made a resolution to use my coach frequently i ceased to keep onein town at least  february 28completed malachi today it is more serious than the first

is no such passage in the odyssey but he suggests that what scott had in his mind was merely the greek idea of a waking vision being a true one they spoke of it as a ὕπαρ opposed to an ὄναρ a mere dream these waking visions are usually said to be seen towards morning  in the odyssey there are two such visions which turn out to be realitiesthat of nausicaa bk vi 20 etc and that of penelope bk xix 535 etc in the former case we are told that the vision occurred just before dawn i 4849 αὐτίκα δ Ἠὼςἦλθεν straightway came the dawn etc in the latter there is no special mention of the hour the

telltruth had a somewhat delicate task to perform  the lord of the isles was by far the least popular of the series and mr scott was very prompt at making such discoveries in about a week after its publication he took me into his library and asked me what the people were saying about the lord of the isles i hesitated much in the same manner that gil blas might be supposed to do when a similar question was put by the archbishop of grenada but he very speedily brought the matter to a pointcome speak out my good fellow what has put it in your head to be on ceremony with me but the result is in one worddisappointment my silence admitted his inference to its fullest extent his countenance certainly did look rather blank for a few seconds for it is a singular fact that before the public or rather the booksellers gave their decision he no more knew whether he had written well or ill than whether a die which he threw out of a box was to turn out a sise or an ace however he almost instantly resumed his spirits and expressed his wonder rather that his popularity had lasted so long than that it should have given way at last at length with a perfectly cheerful manner he said well well james but you know we must not droopfor you know we cant and wont give overwe must just try something else and the question is what its to be nor was it any wonder he spoke thus for he could not fail to be unconsciously conscious if i dare use such a term of his own gigantic and as yet undeveloped powers and was somewhat under forty years old i am by no means sure whether he then alluded to waverley as if he had mentioned it to me for the first time for my memory has greatly failed me touching this or whether he alluded to it as in fact appears to have been the case as having been commenced and laid aside several years before but i well recollect that he consulted me with his usual openness and candour respecting his probability of succeeding as a novelist and i confess my expectations were not very sanguine he saw this and said well i dont see why i should not succeed as well as other people come faint heart never won fair ladylet us try i remember when the work was put into my hands i could not get myself to think much of the waverley honour scenes but to my shame be it spoken when he had reached the exquisite scenes of scottish manners at tullyveolan i thought them and pronounced them vulgar when the success of the book so utterly knocked me down as a man of taste all that the goodnatured author observed was well i really thought you might be wrong about the scotch why burns had already attracted universal attention to all about scotland and i confess i could not see why i should not be able to keep the flame alive merely because i wrote in prose in

consigned with indifference to the chance of an auction things that have had their day of importance with me i cannot forget though the merest trifles but i am glad that she with bad health and enough to vex her has not the same useless mode of associating recollections with this unpleasant business the best part of it is the necessity of leaving behind viz setting rid of a set of most wretched daubs of landscapes in great gilded frames of which i have often been heartily ashamed the history of them was curious an amateur artist a lady happened to fall into misfortunes upon which her landscapes the character of which had been buoyed up far beyond their proper level sank even beneath it and it was low enough one most amiable and accomplished old lady continued to encourage her pencil and to order picture after picture which she sent in presents to her friends i suppose i have eight or ten of them which i could not avoid accepting there will be plenty of laughing when they come to be sold it would be a good joke enough to cause it to be circulated that they were performances of my own in early youth and they would be looked on and bought up as curiosities true it is that i took lessons of oilpainting in youth from a little jew animalcule a smouch called burrell a clever sensible creature though but i could make no progress either in painting or drawing nature denied me correctness of eye and neatness of hand yet i was very desirous to be a draughtsman at least and laboured harder to attain that point than at any other in my recollection to which i did not make some approaches my oilpaintings were to miss  above commemorated what hers are to claude lorraine yet burrell was not useless to me altogether neither he was a prussian and i got from him many a long story of the battles of frederic in whose armies his father had been a commissary or perhaps a spy i remember his picturesque account of seeing a party of the black hussars bringing in some forage carts which they had taken from a body of the cossacks whom he described as lying on the top of the carts of hay mortally wounded and like the dying gladiator eyeing their own blood as it ran down through the straw i afterwards took lessons from walker whom we used to call bluebeard he was one of the most conceited persons in the world but a good teacherone of the ugliest countenances he had tooenough as we say to spean weans199 the man was always extremely precise in the quality of everything about him his dress accommodations and everything else he became insolvent poor man and for some reason or other i attended the meeting of those concerned in his affairs instead of ordinary accommodations for writing each of the persons present was equipped with a large sheet of drawing

may say it is too strong but from the true men of scotland you are sure of the warmest gratitude i never have yet found nor do i expect it on this occasion that illwill dies in debt or what is called gratitude distresses herself by frequent payments the one is like a wardholding and pays its reddendo in hard blows the other a blanchtenure and is discharged for payment of a red rose or a peppercorn he that takes the forlorn hope in an attack is often deserted by those that should support him and who generally throw the blame of their own cowardice upon his rashness we shall see this will end in

get the last sheets of malachi second epistle last night so they must go out to the world uncorrecteda great loss for the last touches are always most effectual and i expect misprints in the additional matter we were especially obliged to have it out this morning that it may operate as a gentle preparative for the meeting of inhabitants at two oclock vogue la galèrewe shall see if scotsmen have any pluck left if not they may kill the next percy themselves it is ridiculous enough for me in a state of insolvency for the present to be battling about gold and paper currency it is something like the humorous touch in hogarths distressed poet where the poor starveling of the muses is engaged when in the abyss of poverty in writing an essay on payment of the national debt and his wall is adorned with a plan of the mines of peru nevertheless even these fugitive attempts from the success which they have had and the noise they are making serve to show the truth of the old proverb      when house and land are gone and spent     then learning is most excellent  on the whole i am glad of this brulzie as far as i am concerned people will not dare talk of me as an object of pityno

sae loud rang ilka hill204  this sounds conceited enough yet is not far from truth  the meeting was very numerous 500 or 600 at least and unanimous save in one mr howden who having been all his life as i am told in bitter opposition to ministers proposed on the present occasion that the whole contested measure should be trusted to their wisdom i suppose he chose the opportunity of placing his own opinion in opposition single opposition too to that of a large assembly the speaking was very moderate report had said that jeffrey ja murray and other sages of the economical school were to unbuckle their mails and give us their opinions but no such great guns appeared if they had having the multitude on my side i would have tried to break a lance with them a few short but wellexpressed resolutions were adopted unanimously these were proposed by lord rollo and seconded by sir james fergusson bart i was named one of a committee to encourage all sorts of opposition to the measure so i have already broken through two good and wise resolutionsone that i would not write on political controversy another that i would not be named on public committees if my good resolves go this way like snaw aff a dykethe lord help me  march 4last night i had a letter from lockhart who speaking of malachi says the ministers are sore beyond imagination at present and some of them i hear have felt this new whip on the raw to some purpose i conclude he means canning is offended i cant help it as i said beforefiat justitia ruat coelum no cause in which i had the slightest personal interest should have made me use my pen gainst them blunt or pointed as it may be but as they are about to throw this country into distress and danger by a measure of useless and uncalledfor experiment they must hear the opinion of the scotsmen to whom it is of no other consequence than as a general measure affecting the country at largeand mine they shall hear i had determined to lay down the pen but now they shall have another of malachi beginning with buffoonery and ending as seriously as i can write it it is like a frenzy that they will agitate the upper and middling classes of society so very friendly to them with unnecessary and hazardous projects      oh thus it was they loved them dear       and sought how to requite em     and having no friends left but they       they did resolve to fight them  the country is very high just now england may carry the measure if she will doubtless but what will be the consequence of the distress ensuing god only can foretell  lockhart moreover inquires about my affairs anxiously and asks what he is to say about them says he has inquiries every day kind most kind all and among the most interested and anxious sir william knighton205 who told me the king was quite melancholy all the evening he heard of it this i can well believe for the king educated as a prince has nevertheless as true and kind a heart as any subject in his dominions he goes on i do think they would give you a barons gown as soon as possible etc i have written to him in answer showing i have enough to carry me on and can dedicate my literary efforts to clear my land the preferment would suit me well and the late duke of buccleuch gave me his interest for it i dare say the young duke would do the same for the unvaried love i have borne his house and by and by he will have a voice potential but there is sir william rae in the meantime whose prevailing claim i would never place my own in opposition to even were it possible by a tour de force such as l points at to set it aside meantime i am building a barrier betwixt me and promotion any prospect of the kind is very distant and very uncertain come time come rath as the german says  in the meanwhile now i am not pulled about for money etc methinks i am happier without my wealth than with it everything is paid i have no one wishing to make up a sum of money and writing for his account to be paid since 17th january i have not laid out a guinea out of my own hand save two or three in charity and six shillings for a pocketbook but the cash with which i set out having run short for family expenses i drew on blackwood through ballantyne which was honoured for £25 to account of malachis letters of which another edition of 1000 is ordered and gave it to lady scott because our removal will require that in hand this is for a fortnight succeeding wednesday next being the 8th march current on the 20th my quarter comes in and though i have something to pay out of it i shall be on velvet for expenseand regular i will be methinks all trifling objects of expenditure seem to grow light in my eyes that i may regain independence i must be saving but ambition awakes as love of quiet indulgence dies and is mortified within me dark cuthullin will be renowned or dead206  march 5something of toddy and cigar in that last quotation i think yet i only smoked two and liquified with one glass of spirits and water i have sworn i will not blot out what i have once written here  malachi goes on but i am dubious about the commencementit must be mended at leastreads prosy  had letters from walter and jane the dears all well regiment about to move from dublin  march 6finished third malachi which i dont much like it respects the difficulty of finding gold to replace the paper circulation now this should have been considered first the admitting that the measure may be imposed is yielding up the question and malachi is like a commandant who should begin to fire from interior defences before his outworks were carried if ballantyne be of my own opinion i will suppress it we are all in a bustle shifting things to abbotsford i believe we shall stay here till the beginning of next week it is odd but i dont feel the impatience for the country which i have usually experienced  march 7detained in the court till three by a hearing then to the committee appointed at the meeting on friday to look after the smallnote business a pack of old fainéants incapable of managing such a business and who will lose the day from mere coldness of heart there are about a thousand names at the petition they have added no designationsa great blunder for testimonia sunt ponderanda non numeranda should never be lost sight of they are disconcerted and helpless just as in the business of the kings visit when everybody threw the weight on me for which i suffered much in my immediate labour and after bad health it brought on a violent eruption on my skin which saved me from a fever at the time but has been troublesome more or less ever since i was so disgusted with seeing them sitting in ineffectual helplessness spitting on the hot iron that lay before them and touching it with a timid finger as if afraid of being scalded that at another time i might have dashed in and taken up the hammer summoned the deacons and other heads of public bodies and by consulting them have carried them with me but i cannot waste my time health and spirits in fighting thankless battles i left them in a quarter of an hour and presage unless the country make an alarm the cause is lost the philosophical reviewers manage their affairs betterhold offavoid committing themselves but throw their vis inertiæ into the opposite scale and neutralise the feelings which they cannot combat to force them to fight on disadvantageous ground is our policy but we have more sneakers after ministerial favour than men who love their country and who upon a liberal scale would serve their party for to force the whigs to avow an unpopular doctrine in popular assemblies or to wrench the government of such bodies from them would be a coup de maître but they are alike destitute of manly resolution and sound policy dn the whole nest of them i have corrected the last of malachi and let the thing take its chance i have made enemies enough and indisposed enough of friends  march 8at the court though a teind day a foolish thing happened while the court were engaged with the teinds i amused myself with writing on a sheet of paper notes on frederick maitlands account of the capture of bonaparte and i have lost these notesshuffled in perhaps among my own papers or those of the teind clerks what a curious document to be found in a process of valuation  being jaded and sleepy i took up le due de guise on naples207 i think this with the old memoires on the same subject which i have at abbotsford would enable me to make a pretty essay for the quarterly we must take up woodstock now in good earnest mr cowan a good and able man is chosen trustee in constables affairs with full power from what i hear the poor man is not sensible of the nature of his own situation for myself i have succeeded in putting the matters perfectly out of my mind since i cannot help them and have arrived at a floccipaucinihilipilification of money and i thank shenstone for inventing that long word208 they are removing the wine etc to the carts and you will judge if our flitting is not making a noise in the worldor in the street at least  march 9i foresaw justly      when first i set this dangerous stone arolling     twould fall upon myself209  sir robert dundas today put into my hands a letter of between thirty and forty pages in angry and bitter reprobation of malachi full of general averments and very untenable arguments all written at me by name but of which i am to have no copy and which is to be shown to me in extenso and circulated to other special friends to whom it may be necessary to give the sign to hate210 i got it at two oclock and returned it with an answer four hours afterwards in which i have studied not to be tempted into either sarcastic or harsh expressions211 a quarrel it is however in all the forms between my old friend and myself and his lordships reprimand is to be read out in order to all our friends they all know what i have said is true but that will be nothing to the purpose if they are desired to consider it as false as for lord melville i do not wonder that he is angry though he has little reason for he our watchman stented has from time to time suffered all manner of tampering to go on under his nose with the institutions and habits of scotland as for myself i was quite prepared for my share of displeasure it is very curious that i should have foreseen all this so distinctly as far back as 17th february nobody at least can plague me for interest with lord melville as they used to do by the way from the tone of his letter i think his lordship will give up the measure and i will be the peaceoffering all will agree to condemn me as too warmtoo rashand get rich on privileges which they would not have been able to save but for a little rousing of spirit which will not perhaps fall asleep again212 a gentleman called on the part of a captain rutherford to make inquiry about the border rutherfords not being very cleever as john fraser used to say at these pedigree matters referred him to mrs dr russell and robt rutherford the noble captain conceits he has some title to the honours of lord rutherford very oddwhen there is a vacant or dormant title in a scottish family or name everybody and all connected with the clan conceive they have quodam modo a right to it not being engrossed by any individual it communicates part of its lustre to every individual in the tribe as if it remained in common stock for that purpose  march 10i am not made entirely in the same mould of passions like other people many men would deeply regret a breach with so old a friend as lord melville and many men would be in despair at losing the good graces of a minister of state for scotland and all pretty visions about what might be done for myself and my sons especially charles but i think my good lord doth ill to be angry like the patriarch of old and i have in my odd sans souciance character a good handful of meal from the grist of the jolly miller who                        once     dwelled on the river dee     i care for nobody no not i     since nobody cares for me  breakfasted with me mr franks a young irishman from dublin who brought letters from walter and captain longmore of the royal staff he has written a book of poetry tales of chivalry and romance far from bad yet wants spirit he talks of publishing his recollections in the peninsula which must be interesting for he has i think sense and reflection  sandie young213 came in at breakfasttime with a monsieur brocque of montpelier  saw sir robert dundas at court who condemns lord melville and says he will not show his letter to any one in fact it would be exactly placarding me in a private and confidential manner he is to send my letter to lord melville colin mackenzie concurs in thinking lord melville quite wrong he must cool in the skin he het in  on coming home from the court a good deal fatigued i took a nap in my easychair then packed my books and committed the refuse to jock stevenson      left not a limb on which a dane could triumph  gave mr gibson my fathers cabinet which suits a man of business well gave jock stevenson the picture of my old favourite dog camp mentioned in one of the introductions to marmion and a little crowquill drawing of melrose abbey by nelson whom i used to call the admiral poor fellow he had some ingenuity and was in a moderate way a good penman and draughtsman he left his situation of amanuensis to go into lord homes militia regiment but his dissipated habits got the better of a strong constitution and he fell into bad ways and poverty and died i believe in the hospital at liverpool strange enough that henry weber who acted afterwards as my amanuensis for many years had also a melancholy fate ultimately he was a man of very superior attainments an excellent linguist and geographer and a remarkable antiquary he published a collection of ancient romances superior i think to the elaborate ritson he also published an edition of beaumont and fletcher but too carelessly done to be reputable he was a violent jacobin which he thought he disguised from me while i who cared not a fig about the poor young mans politics used to amuse myself with teasing him he was an excellent and affectionate creature but unhappily was afflicted with partial insanity especially if he used strong liquors to which like others with that unhappy tendency he was occasionally addicted in 1814214 he became quite insane and at the risk of my life i had to disarm him of a pair of loaded pistols which i did by exerting the sort of authority which i believe gives an effectual control in such cases his friends who were respectable placed him in the york asylum where he pined away and died i think in 1814 or 1815215 my patronage in this way has not been lucky to the parties protected i hope poor george huntly gordon will escape the influence of the evil star he has no vice poor fellow but his total deafness makes him helpless  march 11this day the court rose after a long and laborious sederunt i employed the remainder of the day in completing a set of notes on captain maitlands manuscript narrative of the reception of napoleon bonaparte on board the bellerophon it had been previously in the hands of my friend basil hall who had made many excellent corrections in point of style but he had been hypercritical in wishing in so important a matter where everything depends on accuracy this expression to be altered for delicacys sakethat to be omitted for fear of giving offenceand that other to be abridged for fear of being tedious the plain sailors narrative for me written on the spot and bearing in its minuteness the evidence of its veracity  lord elgin sent me some time since a curious account of his imprisonment in france and the attempts which were made to draw him into some intrigue which might authorise treating him with rigour216 he called today and communicated some curious circumstances on the authority of fouché denon and others respecting bonaparte and the empress maria louise whom lord elgin had conversed with on the subject in italy his conduct towards her was something like that of ethwald to elburga in joanna baillies fine tragedy217 making her postpone her high rank by birth to the authority which he had acquired by his talents dinner was usually announced for a particular hour and napoleons business often made him late she was not permitted to sit down to table an etiquette which was reasonable enough but from the hour of dinner till the emperor appeared she was to be in the act of sitting down that is to say he was displeased if he found her engaged with a book with work or with anything else she was obliged to be in a state of absolute being about to sit down she seemed a good deal gênée by something of that kind though remembering with pride she had been empress it might almost be said of the world the rest for tomorrow  march 12resumed woodstock and wrote my task of six pages i was interrupted by a slumberous feeling which made me obliged to stop once or twice i shall soon have a remedy in the country which affords the pleasanter resource of a walk when such feelings come on i hope i am the reverse of the wellknown line sleepy myself to give my readers sleep i cannot gurnalise at any rate having wrought my eyes nearly out218  march 13wrote to the end of a chapter and knowing no more than the man in the moon what comes next i will put down a few of lord elgins remembrances and something may occur to me in the meanwhile when maria louise first saw bonaparte she was in the carriage with his representative general when she saw a horseman ride forward at the gallop passing and repassing the carriage in a manner which joined to the behaviour of her companion convinced her who it was especially as he endeavoured with a curiosity which would not have been tolerated in another to peep into the windows when she alighted at the inn at napoleon presented himself pulled her by the ear and kissed her forehead  bonapartes happiest days passed away when he dismissed from about him such men as talleyrand and fouché whose questions and objections compelled him to recur upon modify and render practicable the great plans which his ardent conception struck out at a heat when he had murat and such persons about him who marvelled and obeyed his schemes equally magnificent were not so well matured and ended in the projectors ruin  i have hinted in these notes that i am not entirely free from a sort of gloomy fits with a fluttering of the heart and depression of spirits just as if i knew not what was going to befall me i can sometimes resist this successfully but it is better to evade than to combat it the hangdog spirit may have originated in the confusion and chucking about of our old furniture the stripping of walls of pictures and rooms of ornaments the leaving a house we have so long called our home is altogether melancholy enough i am glad lady s does not mind it and yet i wonder too she insists on my remaining till wednesday not knowing what i suffer meanwhile to make my recusant spirit do penance i have set to work to clear away papers and pack them for my journey what a strange medley of thoughts such a task produces there lie letters which made the heart throb when received now lifeless and uninterestingas are perhaps their owners riddles which time has readschemes which he has destroyed or brought to maturitymemorials of friendships and enmities which are now alike faded thus does the ring of saturn consume itself today annihilates yesterday as the old tyrant swallowed his children and the snake its tail but i must say to my gurnal as poor byron did to moore damn it tom dont be poetical  memorandumi received some time since from mr riddoch of falkirk a sort of iron mallet said to have been found in the ruins of grames dike there it was reclaimed about three months since by the gentleman on whose lands it was found a doctorby a very polite letter from his man of business having unluckily mislaid his letter and being totally unable either to recollect the name of the proprietor or the professional gentleman i returned this day the piece of antiquity to mr riddoch who sent it to me wrote at the same time to tom grahame of airth mentioning what i had done touch my honour touch my lifethere is the spoon219  march 14jb called this morning to take leave and receive directions about proofs etc talks of the uproar about malachi but i am tired of malachithe humour is off and i have said what i wanted to say and put the people of scotland on their guard as well as ministers if they like to be warned they are gradually destroying what remains of nationality and making the country tabula rasa for doctrines of bold innovation their loosening and grinding down all those peculiarities which distinguished us as scotsmen will throw the country into a state in which it will be universally turned to democracy and instead of canny saunders they will have a very dangerous north british neighbourhood  some english lawyer expressed to lord elibank an opinion that at the union the english law should have been extended all over scotland i cannot say how that might have answered our purpose said lord patrick who was never nonsuited for want of an answer but it would scarce have suited yours since by this time the aberdeen advocates220 would have possessed themselves of all the business in westminster hall  what a detestable feeling this fluttering of the heart is i know it is nothing organic and that it is entirely nervous but the sickening effects of it are dispiriting to a degree is it the body brings it on the mind or the mind that inflicts it upon the body i cannot tell but it is a severe price to pay for the fata morgana with which fancy sometimes amuses men of warm imaginations as to body and mind i fancy i might as well inquire whether the fiddle or fiddlestick makes the tune in youth this complaint used to throw me into involuntary passions of causeless tears but i will drive it away in the country by exercise i wish i had been a mechanic a turninglathe or a chest of tools would have been a godsend for thought makes the access of melancholy rather worse than better i have it seldom thank god and i believe lightly in comparison of others  it was the fiddle after all was out of order not the fiddlestick the body not the mind i walked out met mrs skene who took a turn with me in princes street bade constable and cadell farewell and had a brisk walk home which enables me to face the desolation here with more spirit news from sophia she has had the luck to get an antidruggist in a dr gooch who prescribes care for johnnie instead of drugs and a little homebrewed ale instead of wine and like a liberal physician supplies the medicine he prescribes as for myself while i have scarce stirred to take exercise for four or five days no wonder i had the mulligrubs it is an awful sensation though and would have made an enthusiast of me had i indulged my imagination on devotional subjects i have been always careful to place my mind in the most tranquil posture which it can assume during my private exercises of devotion  i have amused myself occasionally very pleasantly during the last few days by reading over lady morgans novel of odonnel221 which has some striking and beautiful passages of situation and description and in the comic part is very rich and entertaining i do not remember being so much pleased with it at first there is a want of story always fatal to a book the first readingand it is well if it gets a chance of a second alas poor novel also read again and for the third time at least miss austens very finely written novel of pride and prejudice that young lady had a talent for describing the involvements and feelings and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful i ever met with the big bowwow strain i can do myself like any now going but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and the sentiment is denied to me what a pity such a gifted creature died so early222  march 15this morning i leave no 39 castle street for the last time the cabin was convenient and habit had made it agreeable to me i never reckoned upon a change in this particular so long as i held an office in the court of session in all my former changes of residence it was from good to better this is retrograding i leave this house for sale and i cease to be an edinburgh citizen in the sense of being a proprietor which my father and i have been for sixty years at least so farewell poor 39 and may you never harbour worse people than those who now leave you not to desert the lares all at once lady s and anne remain till sunday as for me i go as aforesaid this morning      ha til mi tulidh223  abbotsford 9 at nightthe naturally unpleasant feelings which influenced me in my ejectment for such it is virtually readily evaporated in the course of the journey though i had no pleasanter companions than mrs mackay the housekeeper and one of the maids and i have a shyness of disposition which looks like pride but it is not which makes me awkward in speaking to my household domestics with an outofdoors labourer or an old woman gathering sticks i can talk for ever i was welcomed here on my arrival by the tumult great of men and dogs all happy to see me one of my old labourers killed by the fall of a stone working at gattonside bridge old will straiton my man of wisdom and proverbs also dead he was entertaining from his importance and selfconceit but really a sensible old man when he heard of my misfortunes he went to bed and said he would not rise again and kept his word he was very infirm when i last saw him tom purdie in great glory being released from all farm duty and destined to attend the woods and be my special assistant the gardener bogie is to take care of what small farm we have left which little would make me give up entirely  march 16pleasant days make short journals and i have little to say today i wrote in the morning at woodstock walked from one till four was down at huntly burn and paid my respects to the ladies the spring seems promising and everything in great order visited will straitons widow who squeezed out among many tears a petition for a house i do not think i shall let her have one as she has a bad temper but i will help her otherwise she is greedy besides as was the defunct philosopher william in a year or two i shall have on the toft field a gallant show of extensive woodland sweeping over the hill and its boundaries carefully concealed in the evening after dinner read mrs charlotte smiths novel of desmond224decidedly the worst of her compositions  march 17sent off a packet to jb only three pages copy so must work hard for a day or two i wish i could wind up my bottom handsomelyan odd but accredited phrase the conclusion will be luminous we must try to make it dashing go spin you jade go spin have a good deal to do betweenhands in sorting up the newly arrived accession of books  i need not have exulted so soon in having attained ease and quiet i am robbed of both with a vengeance a letter from lockhart with one enclosed from sophia announces the medical people think the child is visibly losing strength that its walking becomes more difficult and in short that the spine seems visibly affected they recommend tepid baths in seawater so sophia has gone down to brighton leaving lockhart in town who is to visit her once a week here is my worst augury verified225 the bitterness of this probably impending calamity is extreme the child was almost too good for this world beautiful in features and though spoiled by every one having one of the sweetest tempers as well as the quickest intellect i ever saw a sense of humour quite extraordinary in a child and owing to the general notice which was taken of him a great deal more information than suited his years he was born in the eighth month and such children are never strongseldom longlived i look on this side and that and see nothing but protracted misery a crippled frame and decayed constitution occupying the attention of his parents for years and dying at the end of that period when their hearts were turned on him or the poor child may die before sophias confinement and that may again be a dangerous and bad affair or she may by increase of attention to him injure her own health in short to trace into how many branches such a misery may flow is impossible the poor dear love had so often a slow fever that when it pressed its little lips to mine i always foreboded to my own heart what all i fear are now aware of  lockhart writes me that croker is the author of the letters in the courier against malachi and that canning is to make another attack on me in the house of commons226 these things would make a man proud i will not answer because i must show up sir william rae and even lord melville and i have done enough to draw public attention which is all i want let them call me ungrateful unkind and all sorts of names so they keep their own fingers free of this most threatening measure it is very curious that each of these angry friendsmelville canning and crokerhas in former days appealed to me in confidence against each other  while i smoked my cigar after dinner my mind has been running into four threads of bitter fancies or rather into three decidedly bitter and one that is indifferent there is the distress incumbent on the country by these most untimely proceedings which i would stop with my life were that adequate to prevent them 2d there is the unpleasant feeling of seeing a number of valued friends pass from me that i cannot help 3d there is the gnawing misery about that sweet child and its parents 4th there is the necessity of pursuing my own labours for which perhaps i ought to be thankful since it always wrenches ones mind aside from what it must dwell on with pain it is odd that the state of excitation with me rather increases than abates the power of labour i must finish woodstock well if i can otherwise how the philistines will rejoice  march 18slept indifferently and under the influence of queen mab seldom auspicious to me dreamed of reading the tale of the prince of the black marble islands to little johnnie extended on a paralytic chair and yet telling all his pretty stories about hapapa as he calls me and chiefswoodand waked to think i should see the little darling no more or see him as a thing that had better never have existed oh misery misery that the best i can wish for him is early death with all the wretchedness to his parents that is like to ensue i intended to have stayed at home today but tom more wisely had resolved that i should walk and hung about the window with his axe and my own in his hand till i turned out with him and helped to cut some fine paling  march 19i have a most melancholy letter from anne lady s the faithful and true companion of my fortunes good and bad for so many years has but with difficulty been prevailed on to see dr abercrombie and his opinion is far from favourable her asthmatic complaints are fast terminating in hydropsy as i have long suspected yet the avowal of the truth and its probable consequences are overwhelming they are to stay a little longer in town to try the effects of a new medicine on wednesday they propose to return hithera new affliction where there was enough before yet her constitution is so good that if she will be guided by advice things may be yet ameliorated god grant it for really these misfortunes come too close upon each other  a letter from croker of a very friendly tone and tenor which i will answer accordingly not failing however to let him know that if i do not reply it is not for fear of his arguments or raillery far less from diffidence in my cause i hope and trust it will do good227  maxpopple228 and two of his boys arrived to take part of my poor dinner i fear the little fellows had little more than the needful but they had all i had to give them  i wrote a good deal today notwithstanding heavy thoughts  march 20despatched proofs and copy this morning and swanston the carpenter coming in i made a sort of busy idle day of it with altering and hanging pictures and prints to find room for those which came from edinburgh and by dint of being on foot from ten to near five put all things into applepie order what strange beings we are the serious duties i have on hand cannot divert my mind from the most melancholy thoughts and yet the talking with these workmen and the trifling occupation which they give me serves to dissipate my attention the truth is i fancy that a body under the impulse of violent motion cannot be stopped or forced back but may indirectly be urged into a different channel in the evening i read and sent off my sheriffcourt processes  i have a sort of grudging to give reasons why malachi does not reply to the answers which have been sent forth i dont knowi am strongly temptedbut i wont to drop the tone might seem mean and perhaps to maintain it would only exasperate the quarrel without producing any beneficial results and might be considered as a fresh insult by my alienated friends so on the whole i wont  the thing has certainly had more effect than it deserves and i suspect my ministerial friends if they love me less will not hold me cheaper for the fight i have made i am far from saying oderint dum emerint but there is a great difference betwixt that and being a mere protégé a poor brokendown man who was to be assisted when existing circumstances that most convenient of all apologies and happiest of all phrases would permit  march 21perused an attack on myself done with as much ability as truth by no less a man than joseph hume the nightwork man of the house of commons who lives upon petty abuses and is a very useful man by so doing he has had the kindness to say that i am interested in keeping up the taxes i wish i had anything else to do with them than to pay them but he lies and is an ass and not worth a mans thinking about joseph hume indeedi say joseph humand could add a swiftian rhyme but forbear  busy in unpacking and repacking i wrote five pages of woodstock which work begins      to appropinque an end229  march 22a letter from lord downshires man of business about funds supposed to belong to my wife or to the estate of my late brotherinlaw the possessor of the secret wants some reward if any is granted it should be a percentage on the net sum received with the condition no cureno pay i expect lady s and from annes last letter hope to find her better than the first anticipation led me to dread  sent off proofs and copy and shall indulge a little leisure today to collect my ideas and stretch my limbs i am again far before the press  march 23lady scott arrived yesterday to dinner she was better than i expected but anne poor soul looked very poorly and had been much worried with the fatigue and discomfort of the last week lady s takes the digitalis and as she thinks with advantage though the medicine makes her very sick yet on the whole things are better than my gloomy apprehensions had anticipated  i wrote to lockhart and to lord downshires agentg handley esq pentonville london  took a good brushing walk but not till i had done a good task  march 24sent off copy proofs etc jb clamorous for a motto  it is foolish to encourage people to expect mottoes and suchlike decoraments you have no credit for success in finding them and there is a disgrace in wanting them it is like being in the habit of showing feats of strength which you at length gain praise by accomplishing while some shame occurs in failure  march 25the end winds out well enough i have almost finished tonight indeed i might have done so had i been inclined but i had a walk in a hurricane of snow for two hours and feel a little tired miss margaret ferguson came to dinner with us230  march 26here is a disagreeable morning snowing and hailing with gleams of bright sunshine between and all the ground white and all the air frozen i dont like this jumbling of weather it is ungenial and gives chilblains besides with its whiteness and its coldness and its glister and its discomfort it resembles that most disagreeable of all things a vain cold empty beautiful woman who has neither mind nor heart but only features like a doll i do not know what is so like this disagreeable day when the sun is so bright and yet so uninfluential that      one may gaze upon its beams     till he is starved with cold  no matter it will serve as well as another day to finish woodstock walked out to the lake and coquetted with this disagreeable weather whereby i catch chilblains in my fingers and cold in my head fed the swans  finished woodstock however cum tota sequela of titlepage introduction etc and so as dame fortune says in quevedo      go wheel and may the devil drive thee231   march 27another bright cold day i answered two modest requests from widow ladies one whom i had already assisted in some law business on the footing of her having visited my mother requested me to write to mr peel saying on her authority that her second son a youth of infinite merit and accomplishment was fit for any situation in a public office and that i requested he might be provided accordingly another widowed dame whose claim is having read marmion and the lady of the lake besides a promise to read all my other worksgad it is a rash engagementdemands that i shall either pay £200 to get her cub into some place or other or settle him in a seminary of education really this is very much after the fashion of the husbandman of miguel turras requests of sancho when governor232 have you anything else to ask honest man quoth sancho but what are the demands of an honest man to those of an honest woman and she a widow to boot i do believe your destitute widow especially if she hath a charge of children and one or two fit for patronage is one of the most impudent animals living  went to galashiels and settled the dispute about sandies wall  march 28we have now been in solitude for some timemyself nearly totally so excepting at meals or on a call as yesterday from henry and william scott of harden one is tempted to ask himself knocking at the door of his own heart do you love this extreme loneliness i can answer conscientiously i do the love of solitude was with me a passion of early youth when in my teens i used to fly from company to indulge in visions and airy castles of my own the disposal of ideal wealth and the exercise of imaginary power this feeling prevailed even till i was eighteen when love and ambition awakening with other passions threw me more into society from which i have however at times withdrawn myself and have been always even glad to do so i have risen from a feast satiated and unless it be one or two persons of very strong intellect or whose spirits and goodhumour amuse me i wish neither to see the high the low nor the middling class of society this is a feeling without the least tinge of misanthropy which i always consider as a kind of blasphemy of a shocking description if god bears with the very worst of us we may surely endure each other if thrown into society i always have and always will endeavour to bring pleasure with me at least to show willingness to please but for all this i had rather live alone and i wish my appointment so convenient otherwise did not require my going to edinburgh but this must be and in my little lodging i will be lonely enough  had a very kind letter from croker disowning the least idea of personal attack in his answer to malachi  reading at intervals a novel called granby one of that very difficult class which aspires to describe the actual current of society whose colours are so evanescent that it is difficult to fix them on the canvas it is well written but overlabouredtoo much attempt to put the reader exactly up to the thoughts and sentiments of the parties the women do this better edgeworth ferrier austen have all had their portraits of real society far superior to anything man vain man has produced of the like nature233  march 29worked in the morning had two visits from colonels russell and ferguson walked from one till halfpast four a fine flashy disagreeable day snowclouds sweeping past among sunshine driving down the valley and whitening the country behind them  mr gibson came suddenly in after dinner brought very indifferent news from constables house it is not now hoped that they will pay above three or four shillings in the pound robinson supposed not to be much better  mr g goes to london immediately and is to sell woodstock to robinson if he can otherwise to those who will john murray etc this work may fail perhaps though better than some of its predecessors if so we must try some new manner i think i could catch the dogs yet  a beautiful and perfect lunar rainbow tonight  march 30mr gibson looks unwell and complains of coldbitter bad weather for his travelling and he looks but frail  these indifferent news he brought me affect me but to a little degree it is being too confident to hope to ensure success in the long series of successive struggles which lie before me but somehow i do fully entertain the hope of doing a good deal  march 31      he walked and wrote poor soul what then     why then he wrote and walked again  but i am begun nap bon again which is always a change because it gives a good deal of reading and research whereas woodstock and such like being extempore from my motherwit is a sort of spinning of the brains of which a man tires the weather seems milder today  footnotes

hour today i drove to huntly burn and walked home by one of the hundred and one pleasing paths which i have made through the woods i have plantednow chatting with tom purdie who carries my plaid and speaks when he pleases telling long stories of hits and misses in shooting twenty years backsometimes chewing the cud of sweet and bitter fancyand sometimes attending to the humours of two curious little terriers of the dandie dinmont breed together with a noble wolfhound puppy which glengarry has given me to replace maida this brings me down to the very moment i do tellthe rest is prophetic i will feel sleepy when this book is locked and perhaps sleep until dalgleish brings the dinner summons then i will have a chat with lady s and anne some broth or soup a slice of plain meatand mans

wrote letters this evening  april 4wrote two pages in the morning then went to ashestiel in the sociable with colonel ferguson found my cousin russell settled kindly to his gardening and his projects he seems to have brought home with him the enviable talent of being interested and happy in his own place ashestiel looks worst i think at this period of the year but is a beautiful place in summer where i passed nine happy years did i ever pass unhappy years anywhere none that i remember save those at the high school which i thoroughly detested on account of the confinement i disliked serving in my fathers office too from the same hatred to restraint in other respects i have had unhappy daysunhappy weekseven on one or two occasions unhappy months but fortunes finger has never been able to play a dirge on me for a quarter of a year together  i am sorry to see the peelwood and other natural coppice decaying and abridged about ashestiel      the horrid plough has razed the green       where once my children playd     the axe has felld the hawthorn screen       the schoolboys summer shade237  there was a very romantic pasturage called the cowpark which i was particularly attached to from its wild and sequestered character having been part of an old wood which had been cut down it was full of copsehazel and oak and all sorts of young trees irregularly scattered over fine pasturage and affording a hundred intricacies so delicious to the eye and the imagination but some misjudging friend had cut down and cleared away without mercy and divided the varied and sylvan scene which was divided by a little rivulet into the two most formal things in naturea thriving plantation manyangled as usual and a park laid down in grass wanting therefore the rich graminivorous variety which nature gives its carpet and having instead a braird of six days growthlean and hungry growth tooof ryegrass and clover as for the rill it stagnates in a deep square ditch which silences its prattle and restrains its meanders with a witness the original scene was of course imprinted still deeper on russells mind than mine and i was glad to see he was intensely sorry for the change  april 5rose late in the morning past eight to give the cold and toothache time to make themselves scarce which they have obligingly done yesterday every tooth on the right side of my head was absolutely waltzing i would have drawn by the half dozen but country dentists are not to be lippened to238 today all is quiet but a little swelling and stiffness in the jaw went to chiefswood at one and marked with regret forty trees indispensably necessary for palingmuch like drawing a tooth they are wanted and will never be better but i am avaricious of grown trees having so few  worked a fair task dined and read clappertons journey and denhams into bornou very entertaining and less botheration about mineralogy botany and so forth than usual pity africa picks up so many brave men however work in the evening  april 6wrote in the morning went at one to huntly burn where i had the great pleasure to hear through a letter from sir adam that sophia was in health and johnnie gaining strength it is a fine exchange from deep and aching uncertainty on so interesting a subject to the little spitfire feeling of well but they might have taken the trouble to write but so wretched a correspondent as myself has not much to say so i will just grumble sufficiently to maintain the patriarchal dignity  i returned in time to work and to receive a shoal of things from jb among others a letter from an irish lady who for the beaux yeux which i shall never look upon desires i will forthwith send her all the waverley novels which are published with an order to furnish her with all others in course as they appear which she assures me will be an era in her life she may find out some other epocha  april 7made out my mornings task at one drove to chiefswood and walked home by the rhymers glen mars lee and haxellcleugh took me three hours the heath gets somewhat heavier for me every yearbut never mind i like it altogether as well as the day i could tread it best my plantations are getting all into green leaf especially the larches if theirs may be called leaves which are only a sort of hair and from the number of birds drawn to these wastes i may congratulate myself on having literally made the desert to sing as i returned there was in the phraseology of that most precise of prigs in a white collarless coat and chapeau bas mister commissary ramsaya rather dense inspissation of rain deil care      lord who would live turmoiled in the court     that might enjoy such quiet walks as these239  yet misfortune comes our way too poor laidlaw lost a fine prattling child of five years old yesterday  it is odd enoughiden the kentish esquire has just made the ejaculation which i adopted in the last page when he kills cade and posts away up to court to get the price set upon his head here is a letter come from lockhart full of court news and all sort of newsbest is his wife is well and thinks the child gains in health  lockhart erroneously supposes that i think of applying to ministers about charles and that notwithstanding crokers terms of pacification i should find malachi stick in my way i would not make such an application for millions i think if i were to ask patronage it would not be through them for some time at least and i might have better access240  april 8we expect a raid of folks to visit us this morning whom we must have dined before our misfortunes save time wine and money these misfortunesand so far are convenient things besides there is a dignity about them when they come only like the gout in its mildest shape to authorise diet and retirement the nightgown and the velvet shoe when the one comes to chalkstones and the other to prison though there would be the devil or compare the effects of sieur gout and absolute poverty upon the stomachthe necessity of a bottle of laudanum in the one case the want of a morsel of meat in the other  laidlaws infant which died on wednesday is buried today the people coming to visit prevent my going and i am glad of it i hate funeralsalways did there is such a mixture of mummery with real griefthe actual mourner perhaps heartbroken and all the rest making solemn faces and whispering observations on the weather and public news and here and there a greedy fellow enjoying the cake and wine to me it is a farce full of most tragical mirth and i am not sorry like provost coulter241 but glad that i shall not see my own this is a most unfilial tendency of mine for my father absolutely loved a funeral and as he was a man of a fine presence and looked the mourner well he was asked to every interment of distinction he seemed to preserve the list of a whole beadroll of cousins merely for the pleasure of being at their funerals which he was often asked to superintend and i suspect had sometimes to pay for he carried me with him as often as he could to these mortuary ceremonies but feeling i was not like him either useful or ornamental i escaped as often as i could  i saw the poor childs funeral from a distance ah that distance what a magician for conjuring up scenes of joy or sorrow smoothing all asperities reconciling all incongruities veiling all absurdness softening every coarseness doubling every effect by the influence of the imagination a scottish wedding should be seen at a distance the gay band of the dancers just distinguished amid the elderly group of the spectatorsthe glass held high and the distant cheers as it is swallowed should be only a sketch not a finished dutch picture when it becomes brutal and boorish scotch psalmody too should be heard from a distance the grunt and the snuffle and the whine and the scream should be all blended in that deep and distant sound which rising and falling like the eolian harp may have some title to be called the praise of our maker even so the distant funeral the few mourners on horseback with their plaids wrapped around themthe father heading the procession as they enter the river and pointing out the ford by which his darling is to be carried on the last long roadnot one of the subordinate figures in discord with the general tone of the incidentseeming just accessories and no morethis is affecting  april 9i worked at correcting proofs in the morning and what is harder at correcting manuscript which fags me excessively i was dead sick of it by two oclock the rather as my hand o revered gurnal be it said between ourselves gets daily worse  lockharts review242 dont like his article on sheridans life there is no breadth in it no general views the whole flung away in smart but party criticism now no man can take more general and liberal views of literature than jgl but he lets himself too easily into that advocatism of style which is that of a pleader not a judge or a critic and is particularly unsatisfactory to the reader lieutcol ferguson dined here  april 10sent off proofs and copy galore before breakfast and might be able to give idleness a day if i liked but it is as well reading for boney as for anything else and i have a humour to make my amusement useful then the day is changeable with gusts of wind and i believe a start to the garden will be my best outofdoors exercise no thorough hillexpedition in this gusty weather  april 11wrought out my task although i have been much affected this morning by the morbus as i call it aching pain in the back rendering one posture intolerable fluttering of the heart idle fears gloomy thoughts and anxieties which if not unfounded are at least bootless i have been out once or twice but am driven in by the rain mercy on us what poor devils we are i shook this affection off however mr scrope and col ferguson came to dinner and we twaddled away the evening well enough  april 12i have finished my task this morning at halfpast eleveneasily and earlyand i think not amiss i hope jb will make some great points of admirationotherwise i will be disappointed if this work answersif it but answers it must set us on our legs i am sure worse trumpery of mine has had a great run well i will console myself and do my best but fashion changes and i am getting old and may become unpopular but it is time to cry out when i am hurt i remember with what great difficulty i was brought to think myself something better than common243and now i will not in mere faintness of heart give up good hopes so fortune protect the bold i have finished the whole introductory sketch of the revolutiontoo long for an introduction but i think i may now go to my solitary walk  april 13on my return from my walk yesterday i learnt with great concern the death of my old friend sir alexander don he cannot have been above sixor sevenandforty without being much together we had considering our different habits lived in much friendship and i sincerely regret his death his habits were those of a gay man much connected with the turf but he possessed strong natural parts and in particular few men could speak better in public when he chose he had tact wit power of sarcasm and that indescribable something which marks the gentleman his manners in society were extremely pleasing and as he had a taste for literature and the fine arts there were few more pleasant companions besides being a highlyspirited steady and honourable man his indolence prevented his turning these good parts towards acquiring the distinction he might have attained he was among the détenus whom bonapartes iniquitous commands confined so long in france244 and coming there into possession of a large estate in right of his mother the heiress of the glencairn family he had the means of being very expensive and probably then acquired those gay habits which rendered him averse to serious business being our member for roxburghshire his death will make a stir amongst us i prophesy harden245 will be here to talk about starting his son henry  accordingly the laird and lady called i exhorted him to write to lord montagu246 instantly i do not see what they can do better and unless some pickthank intervene to insinuate certain irritating suspicions i suppose lord m will make no objection there can be no objection to henry scott for birth fortune or political principle and i do not see where we could get a better representative  april 14wrote to lord m last night i hope they will keep the peace in the county i am sure it would be to me a most distressing thing if buccleuch and harden were to pull different ways being so intimate with both families  i did not write much yesterday not above two pages and a half i have begun boney though and cest toujours quelque chose this morning i sent off proofs and manuscript had a letter from the famous denis davidoff the black captain whose abilities as a partisan were so much distinguished during the retreat from moscow if i can but wheedle him out of a few anecdotes it would be a great haul  a kind letter from colin mackenzie he thinks the ministry will not push the measure against scotland i fear they will there is usually an obstinacy in weakness but i will think no more about it time draws on i have been here a month another month carries me to be a hermit in the city instead of the country i could scarce think i had been here a week i wish i was able even at great loss to retire from edinburgh entirely here is no bile no visits no routine and yet on the whole things are as well perhaps as they are  april 15received last night letters from sir john scott douglas and from that daintiest of dandies sir william elliot of stobs canvassing for the county young harrys247 the lad for me but will he be the lad for lord montaguthere is the point i should have given him a hint to attend to edgerston perhaps being at minto and not there may give offence and a bad report from that quarter would play the devil it is rather too late to go down and tell them this and to say truth i dont like the air of making myself busy in the matter  poor sir alexander don died of a disease in the heart the body was opened which was very right odd enough too to have a man probably a friend two days before slashing at ones heart as it were a bullocks i had a letter yesterday from john gibson the house of longman and co guarantee the sale of woodstock to hurst and take the work if hurst and robinson as is to be feared can make no play  also i made up what was due of my task both for 13th and 14th so hey for a swiftianism      i loll in my chair     and around me i stare     with a critical air     like a calf at a fair     and say i mrs duty     goodmorrow to your beauty     i kiss your sweet shoetie     and hope i can suit ye   fair words butter no parsnips says duty dont keep talking then but get to your work again here is a days task before youthe siege of toulon call you that a task d me ill write it as fast as boney carried it on  april 16i am now far ahead with nap i wrote a little this morning but this forenoon i must write letters a task in which i am far behind      heaven sure sent letters for some wretchs plague248  lady scott seems to make no way yet can scarce be said to lose any she suffers much occasionally especially during the night sleeps a great deal when at ease all symptoms announce water upon the chest a sad prospect  in the evening a despatch from lord melville written with all the familiarity of former times desiring me to ride down and press mr scott of harden to let henry stand and this in lord montagus name as well as his own so that the two propositions cross each other on the road and henry is as much desired by the buccleuch interest as he desires their support  jedburgh april 17came over to jedburgh this morning to breakfast with my good old friend mr shortreed and had my usual warm reception lord gillies held the circuit court and there was no criminal trial for any offence whatsoever i have attended these circuits with tolerable regularity since 1792 and though there is seldom much of importance to be done yet i never remember before the porteous roll249 being quite blank the judge was presented with a pair of white gloves in consideration of its being a maiden circuit harden came over and talked about his sons preferment naturally much pleased  received £100 from john lockhart for review of pepys250 but this is by far too much £50 is plenty still i must impeticos the gratility for the present251for whitsunday will find me only with £300 in hand unless blackwood settles a few scores of pounds for malachi  wrote a great many letters dined with the judge where i met the disappointed candidate sir john scott douglas who took my excuse like a gentleman sir william elliot on the other hand was being a fine man very much out of sorts that having got his own consent he could not get that of the county he showed none of this however to me  april 18this morning i go down to kelso from jedburgh to poor dons funeral it is i suppose forty years since i saw him first i was staying at sydenham a lad of fourteen or by r lady some sixteen and he a boy of six or seven was brought to visit me on a pony a groom holding the leading reinand now i an old grey man am going to lay him in his grave sad work i detest funerals there is always a want of consistency it is a tragedy played by strolling performers who are more likely to make you laugh than cry no chance of my being made to laugh today the very road i go is a road of grave recollections must write to charles seriously on the choice of his profession and i will do it now  abbotsford april 19returned last night from the house of death and mourning to my own now the habitation of sickness and anxious apprehension found lady s had tried the foxglove in quantity till it made her so sick she was forced to desist the result cannot yet be judged wrote to mrs thomas scott to beg her to let her daughter anne an uncommonly sensible steady and sweettempered girl come and stay with us a season in our distress who i trust will come forthwith  two melancholy things last night i left my pallet in our family apartment to make way for a female attendant and removed to a dressingroom adjoining when to return or whether ever god only can tell also my servant cut my hair which used to be poor charlottes personal task i hope she will not observe it  the funeral yesterday was very mournful about fifty persons present and all seemed affected the domestics in particular were very much so sir alexander was a kind though an exact master it was melancholy to see those apartments where i have so often seen him play the graceful and kind landlord filled with those who were to carry him to his long home  there was very little talk of the election at least till the funeral was over  april 20lady scotts health in the same harassing state of uncertainty yet on my side with more of hope than i had two days since  another death thomas riddell younger of camiston sergeantmajor of the edinburgh troop in the sunny days of our yeomanry and a very good fellow  the day was so tempting that i went out with tom purdie to cut some trees the rather that my task was very well advanced he led me into the wood as the blind king of bohemia was led by his four knights into the thick of the battle at agincourt or crecy252 and then like the old king i struck good strokes more than one which is manly exercise  april 21this day i entertained more flattering hopes of lady scotts health than late events permitted i went down to mertoun with colonel ferguson who returned to dine here which consumed time so much that i made a short days work  had the grief to find lady scott had insisted on coming downstairs and was the worse of it also a letter from lockhart giving a poor account of the infant god help us earth cannot  april 22lady scott continues very poorly better news of the child  wrought a good deal today rather correcting sheets and acquiring information than actually composing which is the least toilsome of the three  jgl kindly points out some solecisms in my style as amid for amidst scarce for scarcely whose he says is the proper genitive of which only at such times as which retains its quality of impersonification well i will try to remember all this but after all i write grammar as i speak to make my meaning known and a solecism in point of composition like a scotch word in speaking is indifferent to me i never learned grammar and not only sir hugh evans but even mrs quickly might puzzle me about gineys case and horum harum horum253 i believe the bailiff in the goodnatured man is not far wrong when he says one man has one way of expressing himself and another another and that is all the difference between them254 went to huntly burn today and looked at the colonels projected approach i am sure if the kind heart can please himself he will please me  april 23a glorious day bright and brilliant and i fancy mild lady scott is certainly better and has promised not to attempt quitting her room  henry scott has been here and his canvass comes on like a moor burning   april 24good news from brighton sophia is confined both she and her baby are doing well and the childs name is announced to be waltera favourite name in our family and i trust of no bad omen yet it is no charm for life of my fathers family i was the second walter if not the third i am glad the name came my way for it was borne by my father greatgrandfather and greatgreatgrandfather also by the grandsire of that lastnamed venerable person who was the first laird of raeburn  hurst and robinson the yorkshire tykes have failed after all their swaggering and longman and co take woodstock but if woodstock and napoleon take with the public i shall care little about their insolvency and if they do not i dont think their solvency would have lasted long constable is sorely broken down      poor fool and knave i have one part in my heart     thats sorry yet for thee255  his conduct has not been what i deserved at his hand but i believe that walking blindfold himself he misled me without malice prepense it is best to think so at least unless the contrary be demonstrated to nourish angry passions against a man whom i really liked would be to lay a blister on my own heart  april 25having fallen behind on the 23d i wrought pretty hard yesterday but i had so much reading and so many proofs to correct that i did not get over the daily task so am still a little behind which i shall soon make up i have got nap dn him into italy where with bad eyes and obscure maps i have a little difficulty in tracing out his victorious chessplay  lady scott was better yesterday certainly better and was sound asleep when i looked in this morning walked in the afternoon i looked at a hooded crow building in the thicket with great pleasure it is a shorter date than my neighbour torwoodlee256 thought of when he told me as i was bragging a little of my plantations that it would be long ere crows built in them  april 26letters from walter and lockharts all well and doing well lady s continues better so the clouds are breaking up i made a good days work yesterday and sent off proofs letters and copy this morning so if this fine day holds good i will take a drive at one  there is an operation called putting to rightsscotticè redding upwhich puts me into a fever i always leave any attempt at it half executed and so am worse off than before and have only embroiled the fray then my long back aches with stooping into the low drawers of old cabinets and my neck is strained with staring up to their attics then you are sure never to get the thing you want i am certain they creep about and hide themselves tom moore257 gave us the insurrection of the papers that was open war but this is a system of privy plot and conspiracy by which those you seek creep out of the way and those you are not wanting perk themselves in your face again and again until at last you throw them into some corner in a passion and then they are the objects of research in their turn i have read in a french eastern tale of an enchanted person called lhomme qui cherche a sort of sir guy the seeker always employed in collecting the beads of a chaplet which by dint of gramarye always dispersed themselves when he was about to fix the last upon the string it was an awful doom transmogrification into the laidleyworm of spindlestaneheugh258 would have been a blessing in comparison now the explanation of all this is that i have been all this morning seeking a parcel of sticks of sealing wax which i brought from edinburgh and the weel brandt and vast houd259 has either melted without the agency of fire or barricaded itself within the drawers of some cabinet which has declared itself in a state of insurrection a choice subject for a journal but what better have i  i did not quite finish my task today nay i only did one third of it it is so difficult to consult the maps after candles are lighted or to read the moniteur that i was obliged to adjourn the task is three pages or leaves of my close writing per diem which corresponds to about a sheet 16 pages of woodstock and about 12 of bonaparte which is a more comprehensive page but i was not idle neither and wrote some balaam260 for lockharts review then i was in hand a leaf above the tale so i am now only a leaf behind it  april 27this is one of those abominable april mornings which deserve the name of sans cullotides as being cold beggarly coarse savage and intrusive the earth lies an inch deep with snow to the confusion of the worshippers of flora by the way bogie attended his professional dinner and show of flowers at jedburgh yesterday here is a beautiful sequence to their floralia it is this uncertainty in april and the descent of snow and frost when one thinks themselves clear of them and that after fine encouraging weather that destroys our scottish fruits and flowers it is as imprudent to attach yourself to flowers in scotland as to a caged bird the cat sooner or later snaps up one and thesesans cullotidesannihilate the other it was but yesterday i was admiring the glorious flourish of the pears and apricots and now hath come the killing frost261  but let it freeze without we are comfortable within lady scott continues better and we may hope has got the turn of her disease  april 28beautiful morning but ice as thick as pasteboard too surely showing that the night has made good yesterdays threat dalgleish with his most melancholy face conveys the most doleful tidings from bogie but servants are fond of the woful it gives such consequence to the person who communicates bad news  wrote two letters and read till twelve and then for a stout walk among the plantations till four found lady scott obviously better i think than i had left her in the morning in walking i am like a spavined horse and heat as i get on the flourishing plantations around me are a great argument for me to labour hard barbarus has segetes i will write my fingerends off first  april 29i was always afraid privately that woodstock would not stand the test in that case my fate would have been that of the unfortunate minstrel trumpeter maclean at the battle of sheriffmuir      by misfortune he happened to fa man       by saving his neck       his trumpet did break     and came off without music at a man262  jb corroborated my doubts by his ravenlike croaking and criticising but the good fellow writes me this morning that he is written down an ass and that the approbation is unanimous it is but edinburgh to be sure but edinburgh has always been a harder critic than london it is a great mercy and gives encouragement for future exertion having written two leaves this morning i think i will turn out to my walk though two hours earlier than usual egad i could not persuade myself that it was such bad balaam after all  april 30i corrected this morning a quantity of proofs and copy and dawdled about a little the weather of late becoming rather milder though not much of that methinks duty looks as if she were but halfpleased with me but would the pagan bitch have me work on the sunday  footnotes  234 ben

this subjectsir walter at all times laboured under the strangest delusion as to the merits of his own works on this score he was not only inaccessible to compliments but even insensible to the truth in fact at all times he hated to talk of any of his productions as for instance he greatly preferred mrs shelleys frankenstein to any of his own romances i remember one day when mr erskine and i were dining with him either immediately before or immediately after the publication of one of the best of the latter and were giving it the high praise we thought it deserved he asked us abruptly whether we had read frankenstein we answered that we had not ah he said have patience read frankenstein and you will be better able to judge of you will easily judge of the disappointment thus prepared for us when i ventured as i sometimes did to press him on the score of the reputation he had gained he merely asked as if he determined to be done with the discussion why what is the value of a reputation which probably will not last above one or two generations one morning i recollect i went into his library shortly after the publication of the lady of the lake and finding miss scott there who was then a very young girl i asked her well miss sophia how do you like the lady of the lake with which everybody is so much enchanted her answer was with affecting simplicity oh i have not read it papa says theres nothing so bad for young girls as reading bad poetry yet he could not be said to be hostile to compliments in the abstractnothing was so easy as to flatter him about a farm or a field and his manner on such an occasion plainly showed that he was really open to such a compliment and liked it in fact i can recall only one instance in which he was fairly cheated into pleasure by a tribute paid to his literary merit and it was a striking one somewhere betwixt two and three years ago i was dining at the rev dr bruntons with a large and accomplished party of whom dr chalmers was one the conversation turned upon sir walter scotts romances generally and the course of it led me very shortly afterwards to call on sir walter and address him as followsi knew the task was a bold one but i thought i saw that i should get well through itwell sir walter i said i was dining yesterday where your works became the subject of very copious conversation his countenance immediately became overcastand his answer was well i think i must say your party might have been better employed i knew it would be your answerthe conversation continuednor would i have mentioned it but that dr chalmers was present and was by far the most decided in his expressions of pleasure and admiration of any of the party this instantly roused him to the most vivid animation dr chalmers he repeated that throws new light on the subjectto have produced any effect upon the mind of such a man as dr chalmers is indeed something to be proud of dr chalmers is a man of the truest genius i will thank you to repeat all you can recollect that he said on the subject i did so accordingly and i can recall no other similar instancejames ballantynes ms  244 for the life led by many of the détenus in france before 1814

along the face of the hill it cost me some trouble to carry the boundaries out of the eye for nothing is so paltry as a plantation of almost any extent if its whole extent lies defined to the eye by availing myself of the undulations of the ground i think i have avoided this for the present only when seen from the eildon hills the cranks and turns of the enclosure will seem fantastic at least

not suffer thank god but strength must fail at last since sunday there has been a gradual changevery gradualbut alas to the worse my hopes are almost gone but i am determined to stand this grief as i have done others  may 3another fine morning i answered a letter from mr handley who has taken the pains to rummage the chancery records until he has actually discovered the fund due to lady scotts mother £1200 it seems to have been invested in the estates of a mr owen as it appears for madame charpentiers benefit but she dying the fund was lost sight of and got into chancery where i suppose it must have accumulated but i cannot say i understand the matter at a happier moment the news would have given poor charlotte much pleasure but nowit is a day too late  may 4on visiting lady scotts sickroom this morning i found her suffering and i doubt if she knew me yet after breakfast she seemed serene and composed the worst is she will not speak out about the symptoms under which she labours sad sad work i am under the most melancholy apprehension for what constitution can hold out under these continued and wasting attacks  my niece anne scott a prudent sensible and kind young woman arrived today having come down to assist us in our distress from so far as cheltenham this is a great consolation  may 5haunted by gloomy thoughts but i corrected proofs from seven to ten and wrote from halfpast ten to one my old friend sir adam called and took a long walk with me which was charity his gaiety rubbed me up a little i had also a visit from the laird and lady of harden henry scott carries the county without opposition  may 6 the same scene of hopeless almost and unavailing anxiety still welcoming me with a smile and asserting she is better i fear the disease is too deeply entwined with the principles of life yet the increase of good weather especially if it would turn more genial might i think aid her excellent constitution still labouring at this review without heart or spirits to finish it i am a tolerable stoic but preach to myself in vain      since these things are necessities     then let us meet them like necessities264  and so we will  may 7hammered on at the review till my backbone ached but i believe it was a nervous affection for a walk cured it sir adam and the colonel dined here so i spent the evening as pleasantly as i well could considering i am so soon to leave my own house and go like a stranger to the town of which i have been so long a citizen and leave my wife lingering without prospect of recovery under the charge of two poor girls talia cogit dura necessitas  may 8i went over to the election at jedburgh there was a numerous meeting the whigs who did not bring ten men to the meeting of course took the whole matter under their patronage which was much of a piece with the blue bottle drawing the carriage i tried to pull up once or twice but quietly having no desire to disturb the quiet of the election to see the difference of modern times we had a good dinner and excellent wine and i had ordered my carriage at halfpast seven almost ashamed to start so soon everybody dispersed at so early an hour however that when henry had left the chair there was no carriage for me and peter proved his accuracy by showing me it was but a quarterpast seven in the days i remember they would have kept it up till daylight nor do i think poor don would have left the chair before midnight well there is a medium without being a veteran vice a grey iniquity like falstaff i think an occasional jolly bout if not carried to excess improved society men were put into good humour when the good wine did its good office the jest the song the speech had double effect men were happy for the night and better friends ever after because they had been so  may 9my new liverpool neighbour mr bainbridge breakfasts here today with some of his family they wish to try the fishing in cauldshields loch and there is promise of a fine soft morning but the season is too early  they have had no sport accordingly after trying with trimmers mr bainbridge is a good cut of john bullplain sensible and downright the maker of his own fortune and son of his own works  may 10tomorrow i leave my home to what scene i may suddenly be recalled it wrings my heart to think if she would but be guided by the medical people and attend rigidly to their orders something might be hoped but she is impatient with the protracted suffering and no wonder anne has a severe task to perform but the assistance of her cousin is a great comfort baron weber the great composer wants me through lockhart to compose something to be set to music by him and sung by miss stephensas if i cared who set or who sung any lines of mine i have recommended instead beaumont and fletchers unrivalled song in the nice valour      hence all ye vain delights etc  edinburgh265 may 11      der abschiedstag ist da     schwer liegt er auf den herzenschwer266  charlotte was unable to take leave of me being in a sound sleep after a very indifferent night perhaps it was as well emotion might have hurt her and nothing i could have expressed would have been worth the risk i have foreseen for two years and more that this menaced event could not be far distant i have seen plainly within the last two months that recovery was hopeless and yet to part with the companion of twentynine years when so very illthat i did not could not foresee267 it withers my heart to think of it and to recollect that i can hardly hope again to seek confidence and counsel from that ear to which all might be safely confided but in her present lethargic state what would my attentions have availed and anne has promised close and constant intelligence i must dine with james ballantyne today en famille i cannot help it but would rather be at home and alone however i can go out too i will not yield to the barren sense of hopelessness which struggles to invade me i passed a pleasant day with honest jb which was a great relief from the black dog which would have worried me at home we were quite alone  edinburgh may 12well here i am in arden and i may say with touchstone when i was at home i was in a better place268 and yet this is not by any means to be complained of good apartments the people civil and apparently attentive no appearance of smoke and absolute warrandice against my dreaded enemies bugs i must when there is occasion draw to my own bailie nicol jarvies consolation one cannot carry the comforts of the sautmarket about with one were i at ease in mind i think the body is very well cared for i have two steady servants a man and woman and they seem to set out sensibly enough only one lodger in the house a mr shandy a clergyman and despite his name said to be a quiet one  may 13the projected measure against the scottish banknotes has been abandoned the resistance being general malachi might clap his wings upon this but alas domestic anxiety has cut his comb  i think very lightly in general of praise it costs men nothing and is usually only lipsalve they wish to please and must suppose that flattery is the ready road to the good will of every professor of literature some praise however and from some people does at once delight and strengthen the mind and i insert in this place the quotation with which ld c baron shepherd concluded a letter concerning me to the chief commissioner magna etiam illa laus et admirabilis videri solet tulisse casus sapienter adversos non fractum esse fortunâ retinuisse in rebus asperis dignitatem269 i record these words not as meriting the high praise they imply but to remind me that such an opinion being partially entertained of me by a man of a character so eminent it becomes me to make my conduct approach as much as possible to the standard at which he rates it  as i must pay back to terry some cash in london £170 together with other matters here i have borrowed from mr alexander ballantyne the sum of £500 upon a promissory note for £512 10s payable 15th november to him or his order if god should call me before that time i request my son walter will in reverence to my memory see that mr alexander ballantyne does not suffer for having obliged me in a sort of exigencyhe cannot afford it and god has given my son the means to repay him  may 14a fair goodmorrow to you mr sun who are shining so brightly on these dull walls methinks you look as if you were looking as bright on the banks of the tweed but look where you will sir sun you look upon sorrow and suffering hogg was here yesterday in danger from having obtained an accommodation of £100 from mr ballantyne which he is now obliged to repay i am unable to help the poor fellow being obliged to borrow myself but i long ago remonstrated against the transaction at all and gave him £50 out of my pocket to avoid granting the accommodation but it did no good  may 15received the melancholy intelligence that all is over at abbotsford  abbotsford may 16she died at nine in the morning after being very ill for two dayseasy at last  i arrived here late last night anne is worn out and has had hysterics which returned on my arrival her broken accents were like those of a child the language as well as the tones broken but in the most gentle voice of submission poor mammanever return againgone for evera better place then when she came to herself she spoke with sense freedom and strength of mind till her weakness returned it would have been inexpressibly moving to me as a strangerwhat was it then to the father and the husband for myself i scarce know how i feel sometimes as firm as the bass rock sometimes as weak as the wave that breaks on it  i am as alert at thinking and deciding as i ever was in my life yet when i contrast what this place now is with what it has been not long since i think my heart will break lonely aged deprived of my familyall but poor anne an impoverished and embarrassed man i am deprived of the sharer of my thoughts and counsels who could always talk down my sense of the calamitous apprehensions which break the heart that must bear them alone even her foibles were of service to me by giving me things to think of beyond my weary selfreflections  i have seen her the figure i beheld is and is not my charlottemy thirty years companion there is the same symmetry of form though those limbs are rigid which were once so gracefully elasticbut that yellow masque with pinched features which seems to mock life rather than emulate it can it be the face that was once so full of lively expression i will not look on it again anne thinks her little changed because the latest idea she had formed of her mother is as she appeared under circumstances of sickness and pain mine go back to a period of comparative health if i write long in this way i shall write down my resolution which i should rather write up if i could i wonder how i shall do with the large portion of thoughts which were hers for thirty years i suspect they will be hers yet for a long time at least but i will not blaze cambric and crape in the public eye like a disconsolate widower that most affected of all characters  may 17 last night anne after conversing with apparent ease dropped suddenly down as she rose from the suppertable and lay six or seven minutes as if dead clarkson however has no fear of these affections  may 18another day and a bright one to the external world again opens on us the air soft and the flowers smiling and the leaves glittering they cannot refresh her to whom mild weather was a natural enjoyment cerements of lead and of wood already hold her cold earth must have her soon but it is not my charlotte it is not the bride of my youth the mother of my children that will be laid among the ruins of dryburgh which we have so often visited in gaiety and pastime no no she is sentient and conscious of my emotions somewheresomehow where we cannot tell how we cannot tell yet would i not at this moment renounce the mysterious yet certain hope that i shall see her in a better world for all that this world can give me the necessity of this separationthat necessity which rendered it even a reliefthat and patience must be my comfort i do not experience those paroxysms of grief which others do on the same occasion i can exert myself and speak even cheerfully with the poor girls but alone or if anything touches methe choking sensation i have been to her room there was no voice in itno stirring the pressure of the coffin was visible on the bed but it had been removed elsewhere all was neat as she loved it but all was calmcalm as death i remembered the last sight of her she raised herself in bed and tried to turn her eyes after me and said with a sort of smile you all have such melancholy faces they were the last words i ever heard her utter and i hurried away for she did not seem quite conscious of what she said when i returned immediately before departing she was in a deep sleep it is deeper now this was but seven days since  they are arranging the chamber of death that which was long the apartment of connubial happiness and of whose arrangements better than in richer houses she was so proud they are treading fast and thick for weeks you could have heard a footfall oh my god  may 19anne poor love is ill with her exertions and agitationcannot walkand is still hysterical though less so i advised fleshbrush and tepid bath which i think will bring her about we speak freely of her whom we have lost and mix her name with our ordinary conversation this is the rule of nature all primitive people speak of their dead and i think virtuously and wisely the idea of blotting the names of those who are gone out of the language and familiar discourse of those to whom they were dearest is one of the rules of ultracivilisation which in so many instances strangle natural feeling by way of avoiding a painful sensation the highlanders speak of their dead children as freely as of their living and mention how poor colin or robert would have acted in such or such a situation it is a generous and manly tone of feeling and so far as it may be adopted without affectation or contradicting the general habits of society i reckon on observing it  may 20tonight i trust will bring charles or lockhart or both at least i must hear from them a letter from violet lockhart gave us the painful intelligence that she had not mentioned to sophia the dangerous state in which her mother was most kindly meant but certainly not so well judged i have always thought that truth even when painful is a great duty on such occasions and it is seldom that concealment is justifiable  sophias baby was christened on sunday 14th may at brighton by the name of walter scott270 may god give him life and health to wear it with credit to himself and those belonging to him melancholy to think that the next morning after this ceremony deprived him of so near a relation sent mr curle £11 to remit mrs bohn york street covent garden for booksi thought i had paid the poor woman before  may 21our sad preparations for tomorrow continue a letter from lockhart doubtful if sophias health or his own state of business will let him be here if things permit he comes tonight from charles not a word but i think i may expect him i wish tomorrow were over not that i fear it for my nerves are pretty good but it will be a day of many recollections  may 22charles arrived last night much affected of course anne had a return of her faintingfits on seeing him and again upon seeing mr ramsay the gentleman who performs the service271 i heard him do so with the utmost propriety for my late friend lady alvanley272 the arrangement of whose funeral devolved upon me how little i could guess when where and with respect to whom i should next hear those solemn words well i am not apt to shrink from that which is my duty merely because it is painful but i wish this day over a kind of cloud of stupidity hangs about me as if all were unreal that men seem to be doing and talking about  may 23about an hour before the mournful ceremony of yesterday walter arrived having travelled express from ireland on receiving the news he was much affected poor fellow and no wonder poor charlotte nursed him and perhaps for that reason she was ever partial to him the whole scene floats as a sort of dream before methe beautiful day the grey ruins covered and hidden among clouds of foliage and flourish where the grave even in the lap of beauty lay lurking and gaped for its prey then the grave looks the hasty important bustle of men with spades and mattocksthe train of carriagesthe coffin containing the creature that was so long the dearest on earth to me and whom i was to consign to the very spot which in pleasureparties we so frequently visited it seems still as if this could not be really so but it is soand duty to god and to my children must teach me patience  poor anne has had longer fits since our arrival from dryburgh than before but yesterday was the crisis she desired to hear prayers read by mr ramsay who performed the duty in a most solemn manner but her strength could not carry it through she fainted before the service was concluded273  may 24slept wretchedly or rather waked wretchedly all night and was very sick and bilious in consequence and scarce able to hold up my head with pain a walk however with my sons did me a great deal of good indeed their society is the greatest support the world can afford me their ideas of everything are so just and honourable kind towards their sisters and affectionate to me that i must be grateful to god for sparing them to me and continue to battle with the world for their sakes if not for my own  may 25i had sound sleep tonight and waked with little or nothing of the strange dreamy feeling which made me for some days feel like one bewildered in a country where mist or snow has disguised those features of the landscape which are best known to him  walter leaves me today he seems disposed to take interest in country affairs which will be an immense resource supposing him to tire of the army in a few years charles he and i went up to ashestiel to call upon the misses russell who have kindly promised to see anne on tuesday this evening walter left us being anxious to return to his wife as well as to his regiment we expect he will be here early in autumn with his household  may 26a rough morning and makes me think of st georges channel which walter must cross tonight or tomorrow to get to athlone the wind is almost due east however and the channel at the narrowest point between portpatrick and donaghadee his absence is a great blank in our circle especially i think to his sister anne to whom he shows invariably much kindness but indeed they do so without exception each towards the other and in weal or woe have shown themselves a family of love no persuasion could force on walter any of his poor mothers ornaments for his wife he undid a readingglass from the gold chain to which it was suspended and agreed to give the glass to jane but would on no account retain the chain i will go to town on monday and resume my labours being of a grave nature they cannot go against the general temper of my feelings and in other respects the exertion as far as i am concerned will do me good besides i must reestablish my fortune for the sake of the children and of my own character i have not leisure to indulge the disabling and discouraging thoughts that press on me were an enemy coming upon my house would i not do my best to fight although oppressed in spirits and shall a similar despondency prevent me from mental exertion it shall not by heaven this day and tomorrow i give to the currency of the ideas which have of late occupied my mind and with monday they shall be mingled at least with other thoughts and cares last night charles and i walked late on the terrace at kaeside when the clouds seemed accumulating in the wildest masses both on the eildon hills and other mountains in the distance this rough morning reads the riddle  dull drooping cheerless has the day been i cared not to carry my own gloom to the girls and so sate in my own room dawdling with old papers which awakened as many stings as if they had been the nest of fifty scorpions then the solitude seemed so absolutemy poor charlotte would have been in the room halfascore of times to see if the fire burned and to ask a hundred kind questions well that is overand if it cannot be forgotten must be remembered with patience  may 27a sleepless night it is time i should be up and be doing and a sleepless night sometimes furnishes good ideas alas i have no companion now with whom i can communicate to relieve the loneliness of these watches of the night but i must not fail myself and my familyand the necessity of exertion becomes apparent i must try a hors doeuvre something that can go on between the necessary intervals of nap mrs murray keiths tale of the deserter with her interview with the lads mother may be made most affecting but will hardly endure much expansion274 the framework may be a highland tour under the guardianship of the sort of postilion whom mrs mk described to mea species of conductor who regulated the motions of his company made their halts and was their cicerone  may 28i wrote a few pages yesterday and then walked i believe the description of the old scottish lady may do but the change has been unceasingly rung upon scottish subjects of late and it strikes me that the introductory matter may be considered as an imitation of washington irving yet not so neither in short i will go on today make a dozen of close pages ready and take jbs advice i intend the work as an olla podrida into which any species of narrative or discussion may be thrown  i wrote easily i think the exertion has done me good i slept sound last night and at waking as is usual with me i found i had some clear views and thoughts upon the subject of this trifling work i wonder if others find so strongly as i do the truth of the latin proverb aurora musis amica if i forget a thing overnight i am sure to recollect it as my eyes open in the morning the same if i want an idea or am encumbered by some difficulty the moment of waking always supplies the deficiency or gives me courage to endure the alternative275  may 29today i leave for edinburgh this house of sorrow in the midst of such distress i have the great pleasure to see anne regaining her health and showing both patience and steadiness of mind god continue this for my own sake as well as hers much of my future comfort must depend upon her  edinburgh may 30returned to town last night with charles this morning resume ordinary habits of rising early working in the morning and attending the court all will come easily round but it is at first as if men looked strange on me and bit their lip when they wring my hand and indicated suppressed feelings it is natural this should beundoubtedly it has been so with me yet it is strange to find onesself resemble a cloud which darkens gaiety wherever it interposes its chilling shade will it be better when left to my own feelings i see the whole world pipe and dance around me i think it will thus sympathy intrudes on my private affliction  i finished correcting the proofs for the quarterly it is but a flimsy article but then the circumstances were most untoward  this has been a melancholy day most melancholy i am afraid poor charles found me weeping i do not know what other folks feel but with me the hysterical passion that impels tears is of terrible violencea sort of throttling sensationthen succeeded by a state of dreaming stupidity in which i ask if my poor charlotte can actually be dead i think i feel my loss more than at the first blow  poor charles wishes to come back to study here when his term ends at oxford i can see the motive  may 31the melancholy hours of yesterday must not return to encourage that dreamy state of incapacity is to resign all authority over the mind and i have been wont to say      my mind to me a kingdom is276 i am rightful monarch and god to aid i will not be dethroned by any rebellious passion that may rear its standard against me such are morning thoughts strong as carlehempsays burns      come firm resolve take thou the van     thou stalk of carlehemp in man  charles went by the steamboat this morning at six we parted last night mournfully on both sides poor boy this is his first

having a fit of gout  gibson seems in high spirits on the views i have given to him on the nature of constable and cos claim it amounts to this that being no longer accountable as publishers they cannot claim the character of such or plead upon any claim arising out of the contracts entered into while they held that capacity  june 3i was much disturbed this morning by bile and its consequences and lost so much sleep that i have been rather late in rising by way of indemnification i must go to the map and study the italian campaigns instead of scribbling  june 4i wrote a good task yesterday and today a great one scarce stirring from the desk the whole day except a few minutes when lady rae called i was glad to see my wifes old friend with whom in early life we had so many liaisons i am not sure it is right to work so hard but a man must take himself as well as other people when he is in the humour a man will do twice as much at one time and in half the time and twice as well as he will be able to do at another people are always crying out about method and in some respects it is good and shows to great advantage among men of business but i doubt if men of method who can lay aside or take up the pen just at the hour appointed will ever be better than poor creatures lady louisa stuart used to tell me of mr hoole the translator of tasso and ariosto and in that capacity a noble transmuter of gold into lead that he was a clerk in the india house with long ruffles and a snuffcoloured suit of clothes who occasionally visited her father john earl of bute she sometimes conversed with him and was amused to find that he did exactly so many couplets day by day neither more or less and habit had made it light to him however heavy it might seem to the reader  well but if i lay down the pen as the pain in my breast hints that i should what am i to do if i think why i shall weepand thats nonsense and i have no friend nownoneto receive my tediousness for halfanhour of the gloaming let me be gratefuli have good news from abbotsford  june 5though this be monday i am not able to feague it away as bayes says279 between correcting proofs and writing letters i have got as yet but two pages written and that with labour and a sensation of pain in the chest i may be bringing on some serious disease by working thus hard if i had once justice done to other folks i do not much care only i would not like to suffer long pain harden made me a visit he argued with me that lord m affichéd his own importance too much at the election and says henry is anxious about it i hinted to him the necessity of counterbalancing it the next time which will be soon  thomson also called about the bannatyne club  these two interruptions did me good though i am still a poor wretch  after all i have fagged through six pages and made poor wurmser lay down his sword on the glacis of mantuaand my head achesmy eyes achemy back achesso does my breastand i am sure my heart aches and what can duty ask more  june 6i arose much better this morning having taken some medicine which has removed the strange and aching feeling in my back and breast i believe it is from the diaphragm it must be looked to however i have not yet breakfasted yet have cleared half my days work holding it at the ordinary stint  worked hard john swinton my kinsman came to see mevery kind and affectionate in his manner my heart always warms to that swinton connection so faithful to old scottish feelings harden was also with me i talked with him about what lord m did at the election i find that he disapprovesi see these visits took place on the 5th  june 7again a day of hard work only at halfpast eight i went to the dean of facultys to a consultation about constable280 and met with said dean and mr js more and j gibson i find they have as high hope of success as lawyers ought to express and i think i know how our profession speak when sincere i cannot interest myself deeply in it when i had come home from such a business i used to carry the news to poor charlotte who dressed her face in sadness or mirth as she saw the news affect me this hangs lightly about me i had almost forgot the appointment if jg had not sent me a card i passed a piper in the street as i went to the deans and could not help giving him a shilling to play pibroch a donuil dhu for lucks sakewhat a child i am  june 8bilious and headache this morning a dog howld all night and left me little sleep poor cur i dare say he had his distresses as i have mine i was obliged to make dalgleish shut the windows when he appeared at halfpast six as usual and did not rise till nine when me voici i have often deserved a headache in my younger days without having one and nature is i suppose paying off old scores ay but then the want of the affectionate care that used to be ready with lowered voice and stealthy pace to smooth the pillowand offer condolence and assistancegonegonefor evereverever well there is another world and well meet free from the mortal sorrows and frailties which beset us here amen so be it let me change the topic with hand and head and the heart must follow  i think that sitting so many days and working so hard may have brought on this headache i must inflict a walk on myself today strange that what is my delight in the country is here a sort of penance well but now i think on it i will go to the chiefbaron and try to get his lordships opinion about the question with constable if i carry it as there is i trust much hope i shall mr gibson says there will be funds to divide 6s in the pound without counting upon getting anything from constable or hurst but sheer hard cash of my own such another pull is possible especially if boney succeeds and the rogue had a knack at success such another i say and we touch ground i believe for surely constable robinson etc must pay something the struggle is worth waring281 a headache upon  i finished five pages today headache laziness and all  june 9corrected a stubborn proof this morning these battles have been the death of many a mani think they will be mine well but it clears to windward so we will fag on  slept well last night by the way how intolerably selfish this journal makes me seemso much attention to ones naturals and nonnaturals lord mackenzie282 called and we had much chat about business the late regulations for preparing cases in the outerhouse do not work well and thus our old machinery which was very indifferent is succeeded by a kind that will hardly move at all mackenzie says his business is trebled and that he cannot keep it up i question whether the extreme strictness of rules of court be advisable in practice they are always evaded upon an equitable showing i do not for instance lodge a paper debito tempore and for an accident happening perhaps through the blunder of a writers apprentice i am to lose my cause the penalty is totally disproportioned to the delict and the consequence is that means are found out of evasion by legal fictions and the like the judges listen to these they become frequent and the rule of court ends by being a scarecrow merely formerly delays of this kind were checked by corresponding amendes but the court relaxed this petty fine too often had they been more strict and levied the mulct on the agents with no recourse upon their clients the abuse might have been remedied i fear the present rule is too severe to do much good  one effect of running causes fast through the courts below is that they go by scores to appeal and lord gifford283 has hitherto decided them with such judgment and so much rapidity as to give great satisfaction the consequence will in time be that the scottish supreme court will be in effect situated in london then down fallas

ere it came to that but it is a catastrophe which the great course of events brings daily nearer      and who can help it dick  i shall always be proud of malachi as having headed back the southron or helped to do so in one instance at least  june 10this was an unusual teindday at court in the morning and evening i corrected proofsfour sheets in number and i wrote my task of three pages and a little more three pages a day will come at constables rate to about £12000 to £15000 per year they have sent their claim it does not frighten me a bit  june 11bad dreams about poor charlotte woke thinking my old and inseparable friend beside me and it was only when i was fully awake that i could persuade myself that she was dark low and distant and that my bed was widowed i believe the phenomena of dreaming are in a great measure occasioned by the double touch which takes place when one hand is crossed in sleep upon another each gives and receives the impression of touch to and from the other and this complicated sensation our sleeping fancy ascribes to the agency of another being when it is in fact produced by our own limbs acting on each other well here goesincumbite remis  june 12finished volume third of napoleon i resumed it on the 1st of june the earliest period that i could bend my mind to it after my great loss since that time i have lived to be sure the life of a hermit except attending the court five days in the week for about three hours on an average except at that time i have been reading or writing on the subject of boney and have finished last night and sent to printer this morning the last sheets of fiftytwo written since 1st june it is an awful screed but grief makes me a housekeeper and to labour is my only resource ballantyne thinks well of the workvery well but i shall expect inaccuracies an it were to do again i would get some one to look it over but who could that some one be whom is there left of human race that i could hold such close intimacy with no one tanneguy du châtel ou estu285 worked five pages  june 13i took a walk out last evening after tea and called on lord chiefcommissioner and the macdonald buchanans that kind and friendly clan the heat is very great and the wrath of the bugs in proportion two hours last night i was kept in an absolute fever i must make some arrangement for winter great pity my old furniture was sold in such a hurry the wiser way would have been to have let the house furnished but its all one in the greek  peccavi peccavi dies quidem sine lineâ i walked to make calls got cruelly hot drank gingerbeer wrote letters then as i was going to dinner enter a big splayfooted trifleheaded old pottering minister who came to annoy me about a claim which one of his parishioners has to be earl of annandale and which he conceits to be established out of the border minstrelsy he mentioned a curious thingthat three brothers of the johnstone family on whose descendants the male representative of these great border chiefs devolved were forced to fly to the north in consequence of their feuds with the maxwells and agreed to change their names they slept on the side of the soutra hills and asking a shepherd the name of the place agreed in future to call themselves sowtra or sowter johnstones the old puddingheaded man could not comprehend a word i either asked him or told him and maundered till i wished him in the annandale beefstand286 mr gibson came in after tea and we talked business then i was lazy and stupid and dosed over a book instead of writing so on the whole confiteor confiteor culpa mea culpa mea  june 14in the morning i began with a page and a half before breakfast this is always the best way you stand like a child going to be bathed shivering and shaking till the first pitcherful is flung about your ears and then are as blithe as a waterwagtail i am just come home from parliament house and now my friend nap have at you with a downright blow methinks i would fain make peace with my conscience by doing six pages tonight bought a little bit of gruyère cheese instead of our domestic chokedog concern when did i ever purchase anything for my own eating but i will say no more of that and now to the breadmill  june 15i laboured all the evening but made little way there were many books to consult and so all i could really do was to make out my task of three pages i will try to make up the deficit of tuesday today and tomorrow letters from walterall well a visit yesterday from charles sharpe  june 16yesterday sate in the court till nearly four i had of course only time for my task i fear i will have little more today for i have accepted to dine at hectors i got yesterday a present of two engravings from sir henry raeburns portrait of me which poor fellow was the last he ever painted and certainly not his worst287 i had the pleasure to give one to young mr davidoff for his uncle the celebrated black captain of the campaign of 1812 curious that he should be interested in getting the resemblance of a person whose mode of attaining some distinction has been very different but i am sensible that if there be anything good about my poetry or prose either it is a hurried frankness of composition which pleases soldiers sailors and young people of bold and active disposition i have been no sigher in shadesno writer of      songs and sonnets and rustical roundelays     framed on fancies and whistled on reeds288  abbotsford saturday june 17left edinburgh today after parliament house to come here my two girls met me at torsonce which was a pleasant surprise and we returned in the sociable all together found everything right and well at abbotsford under the new regime i again took possession of the family bedroom and my widowed couch this was a sore trial but it was necessary not to blink such a resolution indeed i do not like to have it thought that there is any way in which i can be beaten289  june 18this morning wrote till halftwelvegood days workat canongate chronicles methinks i can make this work answer then drove to huntly burn and called at chiefswood walked home the country crying for rain yet on the whole the weather delicious dry and warm with a fine air of wind the young woods are rising in a kind of profusion i never saw elsewhere let me once clear off these encumbrances and they shall wave broader and deeper yet but to attain this i must work  wrought very fair accordingly till two then walked after dinner out again with the girls smoked two cigars first time these two months  june 19wrought very fair indeed and the day being scorching we dined al fresco in the hall among the armour and went out early in the evening walked to the lake and back again by the marle pool very delightful evening  june 20this is also a hardworking day hot weather is favourable for application were it not that it makes the composer sleepy pray god the reader may not partake the sensation but days of hard work make short journals today we again dine in the hall and drive to ashestiel in the evening pour prendre le frais  june 21we followed the same course we proposed for a party of pleasure i have attended to business well twenty pages of croftangry five printed pages each attest my diligence and i have had a delightful variation by the company of the two annes regulated my little expenses here  edinburgh june 22returned to my patmos heard good news from lockhart wife well and john hugh better he mentions poor southey testifying much interest for me even to tears it is oddam i so hardhearted a man i could not have wept for him though in distress i would have gone any length to serve him i sometimes think i do not deserve peoples good opinion for certainly my feelings are rather guided by reflection than impulse but everybody has his own mode of expressing interest and mine is stoical even in bitterest grief agere atque pati romanum est i hope i am not the worse for wanting the tenderness that i see others possess and which is so amiable i think it does not cool my wish to be of use where i can but the truth is i am better at enduring or acting than at consoling from childhoods earliest hour my heart rebelled against the influence of external circumstances in myself and others non est tanti  today i was detained in the court from halfpast ten till near four yet i finished and sent off a packet to cadell which will finish onethird of the chronicles vol 1st  henry scott came in while i was at dinner and sat while i ate my beefsteak a gourmand would think me much at a loss coming back to my ploughmans meal of boiled beef and scotch broth from the rather recherché table at abbotsford but i have no philosophy in my carelessness on that score it is naturalthough i am no ascetic as my father was  june 23the heat tremendous and the drought threatening the hay and barley crop got from the court at halftwelve and walked to the extremity of heriot row to see poor lady don left my card as she does not receive any one i am glad this painful meeting is adjourned i received today £10 from blackwood for the article on the omen time was i would not have taken these small tithes of mint and cummin but scornful dogs will eat dirty puddings and i with many depending on me must do the best i can with my timegod help me  blairadam june 24left edinburgh yesterday after the court halfpast twelve and came over here with the lord chiefbaron and william clerk to spend as usual a day or two at blairadam in general this is a very gay affair we hire a light coachandfour and scour the country in every direction in quest of objects of curiosity but the lord chiefcommissioners family misfortunes and my own make our holiday this year of a more quiet description than usual and a sensible degree of melancholy hangs on the reunion of our party it was wise however not to omit it for to slacken your hold on life in any agreeable point of connection is the sooner to reduce yourself to the indifference and passive vegetation of old age  june 25another melting day thermometer at 78° even here 80° was the height yesterday at edinburgh if we attempt any active proceeding we dissolve ourselves into a dew we have lounged away the morning creeping about the place sitting a great deal and walking as little as might be on account of the heat  blairadam has been successively in possession of three generations of persons attached to and skilled in the art of embellishment and may be fairly taken as a place where art and taste have done a great deal to improve nature a long ridge of varied ground sloping to the foot of the hill called benarty and which originally was of a bare mossy boggy character has been clothed by the son father and grandfather while the undulations and hollows which seventy or eighty years since must have looked only like wrinkles in the black morasses being now drained and limed are skirted with deep woods particularly of spruce which thrives wonderfully and covered with excellent grass we drove in the droskie and walked in the evening  june 26another day of unmitigated heat thermometer 82 must be higher in edinburgh where i return tonight when the decline of the sun makes travelling practicable it will be well for my work to be therenot quite so well for me there is a difference between the clean nice arrangement of blairadam and mrs browns accommodations though he who is insured against worse has no right to complain of them but the studious neatness of poor charlotte has perhaps made me fastidious she loved to see things clean even to oriental scrupulosity so oddly do our deep recollections of other kinds correspond with the most petty occurrences of our life  lord chiefbaron told us a story of the ruling passion strong in death a master in chancery was on his deathbeda very wealthy man some occasion of great urgency occurred in which it was necessary to make an affidavit and the attorney missing one or two other masters whom he inquired after ventured to ask if mr  would be able to receive the deposition the proposal seemed to give him momentary strength his clerk sent for and the oath taken in due form the master was lifted up in bed and with difficulty subscribed the paper as he sank down again he made a signal to his clerkwallacesiryour earlowerlower have you got the halfcrown he was dead before morning  edinburgh june 27returned to edinburgh late last night and had a most sweltering night of it this day also cruel hot however i made a task or nearly so and read a good deal about the egyptian expedition had comfortable accounts of anne and through her of sophia dr shaw doubts if anything is actually the matter with poor johnnies back i hope the dear child will escape deformity and the infirmities attending that helpless state i have myself been able to fight up very well notwithstanding my lameness but it has cost great efforts and i am besides very strong dined with colin mackenzie a fine family all growing up about him turning men and women and treading fast on our heels some thunder and showers which i fear will be but partial hothothot  june 28another hot morning and something like an idle day though i have read a good deal but i have slept also corrected proofs and prepared for a great start by filling myself with facts and ideas  june 29i walked out for an hour last night and made one or two callsthe evening was delightful      day its sultry fires had wasted       calm and cool the moonbeam rose     even a captives bosom tasted       half oblivion of his woes290  i wonder often how tom campbell with so much real genius has not maintained a greater figure in the public eye than he has done of late the magazine seems to have paralysed him the author not only of the pleasures of hope but of hohenlinden lochiel etc should have been at the very top of the tree somehow he wants audacity fears the public and what is worse fears the shadow of his own reputation he is a great corrector too which succeeds as ill in composition as in education many a clever boy is flogged into a dunce and many an original composition corrected into mediocrity yet tom campbell ought to have done a great deal more his youthful promise was great john leyden introduced me to him they afterwards quarrelled when i repeated hohenlinden to leyden he said dash it man tell the fellow that i hate him but dash him he has written the finest verses that have been published these fifty years i did mine errand as faithfully as one of homers messengers and had for answer tell leyden that i detest him but i know the value of his critical approbation this feud was therefore in the way of being taken up when leyden comes back from india said tom campbell what cannibals he will have eaten and what tigers he will have torn to pieces  gave a poor poetess £1 gibson writes me that £2300 is offered for the poor house it is worth £300 more but i will not oppose my own opinion or convenience to good and wellmeant counsel so farewell poor no 39 what a portion of my life has been spent there it has sheltered me from the prime of life to its decline and now i must bid goodbye to it i have bid goodbye to my poor wife so long its courteous and kind mistressand i need not care about the empty rooms yet it gives me a turn i have been so long a citizen of edinburgh now an indweller only never mind all in the days work  j ballantyne and b cadell dined with me and as pepys would say all was very handsome drank amongst us one bottle of champagne one of claret a glass or two of port and each a tumbler of whisky toddy jb had courage to drink his with hot water mine was iced  june 30here is another dreadful warm day fit for nobody but the flies and then one is confined to town  yesterday i agreed to let cadell have the new work291 edition 1500 he paying all charges and paying also £500two hundred and fifty at lammas to pay j gibson money advanced on the passage of young walter my nephew to india it is like a thorn in ones eye this sort of debt and gibson is young in business and somewhat involved in my affairs besides our plan is that this same miscellany or chronicle shall be committed quietly to the public and we hope it will attract attention if it does not we must turn public attention to it ourselves about one half of vol i is written and there is worse abomination or i mistake the matter  i was detained in court till four dreadfully close and obliged to drink water for refreshment which formerly i used to scorn even on the moors with a burning august sun the heat of exercise and a hundred springs gushing around me  corrected proofs etc on my return i think i have conquered the trustees objections to carry on

materials apropos of this mr skene relatesin one of our frequent walks to the pier of leith to which the freshness of the sea breeze offered a strong inducement to those accustomed to pass a few of the morning hours within the close and impure atmosphere of the court of session i happened to meet with and to recognise the master of a vessel in which i had sailed in the mediterranean our recognition of each other seemed to give mutual satisfaction as the cordial grasp of the seamans hard fist effectually indicated it was some years since we had been shipmates he had since visited almost every quarter of the globe but he shook his head and looked serious when he came to mention his last trip he had commanded a whaler and having been for weeks exposed to great stress of weather in the polar regions finally terminated in the total loss of his vessel with most of her equipage in the course of a dark tempestuous night when thrown on her beamends my friend had been washed overboard and in his struggles to keep himself above water had got hold of a piece of ice on the top of which he at length succeeded in raising himselfand there i was sir on a cursed dark dirty night squatted on a round lump of floating ice for all the world like a teatable adrift in the middle of a stormy sea without being able to see whether there was any hope within sight and having enough ado to hold on cold as my seat was with sometimes one end of me in the water and sometimes the other as the illfashioned crank thing kept whirling and whomeling about all night however praised be god daylight had not been long in when a boats crew on the outlook hove in sight and taking me for a basking seal and maybe i was not unlike that same up they came of themselves for neither voice nor hand had i to signal them and if they lost their blubber faith sir they did get a willing prize on board so after just a little bit gliff of a prayer for the mercy that sent them to my help i soon came to myself again and now that i am landed safe and sound i am walking about ye see like a gentleman till i get some new craft to try the trade againsir walter who was leaning on my arm during this narrative had not taken any share in the dialogue and kept gazing to seaward with his usual heavy absorbed expression and only joined in wishing the seaman better success in his next trip as we parted however the detail had by no means escaped his notice but dropping into the fertile soil of his mind speedily yielded fruit quite characteristic of his habits we happened that evening to dine in company together i was not near sir walter at table but in the course of the evening my attention was called to listen to a narrative with which he was entertaining those around him and he seemed as usual to have excited the eager interest of his hearers the commencement of the story i had not heard but soon perceived that a shipwreck was the theme which he described with all the vivid touches of his fancy marshalling the incidents and striking features of the situation with a degree of dexterity that seemed to bring all the horrors of a polar storm home to every ones mind and although it occurred to me that our rencontre in the morning with the shipwrecked whaler might have recalled a similar story to his recollection it was not until he came to mention the teatable of ice that i recognised the identity of my friends tale which had luxuriated to such an extent in the fertile soil of the poets imagination as to have left the original germ in comparative insignificance he cast a glance towards me at the close and observed with a significant nod you see you did not hear onehalf of that honest seamans story this morning it was such slender hints which in the common intercourse of life must have hourly dropped on the soil of his retentive memory that fed the exuberance of sir walters invention and supplied the seemingly inexhaustible stream of fancy from which he drew forth

sunny day this threatens absolutely syrian drought as the selkirk election comes on monday i go out today to abbotsford and carry young davidoff and his tutor with me to see our quiet way of managing the choice of a national representative  i wrote a page or two last night slumbrously  abbotsford july 2late at court got to abbotsford last night with count davidoff about eight oclock i worked a little this morning then had a long and warm walk mr and mrs hamilton from chiefswood the present inhabitants of lockharts cottage dined with us which made the society pleasant he is a fine soldierlylooking man292though affected with paralysishis wife a sweet goodhumoured little woman he is supposed to be a writer in blackwoods magazine since we were to lose the lockharts we could scarce have had more agreeable folks  at selkirk where borthwickbrae was elected with the usual unanimity of the forest freeholders this was a sight to my young muscovite we walked in the evening to the lake  july 5still very hot but with thunder showers wrote till breakfast then walked and signed the deathwarrant of a number of old firs at abbotstown i hope their deaths will prove useful their lives are certainly not ornamental young mr davidoff entered upon the cause of the late discontents in russia which he imputes to a deepseated jacobin conspiracy to overthrow the state and empire and establish a government by consuls  edinburgh july 6returned last night with my frozen muscovites to the capital and suffered as usual from the incursions of the black horse during the night it was absolute fever a bunch of letters but little interesting mr barry cornwall293 writes to condole with me i think our acquaintance scarce warranted this but it is well meant and modestly done i cannot conceive the idea of forcing myself on strangers in distress and i have half a mind to turn sharp round on some of my consolers came home from court rp gillies called he is writing a satire he has a singular talent of aping the measure and tone of byron and this poem goes to the tune of don juan but it is the champagne after it has stood two days with the cork drawn thereafter came charles k sharpe and will clerk as robinson sayeth to my exceeding refreshment294 and last not least mr jollie one of the triumvirs who manage my poor matters he consents to going on with the small edition of novels which he did not before comprehend all this has consumed the day but we will make up tideway presently i must dress to go to lord medwyn295 to dinner and it is near time  july 7coming home from lord medwyns last night i fell in with willie clerk and went home to drink a little shrub and water over which we chatted of old stories until halfpast eleven this morning i corrected two proofs of croftangry which is getting on but there must be a little check with the throng of business at the close of the session dn the session i wish it would close its eyes for a century it is too bad to be kept broiling here but on the other hand we must have the instinctive gratitude of the laird of mintosh who was for the king that gave mintosh halfaguinea the day and halfaguinea the morn so i retract my malediction  received from blackwood to account sales of malachi £72 with some odd shillings this was for copies sold to banks the cash comes far from illtimed having to clear all odds and ends before i leave edinburgh this will carry me on tidily till 25th when precepts become payable well if malachi did me some mischief he must also contribute quodam modo to my comfort  july 8wrote a good task this morning i may be mistaken but i do think the tale of elspat mctavish296 in my bettermost mannerbut jb roars for chivalry he does not quite understand that everything may be overdone in this world or sufficiently estimate the necessity of novelty the highlanders have been off the field now for some time  returning from court looked into a show of wild beasts and saw nero the great lion whom they had the cruelty to bait with bulldogs against whom the noble creature disdained to exert his strength he was lying like a prince in a large cage where you might be admitted if you wish i had a months mind but was afraid of the newspapers i could be afraid of nothing else for never did a creature seem more gentle and yet majestici longed to caress him wallace the other lion born in scotland seemed much less trustworthy he handled the dogs as his namesake did the southron  enter a confounded dousterswivel called burschal or some such name patronised by john lockhart teacher of german and learner of english  he opened the trenches by making me a present of a german work called der bibelische orient then began to talk of literature at large and display his own pretensions asked my opinion of gray as a poet and wished me to subscribe an attestation of his own merits for the purpose of getting him scholars as i hinted my want of acquaintance with his qualifications i found i had nearly landed myself in a proof for he was girding up his loins to repeated thundering translations by himself into german hebrew until thinking it superfluous to stand on very much ceremony with one who used so little with me hinted at letters to write and got him to translate himself elsewhere  saw a good house in brunswick street which i liked this evening supped with thomas thomson about the affairs of the bannatyne there was the dean will clerk john thomson young smythe of methven very pleasant  july 9rather slumbrous today from having sat up till twelve last night we settled or seemed to settle on an election for the bannatyne club there are people who would wish to confine it much to one party but those who were together last night saw it in the true and liberal point of view as a great national institution which may do much good in the way of publishing our old records providing we do not fall into the usual habit of antiquarians and neglect what is useful for things that are merely curious thomson is a host for such an undertaking i wrote a good days work at the canongate matter notwithstanding the intervention of two naps i get sleepy oftener than usual it is the weather i supposenaboclish297 i am near the end of the first volume and every step is one out of difficulty  july 10slept too long this morning it was eight before i rosehalfpast eight ere i came into the parlour terry and j ballantyne dined with me yesterday and i suppose the wassail though there was little enough of it had stuck to my pillow  this morning i was visited by a mr lewis a smart cockney whose object is to amend the handwriting he uses as a mechanical aid a sort of puzzle of wire and ivory which is put upon the fingers to keep them in the desired position like the muzzle on a dogs nose to make him bear himself right in the field it is ingenious and may be useful if the man comes here as he proposes in winter i will take lessons bear witness good reader that if ws writes a cramp hand as is the case he is desirous to mend it  dined with john swinton en famille he told me an odd circumstance coming from berwickshire in the mail coach he met with a passenger who seemed more like a military man than anything else they talked on all sorts of subjects at length on politics malachis letters were mentioned when the stranger observed they were much more seditious than some expressions for which he had three or four years ago been nearly sent to botany bay and perceiving john swinton surprised at this avowal he added i am kinloch of kinloch this gentleman had got engaged in the radical business the only real gentleman by the way who did and harangued the weavers of dundee with such emphasis that he would have been tried and sent to botany bay had he not fled abroad he was outlawed and only restored to his status on a composition with government it seems to have escaped mr kinloch that the conduct of a man who places a lighted coal in the middle of combustibles and upon the floor is a little different from that of one who places the same quantity of burning fuel in a firegrate298  july 11the last day of the session and as toilsome a one as i ever saw there were about 100 or 120 cases on the roll and most of them of an incidental character which gives us clerks the greatest trouble for it is the grasshopper that is a burthen to us came home about four tired and hungry i wrought little or none indeed i could not having books and things to pack went in the evening to sup with john murray299 where i met will clerk thomson henderland and charles stuart blantyre and had of course a pleasant party i came late home though for me and was not in bed till past midnight it would not do for me to do this often  july 12i have the more reason to eschew evening parties that i slept two mornings till past eight these vigils would soon tell on my utility as the divines call it but this is the last day in town and the world shall be amended i have been trying to mediate between the unhappy rp gillies and his uncle lord g the latter talks like a man of sense and a good relation and would i think do something for epg if he would renounce temporary expedients and bring his affairs to a distinct crisis but this ep will not hear of but flatters himself with ideas which seem to me quite visionary i could make nothing of him but i conclude offended him by being of his uncles opinion rather than his as to the mode of extricating his affairs  i am to dine out today and i would fain shirk and stay at home never shylocklike had i less will to feasting forth but i must go or be thought sulky lord m and lady abercromby called this morning and a world of people besides among others honest mr wilson late of wilsontown who took so much care of me at london sending fresh eggs and all sorts of good things well i have dawdled and written letters sorely against the grain all day also i have been down to see will allans picture of the landing of queen mary which he has begun in a great style also i have put my letters and papers to rights which only happens when i am about to move and now having nothing left to do i must go and dress myself  july 13dined yesterday with lord abercromby at a party he gave to lord melville and some old friends who formed the contemporary club lord m and i met with considerable feeling on both sides and all our feuds were forgotten and forgiven i conclude so at least because one or two people whom i know to be sharp observers of the weatherglass on occasion of such squalls have been earnest with me to meet lord m at partieswhich i am well assured they would not have been had i been horace come to life again300 were they not sure the breeze was over for myself i am happy that our usual state of friendship should be restored though i could not have come down proud stomach to make advances which is among friends always the duty of the richer and more powerful of the two  today i leave mrs browns lodgings altogether i cannot complain but the insects were voracious even until last night when the turtlesoup and champagne ought to have made me sleep like a top but i have done a monstrous sight of work here notwithstanding the indolence of this last week which must and shall be amended      so goodby mrs brown     i am going out of town     over dale over down     where bugs bite not     where lodgers fight not     where below you chairmen drink not     where beside you gutters stink not     but all is fresh and clean and gay     and merry lambkins sport and play     and they toss with rakes uncommonly short hay     which looks as if it had been sown only the other day     and where oats are at twentyfive shillings a boll they say     but alls one for that since i must and will away  july 14 abbotsfordarrived here yesterday before five oclock anybody would think from the falderal conclusion of my journal of yesterday that i left town in a very gay humourcujus contrarium verum est but nature has given me a kind of buoyancy i know not what to call it that mingles even with my deepest afflictions and most gloomy hours i have a secret pridei fancy it will be so most truly termedwhich impels me to mix with my distresses strange snatches of mirth which have no mirth in them in fact the journey hither the absence of the affectionate friend that used to be my companion on the journey and many mingled thoughts of bitterness have given me a fit of the bile  july 15this day i did not attempt to work but spent my time in the morning in making the necessary catalogue and distribution of two or three chests of books which i have got home from the binder niece anne acting as my amanuensis in the evening we drove to huntly burn and took tea there returning home we escaped a considerable danger the iron screw bolts of the drivingseat suddenly giving way the servants were very nearly precipitated upon the backs of the horses had it been down hill instead of being on the level the horses must have taken fright and the consequences might have been fatal indeed they had almost taken fright as it was had not peter matheson301 who in mr fags phrase i take to be the discreetest of whips302 kept his presence of mind when losing his equilibrium so that he managed to keep the horses in hand until we all got out i must say it is not the first imminent danger on which i have seen peter my automedon for near twentyfive years behave with the utmost firmness  july 16very unsatisfactory today sleepy stupid indolentfinished arranging the books and after that was totally uselessunless it can be called study that i slumbered for three or four hours over a variorum edition of the gillshills tragedy303 admirable recipe for low spiritsfor not to mention the brutality of so extraordinary a murder it led john bull into one of his uncommon fits of gambols until at last he become so maudlin as to weep for the pitiless assassin thurtell and treasure up the leaves and twigs of the hedge and shrubs in the fatal garden as valuable relicsnay thronged the minor theatres to see the very roan horse and yellow gig in which the body was transported from one place to another i have not stept over the threshold today so very stupid have i been  july 17desidiæ longum valedixi our time is like our money when we change a guinea the shillings escape as things of small account when we break a day by idleness in the morning the rest of the hours lose their importance in our eye i set stoutly to work about seven this morning to boney      and long ere dinnertime i have       full eight close pages wrote     what duty hast thou now to crave       well done sir walter scott  july 18this as yesterday has been a day of unremitting labour though i only got through half the quantity of manuscript owing to drowsiness a most disarming annoyance i walked a little before dinner and after tea but was unable to go with the girls and charles to the top of cauldshiels hill i fear my walking powers are diminishing but why not they have been wonderfully long efficient all things considered only i fear i shall get fat and fall into diseases well things must be as they may let us use the time and faculties which god has left us and trust futurity to his guidance amen  this is the day of st boswells fair that watery saint has for once had a dry festival  july 19wrote a page this morning but no more corrected proofs however and went to selkirk to hold sheriff court this consumed the forenoon colonel and miss ferguson with mr and mrs laidlaw dined and occupied the evening the rain seemed to set in this night  july 20today rainy a morning and forenoon of hard work about five pages which makes up for yesterdays lee way i am sadly tired however but as i go to mertoun at four and spend the night there the exertion was necessary  july 21to mertoun we went accordingly lord and lady minto were there with part of their family david haliburton etc besides their own large family so my lodging was a little room which i had not occupied since i was a bachelor but often before in my frequent intercourse with this kind and hospitable family feeling myself returned to that celibacy which renders many accommodations indifferent which but lately were indispensable my imagination drew a melancholy contrast between the young man entering the world on fire for fame and restless in imagining means of coming by it and the aged widower blasé on the point of literary reputation deprived of the social comforts of a married state and looking back to regret instead of looking forward to hope this brought bad sleep and unpleasing dreams but if i cannot hope to be what i have been i will not if i can help it suffer vain repining to make me worse than i may be  we left mertoun after breakfast and the two annes and i visited lady raeburn at lessudden my aunt is now in her ninetieth yearso clean so nice so well arranged in every respect that it makes old age lovely she talks both of late and former events with perfect possession of her faculties and has only failed in her limbs a great deal of kind feeling has survived in spite of the frost of years  home to dinner and worked all the afternoon among the moniteursto little purpose for my principal acquisition was a headache i wrote nothing today but part of a trifle for blackwood  july 22the same severe headache attends my poor pate but i have worked a good deal this morning and will do more i wish to have half the volume sent into town on monday if possible it will be a royal effort and more than make up for the blanks of this week  july 23i wrote very hard this day and attained page 40 45 would be more than half the volume colonel russell came about one and carried me out awalking which i was all the better of in the evening we expected terry and his wife but they did not come which makes me fear she may be unwell again  july 24a great number of proofsheets to revise and send off and after that i took a fancy to give a more full account of the constitution framed by sieyèsa complicated and ingenious web it is but far too fine and critical to be practically useful  july 25terry and wife arrived yesterday both very well at dinnertime today came dr jamieson304 of the scottish dictionary an excellent good man and full of auld scottish cracks which amuse me well enough but are caviare to the young people a little prolix and heavy is the good doctor somewhat prosaic and accustomed to much attention on the sunday from his congregation and i hope on the six other days from his family so he will demand full attention from all and sundry before he begins a story and once begun there is no chance of his ending  july 26this day went to selkirk and held a court the doctor and terry chose to go with me captain and mrs hamilton came to dinner desperate warm weather little done in the literary way except sending off proofs roup of standing corn etc went off very indifferently letter from ballantyne wanting me to write about absentees but i have enough to do without burning my fingers with politics  july 27up and at it this morning and finished four pages an unpleasant letter from london as if i might be troubled by some of the creditors there when going to town to get materials for nap i have no wish to gonone at all i would even like to put off my visit so far as john lockhart and my daughter are concerned and see them when the meeting could be more pleasant but then having an offer to see the correspondence from st helena i can make no doubt that i ought to go however if it is to infer any danger to my personal freedom english wind will not blow on me it is monstrous hard to prevent me doing what is certainly the best for all parties  july 28i am wellnigh choked with the sulphurous heat of the weatheror i am unwell for i perspire as if i had been walking hard and my hand is as nervous as a paralytics read through and corrected st ronans well i am no judge but i think the language of this piece rather good then i must allow the fashionable portraits are not the true thing i am too much out of the way to see and remark the ridiculous in society the story is terribly contorted and unnatural and the catastrophe is melancholy which should always be avoided no matter i have corrected it for the press305  the worthy lexicographer left us today somewhat ponderous he is poor soul but there are excellent things about him  action and reactionscots proverb the unrest ie pendulum of a clock goes aye as far the ae gait as the tother  walters account of his various quarters per last despatch query if original      loughrea is a blackguard place       to gort i give my curse     athlone itself is bad enough       but ballinrobe is worse     i cannot tell which is the worst       theyre all so very bad     but of all towns i ever saw       bad luck to kinnegad  old mr haliburton dined with us also colonel russell what a man for fourscore or thereby is old halyan indian too he came home in 1785  july 29yesterday i wrought little and light work almost stifled by the smothering heat today i wrought about half task in the morning and as a judgment on me i think for yesterdays sloth mr h stayed unusually late in the forenoon he is my friend my fathers friend and an excellent sensible man besides and a man of eighty and upwards may be allowed to talk long because in the nature of things he cannot have long to talk if i do a task today i hope to send a good parcel on monday and keep tryst pretty well  july 30i did better yesterday than i had hoped forfour instead of three pages which considering how my time was cut up by prolonged morning lounging with friend haly was pretty fair i wrote a good task before eleven oclock but then my good friends twaddled and dawdled for near two hours before they set off the time devoted to hospitality especially to those whom i can reckon upon as sincere good friends i never grudge but like to welcome the coming speed the parting guest by my will every guest should part at halfpast ten or arrange himself to stay for the day  we had a long walk in a sweltering hot day met mr blackwood coming to call and walked him on with us so blinked his visitgratias domine asked him for breakfast tomorrow to make amends i rather overwalked myselfthe heat considered  july 31sti corrected six sheets and sent them off with eight leaves of copy so i keep forward pretty well blackwood the bookseller came over from chiefswood to breakfast and this kept me idle till eleven oclock at twelve i went out with the girls in the sociable and called on the family at bemerside on dr306 and mrs brewster and mr bainbridge at gattonside house it was five ere we got home so there was a day dished unless the afternoon does something for us i am keeping up pretty well however and after all visitors will come and calls must be made i must not let anne forego the

nothing for the idlesse of the morning i was hungry eat and drank and became drowsy then i took to arranging the old plays of which terry had brought me about a dozen and dipping into them scrambled through two one called michaelmas term307 full of traits of manners and another a sort of bouncing tragedy called the hector of germany or the palsgrave308 the last worthless in the extreme is like many of the plays in the beginning of the seventeenth century written to a good tune the dramatic poets of that time seem to have possessed as jointstock a highly poetical and abstract tone of language so that the worst of them often remind you of the very best the audience must have had a much stronger sense of poetry in those days than now since language was received and applauded at the fortune or at the red bull309 which could not now be understood by any general audience in great britain this leads far  this morning i wrote two hours then out with tom purdie and gave directions about thinning all the plantations above abbotsford properly so called came in at one oclock and now set to work debout debout lyciscas debout310 finished four leaves  august 2well and today i finished before dinner five leaves more and i would crow a little about it but here comes duty like an old housekeeper to an idle chambermaid hear her very words  dutyoh you crow do you pray can you deny that your sitting so quiet at work was owing to its raining heavily all the forenoon and indeed till dinnertime so that nothing would have stirred out that could help it save a duck or a goose i trow if it had been a fine day by noon there would have been aching of the head throbbing shaking and so forth to make an apology for going out  egomet ipseand whose head ever throbbed to go out when it rained mrs duty  dutyanswer not to me with a foolborn jest as your poor friend erskine used to say to you when you escaped from his good advice under the fire of some silly pun you smoke a cigar after dinner and i never check youdrink tea too which is loss of time and then instead of writing me one other page or correcting those you have written out you rollick into the woods till you have not a dry thread about you and here you sit writing down my words in your foolish journal instead of minding my advice  egowhy mrs duty i would as gladly be friends with you as crabbes311 tradesman fellow with his conscience but you should have some consideration with human frailty  dutyreckon not on that but however goodnight for the present i would only recommend to you to think no thoughts in which i am not mingledto read no books in which i have no concernto write three sheets of botheration all the six days of the week per diem and on the seventh to send them to the printer thus advising i heartily bid you farewell  egofarewell madam exit duty and be dd to ye for an unreasonable bitch the devil must be in this greedy gled as the earl of angus said to his hawk will she never be satisfied312 i believe in my soul she is the very hag who haunted the merchant abudah313  ill have my great chest upstairs exorcised but first ill take a nap till supper which must take place within ten minutes  august 3wrote half a task in the morning from eleven till halfpast eight in selkirk taking precognitions about a row and came home famished and tired now mrs duty do you think there is no other duty of the family but yourself or can the sheriffdepute neglect his duty that the author may mind his the thing cannot be the people of selkirk must have justice as well as the people of england books so the two duties may go pull caps about it my conscience is clear  august 4wrote to miss edgeworth on her sisters marriage which consumed the better part of the morning i must read for marengo item i must look at the pruning item at the otter hunt but my hope is constant to make up a good days task notwithstanding failed in finding the otter and was tired and slept and did but a poor days work  august 6wrote today a very good days work walked to chiefswood and saw old mrs tytler314 a friend when life was young her husband lord woodhouselee was a kind amiable and accomplished man and when we lived at lasswade cottage soon after my marriage we saw a great deal of the family who were very kind to us as newly entered on the world315 walked home and worked in the evening four leaves finished  august 7my niece anne leaves us this morning summoned back from one scene of distress to another her uncle david macculloch is extremely illa paralytic stroke i fancy she is a charming girl ladylike in thought and action and very pleasant in society we are to dine today with our neighbours at gattonside meantime i will avail myself of my disposition to labour and work instead of journalising  mr h cranstoun316 looked in a morning call he is become extremely deaf he gave me a letter from the countess purgstall his sister which i have not the heart to open so many reproaches i have deserved for not writing it is a sad thing though to task eyes as hard wrought as mine to keep up correspondence dined at gattonside317  august 8wrote my task this morning and now for walk dine today at chiefswood have company tomorrow why this is dissipation but no matter mrs duty if the task is done ay but says she you ought to do something extraprovide against a rainy day not i ill make a rainy day provide against a fair one mrs duty i write twice as much in bad weather seriously i write fully as much as i ought i do not like this dull aching in the chest and the back and its giving way to exercise shows that it originates in remaining too long in a sitting posture so ill take the field while the day is good  august 9i wrote only two leaves today but with as many additions as might rank for three i had a long and warm walk mrs tytler of woodhouselee the hamiltons and colonel ferguson dined here how many early stories did the old ladys presence recall she might almost be my mother yet there we sat like two people of another generation talking of things and people the rest knew nothing of when a certain period of life is survived the difference of years between the survivors even when considerable becomes of much less consequence  august 10rose early and wrote hard till two when i went with anne to minto the place being new to my companion gave her much amusement we found the scotts of harden etc and had a very pleasant party i like lady m particularly but missed my facetious and lively friend lady anna maria318 it is the fashion for women and silly men to abuse her as a bluestocking if to have wit good sense and goodhumour mixed with a strong power of observing and an equally strong one of expressing the result be blue she shall be as blue as they will such cant is the refuge of persons who fear those who they think can turn them into ridicule it is a common trick to revenge supposed raillery with good substantial calumny slept at minto  august 11i was up as usual and wrote about two leaves meaning to finish my task at home but found my sheriffsubstitute319 here on my return which took up the evening but i shall finish the volume on sunday that is less than a month after beginning it the same exertion would bring the book out at martinmas but december is a better time  august 12wrote a little in the morning then duty and i have settled that this is to be a kind of holiday providing the volume be finished tomorrow i went to breakfast at chiefswood and after that affair was happily transacted i wended me merrily to the black cock stripe and there caused tom purdie and john swanston cut out a quantity of firs got home about two oclock and set to correct a set of proofs james ballantyne presages well of this work but is afraid of inaccuraciesso am ibut things must be as they may there is a kind of glamour about me which sometimes makes me read dates etc in the proofsheets not as they actually do stand but as they ought to stand i wonder if a pill of holy trefoil would dispel this fascination  by the way john swanston measured a young shoot that was growing remarkably and found that for three days successively it grew half an inch every day fineear320 used to hear the grass growhow far off would he have heard this extravagant rapidity of vegetation the tree is a silver fir or spruce in the patch at the greentongue park  august 13yesterday i was tired of labouring in the rough ground well i must be content to feel my disabilities increase one sure thing is that all wise men will soon contrive to lay aside inclination when performance grows toilsome i have hobbled over many a rough heugh in my dayno wonder if i must sing at last      thus says the auld man to the aik tree     sair failed hinny since i kennd thee  but here are many a mile of smooth walk just when i grow unable to face bent and brae and here is the garden when all fails to a sailor the length of his quarterdeck is a good space of exercising ground  i wrote a good task today then walked to the lake then came back by three oclock hungering and thirsting to finish the volume i have seldom such fits of voluntary industry so duty shall have the benefit  finished volume iv this eveningdeo gratias  august 14this is a morning i have not seen many a day for it appears to set in for a rainy day it has not kept its word though i was seized by a fit of the clevers and finished my task by twelve oclock and hope to add something in the evening i was guilty however of some waywardness for i began volume v of boney instead of carrying on the canongate as i proposed the reason however was that i might not forget the information i had acquired about the treaty of amiens  august 15the weather seems decidedly broken yesterday indeed cleared up but this day seems to persevere in raining naboclish its a rarity nowadays i write on though a little afflicted with the oppression on my chest sometimes i think it is something dangerous but as it always goes away on change of posture it cannot be speedily so i want to finish my task and then goodnight i will never relax my labour in these affairs either for fear of pain or love of life i will die a free man if hard working will do it accordingly today i cleared the ninth leaf which is the tenth part of a volume in two daysfour and a half leaves a day walter and jane with mrs jobson are arrived to interrupt me  august 16god be praised for restoring to me my dear children in good health which has made me happier than anything that has happened these several months walter and jane appear cordial and happy in each other the greatest blessing heaven can bestow on them or me who witness it if we had lockhart and sophia there would be a meeting of the beings dearest to me in life walked to huntly burn where i found a certain lady on a visitso youthy so beautiful so strong in voicewith sense and learningabove all so fond of good conversation that in compassion to my eyes ears and understanding i bolted in the middle of a tremendous shower of rain and rather chose to be wet to the skin than to be bethumped with words at that rate there seemed more than i of the same opinion for col ferguson chose the ducking rather than the conversation young mr surtees came this evening  august 17wrote half a leaf short of my task having proofs etc to correct and being called early to walk with the ladies i have gained three leaves in the two following days so i cannot blame myself sat cito si sat bene sat boni i am surei may saya truly execrable pun that hope no one will find it out  in the evening we had music from the girls and the voice of the harp and viol were heard in my halls once more which have been so long deprived of mirth it is with a mixed sensation i hear these sounds i look on my children and am happy and yet every now and then a pang shoots across my heart it seems so strange that my poor wife should not be there but enough of this colonel ferguson dined  august 18again i fell a half page behind being summoned out too early for my task but i am still two leaves before on the whole week it is natural to see as much of these young people as i can walter talks of the ionian islands it is an awful distance a long walk in very warm weather music in the evening  august 19this morning wrote none excepting extracts etc being under the necessity of reading and collating a great deal which lasted till one oclock or thereabouts when dr and mrs brewster and their young people came to spend a day of happiness at the lake we were met there by captain and mrs hamilton and a full party since the days of seged emperor of ethiopia321 these days of appointed sport and happiness have seldom answered but we came off indifferently well we did not indeed catch much fish but we lounged about in a delightful day eat and drankand the children who are very fine infantry were clamorously enjoying themselves we sounded the loch in two or three different placesthe deepest may be sixty feet i was accustomed to think it much more but your deepest pools like your deepest politicians and philosophers often turn out more shallow than was expected the whole party dine with us  august 20wrote four leaves the day wet and rainy though not uniformly so no temptation however to play truant so this will make some amends for a blank day yesterday i am far in advance of the press but it is necessary if i go to drumlanrig on wednesday as i intend and to lochore next week which i also meditate this will be no great interruption however if i can keep the canongate moving for i shall be more than half a volume in advance with napoleon  august 21wrought out my task though much bothered with a cold in my head and face how caught i know not mrs crampton wife of the surgeongeneral322 in ireland sends to say she is hereabouts so we ask her hospitality must not be neglected and most hospitable are the cramptons all the calliachs323 from huntly burn are to be here and anne wishes we may have enough of dinner naboclish it is hoped there will be a pièce de résistance  august 22mrs and misses crampton departed i was rather sorry to give them such brief entertainment for they were extremely kind but going to eildon hall today and to drumlanrig tomorrow there was nothing more could be done for them it is raining now successfully as old macfarlane of the arroquhar used to say what is the odds we get a soaking before we cross the birkendaillywet against dry ten to one  august 23 bittocks bridgeset off cheerily with walter charles and surtees in the sociable to make our trip to drumlanrig we breakfasted at mr boyds broadmeadows and were received with yarrow hospitality from thence climbed the yarrow and skirted saint marys lake and ascended the birkhill path under the moist and misty influence of the genius loci never mind my companions were merry and i cheerful when old people can be with the young without fatiguing them or themselves their tempers derive the same benefits which some fantastic physicians of old supposed accrued to their constitutions from the breath of the young and healthy you have not cannot again have their gaiety of pleasure in seeing sights but still it reflects itself upon you and you are cheered and comforted our luncheon eaten in the herds cottage but the poor woman saddened me unawares by asking for poor charlotte whom she had often seen there with me she put me in mind that i had come twice over those hills and bogs with a wheeledcarriage before the road now an excellent one was made i knew it was true but on my soul looking where we must have gone i could hardly believe i had been such a fool for riding pass if you will but to put ones neck in such a venture with a wheeledcarriage was too silly here we are however at bittocks inn for this night  drumlanrig august 24this morning lunched at parkgate under a very heavy shower and then pushed on to drumlanrig where i was pleased to see the old castle and old servants solicitous and anxious to be civil what visions does not this magnificent old house bring back to me the exterior is much improved since i first knew it it was then in the state of dilapidation to which it had been abandoned by the celebrated old q324 and was indeed scarce wind and water tight then the whole wood had been felled and the outraged castle stood in the midst of waste and desolation excepting a few scattered old stumps not judged worth the cutting now the whole has been ten or twelve years since completely replanted and the scattered seniors look as graceful as fathers surrounded by their children the face of this immense estate has been scarcely less wonderfully changed the scrambling tenants who held a precarious tenure of lease under the duke of queensberry at the risk as actually took place of losing their possession at his death have given room to skilful and labouring men working their farms regularly and enjoying comfortable houses and their farms at a fair rent which is enough to forbid idleness but not enough to overpower industry  august 25here are lord and lady home325 charles douglas326 lord and lady charlotte stopford327 i grieve to say the last though as beautiful as ever is extremely thin and looks delicate the duke himself has grown up into a graceful and apparently strong young man and received us most kindly i think he will be well qualified to sustain his difficult and important task the heart is excellent so are the talentsgood sense and knowledge of the world picked up at one of the great english schools and it is one of their most important results will prevent him from being deceived and with perfect goodnature he has a natural sense of his own situation which will keep him from associating with unworthy companions god bless him his father and i loved each other well and his beautiful mother had as much of the angel as is permitted to walk this earth i see the balcony from which they welcomed poor charlotte and me long ere the ascent was surmounted streaming out their white handkerchiefs from the battlements there were four merry people that daynow one sad individual is all that remains singula praedantur anni i had a long walk today through the new plantation the duchesss walk by the nith etc formed by priors kitty young and gay328 fell in with the ladies but their donkeys outwalked mea flock of sheep afterwards outwalked me and i begin to think on my conscience that a snail put in training might soon outwalk me i must lay the old salve to the old sore and be thankful for being able to walk at all  nothing was written today my writingdesk having been forgot at parkgate but tom crighton kindly fetched it up today so something more or less may be done tomorrow morningand now to dress  bittocks bridge august 26we took our departure from the friendly halls of drumlanrig this morning after breakfast and leavetaking i trust this young nobleman will be      a hedge about his friends     a hackle to his foes329  i would have him not quite so softnatured as his grandfather whose kindness sometimes mastered his excellent understanding his father had a temper which better lumped with my humour enough of illnature to keep your goodnature from being abused is no bad ingredient in their disposition who have favours to bestow330  in coming from parkgate here i intended to accomplish a purpose which i have for some years entertained of visiting lochwood the ancient seat of the johnstones of which king james said when he visited it that the man who built it must have been a thief in his heart it rained heavily however which prevented my making this excursion and indeed i rather overwalked myself yesterday and have occasion for rest       so sit down robin and rest thee  abbotsford august 27today we journeyed through the hills and amongst the storms the weather rather bullying than bad we viewed the grey mares tail and i still felt confident in crawling along the ghastly bank by which you approach the fall i will certainly get some road of application to mr hope johnstone to pray him to make the place accessible we got home before halfpast five having travelled forty miles  blairadam august 28set off with walter and jane at seven oclock and reached this place in the middle of dinnertime by some of my not unusual blunders we had come a day before we were expected luckily in this ceremonious generation there are still houses where such blunders only cause a little raillery and blairadam is one of them my excellent friend is in high health and spirits to which the presence of sir frederick adds not a little331 his lady is herea beautiful woman whose countenance realises all the poetic dreams of byron there is certainly a something of full maturity of beauty which seems framed to be adoring and adored and it is to be found in the full dark eye luxuriant tresses and rich complexion of greece and not among the pale unripened beauties of the north what sort of a mind this exquisite casket may contain is not so easily known she is anxious to please and willing to be pleased and with her striking beauty cannot fail to succeed  august 29today we designed to go to lochore but heigho the wind and the rain besides mrs and admiral adam mrs loch and miss adam i find here mr impey son of that sir elijah celebrated in indian history he has himself been in india but has with a great deal of sense and observation much better address than always falls to the share of the eastern adventurer the art of quiet and entertaining conversation which is always easy as well as entertaining is chiefly known in england in scotland we are pedantic and wrangle or we run away with the harrows on some topic we chance to be discursive upon in ireland they have too much vivacity and are too desirous to make a show to preserve the golden mean they are the gascons of britain george ellis was the best converser i ever knew his patience and good breeding made me often ashamed of myself going off at score upon some favourite topic richard sharp is so celebrated for this peculiar gift as to be generally called conversation sharp332 the worst of this talent is that it seems to lack sincerity you never know what are the real sentiments of a good converser or at least it is very difficult to discover to what extent he entertains them his politeness is inconsistent with energy for forming a good converser good taste and extensive information and accomplishment are the principal requisites to which must be added an easy and elegant delivery and a welltoned voice i think the higher order of genius is not favourable to this talent  mrs impey an intelligent person

at the age of seventysix     september   september 1awaked with a headache which the reconsideration of gibsons news did not improve we save bonaparte however and that is a great thing i will not be downcast about it let the worst come that can but i wish i saw that worst it is the devil to be struggling forward like a man in the mire and making not an inch by your exertions and such seems to be my fate well i have much to comfort me and i will take comfort if there be further wrath to come i shall be glad that i bear it alone poor charlotte was too much softened by prosperity to look adverse circumstances courageously in the face anne is young and has sophia and jane to trust to for assistance  september 2wrote this morning but only two pages or thereabouts at twelve oclock set out with anne and walter to visit at makerstoun but the road between makerstoun and merton being very bad we drove i dare say thirty miles in going and coming by a circuitous route and only got home at halfpast seven at night saw lady brisbane makdougall but not sir thomas333 thought of old sir henry and his older father sir george received a box of australian seeds forwarded by andrew murray now headgardener to the governor whom i detected a clever boy among my labourers in 1812 and did a little for him it is pleasant to see men thrive and be grateful at the same time so good luck to andrew mora as we called him  september 3made up my necessary task for yesterday and today also but not more writing very heavily cousin archie swinton came to dinner we had a dish of cousinred of courseand of auld lang syne334  september 4archie swinton left us this morning early i wrote from seven to halfpast two but partly that i had five proofsheets to correct partly that like old john fraser335 i was not very cleever today i made out but a page and a half  september 5wrote task and half a page more terry arrived and brought with him a mr bruce from persia with an introduction forsooth from mr blackwood i will move a quo warranto against this species of introduction and the good gentleman is to be here he informs me for two days he is a dark foreignlooking man of small stature and rather blunt manners which may be easily accounted for by his having been in the east for thirty years he has a considerable share of information and made good play after dinner  september 6walter being to return to ireland for three weeks set off today and has taken surtees and charles with him i fear this is but a wild plan but the prospect seemed to make them so happy that i could not find in my heart to say no sufficiently peremptorily so away they all went this morning to be as happy as they can youth is a fine carver and gilder went down to huntly burn and dawdled about while waiting for the carriage to bring me back mr bruce and colonel ferguson pottered away about persia and india and i fell asleep by the fireside here is a fine spate of worka day diddled away and nothing to show for it i must write letters now there is nothing else for it butyawyawi must take a nap first i had a letter from jem ballantyne plague on him full of remonstrance deep and solemn upon the carelessness of bonaparte the rogue is right too but as to correcting my style to the      jemmy jemmy linkum feedle  tune of what is called fine writing ill be dd if i do drew £12 in favour of charles for his irish jaunt same time exhorted him to make himself as expensive to walter in the way of eating and drinking as he could mr and mrs impey arrived to dinner  september 7mr bruce the bastinadoed left us this morning promising wine from shiraz and arms from india from our joint observation he must be a halfcaste probably half an arab he told us of his having been taken by pirates in the arabian gulf and having received two thousand bastinadoes on the soles of his feet after which he was buried in a heap of dung by way of cure though the matter was certainly serious enough to the sufferer yet it excited our suppressed or scarce suppressed mirth alas let never traveller tell any distress which borders on the ludicrous if he desires to excite the sympathy of the audience  another thing he mentioned was the mode of seasoning timber for shipbuilding in the arabian gulf they bury it in the sand within watermark and leave it exposed to the flux and reflux of the tide for six months at least but often for twelve or eighteen the tendency to vegetation which produces the dryrot is thus prevented effectually and the ships built of this wood last for twenty years  we drove to ashestiel in the morning after i had written a good task or nearly so nay i lie it wanted half a page and passed a pleasant day terry read bobadil in the evening which he has i think improved  september 8i have rubbed up by collation with mr impey sir frederick adams idea of the greeks he deeply regrets the present war as premature undertaken before knowledge and rational education had extended themselves sufficiently the neighbourhood of the ionian islands was fast producing civilisation and as knowledge is power it is clear that the example of europeans and the opportunities of education thereby afforded must soon have given them an immense superiority over the turk this premature war has thrown all back into a state of barbarism it was precipitated by the agents of russia sir frederick spoke most highly of byron the soundness of his views the respect in which he was heldhis just ideas of the grecian cause and character and the practical and rational wishes which he formed for them singular that a man whose conduct in his own personal affairs had been anything but practical should be thus able to stand by the helm of a sinking state sir frederick thinks he might have done much for them if he had lived the rantipole friends of liberty who go about freeing nations with the same success which don quixote had in redressing wrongs have of course blundered everything which they touched the impeys left us today and captain hugh scott and his lady arrived task is bangup  september 9i begin to fear nap will swell to seven volumes i have a long letter from james b threatening me with eight but that is impossible the event of his becoming emperor is the central point of his history now i have just attained it and it is the centre of the third volume two volumes and a half may be necessary to complete the whole walked with hugh scott up the rhymers glen and round by the lake mr bainbridge of gattonside house dined also colonel ferguson was bang up to my task again this day  september 10corrected proofsheets in the morning then immured myself to write the more willingly that the day seemed showery but i found myself obliged to read and study the map so much that i did not get over half a sheet written walked with hugh scott through haxell cleuch great pleasure to show the young wood to any who understands them well  september 11jane and her mother go into town this morning and anne with them to look out a lodging for us during the time we must pass in town it seems strange to have this to do having had always my fathers house or my own to go to butsic transit gloria mundi  well it is halfpast twelve oclock and at length having regulated all disappointments as to posthorses and sent three or four servants three or four miles to remedy blunders which a little forethought might have prevented my family and guests are separated      like youthful steers let loose east north and south336  miss miln goes to stirling the scotts to lessudden anne and jane to edinburgh and i am left alone i must needs go up and see some operations about the spring which supplies us with water though i calculate my presence is not very necessary so nowto workto work  but i reckoned without my host or i should rather say without my guest just as i had drawn in my chair fitted a new bramah on the stick and was preparing to feague it away i had a call from the son of an old friend mr waldie of henderland as he left me enter young whytbank and mr auriol hay337 of the lyon office and we had a long armorial chat together which lasted for some timethen the library was to be looked at etc so when they went away i had little better to do than to walk up to the spring which they are digging and to go to my solitary dinner on my return  september 12notwithstanding what is above said i made out my task yesterday or nearly so by working after dinner after all these interruptions are not such bad things they make a man keen of the work which he is withheld from and differ in that point much from the indulgence of an indisposition to labour in your own mind which increases by indulgence les fâcheux seldom interrupt your purpose absolutely and entirelyyou stick to it for contradictions sake  well i visited the spring in the morning and completed my task afterwards as i slept for a few minutes in my chair to which i am more addicted than i could wish i heard as i thought my poor wife call me by the familiar name of fondness which she gave me my recollections on waking were melancholy enough these be      the airy tongues that syllable mens names338  all i believe have some natural desire to consider these unusual impressions as bodements of good or evil to come but alas this is a prejudice of our own conceit they are the empty echoes of what is past not the foreboding voice of what is to come  i dined at the club today at selkirk and acted as croupier there were eighteen dined young men chiefly and of course young talk but so it has been will be and must be  september 13wrote my task in the morning and thereafter had a letter from that sage privy councillor and booby of a baronet this unutterable idiot proposes to me that i shall propose to the dowager duchess of  and offers his own right honourable intervention to bring so beautiful a business to bear i am struck dumb with the assurance of his follyabsolutely mute and speechlessand how to prevent him making me further a fool is not easy for the wretch has left me no time to assure him of the absurdity of what he proposes and if he should ever hint at such a piece of dd impertinence what must the lady think of my conceit or of my feelings i will write to his present quarters however that he may if possible have warning not to continue this absurdity339  dined at major scott my cousins where was old lord buchan he too is a prince of bores but age has tamed him a little and like the giant pope in the pilgrims progress he can only sit and grin at pilgrims as they go past and is not able to cast a fank340 over them as formerly a few quiet puns seem his most formidable infliction nowadays  september 14i should not have forgotten among the memorabilia of yesterday that mr nasmyth the dentist and his family called and i showed them the lions for truly he that has rid a man of the toothache is well entitled to command a part of his time item two young frenchmen made their way to our sublime presence in guerdon of a laudatory copy of french verses sent up the evening before by way of open sesame i suppose i have not read them nor shall i no man that ever wrote a line despised the pap of praise so heartily as i do there is nothing i scorn more except those who think the ordinary sort of praise or censure is matter of the least consequence people have almost always some private view of distinguishing themselves or of gratifying their curiositysome point in short to carry with which you have no relation when they take the trouble to praise you in general it is their purpose to get the person praised to puff away in return to me their rank praises no more make amends for their bad poetry than tainted butter would pass off stale fish  september 15many proofs to correct and dates to compare what signify dates in a true story i was fidgety after breakfast owing to perusing some advices from j gibson poor fellow i will not be discouraged come of things what will however i could not write continuously but went out by starts and amused myself by cutting trees in the avenue thus i dawdled till anne and jane came home with merry faces and raised my spirits of course after tea i een took heart of grace and finished my task as i now do this days journal  september 16worked hard today and in morning and evening made out five pages and a half as much perhaps as one should attempt yet i was not overworked on the contrary went out with tom about one oclock and cut trees etc to clear the avenue and favour the growth of such trees as are designed for standards i received visits toothe laird of bemerside341 who had been for nine years in italy with his familyalso the laird of kippielaw anne and jane drove up and called at the haining  i expected james ballantyne to dinner as he proposed but the worthy typographer appeared not he is sometimes inaccurate in keeping such appointments which is not according to the academy of compliments but in the letter which announced his intended visit he talked of having received himself a visit from the cholera morbus i shall be very sorry if so unwelcome a guest be the cause of the breach of his appointment  september 17rather surprised with a letter from lord melville informing me that he and mr peel had put me into the commission for inquiring into the condition of the colleges in scotland i know little on the subject but i dare say as much as some of the official persons who are inserted of course the want of efficient men is the reason alleged i must of course do my best though i have little hope of being useful and the time it will occupy is half ruinous to me to whom time is everything besides i suppose the honour is partly meant as an act of grace for malachi i shall never repent of that escapade although it offended persons for the time whose good opinion i value jb continues ill at teviot grove as they call it i am a little anxious about him  i finished my task and an extra pagehope to do another before supper accomplished the said diligent purpose  september 18rainy and gloomythat small sifting rain driving on an eastern gale which intermits not wrote letters to lord melville etc and agreed to act under the commission settled to be at melville castle saturday 24th i fear this will interfere consumedly with business i corrected proofsheets and wrote a good deal but intend to spend the rest of the day in reading and making notes no bricks to be made without straw  jedburgh september 19circuit went to poor mr shortreeds and regretted bitterly the distress of the family though they endeavoured to bear it bravely and to make my reception as comfortable and even cheerful as possible my old friend rs gave me a ring found in a grave at the abbey to be kept in memory of his son i will certainly preserve it with especial care342  many trifles at circuit chiefly owing to the cheap whisky as they were almost all riots one case of assault on a deaf and dumb woman she was herself the chief evidence but being totally without education and having from her situation very imperfect notions of a deity and a future state no oath could be administered mr kinniburgh teacher of the deaf and dumb was sworn interpreter together with another person a neighbour who knew the accidental or conventional signs which the poor thing had invented for herself as mr k was supposed to understand the more general or natural signs common to people in such a situation he went through the task with much address and it was wonderful to see them make themselves intelligible to each other by mere pantomime still i did not consider such evidence as much to be trusted to in a criminal case several previous interviews had been necessary between the interpreter and the witness and this is very much like getting up a story some of the signs brief in themselves of which mr k gave long interpretations put me in mind of lord burleigh in the critic did he mean all this by the shake of the head yes if he shook his head as i taught him343 the man was found not guilty mr k told us of a pupil of his whom he restored as it may be said to humanity and who told him that his ideas of another world were that some great person in the skies lighted up the sun in the morning as he saw his mother light her fire and the stars in the evening as she kindled a lamp he said the witness had ideas of truth and falsehood which was i believe true and that she had an idea of punishment in a future state which i doubt he confessed she could not give any guess at its duration whether temporary or eternal i should like to know if mr k is in that respect much wiser than his pupils dined of course with lord mackenzie the judge  september 20waked after a restless night in which i dreamed of poor tom shortreed breakfasted with the rev dr somerville344 this venerable gentleman is one of the oldest of the literary brotherhoodi suppose about eightyseven and except a little deafness quite entire living all his life in good society as a gentleman bornand having besides professional calls to make among the poorhe must know of course much that is curious concerning the momentous changes which have passed under his eyes he talks of them accordingly and has written something on the subject but has scarce the force necessary to seize on the most striking points palabras neighbour verges345gifts which god gives the bowl that rolls easiest along the green goes furthest and has least clay sticking to it i have often noticed that a kindly placid goodhumour is the companion of longevity and i suspect frequently the leading cause of it quick keen sharp observation with the power of contrast and illustration disturbs this easy current of thought my good friend the venerable doctor will not i think die of that disease  called at nesbit mill on my cousin charles his wife received me better than i deserved for i have been a sad neglectful visitor she has a very pleasant countenance  some of the circuit lawyers dined here namely r dundas borthwick the facetious peter robertson346 mr r adam dundas and with them henry scott of harden  september 21our party breakfasted late and i was heavyheaded and did not rise till eight had drank a little more wine than usual but as our friend othello says thats not much347 however we dawdled about till near noon ere all my guests left me then i walked a little and cut some wood read afterwards i cant get on without it how did i get on beforethats a secret mr thomas tod348 and his wife came to dine we talked of old stories and got over a pleasant evening  september 22still no writing we have materials to collect dn you mother duty hold your tongue i tell you you know nothing of the matter besides i corrected five sheets i wish you had to do with some other people just to teach you the difference i grant that the day being exquisite i went and thinned out the wood from the north front of the house read and noted a great deal  september 23wrought in the morning but only at reading and proofs that cursed battle of jena is like to cost me more time than it did bonaparte to gain it i met colonel ferguson about one to see his dogs run it is a sport i have loved well but now i know not why i find it little interesting to be sure i used to gallop and that i cannot now do we had good sport however and killed five hares i felt excited during the chase but the feeling was but momentary my mind was immediately turned to other remembrances and to pondering upon the change which had taken place in my own feelings the day was positively heavenly and the wild hillside with our little coursing party was beautiful to look at yet i felt like a man come from the dead looking with indifference on that which interested him while living so it must be      when once lifes day is near the gloaming349  we dined at huntly burn kind and comfortable as usual  september 24i made a rally today and wrote four pages or nearly never stirred abroad the whole day but was made happy after dinner by the return of charles and surtees full of their irish jaunt and happy as young men are with the change of scene tomorrow i must go to melville castle i wonder what i can do or say about these universities one thing occursthe distribution of bursaries only ex meritis that is i would have the presentations continue in the present patrons but exact that those presented should be qualified by success in their literary attainments and distinction acquired at school to hold these scholarships this seems to be following out the idea of the founders who doubtless intended the furthering of good literature to give education to dull mediocrity is a flinging of the childrens bread to dogsit is sharpening a hatchet on a razorstrop which renders the strop useless and does no good to the hatchet well something we will do  september 25morning spent in making up proofs and copy set out for melville castle with jane who goes on to her mother at edinburgh  found lord and lady m in great distress their son robert is taken ill at a russian town about 350 miles from moscowdangerously ill the distance increases the extreme distress of the parents who however bore it like themselves i was glad to spend a day upon the old terms with such old friends and believe my being with them even in this moment of painful suspense as it did not diminish the kindness of my reception certainly rather seemed to divert them from the cruel subject  dr nicoll principal of st andrews dineda very gentlemanlike sensible man we spoke of the visitation of granting degrees of public examinations of abolishing the election of professors by the senatus academicus a most pregnant source of jobs and much besidebut all desultoryand lord m had either nothing particular to say to me or was too much engrossed with his family distress to enter upon it he proposes to be here in the end of october  september 26returned to abbotsford after breakfast here is a cool thing of my friend jw croker the duke of clarence dining at the pavilion with the king happened by choice or circumstance to sit lower than usual at the table and being at that time on bad terms with the board of admiralty took an opportunity to say that were he king he would do all that away and assume the office of lord high admiral your rh may act with great prudence said croker the last monarch who did so was james ii presently after hm asked what they were talking of its only his rh of c answered croker who is so condescending as to tell us what he will do when he is king  a long letter from rp gillies i wonder how even he could ask me to announce myself as the author of annotations on german novels which he is to write  september 27a day of honest labourbut having much to read proofs to send off etc i was only able to execute my task by three oclock pm then i went to direct the cutting of wood along the road in front of the house dined at chiefswood with captain and mrs hamilton lady lucy whitmore their guest and neighbours from gattonside and huntly burn  september 28another hard brush and finished four pages by twelve oclock then drove out to cowdenknowes for a morning visit the house is ancient and curious though modernised by vile improvements of a modern roof and windows the inhabited part has over the principal door the letters sihvih the first three indicate probably sir john hume but what are we to make of the rest i will look at them more heedfully one day there is a large room said to have been built for the reception of queen mary if so it has been much modernised the date on the door is 1576 which would not bear out the tradition the last two letters probably signify lady humes name but what are we to make of the v dr hume thinks it means uxor but why should that word be in latin and the rest in scotch  returned to dinner corrected proofs and hope still to finish another leaf being in light working humour finished the same accordingly  abbotsford september 29 a sort of zeal of working has seized me which i must avail myself of no dejection of mind and no tremor of nerves for which god be humbly thanked my spirits are neither low nor highgrave i think and quieta complete twilight of the mind  good news of john lockhart from lady montagu who most kindly wrote on that interesting topic  i wrote five pages nearly a double task yet wandered for three hours axe in hand superintending the thinning of the home planting that does good too i feel it give steadiness to my mind women it is said go mad much seldomer than men i fancy if this be true it is in some degree owing to the little manual works in which they are constantly employed which regulate in some degree the current of ideas as the pendulum regulates the motion of the timepiece i do not know if this is sense or nonsense but i am sensible that if i were in solitary confinement without either the power of taking exercise or employing myself in study six months would make me a madman or an idiot  september 30wrote four pages honest james ballantyne came about five i had been cutting wood for two hours he brought his child a remarkably fine boy wellbred quiet and amiable james and i had a good comfortable chat the boys being at gattonside house i am glad to see him bear up

find by a letter from j gibson that i may go to london without danger and if i may i in a manner must to examine the papers in the secretary of states office about bon when at saint helena the opportunity having been offered must be accepted and yet i had much rather stay at home even the prospect of seeing sophia and lockhart must be mingled with pain yet this is foolish too lady hamilton350 writes me that pozzo di borgo351 the russian minister at paris is willing to communicate to me some particulars of bonapartes early life querymight i not go on there in for a penny in for a pound i intend to take anne with me and the pleasure will be great to her who deserves much at my hand  october 6charles and his friend surtees left us this morning  went to see colonel thornhills hawks fly some part of the amusement is very beautiful particularly the first flight of the hawks when they sweep so beautifully round the company jingling their bells from time to time and throwing themselves into the most elegant positions as they gaze about for their prey but i do not wonder that the impatience of modern times has renounced this expensive and precarious mode of sporting the hawks are liable to various misfortunes and are besides addicted to fly away one of ours was fairly lost for the day and one or two went off without permission but returned we killed a crow and frightened a snipe there are however ladies and gentlemen enough to make a gallant show on the top of mintlaw kipps the falconer made a fine figurea handsome and active young fellow with the falcon on his wrist the colonel was most courteous and named a hawk after me which was a compliment the hawks are not named till they have merited that distinction i walked about six miles and was not fatigued  there dined with us colonel thornhill clifton young whytbank spencer stanhope and his brother with miss tod and my old friend locker352 secretary to greenwich hospital we did not break up the party till one in the morning and were very well amused  october 7a weary day of rain locker and i chatted from time to time and i wrought not at boney but upon the prose works of which i will have a volume ready to send in on monday i got a letter from john gibson with an offer by longman for napoleon of ten thousand five hundred guineas353 which i have advised them to accept also i hear there is some doubt of my getting to london from the indecision of these foolish londoners  i dont care whether i go or no and yet it is unpleasant to see how ones motions depend on scoundrels like these besides i would like to be there were it but to see how the cat jumps one knows nothing of the world if you are absent from it so long as i have been  october 8locker left me this morning he is of opinion the ministry must soon assume another form but that the whigs will not come in lord liverpool holds much by lord melvillewell in point of judgmentand by the duke of wellingtonstill better but then the duke is a soldiera bad education for a statesman in a free country the chancellor is also consulted by the premier on all law affairs canning and huskisson are at the head of the other party who may be said to have taken the cabinet by storm through sheer dint of talent i should like to see how these ingredients are working but by the grace of god i will take care of putting my finger into the cleft stick  locker has promised to get my young cousin walter scott on some quarterdeck or other  received from mr cadell the second instalment advance of cash on canongate it is in english bills and money in case of my going to town  october 9a gracious letter from messrs abud and son billbrokers etc assure mr gibson that they will institute no legal proceedings against me for four or five weeks and so i am permitted to spend my money and my leisure to improve the means of paying them their debts for that is the only use of my present journey they are jews i suppose the devil baits for jews with a pork griskin were i not to exert myself i wonder where their money is to come from  a letter from gillies menacing the world with a foreign miscellany the plan is a good one but he canna haud it as john moodie354 says he will think all is done when he has got a set of names and he will find the difficulty consists not in that but in getting articles i wrote on the prose works  lord and lady minto dined and spent the night at abbotsford  october 10well i must prepare for going to london and perhaps to paris the morning frittered away i slept till eight oclock then our guests till twelve then walked out to direct some alterations on the quarry which i think may at little expense be rendered a pretty recess wordsworth swears by an old quarry and is in some degree a supreme authority on such points rain came on returned completely wet i had next the displeasure to find that i had lost the conclusion of vol v of napoleon seven or eight pages at least which i shall have to write over again unless i can find it well as othello says thats not much my cousin james scott came to dinner  i have great unwillingness to set out on this journey i almost think it ominous but      they that look to freits my master dear     their freits will follow them355  i will stick to my purpose answered a letter from gillies about establishing a foreign journal a good plan but i fear in sorry hands of those he names as his assistants they who can be useful will do little and the labours of those who are willing to work will rather hold the publication down i fear it will not do  i am downhearted about leaving all my things after i was quietly settled it is a kind of disrooting that recalls a thousand painful ideas of former happier journeys and to be at the mercy of these fellows god helpbut rather god blessman must help himself  october 11we are ingenious selftormentors this journey annoys me more than anything of the kind in my life my wifes figure seems to stand before me and her voice is in my earsscott do not go it half frightens me strong throbbing at my heart and a disposition to be very sick it is just the effect of so many feelings which had been lulled asleep by the uniformity of my life but which awaken on any new subject of agitation poor poor charlotte i cannot daub it further i get incapable of arranging my papers too i will go out for halfanhour god relieve me  i quelled this hysterica passio by pushing a walk towards kaeside and back again but when i returned i still felt uncomfortable and all the papers i wanted were out of the way and all those i did not want seemed to place themselves under my fingers my cash according to the nature of riches in general made to itself wings and fled i verily believe from one hidingplace to another to appease this insurrection of the papers i gave up putting my things in order till tomorrow morning  dined at kippielaw with a party of neighbours they had cigars for me very politely but i must break folks off this i would not willingly be like old dr parr or any such quiz who has his tastes and whims forsooth that must be gratified so no cigars on the journey  october 12356reduced my rebellious papers to order set out after breakfast and reached carlisle at eight oclock at night  rokeby park october 13we were off before seven and visiting appleby castle by the way a most interesting and curious place we got to morritts357 about halfpast four where we had as warm a welcome as one of the warmest hearts in the world could give an old friend i saw his nephews wife for the first time a very pleasing young person it was great pleasure to me to see morritt happy in the midst of his family circle undisturbed as heretofore by the sickness of any dear to him  on recalling my own recollections during my journey i may note that i found great pleasure in my companions conversation as well as in her mode of managing all her little concerns on the road i am apt to judge of character by goodhumour and alacrity in these petty concerns i think the inconveniences of a journey seem greater to me than formerly while on the other hand the pleasures it affords are rather less the ascent of stainmore seemed duller and longer than usual and bowes which used to strike me as a distinguished feature seemed an illformed mass of rubbish a great deal lower than i had supposed yet i have seen it twenty times at least on the other hand what i lose in my own personal feelings i gain in those of my companion who shows an intelligent curiosity and interest in what she sees i enjoy therefore reflectively veluti in speculo the sort of pleasure to which i am now less accessible  october 14strolled about in the morning with morritt and saw his new walk up the tees which he is just concocting got a pamphlet he has written on the catholic question in 1806 he had other views on that subject but live and learn as they say one of his squibs against fox and grenvilles administration concludes      though they sleep with the devil yet theirs is the hope     on the scum of old england to rise with the pope  set off at two and reached wetherby to supper and bed  it was the corporation of leeds that by a subscription of £80000 brought in the anticatholic candidate i remember their subscribing a similar sum to bring in morritt if he would have stood  saw in morritts possession an original miniature of milton by coopera valuable thing indeed the pedigree seemed authentic it was painted for his favourite daughterhad come into possession of some of the davenantswas then in the devonshire collection from which it was stolen afterwards purchased by sir joshua reynolds and at his sale by morritt or his father358 the countenance handsome and dignified with a strong expression of genius probably the only portrait of milton taken from the life excepting the drawing from which faithornes head is done  grantham october 15old england is no changeling it is long since i travelled this road having come up to town chiefly by sea of late years but things seem much the same one race of rednosed innkeepers are gone and their widows eldest sons or headwaiters exercise hospitality in their room with the same bustle and importance other things seem externally at least much the same the land however is much better ploughed straight ridges everywhere adopted in place of the old circumflex of twenty years ago three horses however or even four are often seen in a plough yoked one before the other ill habits do not go out at once we slept at grantham where we met with captain william lockhart and his lady bound for london like ourselves  biggleswade october 16visited burleigh this morning the first time i ever saw that grand place where there are so many objects of interest and curiosity the house is magnificent in the style of james is reign and consequently in mixed gothic of paintings i know nothing so shall attempt to say nothing but whether to connoisseurs or to an ignorant admirer like myself the salvator mundi by carlo dolci must seem worth a kings ransom lady exeter who was at home had the goodness or curiosity to wish to see us she is a beauty after my own heart a great deal of liveliness in the face an absence alike of form and of affected ease and really courteous after a genuine and ladylike fashion  we reached biggleswade tonight at six and paused here to wait for the lockharts spent the evening together  pall mall october 17here am i in this capital once more after an aprilweather meeting with my daughter and lockhart too much grief in our first meeting to be joyful too much pleasure to be distressinga giddy sensation between the painful and the pleasurable i will call another subject  read over sir john chiverton359 and brambletye house360novels in what i may surely claim as the style      which i was born to introduce     refined it first and showd its use  they are both clever books one in imitation of the days of chivalry the other by horace smith one of the authors of the rejected addresses dated in the time of the civil wars and introducing historical characters i read both with great interest during the journey  i am something like captain bobadil361 who trained up a hundred gentlemen to fight very nearly if not altogether as well as myself and so far i am convinced of this that i believe were i to publish the canongate chronicles without my name nom de guerre i mean the event would be a corollary to the fable of the peasant who made the real pig squeak against the imitator while the sapient audience hissed the poor grunter as if inferior to the biped in his own language the peasant could indeed confute the longeared multitude by showing piggy but were i to fail as a knight with a white and maiden shield and then vindicate my claim to attention by putting by the author of waverley in the title my good friend publicum would defend itself by stating i had tilted so ill that my course had not the least resemblance to my former doings when indisputably i bore away the garland therefore i am as firmly and resolutely determined that i will tilt under my own cognisance the hazard indeed remains of being beaten but there is a prejudice not an undue one neither in favour of the original patentee and joe mantons name has borne out many a sorry gunbarrel more of this tomorrow  expense of journey                    £4100 anne pocketmoney                      500 servants on journey                     200 cash in purse silver not reckoned     200                                                                                 £5000                                           this is like to be an expensive journey but if i can sell an early copy of the work to a french translator it should bring me home  thank god little johnnie hoo as he calls himself is looking well though the poor dear child is kept always in a prostrate posture  october 18i take up again my remarks on imitators i am sure i mean the gentlemen no wrong by calling them so and heartily wish they had followed a better model but it serves to show me veluti in speculo my own errors or if you will those of the style one advantage i think i still have over all of them they may do their fooling with better grace but i like sir andrew aguecheek do it more natural362 they have to read old books and consult antiquarian collections to get their knowledge i write because i have long since read such works and possess thanks to a strong memory the information which they have to seek for this leads to a draggingin historical details by head and shoulders so that the interest of the main piece is lost in minute descriptions of events which do not affect its progress perhaps i have sinned in this way myself indeed i am but too conscious of having considered the plot only as what bayes363 calls the means of bringing in fine things so that in respect to the descriptions it resembled the string of the showmans box which he pulls to show in succession kings queens the battle of waterloo bonaparte at saint helena newmarket races and whiteheaded bob floored by jemmy from town all this i may have done but i have repented of it and in my better efforts while i conducted my story through the agency of historical personages and by connecting it with historical incidents i have endeavoured to weave them pretty closely together and in future i will study this more must not let the background eclipse the principal figuresthe frame overpower the picture  another thing in my favour is that my contemporaries steal too openly mr smith has inserted in brambletye house whole pages from defoes fire and plague of london      steal foh a fico for the phrase     convey the wise it call364  when i convey an incident or so i am at as much pains to avoid detection as if the offence could be indicted in literal fact at the old bailey  but leaving this hard pressed as i am by these imitators who must put the thing out of fashion at last i consider like a fox at his last shifts whether there be a way to dodge them some new device to throw them off and have a mile or two of free ground while i have legs and wind left to use it there is one way to give novelty to depend for success on the interest of a wellcontrived story but woes me that requires thought considerationthe writing out a regular plan or plotabove all the adhering to onewhich i never can do for the ideas rise as i write and bear such a disproportioned extent to that which each occupied at the first concoction that cocksnowns i shall never be able to take the trouble and yet to make the world stare and gain a new march ahead of them all well something we still will do      libertys in every blow     let us do or die  poor rob burns to tack thy fine strains of sublime patriotism better take tristram shandys vein hand me my cap and bells there so now i am equipped i open my rareeshow with      maam will you walk in and fal de ral diddle     and sir will you stalk in and fal de ral diddle     and miss will you pop in and fal de ral diddle     and master pray hop in and fal de ral diddle  queryhow long is it since i heard that strain of dulcet mood and where or how came i to pick it up it is not mine though by your smiling you seem to say so365 here is a proper mornings work but i am childish with seeing them all well and happy here and as i can neither whistle nor sing i must let the giddy humour run to waste on paper  sallied forth in the morning bought a hat met sir william knighton366 from whose discourse i guess that malachi has done me no prejudice in a certain quarter with more indications of the times which i need not set down sallied again after breakfast and visited the piccadilly ladies367 saw rogers and richard sharp also good dr and mrs hughes also the duchess of buckingham and lady charlotte bury with a most beautiful little girl owen rees breakfasted and agreed i should have what the frenchman has offered for the advantage of translating napoleon which being a hundred guineas will help my expenses to town and down again  october 19i rose at my usual time but could not write so read southeys history of the peninsular war it is very good indeedhonest english principle in every line but there are many prejudices and there is a tendency to augment a work already too long by saying all that can be said of the history of ancient times appertaining to every place mentioned what care we whether saragossa be derived from caesarea augusta could he have proved it to be numantium there would have been a concatenation accordingly368  breakfasted at rogers with sir thomas lawrence luttrell the great london wit369 richard sharp etc sam made us merry with an account of some part of roses ariosto proposed that the italian should be printed on the other side for the sake of assisting the indolent reader to understand the english and complained of his using more than once the phrase of a lady having voided her saddle which would certainly sound extraordinary at apothecaries hall well well rose carries a dirk too370 the morning was too dark for westminster abbey which we had projected  i went to the foreign office and am put by mr wilmot horton into the hands of a confidential clerk mr smith who promises access to everything then saw croker who gave me a bundle of documents sir george cockburn promises his despatches and journal in short i have ample prospect of materials  dined with mrs coutts tragicomic distress of my good friend on the marriage of her presumptive heir with a daughter of lucien bonaparte  october 20commanded down to pass a day at windsor this is very kind of his majesty  at breakfast crofton croker author of the irish fairy taleslittle as a dwarf keeneyed as a hawk and of very prepossessing manners something like tom moore there were also terry allan cunningham newton and others now i must go to work  went down to windsor or rather to the lodge in the forest which though ridiculed by connoisseurs seems to be no bad specimen of a royal retirement and is delightfully situated a kind of cottage ornéetoo large perhaps for the stylebut yet so managed that in the walks you only see parts of it at once and these well composed and grouping with immense trees his majesty received me with the same mixture of kindness and courtesy which has always distinguished his conduct towards me there was no company beside the royal retinuelady conyngham her daughter and two or three other ladies after we left table there was excellent music by the royal band who lay ambushed in a greenhouse adjoining the apartment the king made me sit beside him and talk a great dealtoo much perhapsfor he has the art of raising ones spirits and making you forget the retenue which is prudent everywhere especially at court but he converses himself with so much ease and elegance that you lose thoughts of the prince in admiring the wellbred and accomplished gentleman he is in many respects the model of a british monarchhas little inclination to try experiments on government otherwise than through his ministerssincerely i believe desires the good of his subjects is kind toward the distressed and moves and speaks every inch a king371 i am sure such a man is fitter for us than one who would long to head armies or be perpetually intermeddling with la grande politique a sort of reserve which creeps on him daily and prevents his going to places of public resort is a disadvantage and prevents his being so generally popular as is earnestly to be desired this i think was much increased by the behaviour of the rabble in the brutal insanity of the queens trial when john bull meaning the best in the world made such a beastly figure  october 21walked in the morning with sir william knighton and had much confidential chat not fit to be here set down in case of accidents he undertook most kindly to recommend charles when he has taken his degree to be attached to some of the diplomatic missions which i think is best for the lad after all after breakfast went to windsor castle met by appointment my daughters and lockhart and examined the improvements going on there under mr wyattville who appears to possess a great deal of taste and feeling for gothic architecture the old apartments splendid enough in extent and proportion are paltry in finishing instead of being lined with heart of oak the palace of the british king is hung with paper painted wainscot colour there are some fine paintings and some droll ones among the last are those of divers princes of the house of mecklenburgstrelitz of which queen charlotte was descended they are illcoloured orangoutanglooking figures with black eyes and hooknoses in oldfashioned uniforms  we returned to a hasty dinner in pall mall and then hurried away to see honest dan terrys house called the adelphi theatre where we saw the pilot from the american novel of that name it is extremely popular the dramatist having seized on the whole story and turned the odious and ridiculous parts assigned by the original author to the british against the yankees themselves there is a quiet effrontery in this that is of a rare and peculiar character the americans were so much displeased that they attempted a rowwhich rendered the piece doubly attractive to the seamen at wapping who came up and crowded the house night after night to support the honour of the british flag after all one must deprecate whatever keeps up illwill betwixt america and the mother country and we in particular should avoid awakening painful recollections our high situation enables us to contemn petty insults and to make advances towards cordiality i was however glad to see honest dans theatre as full seemingly as it could hold the heat was dreadful and anne was so very unwell that she was obliged to be carried into terrys housea curious dwelling no larger than a squirrels cage which he has contrived to squeeze out of the vacant spaces of the theatre and which is accessible by a most complicated combination of staircases and small passages here we had rare good porter and oysters after the play and found anne much better she had attempted too much indeed i myself was much fatigued  october 22this morning drs gooch shaw and yates breakfasted and had a consultation about wee johnnie they give us great hopes that his health will be established but the seaside or the country seem indispensable mr wilmot horton372 under secretary of state also breakfasted he is full of some new plan of relieving the poorsrates by encouraging emigration but john bull will think this savours of botany bay the attempt to look the poorsrates in the face is certainly meritorious  laboured in writing and marking extracts to be copied from breakfast to dinner with the exception of an hour spent in telling johnnie the history of his namesake gilpin  mr william and mrs lockhart dined with us tom moore373 and sir thomas lawrence came in the evening which made a pleasant soirée smoke my frenchegad it is time to air some of my vocabulary it is i find cursedly musty  october 23sam rogers and moore breakfasted here and we were very merry fellows moore seemed disposed to go to france with us i visited the admiralty and got sir george cockburns journal which is valuable374 also visited lady elizabeth and sir charles stewart my heart warmed to the former on account of the old balcarres connection sir charles and she were very kind and communicative i foresee i will be embarrassed with more communications than i can well use or trust to coloured as they must be by the passions of those who make them thus i have a statement from the duchess descars to which the bonapartists would i dare say give no credit if talleyrand for example could be communicative he must have ten thousand reasons for perverting the truth and yet a person receiving a direct communication from him would be almost barred from disputing it      sing tantararara rogues all  we dined at the residentiaryhouse with good dr hughes375 allan cunningham sir thomas lawrence and young mr hughes thomas pringle376 is returned from the cape and called in my absence he might have done well there could he have scoured his brain of politics but he must needs publish a whig journal at the cape of good hope he is a worthy creature but conceited withalhinc illæ lachrymæ he brought me some antlers and a skin in addition to others he had sent to abbotsford four years since crofton croker made me a present of a small box of curious irish antiquities containing a gold fibula etc etc  october 24laboured in the morning at breakfast dr holland377 and cohen whom they now call palgrave378 a mutation of names which confused my recollections item moore i worked at the colonial office pretty hard dined with mr wilmot horton and his beautiful wife the original of the she walks in beauty etc of poor byron  the conversation is seldom excellent among official people so many topics are what otaheitians call taboo we hunted down a pun or two which were turned out like the stag at the epping hunt for the pursuit of all and sundry came home early and was in bed by eleven  october 25good mr wilson379 and his wife at breakfast also sir thomas lawrence locker380 came in afterwards and made a proposal to me to give up his intended life of george iii in my favour on cause shown i declined the proposal not being of opinion that my genius lies that way and not relishing hunting in couples afterwards went to the colonial office and had robert hays assistance in my inquiries then to the french ambassador for my passports picked up sotheby who endeavoured to saddle me for a review of his polyglot virgil i fear i shall scarce convince him that i know nothing of the latin lingo sir rh inglis richard sharp and other friends called we dined at miss dumergues and spent a part of our soirée at lydia whites tomorrow      for france for france for it is more than need381  calais october 26 up at five and in the packet by six a fine passagesave at the conclusion while we lay on and off the harbour of calais but the tossing made no impression on my companion or me we ate and drank like dragons the whole way and were able to manage a good supper and best part of a bottle of chablis at the classic desseins who received us with much courtesy  october 27custom house etc detained us till near ten oclock so we had time to walk on the boulevards and to see the fortifications which must be very strong all the country round being flat and marshy lost as all know by the bloody papist bitch one must be vernacular when on french ground queen mary of redhot memory i would rather she had burned a score more of bishops if she had kept it her sister bess would sooner have parted with her virginity charles i had no temptation to part with itit might indeed have been shuffled out of our hands during the civil wars but noll would have as soon let monsieur draw one of his grinders then charles ii would hardly have dared to sell such an old possession as he did dunkirk and after that the french had little chance till the revolution even then i think we could have held a place that could be supplied from our own element the sea cui bono none i think but to plague the rogueswe dined at cormont and being stopped by mr canning having taken up all the posthorses could only reach montreuil that night i should have liked to have seen some more of this place which is fortified and as it stands on an elevated and rocky site must present some fine points but as we came in late and left early i can only bear witness to good treatment good supper good vin de barsac and excellent beds  october 28breakfasted at abbeville and saw a very handsome gothic church and reached grandvilliers at night the house is but secondrate though lauded by various english travellers for the moderation of its charges as was recorded in a book presented to us by the landlady there is no great patriotism in publishing that a traveller thinks the bills moderate it serves usually as an intimation to mine host or hostess that john bull will bear a little more squeezing i gave my attestation too however for the charges of the good lady resembled those elsewhere and her anxiety to please was extreme folks must be harderhearted than i am to resist the empressement which may indeed be venal yet has in its expression a touch of cordiality  paris october 29breakfasted at beauvais and saw its magnificent cathedralunfinished it has been left and unfinished it will remain of coursethe fashion of cathedrals being passed away but even what exists is inimitable the choir particularly and the grand front beauvais is called the pucelle yet so far as i can see she wears no staysi mean has no fortifications on we run however vogue la galère et voilà nous à paris hotel de windsor rue rivoli where we are well lodged france so far as i can see which is very little has not undergone many changes the image of war has indeed passed away and we no longer see troops crossing the country in every direction villages either ruined or hastily fortified inhabitants sheltered in the woods and caves to escape the rapacity of the soldiersall this has passed away the inns are much amended there is no occasion for that rascally practice of making a bargainor combiening your landlady before you unharness your horses which formerly was a matter of necessity the general taste of the english seems to regulate the travellingnaturally enough as the hotels of which there are two or three in each town chiefly subsist by them we did not see one french equipage on the road the natives seem to travel entirely in the diligence and doubtless à bon marché the road was thronged with english  but in her great features france is the same as ever an oppressive air of solitude seems to hover over these rich and extended plains while we are sensible that whatever is the motive of the desolation it cannot be sterility the towns are small and have a poor appearance and more frequently exhibit signs of decayed splendour than of thriving and increasing prosperity the château the abode of the gentleman and the villa the retreat of the thriving négociant are rarely seen till you come to beaumont at this place which well deserves its name of the fair mount the prospect improves greatly and countryseats are seen in abundance also woods sometimes deep and extensive at other times scattered in groves and single trees amidst these the oak seldom or never is found england lady of the ocean seems to claim it exclusively as her own neither are there any quantity of firs poplars in abundance give a formal air to the landscape the forests chiefly consist of beeches with some birches and the roads are bordered by elms cruelly cropped pollarded and switched the demand for firewood occasions these mutilations if i could waft by a wish the thinnings of abbotsford here it would make a little fortune of itself but then to switch and mutilate my treesnot for a thousand francs ay but sour grapes quoth the fox  october 30finding ourselves snugly settled in our hotel we determined to remain here at fifteen francs per day we are in the midst of what can be seen and we are very comfortably fed and lodged  this morning wet and surly sallied however by the assistance of a hired coach and left cards for count pozzo di borgo lord granville our ambassador and m gallois author of the history of venice382 found no one at home not even the old pirate galignani383 at whose den i ventured to call showed my companion the louvre which was closed unluckily the front of the palace with its courts and all that splendid quarter which the fame of paris rests upon in security we can never do the like in britain royal magnificence can only be displayed by despotic power in england were the most splendid street or public building to be erected the matter must be discussed in parliament or perhaps some sturdy cobbler holds out and refuses to part with his stall and the whole plan is disconcerted long may such impediments exist but then we should conform to circumstances and assume in our public works a certain sober simplicity of character which should point out that they were dictated by utility rather than show the affectation of an expensive style only places us at a disadvantageous contrast with other nations and our substitute of brick and plaster for freestone resembles the mean ambition which displays bristol stones in default of diamonds  we went to theatre in the eveningcomédie française the place rosemunde the piece it is the composition of a young man with a promising nameÉmile de bonnechose the story that of fair rosamond there were some good situations and the actors in the french taste seemed to me admirable particularly mademoiselle bourgoin it would be absurd to attempt to criticise what i only half understood but the piece was well received and produced a very strong effect two or three ladies were carried out in hysterics one next to our box was frightfully ill a monsieur à belles moustachesthe husband i trust though it is likely they were en partie finewas extremely and affectionately assiduous she was well worthy of the trouble being very pretty indeed the face beautiful even amidst the involuntary convulsions the afterpiece was femme juge et partie with which i was less amused than i had expected because i found i understood the language less than i did ten or eleven years since well well i am past the age of mending  some of our friends in london had pretended that at paris i might stand some chance of being encountered by the same sort of tumultuary reception which i met in ireland but for this i see no ground it is a point on which i am totally indifferent as a literary man i cannot affect to despise public applause as a private gentleman i have always been embarrassed and displeased with popular clamours even when in my favour i know very well the breath of which such shouts are composed and am sensible those who applaud me today would be as ready to toss me tomorrow and i would not have them think that i put such a value on their favour as would make me for an instant fear their displeasure now all this disclamation is sincere and yet it sounds affected it puts me in mind of an old woman who when carlisle was taken by the highlanders in 1745 chose to be particularly apprehensive of personal violence and shut herself up in a closet in order that she might escape ravishment but no one came to disturb her solitude and she

refuge with the petty question good folks can you tell when the ravishing is going to begin i am sure i shall neither hide myself to avoid applause which probably no one will think of conferring nor

seen nearly and remarked deeply and spoke frankly though with due caution he went with us to the museum where i think the hall of sculpture continues to be a fine thing that of pictures but tolerable

rather corpulenthandsome features with all the corsican fire in his eye he was quite kind and communicative lord granville had also called and sent mr jones his secretary to invite us to dinner tomorrow in the evening at the odéon where we saw ivanhoe it was superbly got up the norman soldiers wearing pointed helmets and what resembled much hauberks of mail which looked very well the number of the attendants and the skill with which they were moved and grouped on the stage were well worthy of notice it was an opera and of course the story greatly mangled and the dialogue in a great part nonsense yet it was strange to hear anything like the words which i then in an agony of pain with spasms in my stomach dictated to william laidlaw at abbotsford now recited in a foreign tongue and for

sequestration he saidi was so sanguine as to the success of the memoirs of napoleon that i did not hesitate to express it as my opinion that i had much confidence in it producing him at least £10000

government offices and thence he proceeded to paris in the hope of gathering from various eminent persons authentic anecdotes concerning napoleon his diary shows that he was successful in obtaining many valuable materials for the completion of his historical work and reflects with sufficient distinctness the very brilliant reception he on this occasion experienced both in london and paris the range of his society is strikingly and unconsciously exemplified in the record of one day when we find him breakfasting at the royal lodge in windsor park and supping on oysters and porter in honest dan terrys house like a squirrels cage above the adelphi theatre in the strand there can be no doubt that this expedition was in many ways serviceable in his life of napoleon and i think as little that it was chiefly so by renewing his spirits the deep and respectful sympathy with which his misfortunes and gallant behaviour under them had been regarded by all classes of men at home and abroad was brought home to his perception in a way not to be mistaken he was cheered and gratified and returned to scotland with renewed hope and courage for the prosecution of his marvellous course of

accidental collision there must be when works of a similar character are finished on the same general system of historical manners and the same historical personages are introduced of course if such

between that date and 25th fancied that he saw something in scotts manner that made him hesitate and then finally give up the idea he adds that scotts friends had thrown out hints as to the impropriety of such a political reprobate forming one of the party this suspicion on moores part shows how he had misunderstood scotts real character if scott thought it right to ask the bard of ireland to be his companion no hints from mr wilmot horton or any members of the court party would have influenced him even though they had urged that this political reprobate was author of the fudge family in paris and the twopenny postbag  374 sir george died in 1853 his journal does not appear to have been published  375 dr hughes who died jan 6 1833 aged seventyseven was one of the

was the latter of these who translated from the italian of colletta cinq jours de lhistoire de naples 8vo paris 1820 but at this date he was only thirtyseven and it can scarcely be of him that scott writes p 288 as an elderly man the probability is that it was the elder gallois whom scott saw and that he ascribed to him though the title is misquoted a work written by the younger  383 when he was

1i suppose the ravishing is going to begin for we have had the dames des halles with a bouquet like a maypole and a speech full of honey and oil which cost me ten francs also a small worshipper who would not leave his name but came seulement pour avoir le plaisir la félicité etc etc all this jargon i answer with corresponding blarney of my own for have i not licked the black stone of that ancient castle as to french i speak it as it comes and like doeg in absalom and achitophel      dash on through thick and thin     through sense and nonsense never out nor in  we went this morning with m gallois to the church of st genevieve and thence to the college henri iv where i saw once more my old friend chevalier385 he was unwell swathed in a turban of nightcaps and a multiplicity of robes de chambre but he had all the heart and the vivacity of former times i was truly glad to see the kind old man we were unlucky in our day for sights this being a high festivalall souls day we were not allowed to scale the steeple of st genevieve neither could we see the animals at the jardin des plantes who though they have no souls it is supposed and no interest of course in the devotions of the day observe it in strict retreat like the nuns of kilkenny i met however one lioness walking at large in the jardin and was introduced this was madame de souza386 the authoress of some wellknown french romances of a very classical character i am told for i have never read them she must have been beautiful and is still welllooked she is the mother of the handsome count de flahault and had a very welllooking daughter with her besides a son or two she was very agreeable we are to meet again the day becoming decidedly rainy we returned along the boulevards by the bridge of austerlitz but the weather was so indifferent as to spoil the fine show  we dined at the ambassadorslord granville formerly lord leveson gower he inhabits the same splendid house which lord castlereagh had in 1815 namely numero 30 rue du fauxbourg st honoré it once belonged to pauline borghese and if its walls could speak they might tell us mighty curious stories without their having any tongue they spoke to my feelings with most miraculous organ387 in these halls i had often seen and conversed familiarly with many of the great and powerful who won the world by their swords and divided it by their counsel  here i saw very much of poor lord castlereagha man of sense presence of mind courage and fortitude which carried him through many an affair of critical moment when finer talents might have stuck in the mire he had been i think indifferently educated and his mode of speaking being far from logical or correct he was sometimes in danger of becoming almost ridiculous in spite of his lofty presence which had all the grace of the seymours and his determined courage388 but then he was always up to the occasion and upon important matters was an orator to convince if not to delight his hearers he is gone and my friend stanhope also whose kindness this town so strongly recalls it is remarkable they were the only persons of sense and credibility who both attested supernatural appearances on their own evidence and both died in the same melancholy manner i shall always tremble when any friend of mine becomes visionary389  i have seen in these rooms the emperor alexander platoff schwarzenberg old blucher fouché and many a maréchal whose truncheon had guided armiesall now at peace without subjects without dominion and where their past life perhaps seems but the recollection of a feverish dream what a group would this band have made in the gloomy regions described in the odyssey but to lesser things we were most kindly received by lord and lady granville and met many friends some of them having been guests at abbotsford among these were lords ashley and morpeththere were also charles ellis lord seaford now cum plurimis aliis anne saw for the first time an entertainment à la mode de france where the gentlemen left the parlour with the ladies in diplomatic houses it is a good way of preventing political discussion which john bull is always apt to introduce with the second bottle we left early and came home at ten much pleased with lord and lady granvilles kindness though it was to be expected as our recommendations came from windsor  november 2another gloomy daya pize upon itand we have settled to go to saint cloud and dine if possible with the drummonds at auteuil besides i expect poor wr spencer to breakfast there is another thought which depresses me  wellbut let us jot down a little politics as my book has a pretty firm lock the whigs may say what they please but i think the bourbons will stand gallois no great royalist says that the duke of orleans lives on the best terms with the reigning family which is wise on his part for the golden fruit may ripen and fall of itself but it would be dangerous to      lend the crowd his arm to shake the tree390  the army which was bonapartes strength is now very much changed by the gradual influence of time which has removed many and made invalids of many more the citizens are neutral and if the king will govern according to the charte and what is still more according to the habits of the people he will sit firm enough and the constitution will gradually attain more and more reverence as age gives it authority and distinguishes it from those temporary and ephemeral governments which seemed only set up to be pulled down the most dangerous point in the present state of france is that of religion it is no doubt excellent in the bourbons to desire to make france a religious country but they begin i think at the wrong end to press the observances and ritual of religion on those who are not influenced by its doctrines is planting the growing tree with its head downwards rites are sanctified by belief but belief can never arise out of an enforced observance of ceremonies it only makes men detest what is imposed on them by compulsion then these jesuits who constitute emphatically an imperium in imperio labouring first for the benefit of their own order and next for that of the roman seewhat is it but the introduction into france of a foreign influence whose interest may often run counter to the general welfare of the kingdom  we have enough of ravishment m meurice writes me that he is ready to hang himself that we did not find accommodation at his hotel and madame mirbel came almost on her knees to have permission to take my portrait i was cruel but seeing her weepingripe consented she should come tomorrow and work while i wrote a russian princess galitzin too demands to see me in the heroic vein elle vouloit traverser les mers pour aller voir sws and offers me a rendezvous at my hotel this is precious tomfoolery however it is better than being neglected like a fallen skyrocket which seemed like to be my fate last year  we went to saint cloud with my old friend mr drummond now at a pretty maison de campagne at auteuil saint cloud besides its unequalled views is rich in remembrances i did not fail to revisit the orangerie out of which bon expelled the council of five hundred i thought i saw the scoundrels jumping the windows with the bayonets at their rumps what a pity the house was not two stories high i asked the swiss some questions on the locale which he answered with becoming caution saying however that he was not present at the time there are also new remembrances a separate garden laid out as a playground for the royal children is called il trocadero391 from the siege of cadiz 1823 but the bourbons should not take military groundit is firing a popgun in answer to a battery of cannon  all within the house is changed every trace of nap or his reign totally done away as if traced in sand over which the tide has passed moreau and pichegrus portraits hang in the royal antechamber the former has a mean look the latter has been a strong and sternlooking man i looked at him and thought of his deathstruggles in the guardroom were the heroes of la vendéecharette with his white bonnet the two la rochejacqueleins lescure in an attitude of prayer stofflet the gamekeeper with others  we dined at auteuil mrs drummond formerly the beautiful cecilia telfer has lost her looks but kept her kind heart on our return went to the italian opera and saw figaro anne liked the music to me it was all caviare a mr  dined with us sensible liberal in his politics but well informed and candid  november 3sat to mad mirbelspencer at breakfast went out and had a long interview with marshal macdonald the purport of which i have put down elsewhere visited princess galitzin and also cooper the american novelist this man who has shown so much genius has a good deal of the manner or want of manner peculiar to his countrymen392 he proposed to me a mode of publishing in america by entering the book as the property of a citizen i will think of this every little helps as the tod says when etc at night at the theatre de madame where we saw two petit pieces le mariage de raison and le plus beau jour de ma vieboth excellently played afterwards at lady granvilles rout which was as splendid as any i ever sawand i have seen beaucoup dans ce genre a great number of ladies of the first rank were present and if honeyed words from pretty lips could surfeit i had enough of them one can swallow a great deal of whipped cream to be sure and it does not hurt an old stomach  november 4 anne goes to sit to mad mirbel i called after ten mr cooper and gallois having breakfasted with me the former seems quite serious in desiring the american attempt i must however take care not to give such a monopoly as to prevent the american public from receiving the works at the prices they are accustomed to i think i may as well try if the thing can be done  after ten i went with anne to the tuileries where we saw the royal family pass through the glass gallery as they went to chapel we were very much looked at in our turn and the king on passing out did me the honour to say a few civil words which produced a great sensation mad la dauphine and mad de berri curtsied smiled and looked extremely gracious and smiles bows and curtsies rained on us like odours from all the courtiers and court ladies of the train we were conducted by an officer of the royal gardes du corps to a convenient place in chapel where we had the pleasure of hearing the grand mass performed with excellent music  i had a perfect view of the king and royal family the king is the same in age as i knew him in youth at holyrood housedebonair and courteous in the highest degree mad dauphine resembles very much the prints of marie antoinette in the profile especially she is not however beautiful her features being too strong but they announce a great deal of character and the princess whom bonaparte used to call the man of the family she seemed very attentive to her devotions the duchess of berri seemed less immersed in the ceremony and yawned once or twice she is a livelylooking blondelooks as if she were goodhumoured and happy by no means pretty and has a cast with her eyes splendidly adorned with diamonds however after this gave mad mirbel a sitting where i encountered le général her uncle393 who was chef de létat major to bonaparte he was very communicative and seemed an interesting person by no means over much prepossessed in favour of his late master whom he judged impartially though with affection  we came home and dined in quiet having refused all temptations to go out in the evening this on annes account as well as my own it is not quite gospel though solomon says itthe eye can be tired with seeing whatever he may allege in the contrary and then there are so many compliments i wish for a little of the old scotch causticity i am something like the bee that sips treacle  november 5i believe i must give up my journal till i leave paris the french are literally outrageous in their civilitiesbounce in at all hours and drive one half mad with compliments i am ungracious not to be so entirely thankful as i ought to this kind and merry people we breakfasted with mad mirbel where were the dukes of fitzjames and i think duras394 goodly companybut alls one for that i made rather an impatient sitter wishing to talk much more than was agreeable to madame afterwards we went to the champs elysées where a balloon was let off and all sorts of frolics performed for the benefit of the bons gens de parisbesides stuffing them with victuals i wonder how such a civic festival would go off in london or edinburgh or especially in dublin to be sure they would not introduce their shillelahs but in the classic taste of the french there were no such gladiatorial doings to be sure they have a natural goodhumour and gaiety which inclines them to be pleased with themselves and everything about them  we dined at the ambassadors where was a large party lord morpeth the duke of devonshire and othersall were very kind pozzo di borgo there and disposed to be communicative a large soirée home at eleven these hours are early however  november 6cooper came to breakfast but we were obsédés partout such a number of frenchmen bounced in successively and exploded i mean discharged their compliments that i could hardly find an opportunity to speak a word or entertain mr cooper at all after this we sat again for our portraits mad mirbel took care not to have any one to divert my attention but i contrived to amuse myself with some masons finishing a façade opposite to me who placed their stones not like inigo jones but in the most lubberly way in the world with the help of a large wheel and the application of strength of hand john smith of darnick and two of his men would have done more with a block and pulley than the whole score of them the french seem far behind in machinerywe are almost eaten up with kindness but that will have its end i have had to parry several presents of busts and so forth the funny thing was the airs of my little friend we had a most affectionate partingwet wet cheeks on the ladys side395 the pebblehearted cur shed as few tears as crab of dogged memory396  went to galignanis where the brothers after some palaver offered me £105 for the sheets of napoleon to be reprinted at paris in english i told them i would think of it i suppose treuttel and wurtz had apprehended something of this kind for they write me that they had made a bargain with my publisher cadell i suppose for the publishing of my book in all sorts of ways i must look into this  dined with marshal macdonald and a splendid party397 amongst others marshal marmontmiddle size stoutmade dark complexion and looks sensible the french hate him much for his conduct in 1814 but it is only making him the scapegoat also i saw mons de molé but especially the marquis de lauriston who received me most kindly he is personally like my cousin colonel russell i learned that his brother louis law398 my old friend was alive and the father of a large family i was most kindly treated and had my vanity much flattered by the men who had acted such important parts talking to me in the most frank manner  in the evening to princess galitzin where were a whole covey of princesses of russia arrayed in tartan with music and singing to boot the person in whom i was most interested was mad de boufflers399 upwards of eighty very polite very pleasant and with all the agrémens of a french court lady of the time of mad sévigné or of the correspondent rather of horace walpole cooper was there so the scotch and american lions took the field togetherhome and settled our affairs to depart  november 7off at seven breakfasted at beaumont and pushed on to airaines this being a forced march we had bad lodgings wet wood uncomfortable supper damp beds and an extravagant charge i was never colder in my life than when i waked with the sheets clinging round me like a shroud  november 8 we started at six in the morning having no need to be called twice so heartily was i weary of my comfortless couch breakfasted at abbeville then pushed on to boulogne expecting to find the packet ready to start next morning and so to have had the advantage of the easterly tide but lo ye the packet was not to sail till next day so after shrugging our shouldersbeing the solace à la mode de franceand recruiting ourselves with a pullet and a bottle of chablis à la mode dangleterre we set off for calais after supper and it was betwixt three and four in the morning before we got to desseins when the house was full or reported to be so we could only get two wretched brickpaved garrets as cold and moist as those of airaines instead of the comforts which we were received with at our arrival but i was better prepared stripped off the sheets and lay down in my dressinggown and so roughed it outtant bien que mal  november 9at four in the morning we were called at six we got on board the packet where i found a sensible and conversible mana very pleasant circumstance the day was raw and cold the wind and tide surly and contrary the passage slow and anne contrary to her wont excessively sick we had little trouble at the custom house thanks to the secretary of the embassy mr jones who gave me a letter to mr ward at dover mr ward came with the lieutenantgovernor of the castle and wished us to visit that ancient fortress i regretted much that our time was short and the weather did not admit of our seeing views so we could only thank the gentlemen in declining their civility  the castle partly ruinous seems to have been very fine the cliff to which shakespeare gave his immortal name is as all the world knows a great deal lower than his description implies our dover friends justly jealous of the reputation of their cliff impute this diminution of its consequence to its having fallen in repeatedly since the poets time i think it more likely that the imagination of shakespeare writing perhaps at a period long after he may have seen the rock had described it such as he conceived it to have been besides shakespeare was born in a flat country and dover cliff is at least lofty enough to have suggested the exaggerated features to his fancy at all events it has maintained its reputation better than the tarpeian rockno man could leap from it and live  left dover after a hot luncheon about four oclock and reached london at halfpast three in the morning so adieu to la belle france and welcome merry england400  pall mall november 10ere i leave la belle france however it is fit i should express my gratitude for the unwontedly kind reception which i met with at all hands it would be an unworthy piece of affectation did i not allow that i have been pleasedhighly pleasedto find a species of literature intended only for my own country has met such an extensive and favourable reception in a foreign land where there was so much a priori to oppose its progress  for my work i think i have done a good deal but above all i have been confirmed strongly in the impressions i had previously formed of the character of nap and may attempt to draw him with a firmer hand  the succession of new people and unusual incidents has had a favourable effect on my mind which was becoming rutted like an illkept highway my thoughts have for some time flowed in another and pleasanter channel than through the melancholy course into which my solitary and deprived state had long driven them and which gave often pain to be endured without complaint and without sympathy for this relief as francisco says in hamlet much thanks  today i visited the public offices and prosecuted my researches left inquiries for the duke of york who has recovered from a most desperate state his legs had been threatened with mortification but he was saved by a critical discharge also visited the duke of wellington lord melville and others besides the ladies in piccadilly dined and spent the evening quietly in pall mall  november 11croker came to breakfast and we were soon after joined by theodore hook alias john bull401 he has got as fat as the actual monarch of the herd lockhart sat still with us and we had as gil blas says a delicious morning spent in abusing our neighbours at which my three neighbours are no novices any more than i am myself though like puss in boots who only caught mice for his amusement i am only a chamber counsel in matters of scandal the fact is i have refrained as much as human frailty will permit from all satirical composition here is an ample subject for a little blackballing in the case of joseph hume the great Æconomist who has managed the greek loan so egregiously i do not lack personal provocation see 13th march last yet i wont attack himat present at leastbut quil se garde de moi      im not a king nor nae sic thing       my word it may not stand     and joseph may a buffet bide       come he beneath my brand  at dinner we had a little blowout on sophias part lord dudley mr hay under secretary of state sir thomas lawrence etc mistress as she now calls herself joanna baillie and her sister came in the evening the whole went off pleasantly  november 12went to sit to sir tl to finish the picture for his majesty which every one says is a very fine one i think so myself and wonder how sir thomas has made so much out of an old weatherbeaten block but i believe the hard features of old dons like myself are more within the compass of the artists skill than the lovely face and delicate complexion of females came home after a heavy shower i had a long conversation about  with lockhart all that was whispered is truea sign how much better our domestics are acquainted with the private affairs of our neighbours than we are a dreadful tale of incest and seduction and nearly of blood alsohorrible beyond expression in its complications and eventsand yet the end is notand this man was amiable and seemed the soul of honourlaughed too and was the soul of society it is a mercy our own thoughts are concealed from each other oh if at our social table we could see what passes in each bosom around we would seek dens and caverns to shun human society to see the projector trembling for his falling speculations the voluptuary rueing the event of his debauchery the miser wearing out his soul for the loss of a guineaallall bent upon vain hopes and vainer regretswe should not need to go to the hall of the caliph vathek to see mens hearts broiling under their black veils402 lord keep us from all temptation for we cannot be our own shepherd  we dined today at lady staffords at westhill403 lord s looks very poorly but better than i expected no company excepting sam rogers and mr grenville404the latter is better known by the name of tom grenvillea very amiable and accomplished man whom i knew better about twenty years since age has touched him as it has doubtless affected me the great lady received us with the most cordial kindness and expressed herself i am sure sincerely desirous to be of service to sophia  november 13i consider charless business as settled by a private intimation which i had to that effect from sir wk so i need negotiate no further but wait the event breakfasted at home and somebody with us but the whirl of visits so great that i have already forgot the party lockhart and i dined at an official persons where there was a little too much of that sort of flippant wit or rather smartness which becomes the parochial joe miller of boards and offices you must not be grave because it might lead to improper discussions and to laugh without a joke is a hard task your professed wags are treasures to this species of company gil blas was right in censuring the literary society of his friend fabricio but nevertheless one or two of the mess would greatly have improved the conversation of his commis  went to poor lydia whites and found her extended on a couch frightfully swelled unable to stir rouged jesting and dying she has a good heart and is really a clever creature but unhappily or rather happily she has set up the whole staff of her rest in keeping literary society about her the world has not neglected her it is not always so bad as it is called she can always make up her soirée and generally has some people of real talent and distinction she is wealthy to be sure and gives petit dinners but not in a style to carry the point à force dargent in her case the world is goodnatured and perhaps it is more frequently so than is generally supposed  november 14we breakfasted at honest allan cunninghamshonest allana leal and true scotsman of the old cast a man of genius besides who only requires the tact of knowing when and where to stop to attain the universal praise which ought to follow it i look upon the alteration of its hame and its hame and a wet sheet and a flowing sea as among the best songs going his prose has often admirable passages but he is obscure and overlays his meaning which will not do nowadays when he who runs must read  dined at crokers at kensington with his family the speaker405 and the facetious theodore hook  we came away rather early that anne and i might visit mrs arbuthnot to meet the duke of wellington in all my life i never saw him better he has a dozen of campaigns in his bodyand tough ones anne was delighted with the frank manners of this unequalled pride of british war and me he received with all his usual kindness he talked away about bonaparte russia and france  november 15at breakfast a conclave of medical men about poor little johnnie lockhart they give good words but i cannot help fearing the thing is very precarious and i feel a miserable anticipation of what the parents are to undergo it is wrong however to despair i was myself a very weak child and certainly am one of the strongest men of my age in point of constitution sophia and anne went to the tower i to the colonial office where i laboured hard  dined with the duke of wellington anne with me who could not look enough at the vainqueur du vainqueur de la terre the party were mr and mrs peel and mr and mrs arbuthnot406 vesey fitzgerald bankes and croker with lady bathurst and lady georgina one gentleman took much of the conversation and gave us with unnecessary emphasis and at superfluous length his opinion of a late gambling transaction this spoiled the evening i am sorry for the occurrence though for lord  is fetlock deep in it and it looks like a vile bog this misfortune with the foolish incident at  will not be suffered to fall to the ground but will be used as a counterpoise to the greek loan peel asked me in private my opinion of three candidates for the scotch gown and i gave it him candidly we will see if it has weight407  i begin to tire of my gaieties and the late hours and constant feasting disagree with me i wish for a sheeps head and whisky toddy against all the french cookery and champagne in the world  well i suppose i might have been a judge of session this termattained in short the grand goal proposed to the ambition of a scottish lawyer it is better however as it is while at least i can maintain my literary reputation  i had some conversation today with messrs longman and co they agreed to my deriving what advantage i could in america and that very willingly  november 16breakfasted with rogers with my daughters and lockhart r was exceedingly entertaining in his dry quiet sarcastic manner at eleven to the duke of wellington who gave me a bundle of remarks on bonapartes russian campaign written in his carriage during his late mission to st petersburg408 it is furiously scrawled and the russian names hard to distinguish but it shall do me yeomans service then went to pentonville to old mr handley a solicitor of the old school and manager of the devonshire property had an account of the claim arising on the estate of one mrs owen due to the representatives of my poor wifes mother he was desperately excursive and spoke almost for an hour but the prospect of £4000 to my children made me a patient auditor thence i passed to the colonial office where i concluded my extracts lockhart and i dined with croker at the admiralty au grand couvert no less than five cabinet ministers were presentcanning huskisson melville peel and wellington with subsecretaries by the bushel the cheer was excellent but the presence of too many men of distinguished rank and power always freezes the conversation each lamp shines brightest when placed by itself when too close they neutralise each other409  november 17my morning here began with the arrival of bahauder jah soon after mr wright410 then i was called out to james scott the young painter i greatly fear this modest and amiable creature is throwing away his time next came an animal who is hunting out a fortune in chancery which has lain perdu for thirty years the fellow who is in figure and manner the very essence of the creature called a sloth has attached himself to this pursuit with the steadiness of a wellscented beagle i believe he will actually get the prize  sir john malcolm acknowledges and recommends my persian visitor bruce  saw the duke of york the change on hrh is most wonderful from a big burly stout man with a thick and sometimes an inarticulate mode of speaking he has sunk into a thinfaced slenderlooking old man who seems diminished in his very size i could hardly believe i saw the same person though i was received with his usual kindness he speaks much more distinctly than formerly his complexion is clearer in short hrh seems on the whole more healthy after this crisis than when in the stallfed state for such it seemed to be in which i remember him god grant it his life is of infinite value to the king and countryit is a breakwater behind the throne  november 18was introduced by rogers to mad darblay the celebrated authoress of evelina and ceciliaan elderly lady with no remains of personal beauty but with a gentle manner and a pleasing expression of countenance she told me she had wished to see two personsmyself of course being one the other george canning this was really a compliment to be pleased witha nice little handsome pat of butter made up by a neathanded phillis411 of a dairymaid instead of the grease fit only for cartwheels which one is dosed with by the pound mad darblay told us the common story of dr burney her father having brought home her own first work and recommended it to her perusal was erroneous her father was in the secret of evelina being printed but the following circumstances may have given rise to the storydr burney was at streatham soon after the publication where he found mrs thrale recovering from her confinement low at the moment and out of spirits while they were talking together johnson who sat beside in a kind of reverie suddenly broke out you should read this new work madamyou should read evelina every one says it is excellent and they are right the delighted father obtained a commission from mrs thrale to purchase his daughters work and retired the happiest of men mad darblay said she was wild with joy at this decisive evidence of her literary success and that she could only give vent to her rapture by dancing and skipping round a mulberrytree in the garden she was very young at this time i trust i shall see this lady again she has simple and apparently amiable manners with quick feelings  dined at mr peels with lord liverpool duke of wellington croker bankes etc the conversation very goodpeel taking the lead in his own house which he will not do elsewhere we canvassed the memorable criminal case of ashford412 peel almost convinced of the mans innocence should have been at the play but sat too late at mr peels  so ends my campaign among these magnificoes and potent signiors413 with whom i have found as usual the warmest acceptation i wish i could turn a little of my popularity amongst them to lockharts advantage who cannot bustle for himself he is out of spirits just now and views things au noir i fear johnnies precarious state is the cause  i finished my sittings to lawrence and am heartily sorry there should be another picture of me except that which he has finished the person is remarkably like and conveys the idea of the stout blunt carle that cares for few things and fears nothing he has represented the author as in the act of composition yet has effectually discharged all affectation from the manner and attitude he seems pleased with it himself he dined with us at peels yesterday where by the way we saw the celebrated chapeau de paille which is not a chapeau de paille at all  november 19saw this morning duke of wellington and duke of york the former so communicative that i regretted extremely the length of time414 but have agreed on a correspondence with him trop dhonneur pour moi the duke of york saw me by appointment he seems still mending and spoke of state affairs as a high tory were his health good his spirit is as strong as ever hrh has a devout horror of the liberals having the duke of wellington the chancellor and perhaps a still greater person on his side he might make a great fight when they split as split they will but canning huskisson and a mitigated party of liberaux will probably beat them cannings will and eloquence are almost irresistible but then the church justly alarmed for their property which is plainly struck at and the bulk of the landed interest will scarce brook a mild infusion of whiggery into the administration well time will show  we visited our friends peel lord gwydyr arbuthnot etc and left our tickets of adieu in no instance during my former visits to london did i ever meet with such general attention and respect on all sides  lady louisa stuart dinedalso wright and mr and mrs christie dr and mrs hughes came in the evening so ended pleasantly our last night in london  oxford november 20left london after a comfortable breakfast and an adieu to the lockhart family if i had had but comfortable hopes of their poor pale prostrate child so clever and so interesting i should have parted easily on this occasion but these misgivings overcloud the prospect we reached oxford by six oclock and found charles and his friend young surtees waiting for us with a good fire in the chimney and a good dinner ready to be placed on the table we had struggled through a cold sulky drizzly day which deprived of all charms even the beautiful country near henley so we came from cold and darkness into light and warmth and society nbwe had neither daylight nor moonlight to see the view of oxford from the maudlin bridge which i used to think one of the most beautiful in the world  upon finance i must note that the expense of travelling has mounted high i am too old to rough it and scrub it nor could i have saved fifty pounds by doing so i have gained however in health spirits in a new stock of ideas new combinations and new views my selfconsequence is raised i hope not unduly by the many flattering circumstances attending my reception in the two capitals and i feel confident in proportion in scotland i shall find time for labour and for economy  cheltenham november 21breakfasted with charles in his chambers at brasenose where he had everything very neat how pleasant it is for a father to sit at his childs board it is like an aged man reclining under the shadow of the oak which he has planted my poor plant has some storms to undergo but were this expedition conducive to no more than his entrance into life under suitable auspices i should consider the toil and the expense well bestowed we then sallied out to see the lionsguides being charles and friend surtees mr john hughes young mackenzie fitzcolin and a young companion or two of charless remembering the ecstatic feelings with which i visited oxford more than twentyfive years since i was surprised at the comparative indifference with which i revisited the same scenes reginald heber then composing his prize poem and imping his wings for a long flight of honourable distinction is now dead in a foreign landhodgson and other able men all entombed the towers and halls remain but the voices which fill them are of modern days besides the eye becomes satiated with sights as the full soul loathes the honeycomb i admired indeed but my admiration was void of the enthusiasm which i formerly felt i remember particularly having felt while in the bodleian like the persian magician who visited the enchanted library in the bowels of the mountain and willingly suffered himself to be enclosed in its recesses415 while less eager sages retired in alarm now i had some base thoughts concerning luncheon which was most munificently supplied by surtees at his rooms in university college with the aid of the best ale i ever drank in my life the real wine of ceres and worth that of bacchus dr jenkyns416 the vicechancellor did me the honour to call but i saw him not i called on charles douglas at allsouls and had a chat of an hour with him417  before three set out for cheltenham a long and uninteresting drive which we achieved by nine oclock my sisterinlaw mrs thomas scott and her daughter instantly came to the hotel and seem in excellent health and spirits  november 22breakfasted and dined with mrs scott and leaving cheltenham at seven pushed on to worcester to sleep  november 23breakfasted at birmingham and slept at macclesfield as we came in between ten and eleven the people of the inn expressed surprise at our travelling so late as the general distress of the manufacturers has rendered many of the lower class desperately outrageous the inn was guarded by a special watchman who alarmed us by giving his signal of turn out but it proved to be a poor deserter who had taken refuge among the carriages and who was reclaimed by his sergeant the people talk gloomily of winter when the distress of the poor will be increased  november 24breakfasted at manchester ere we left the senior churchwarden came to offer us his services to show us the town principal manufactures etc we declined his polite offer pleading haste i found his opinion about the state of trade more agreeable than i had ventured to expect he said times were mending gradually but steadily and that the poorrates were decreasing of which none can be so good a judge as the churchwarden some months back the people had been in great discontent on account of the power engines which they conceived diminished the demand for operative labour there was no politics in their discontent however and at present it was diminishing we again pressed onand by dint of exertion reached kendal to sleep thus getting out of the region of the stern sullen unwashed artificers whom you see lounging sulkily along the streets of the towns in lancashire cursing it would seem by their looks the stop of trade which gives them leisure and the laws which prevent them employing their spare time gods justice is requiting and will yet further requite those who have blown up this country into a state of unsubstantial opulence at the expense of the health and morals of the lower classes  november 25took two pair of horses over the shap fells which are covered with snow and by dint of exertion reached penrith to breakfast then rolled on till we found our own horses at hawick and returned to our own home at abbotsford about three in the morning it is well we made a forced march of about one hundred miles for i think the snow would have stopped us had we lingered  abbotsford november 26consulting my purse found my good £60 diminished to quarter less ten in purse £8 naturally reflected how much expense has increased since i first travelled my uncles servant during the jaunts we made together while i was a boy used to have his option of a shilling per diem for board wages and usually preferred it to having his charges borne a servant nowadays to be comfortable on the road should have 4s or 4s 6d board wages which before 1790 would have maintained his master but if this be pitiful it is still more so to find the alteration in my own temper when young on returning from such a trip as i have just had my mind would have loved to dwell on all i had seen that was rich and rare or have been placing perhaps in order the various additions with which i had supplied my stock of informationand now like a stupid boy blundering over an arithmetical question half obliterated on his slate i go stumbling on upon the audit of pounds shillings and pence why the increase of charge i complain of must continue so long as the value of the thing represented by cash continues to rise or as the value of the thing representing continues to decreaselet the economists settle which is the right way of expressing the process when groats turn plenty and eggs grow dear      and so twill be when i am gone     the increasing charge will still go on     and other bards shall climb these hills     and curse your charge dear evening bills  well the skirmish has cost me £200 i wished for informationand i have had to pay for it the information is got the money is spent and so this is the only mode of accounting amongst friends  i have packed my books etc to go by cart to edinburgh tomorrow i idled away the rest of the day happy to find myself at home which is home though never so homely and mine is not so homely neither on the contrary i have seen in my travels none i liked so wellfantastic in architecture and decoration if you pleasebut no real comfort sacrificed to fantasy ever gramercy my own purse saith the song418 ever gramercy my own house quoth i  november 27we set off after breakfast but on reaching fushie bridge at three found ourselves obliged to wait for horses all being gone to the smithy to be roughshod in this snowy weather so we stayed dinner and peter coming up with his horses bowled us into town about eight walter came and supped with us which diverted some heavy thoughts it is impossible not to compare this return to edinburgh with others in more happy times but we should rather recollect under what distress of mind i took up my lodgings in mrs browns last summer and then the balance weighs deeply on the favourable side this house is comfortable and convenient419  edinburgh november 28went to court and resumed old habits dined with walter and jane at mrs jobsons when we returned were astonished at the news of s death and the manner of it a quieter more inoffensive mild and staid mind i never knew he was free from all these sinkings of the imagination which render those who are liable to them the victims of occasional low spirits all belonging to this gifted as it is called but often unhappy class must have felt at times that but for the dictates of religion or the natural recoil of the mind from the idea of dissolution there have been times when they would have been willing to throw away life as a child does a broken toy but poor  was none of these he was happy in his domestic relations and on the very day on which the rash deed was committed was to have embarked for rejoining his wife and child whom i so lately saw anxious to impart to him their improved prospects  o lord what are welords of nature why a tile drops from a housetop which an elephant would not feel more than the fall of a sheet of pasteboard and there lies his lordship or something of inconceivably minute origin the pressure of a bone or the inflammation of a particle of the brain takes place and the emblem of the deity destroys himself or some one else we hold our health and our reason on terms slighter than one would desire were it in their choice to hold an irish cabin  november 29awaked from horrid dreams to reconsideration of the sad reality he was such a kind obliging assiduous creature i thought he came to my bedside to expostulate with me how i could believe such a scandal and i thought i detected that it was but a spirit who spoke by the paleness of his look and the blood flowing from his cravat i had the nightmare in short and no wonder  i felt stupefied all this day but wrote the necessary letters notwithstanding walter jane and mrs jobson dined with usbut i could not gather my spirits but it is nonsense and contrary to my system which is of the stoic school and i think pretty well maintained it is the only philosophy i know or can practise but it cannot always keep the helm  november 30i went to the court and on my return set in order a sheet or two of copy we came back about

389 the story regarding castlereaghs radiant boy is that one night when he was in barracks and alone he saw a figure glide from the fireplace the face becoming brighter as it approached him on lord castlereagh stepping forward to meet it the figure retired again and as he advanced it gradually faded from his view sir walter does not tell us of his friend stanhopes ghostly experience  390 drydens absalom and achitophelcharacter of shaftesburyjgl  391 the name has since been bestowed on the high ground on the bank of the seine on which was built the palace in connection with the international exhibition of 1878  392 it should be noted that scott wrote manner not manners as in all previous editions the word is printed of cooper his latest american biographer mr lounsbury says there was in his manner at times a selfassertion that often bordered or seemed to border on arrogance p 79  of this interview cooper is said to have recorded in after years that scott was so obliging as to make him a number of flattering speeches which however he did not repay in kind giving as a reason for has silence the words of dr johnson regarding his meeting with george iii it was not for me to bandy compliments with my sovereign these two lions met on four occasions viz on the 3d 4th and 6th november scott leaving paris next day  it cannot be too widely known that if scott never derived any profits from the enormous sale of his works in america it was not the fault of his brother author who urged him repeatedly to try the plan here proposed whether the attempt was made is unknown but it is amusing to see one cause of scotts hesitation was the fear that the american public would not get his works at the low prices to which they had been accustomed  393 general monthion  394 fitzjames

and the estate was in their possession at the time of the revolution two or three cadets of the family were of the first emigration and one of them m louis law was a frequent guest of the poets father and afterwards corresponded during many years with himself i am not sure whether it was m louis law whose french designation so much amused the people of edinburgh one brother of the marquis de lauriston however was styled le chevalier de muttonhole this being the name of a village on the scotch propertyjgl  399 the madame de boufflers best known to the world hippolyte de saujon comtesse de boufflers the correspondent not only of walpole but of david hume must have been nearer a hundred than eighty years of age at this date if we are to believe the biographie universelle which gives 1724 as the date of her birth it does not record her death it is known that she took refuge in england during the revolution but count paul de rémusat who has been consulted on the subject has kindly pointed out that the lady of whom scott speaks must have been the widow of the chevalier de boufflersremencourt known by his poems and stories her maiden name was de jean de manville and her first husband was a comte de sabran she died in 1827see correspondance inédite de la comtesse de sabran paris 8vo 1875  400 readers who may wish to compare with the visit of 1826 scotts impressions of paris

desired or devised for such a purpose it seemed as if a legion of sarcastic devils had brooded in synod over the elements of withering derision hook however was the master spirit the majority of the lampoons in prose and all the original poetry in the early volumes from the hunting the hare were from his own pen except perhaps michaels dinner which has been laid at cannings door  oddly enough scott appears to have been the indirect means of placing hook in the editorial chair when he was in london in april 1820 a nobleman called upon him and asked if he could find him in edinburgh some clever fellow to undertake the editorship of a paper about to be established sir walter suggested that his lordship need not go so far afield described hooks situation and the impression he had received of him from his table talk and his magazine the arcadian this was all that occurred but when towards the end of the year john bull electrified london sir walter confessed that he could not help fancying that his mentioning this mans name had had its consequences  hook in spite of his £2000 per annum for several years from john bull and large prices received for his novels died in poverty in 1841 a prematurely aged man his sad story may be read in a most powerful sketch in the quarterly review attributed to mr lockhart  402 see beckfords vathek hall of eblis  403 lady stafford

end of the month the appointment satisfied both political parties though cockburn said that his removal was a great loss to the bar which he had long adorned and where he had the entire confidence of

to you as the oneeyed fellow said when a tennis ball knocked out his remaining luminary my short residue of time before dinner was much cut up by callsall old friends too and men whom i love but this makes the loss of time more galling that one cannot and dare not growl at those on whom it has been bestowed however i made out two hours better than i expected i am now once more at my oar and i will row hard  december 2returned early from court but made some calls by the way dined alone with anne and meant to have worked buti dont know howthis horrid story stuck by me so i een read boutourlins

vivid with his italian ideas only jane besides made out five pages i think or nearly  december 4much colded which is no usual complaint of mine but worked about five leaves so i am quite up with my taskwork and better but my books from abbotsford have not arrived dined with the royal society clubabout thirty members presenttoo many for company after coffee the society were like mungo in the padlock421 i listened without understanding a single word to two scientific papers one about the tail of a comet and the other about a chuckystone besides hearing basil hall describe and seeing him exhibit a new azimuth i have half a mind to cut the whole concern and yet the situation is honourable and as bob acres says one should think of their honour we took possession of our new rooms on the mound which are very handsome and gentlemanlike  december 5annoyed with the cold and its consequences all night and wish i could shirk the court this morning but it must not be was kept late and my cold increased i have had a regular attack of this for many years past whenever i return to the sedentary life and heated rooms of edinburgh which are so different from the open air and constant exercise of the country odd enough that during cold weather and cold nocturnal journeys the cold never touched me yet i am no sooner settled in comfortable quarters and warm wellaired couches but la voilà i made a shift to finish my task however and even a leaf more so we are bang up we dined and supped alone and i went to bed early  december 6a bad and disturbed night with fever headache and some touch of cholera morbus which greatly disturbed my slumbers but i fancy nature was scouring the gun after her own fashion i slept little till morning and then lay abed contrary to my wont until halfpast nine oclock when i came down to breakfast went to court and returned time enough to write about five leaves dined at skenes where we met lord elgin and mr stewart a son of sir m shaw stewart whom i knew and liked poor man talked among other things and persons of sir j campbell of ardkinglas who is now here422 he is happy in escaping from his notorious title of callander of craigforth in my youth he was a blackleg and swindler of the first water and like pistol did      somewhat lean to cutpurse of quick hand423  he was obliged to give up his estate to his son colonel callander a gentleman of honour and as dad went to the continent in the midst of the french revolution he is understood to have gone through many scenes at one time lord elgin assured us he seized upon the island of zante as he pretended by direct authority from the english government and reigned there very quietly for some months until to appease the jealousy of the turks lord elgin despatched a frigate to dethrone the new sovereign afterwards he traversed india in the dress of a fakir he is now eighty and upwards  i should like to see what age and adventures have done upon him i recollect him a very handsome plausible man of all good breeding that of a swindler of good education be it understood is the most perfect  december 7again a very disturbed night scarce sleeping an hour yet well when i rose in the morning i did not do above a leaf today because i had much to read but i am up to onefourth of the volume of 400 pages which i began on the first december current the 31st must and shall see the end of vol vi we dined alone i had a book sent me by a very clever woman in defence of what she calls the rights of her sex clever though i hope she will publish it  december 8another restless and deplorable knightnight i should sayfaith either spelling will suit returned early but much done up with my complaint and want of sleep last night i wrought however but with two or three long interruptions my drowsiness being irresistible went to dine with john murray where met his brother henderland jeffrey harry cockburn rutherfurd and others of that file very pleasantcapital good cheer and excellent winemuch laugh and fun  december 9i do not know why it is that when i am with a party of my opposition friends the day is often merrier than when with our own set is it because they are cleverer jeffrey and harry cockburn are to be sure very extraordinary men yet it is not owing to that entirely i believe both parties meet with the feeling of something like novelty we have not worn out our jests in daily contact there is also a disposition on such occasions to be courteous and of course to be pleased wrought all day but rather dawdled being abominably drowsy i fancy it is bile a visitor i have not had this long time  december 10an uncomfortable and sleepless night and the lime water assigned to cure me seems far less pleasant and about as inefficacious as lime punch would be in the circumstances i felt main stupid the whole forenoon and though i wrote my task yet it was with great intervals of drowsiness and fatigue which made me as we scots says dover away in my armchair walter and jane came to dinner also my coz colonel russell and above and attour424 james ballantyne poor fellow we had a quiet and social evening i acting on prescription well i have seen the daybut no matter  december 11slept indifferent well with a feverish halo about me but no great return of my complaint it paid it off this morning however but the difference was of such consequence that i made an ample days work getting over six pages besides what i may do on this the 11th december i shall have more than onethird of vol vi finished which was begun on the first of this current month dined quiet and at home i must take no more frisks till this fit is over      when once lifes day draws near the gloaming     then farewell careless social roaming     and farewell cheerful tankards foaming                           and social noise     and farewell dear deluding woman                           the joy of joys425  long life to thy fame and peace to thy soul rob burns when i want to express a sentiment which i feel strongly i find the phrase in shakespeareor thee the blockheads talk of my being like shakespearenot fit to tie his brogues426  december 12did not go to the parliament house but drove with walter to dalkeith where we missed the duke and found mr blakeney one thing i saw there which pleased me much and that was my own picture painted twenty years ago by raeburn for constable and which was to have been brought to sale among the rest of the wreck hanging quietly up in the diningroom at dalkeith427 i do not care much about these things yet it would have been annoying to have been knocked down to the best bidder even in effigy and i am obliged to the friendship and delicacy which placed the portrait where it now is dined at archie swintons with all the cousins of that honest clan and met lord cringletie428 his wife and others finished my task this day  december 13went to the court this morning early and remained till past three then attended a meeting of the edinburgh academy directors on account of some discussion about flogging i am an enemy to corporal punishment but there are many boys who will not attend without it it is an instant and irresistible motive and i love boys heads too much to spoil them at the expense of their opposite extremity then when children feel an emancipation on this point we may justly fear they will loosen the bonds of discipline altogether the master i fear must be something of a despot at the risk of his becoming something like a tyrant he governs subjects whose keen sense of the present is not easily ruled by any considerations that are not pressing and immediate i was indifferently well beaten at school but i am now quite certain that twice as much discipline would have been well bestowed  dined at home with walter and jane they with anne went out in the evening i remained but not i fear to work much i feel sorely fagged i am sadly fagged then i cannot get s fate out of my head i see that kind social beneficent face never turned to me without respect and complacence andi see it in the agonies of death this is childish i tell myself so and i trust the feeling to no one else but here it goes down like the murderer who could not cease painting the ideal vision of the man he had murdered and who he supposed haunted him a thousand fearful images and dire suggestions glance along the mind when it is moody and discontented with itself command them to stand and show themselves and you presently assert the power of reason over imagination but if by any strange alterations in ones nervous system you lost for a moment the talisman which controls these fiends would they not terrify into obedience with their mandates rather than we would dare longer to endure their presence  december 14annoyed with this cursed complaint though i live like a hermit on pulse and water bothered too with the court which leaves me little room for proofsheets and none for copy they sat today till past two so before i had walked home and called for half an hour on the chief commissioner the work part of the day was gone and then my lassitudei say lassitudenot indolenceis so great that it costs me an hours nap after i come home we dined today with r dundas of arnistonanne and i there was a small cabal about cheapes election for professor of civil law which it is thought we can carry for him he deserves support having been very indifferently used in the affair of the beacon429 where certain high tories showed a great desire to leave him to the mercy of the enemy as feeble says i will never bear a base mind430 we drank some victorious burgundy contrary to all prescription  december 15egad i think i am rather better for my good cheer i have passed one quiet night at least and that is something gained a glass of good wine is a gracious creature and reconciles poor mortality to itself and that is what few things can do  our election went off very decently no discussions or aggravating speeches sir john jackass seconded the whigs nominee so much they will submit to to get a vote the numbers stoodcheape431 138 bell 132 majority 6mighty hard run the tory interest was weak among the old stagers where i remember it so strong but preferment country residence etc has thinned them then it was strong in the younger classes the new dean james moncreiff432 presided with strict propriety and impartiality walter and jane dined with us  december 16another bad night i remember i used to think a slight illness was a luxurious thing my pillow was then softened by the hand of affection and all the little cares which were put in exercise to soothe the languor or pain were more flattering and pleasing than the consequences of the illness were disagreeable it was a new sense to be watched and attended and i used to think that the malade imaginaire gained something by his humour it is different in the latter stages the old postchaise gets more shattered and out of order at every turn windows will not be pulled up doors refuse to open or being open will not shut againwhich last is rather my case there is some new subject of complaint every moment your sicknesses come thicker and thicker your comforting or sympathising friends fewer and fewer for why should they sorrow for the course of nature the recollection of youth health and uninterrupted powers of activity neither improved nor enjoyed is a poor strain of comfort the best is the long halt will arrive at last and cure all  we had a long sitting in the court came home through a cold easterly rain without a greatcoat and was well wet a goodly medicine for my aching bones433 dined at mr adam wilsons and had some good singing in the evening saw dr stokoe who attended boney in saint helena a plain sensible sort of man434  december 17this was a day of labour agreeably varied by a pain which rendered it scarce possible to sit upright my journal is getting a vile chirurgical aspect  i begin to be afraid of the odd consequences complaints in the post equitem are said to produce walter and jane dined mrs skene came in the evening  december 18almost sick with pain and it stops everything i shall tire of my journal if it is to contain nothing but biles and plasters and unguents in my better days i had stories to tell but death has closed the long dark avenue upon loves and friendships and i can only look at them as through the grated door of a long burialplace filled with monuments of those who were once dear to me with no insincere wish that it may open for me at no distant period provided such be the will of god my pains were those of the heart and had something flattering in their character if in the head it was from the blow of a bludgeon gallantly received and well paid back  i went to the meeting of the commissioners435 there was none today the carriage had set me down so i walked from the college in one of the sourest and most unsocial days which i ever felt why should i have liked this i do not know it is my dogged humour to yield little to external circumstances sent an excuse to the royal society however  december 19went to court no i lie i had business there wrote a task no more could not went out to dalkeith and dined with the duke it delights me to hear this hopeful young nobleman talk with sense and firmness about his plans for improving his estate and employing the poor if god and the world spare him he will be far known as a true scots lord436  december 20being a teind day i had a little repose we dined at hector macdonalds with william clerk and some youngsters highland hospitality as usual i got some work done today  december 21in the house till two oclock nearly came home corrected proofsheets etc mechanically all well would the machine but keep in order but the spinning wheel is auld and stiff  i think i shall not live to the usual verge of human existence i shall never see the threescore and ten and shall be summed up at a discount no help for it and no matter either  december 22poor old honour and glory deadonce lord moira more lately lord hastings he was a man of very considerable talents but had an overmastering degree of vanity of the grossest kind it followed of course that he was gullible in fact the propensity was like a ring in his nose into which any rogue might put a string he had a high reputation for war but it was after the pettifogging hostilities in america where he had done some clever things he died having the credit or rather having had the credit to leave more debt than any man since caesars time £1200000 is said to be the least there was a time that i knew him well and regretted the foibles which mingled with his character so as to make his noble qualities sometimes questionable sometimes ridiculous he was always kind to me poor plantagenet young percival went out to dine at dalkeith with me  december 24to add to my other grievances i have this day a proper fit of rheumatism in my best knee i pushed to abbotsford however after the court rose though compelled to howl for pain as they helped me out of the carriage  abbotsford december 25by dint of abstinence and opodeldoc i passed a better night than i could have hoped for but took up my lodging in the chapel room as it is called for going upstairs was impossible  today i have been a mere wretch i lay in bed till past eleven thinking to get rid of the rheumatism then i walked as far as turnagain with much pain and since that time i have just roasted myself like a potato by the fireside in my study slumbering away my precious time and unable to keep my eyes open or my mind intent on anything if i would have given my life for it i seemed to sleep tolerably too last night but i suppose nature had not her dues properly paid neither has she for some time  i saw the filling up of the quarry on the terrace walk and was pleased anne and i dined at mertoun as has been my old wont and use as christmas day comes about we were late in setting out and i have rarely seen so dark a night the mist rolled like volumes of smoke on the road before us  december 26returned to abbotsford this morning i heard it reported that lord b is very ill if that be true it affords ground for hope that sir john  is not immortal both great bores but the earl has something of wild cleverness far exceeding the ponderous stupidity of the cavaliero jackasso  december 27still weak with this wasting illness but it is clearly going off time it should quoth sancho i began my work again which had slumbered betwixt pain and weakness in fact i could not write or compose at all  december 28stuck to my work mr scrope came to dinner and remained next day we were expecting young percival and his wife once my favourite and beautiful nancy mleod and still a very fine woman but they came not  in bounced g thomson alarmed by an anonymous letter which acquainted him that thirty tents full of catholics were coming to celebrate high mass in the abbey church and to consult me on such a precious document he came prancing about seven at night i hope to get him a kirk before he makes any extraordinary explosion of simplicity  december 29mr and mrs percival came today he is son of the late lamented statesman equally distinguished by talents and integrity the son is a clever young man and has read a good deal pleasant too in society but tampers with phrenology which is unworthy of his fathers son there is a certain kind of cleverish men either half educated or cockbrained by nature who are attached to that same turnipology i am sorry this gentleman should take such whimssorry even for his names sake walter and jane arrived so our christmas party thickens sir adam and colonel ferguson dined  december 30wrote and wrought hard then went out a drive with mr and mrs percival and went round by the lake if my days of good fortune should ever return i will lay out some pretty rides at abbotsford  last day of an eventful year much evil and some good but especially the courage to endure what fortune sends without becoming a pipe for her fingers437  it is not the last day of the year but tomorrow being sunday we hold our festival of neighbours today instead the fergusons came en masse and we had all the usual appliances of mirth and good cheer yet our party like the chariotwheels of pharaoh in the red sea dragged heavily  some of the party grow old and infirm others thought of the absence of the hostess whose reception of her guests was always kind we did as well as we could however      its useless to murmur and pout     theres no good in making ado     tis well the old year is out     and time to begin a new  december 31it must be allowed that the regular recurrence of annual festivals among the same individuals has as life advances something in it that is melancholy we meet on such occasions like the survivors of some perilous expedition wounded and weakened ourselves and looking through the diminished ranks of those who remain while we think of those who are no more or they are like the feasts of the caribs in which they held that the pale and speechless phantoms of the deceased appeared and mingled with the living yet where shall we fly from vain repining or why should we give up the comfort of seeing our friends because they can no longer be to us or we to them what we once were to each other  footnotes  420 during the winter of 18267 sir walter suffered great pain enough to have disturbed effectually any other mans labours whether official or literary from successive attacks of rheumatism which seems to have been fixed on him by the wet sheets of one of his french inns and his diary contains besides various indications that his constitution was already shaking under the fatigue to which he had subjected it formerly however great the quantity of work he put through his hands his evenings were almost all reserved for the light reading of an elbowchair or the enjoyment of his family and friends now he seemed to grudge every minute that was not spent at his desk the little that he read of new books or for mere amusement was done by snatches in the course of his meals and to walk when he could walk at all to the parliament house and back again through the princes street gardens was his only exercise and his only relaxation every ailment of whatever sort ended in aggravating his lameness and perhaps the severest test his philosophy encountered was the feeling of bodily helplessness that from week to week crept upon him the winter to make bad worse was a very cold and stormy one the growing sluggishness of his blood showed itself in chilblains not only on the feet but the fingers and his handwriting becomes more and more cramped and confusedlife vol ix pp

all our family today to dine as usual at the kind house of huntly burn but the same cloud which hung over us on saturday still had its influence the effect of grief upon those who like myself and sir af are highly susceptible of humour has i think been finely touched by wordsworth in the character of the merry village teacher matthew whom jeffrey profanely calls the hysterical schoolmaster438 but with my friend jeffreys pardon i think he loves to see imagination best when it is bitted and managed and ridden upon the grand pas he does not make allowance for starts and sallies and bounds when pegasus is beautiful to behold though sometimes perilous to his rider not that i think the amiable bard of rydal shows judgment in choosing such subjects as the popular mind cannot sympathise in it is unwise and unjust to himself i do not compare myself in point of imagination with wordsworthfar from it for his is naturally exquisite and highly cultivated by constant exercise but i can see as many castles in the clouds as any man as many genii in the curling smoke of a steam engine as perfect a persepolis in the embers of a seacoal fire my life has been spent in such daydreams but i cry no roastmeat there are times a man should remember what rousseau used to say taistoi jeanjacques car on ne tentend pas439  january 2i had resolved to mark down no more griefs and groans but i must needs briefly state that i am nailed to my chair like the unhappy theseus the rheumatism exasperated by my sortie of yesterday has seized on my only serviceable kneeand i am by proserpine motionless as an anvil leeches and embrocations are all i have for it diable there was a twinge the russells and fergusons here but i was fairly driven off the pit after dinner and compelled to retreat to my own bed there to howl till morning like a dog in his solitary cabin  january 3mending slowly two things are comfortable1st i lose no good weather out of doors for the ground is covered with snow 2d that by exerting a little stoicism i can make my illness promote the advance of nap as i can scarcely stand however i am terribly awkward at consulting books maps etc the work grows under my hand however vol vi napoleon will be finished this week i believe russells being still with us i was able by dint of handing and chairing to get to the diningroom and the drawingroom in the evening  talking of wordsworth he told anne and me a story the object of which was to show that crabbe had not imagination he sir george beaumont and wordsworth were sitting together in murray the booksellers backroom sir george after sealing a letter blew out the candle which had enabled him to do so and exchanging a look with wordsworth began to admire in silence the undulating thread of smoke which slowly arose from the expiring wick when crabbe put on the extinguisher anne laughed at the instance and inquired if the taper was wax and being answered in the negative seemed to think that there was no call on mr crabbe to sacrifice his sense of smell to their admiration of beautiful and evanescent forms in two other men i should have said this is affectations440 with sir hugh evans but sir george is the man in the world most void of affectation and then he is an exquisite painter and no doubt saw where the incident would have succeeded in painting the error is not in you yourself receiving deep impressions from slight hints but in supposing that precisely the same sort of impression must arise in the mind of men otherwise of kindred feeling or that the commonplace folks of the world can derive such inductions at any time or under any circumstances  january 4my enemy gained some strength during the watches of the night but has again succumbed under scalding fomentations of camomile flowers i still keep my state for my knee though it has ceased to pain me is very feeble we began to fill the icehouse today dine aloneen famille that is jane anne walter and i why this makes up for aiches as poor john kemble used to call them after tea i broke off work and read my young folks the farce of the critic and merry folks were we  january 5i waked or aked if you please for five or six hours i think then fevered a little i am better though god be thanked and can now shuffle about and help myself to what i want without ringing every quarter of an hour it is a fine clear sunny day i should like to go out but flannel and poultices cry nay so i drudge away with the assisting of pelet who has a real french head believing all he desires should be true and affirming all he wishes should be believed skenes mr and mrs with miss jardine arrived about six oclock skene very rheumatic as well as i am  january 6worked till dusk but not with much effect my head and mind not clear somehow w laidlaw at dinner in the evening read footes farce of the commissary said to have been levelled at sir lawrence dundas but sir lawrence was a man of family walter and jane dined at mertoun  january 7wrought till twelve then sallied and walked with skene for two miles home and corrected proofs and to a large amount mr scrope and george thomson dined  january 8slept well last night in consequence i think of my walk which i will god willing repeat today i wrote some letters too long delayed and sent off my packets to jb letter from c sharpe very pressing i should employ my interest at windsor to oppose the alterations on the town of edinburgh one word from you and all that i dont think i shall speak that word though i hate the alterations that is certain but then ne accesseris in consilium nisi vocatuswhat is the use of my volunteering an opinion again the value of many peoples property may depend on this plan going forward have i a right from mere views of amenity to interfere with those serious interests i something doubt it then i have always said that i never meddle in such work and ought i sotto voce now to begin it by my faith i wont there are enough to state the case besides me441  the young duke of b came in to bid us goodbye as he is going off to england god bless him he is a hawk of a good nest afterwards i walked to the welsh pool skene declining to go for i      not over stout of limb     seem stronger of the two  january 9this morning received the longexpected news of the duke of yorks death442 i am sorry both on public and private accounts his rh was while he occupied the situation of next in the royal succession a breakwater behind the throne i fear his brother of clarences opinions may be different and that he will hoist a standard under which will rendezvous men of desperate hopes and evil designs i am sorry too on my own account the duke of york was uniformly kind to me and though i never tasked his friendship deeply yet i find a powerful friend is gone his virtues were honour good sense integrity and by exertion of these qualities he raised the british army from a very low ebb to be the pride and dread of europe his errors were those of a sanguine and social temper he could not resist the temptation of deep play which was fatally allied with a disposition to the bottle this last is incident to his complaint which vinous influence soothes for the time while it insidiously increases it in the end  here blows a gale of wind i was to go to galashiels to settle some foolish lawsuit and afterwards to have been with mr kerr of kippilaw to treat about a marchdike i shall content myself with the first duty for this day does not suit bowdenmoor  went over to galashiels like the devil in a gale of wind and found a writer contesting with halfadozen unwashed artificers the possession of a piece of ground the size and shape of a threecornered pockethandkerchief tried to gar them gree and if i succeed i shall think i deserve something better than the touch of rheumatism which is like to be my only reward  scotts of harden and john pringle of clifton dined and we got on very well  january 10enter rheumatism and takes me by the knee so much for playing the peacemaker in a shower of rain nothing for it but patience cataplasm of camomile and labour in my own room the whole day till dinnertimethen company and reading in the evening  january 11ditto repeated i should have thought i would have made more of these solitary days than i find i can do a morning or two or three hours before dinner have often done more efficient work than six or seven of these hours of languor i cannot say of illness can produce a bow that is slackly strung will never send an arrow very far heavy snow we are engaged at mr scropes but i think i shall not be able to go i remained at home accordingly and having nothing else to do worked hard and effectively i believe my sluggishness was partly owing to the gnawing rheumatic pain in my knee for after all i am of opinion pain is an evil let stoics say what they will thank god it is an evil which is mending with me  january 12all this day occupied with camomile poultices and pen and ink it is now four oclock and i have written yesterday and today ten of my pagesthat is onetenth of one of these large volumesmoreover i have corrected three proofsheets i wish it may not prove fools haste yet i take as much pains too as is in my nature  january 13the fergusons with my neighbours mr scrope and mr bainbridge and young hume eat a haunch of venison from drummond castle and seemed happy we had music and a little dancing and enjoyed in others the buoyancy of spirit that we no longer possess ourselves yet i do not think the young people of this age so gay as we were there is a turn for persiflage a fear of ridicule among them which stifles the honest emotions of gaiety and lightness of spirit and people when they give in the least to the expansion of their natural feelings are always kept under by the fear of becoming ludicrous to restrain your feelings and check your enthusiasm in the cause even of pleasure is now a rule among people of fashion as much as it used to be among philosophers  january 14wellmy holidays are outand i may count my gains and losses as honest robinson crusoe used to balance his accounts of good and evil  i have not been able during three weeks to stir above once or twice from the house but then i have executed a great deal of work which would be otherwise unfinished  again i have sustained long and sleepless nights and much pain true but no one is the worse of the thoughts which arise in the watches of the night and for pain the complaint which brought on this rheumatism was not so painful perhaps but was infinitely more disagreeable and depressing  something there has been of dulness in our little reunions of society which did not use to cloud them but i have seen all my own old and kind friends with my dear children charles alone excepted and if we did not rejoice with perfect joy it was overshadowed from the same sense of regret  again this new disorder seems a presage of the advance of age with its infirmities but age is but the cypress avenue which terminates in the tomb where the weary are at rest  i have been putting my things to rights to go off tomorrow though i always wonder why it should be so i feel a dislike to order and to taskwork of all kindsa predominating foible in my disposition i do not mean that it influences me in morals for even in youth i had a disgust at gross irregularities of any kind and such as i ran into were more from compliance with others and a sort of false shame than any pleasure i sought or found in dissipation but what i mean is a detestation of precise order in petty mattersin reading or answering letters in keeping my papers arranged and in order and so on weber and then gordon used to keep my things in some ordernow they are verging to utter confusion and then i have let my cash run ahead since i came from the continenti must slump the matter as i can  shandwick place january 15 off we came and despite of rheumatism i got through the journey comfortably greeted on my arrival by a number of small accounts whistling like grapeshot they are of no great avail and incurred i see chiefly during the time of illness but i believe it will take me some hard work till i pay them and how to get the time to work it will be hard purchased if as i think not unlikely this bitch of a rheumatism should once more pin me to my chair coming through galashiels we met the laird of torwoodlee who on hearing how long i had been confined asked how i bore it observing that he had once in his life torwoodlee must be between sixty and seventy been confined for five days to the house and was like to hang himself i regret gods free air as much as any man but i could amuse myself were it in the bastile  january 16went to court and returned through a curious atmosphere half mist half rain famous for rheumatic joints yet i felt no increase of my plaguey malady but on the contrary am rather better i had need otherwise a pair of crutches for life were my prettiest help  walter dined with us today jane remaining with her mother the good affectionate creatures leave us tomorrow god send them a quick passage through the irish channel they go to gort where walters troop is lyinga long journey for winter days  january 17another proper day of mist sleet and rain through which i navigated homeward i imagine the distance to be a mile and a half it is a good thing to secure as much exercise  i observed in the papers my old friend giffords funeral he was a man of rare attainments and many excellent qualities the translation of juvenal is one of the best versions ever made of a classical author and his satire of the baviad and maeviad squabashed at one blow a set of coxcombs who might have humbugged the world long enough  as a commentator he was capital could he but have suppressed his rancour against those who had preceded him in the task but a misconstruction or misinterpretation nay the misplacing of a comma was in giffords eyes a crime worthy of the most severe animadversion the same fault of extreme severity went through his critical labours and in general he flagellated with so little pity that people lost their sense of the criminals guilt in dislike of the savage pleasure which the executioner seemed to take in inflicting the punishment  this lack of temper probably arose from indifferent health for he was very valetudinary and realised two verses wherein he says fortune assigned him         one eye not over good     two sides that to their cost have stood             a ten years hectic cough     aches stitches all the various ills     that swell the devlish doctors bills     and sweep poor mortals off  but he might also justly claim as his gift the moral qualities expressed in the next fine stanza                    a soul     that spurns the crowds malign control              a firm contempt of wrong     spirits above afflictions power     and skill to soothe the lingering hour              with no inglorious song443  january 18to go on with my subjectgifford was a little man dumpled up together and so illmade as to seem almost deformed but with a singular expression of talent in his countenance though so little of an athlete he nevertheless beat off dr wolcot when that celebrated person the most unsparing calumniator of his time chose to be offended with gifford for satirising him in his turn peter pindar made a most vehement attack but gifford had the best of the affray and remained i think in triumphant possession of the field of action and of the assailants cane gifford had one singular custom he used always to have a duenna of a housekeeper to sit in his study with him while he wrote this female companion died when i was in london and his distress was extreme i afterwards heard he got her place supplied i believe there was no scandal in all this444  this is another vile day of darkness and rain with a heavy yellow mist that might become charing crossone of the benefits of our extended city for that in our atmosphere was unknown till the extent of the buildings below queen street mculloch of ardwell called  wrought chiefly on a critique of mrs charlotte smiths novels445 and proofs  january 19uncle adam446 vide inheritance who retired last year from an official situation at the age of eightyfour although subject to fits of giddiness and although carefully watched by his accomplished daughter is still in the habit of walking by himself if he can by possibility make an escape the other day in one of these excursions he fell against a lamppost cut himself much bled a good deal and was carried home by two gentlemen what said old ruggedandtough why that his fall against the post was the luckiest thing could have befallen him for the bleeding was exactly the remedy for his disorder      lo stout hearts of men called on said uncle also on david hume lord chiefcommissioner will clerk mrs jobson and others my knee made no allowance for my politeness but has begun to swell again and to burn like a scorpions bite  january 20scarce slept all night scarce able to stand or move this morning almost an absolute fixture      a sleepless knight     a weary knight           god be the guide447  this is at the court a blank day being that of the poor duke of yorks funeral i can sit at home luckily and fag hard  and so i have pretty well six leaves written and four or five proofsheets corrected cadell came to breakfast and proposes an eighth volume for napoleon i told him he might write to longman for their opinion seven is an awkward number and will extremely cramp the work eight too would go into six octavos should it ever be called for in that shape but it shall be as they list to have it  january 21a long day of some pain relieved by labour dr ross came in and recommended some stuff which did little good i would like ill to lose the use of my precious limbs meanwhile patience cousin and shuffle the cards  missie dined with us todayan honest scotch lass ladylike and frank i finished about six leaves doing indeed little else  january 22work varied with camomile we get on though a visit from basil hall with mr audubon the ornithologist who has followed that pursuit by many a long wandering in the american forests he is an american by naturalisation a frenchman by birth448 but less of a frenchman than i have ever seenno dash or glimmer or shine about him but great simplicity of manners and behaviour slight in person and plainly dressed wears long hair which time has not yet tinged his countenance acute handsome and interesting but still simplicity is the predominant characteristic i wish i had gone to see his drawings but i had heard so much about them that i resolved not to see thema crazy way of mine your honourfive more leaves finished  january 23i have got a piece of armour a kneecap of chamois leather which i think does my unlucky rheumatism some good i begin too to sleep at night which is a great comfort spent this day completely in labour only betwixt dinner and tea while husbanding a tumbler of whisky and water i read the new novel elizabeth de bruce449part of it that is  january 24visit from mr audubon who brings some of his birds the drawings are of the first orderthe attitudes of the birds of the most animated character and the situations appropriate one of a snake attacking a birds nest while the birds the parents peck at the reptiles eyesthey usually in the longrun destroy him says the naturalist the feathers of these gay little sylphs most of them from the southern states are most brilliant and are represented with what were it not connected with so much spirit in the attitude i would call a laborious degree of execution this extreme correctness is of the utmost consequence to the naturalist but as i think having no knowledge of virtu rather gives a stiffness to the drawings this sojourner in the desert had been in the woods for months together he preferred associating with the indians to the company of the back settlers very justly i daresay for a civilised man of the lower orderthat is the dregs of civilisationwhen thrust back on the savage state becomes worse than a savage they are wordsworths adventurer      deliberate and undeceived     the wild mens vices who received     and gave them back his own450  the indians he says are dying fast they seem to pine and die whenever the white population approaches them the shawanese who amounted mr audubon says to some thousands within his memory are almost extinct and so are various other tribes mr audubon could never hear any tradition about the mammoth though he made anxious inquiries he gives no countenance to the idea that the red indians were ever a more civilised people than at this day or that a more civilised people had preceded them in north america he refers the bricks etc occasionally found and appealed to in support of this opinion to the earlier settlersor where kettles and other utensils may have been found to the early trade between the indians and the spaniards  john russell451 and leonard horner452 came to consult me about the propriety and possibility of retaining the northern pronunciation of the latin in the new edinburgh academy453 i will think of it until tomorrow being no great judge we had our solitary dinner indeed it is only remarkable nowadays when we have a guest  january 25thought during the watches of the night and a part of the morning about the question of latin pronunciation and came to the following conclusions that the mode of pronunciation approved by buchanan and by milton and practised by all nations excepting the english assimilated in sound too to the spanish italian and other languages derived from the latin is certainly the best and is likewise useful as facilitating the acquisition of sounds which the englishman attempts in vain accordingly i wish the cockneyfied pedant who first disturbed it by reading emo for amo and quy for qui had choked in the attempt but the question is whether a youth who has been taught in a manner different from that used all over england will be heard if he presumes to use his latin at the bar or the senate and if he is to be unintelligible or ludicrous the question arises whether his education is not imperfect under one important view i am very unwilling to sacrifice our sumpsimus to their old mumpsimusstill more to humble ourselves before the saxons while we can keep an inch of the scottish flag flying but this is a question which must be decided not on partialities or prejudices  i got early from the court today and settled myself to work hard  january 26my rheumatism is almost gone i can walk without major weir which is the name anne gives my cane because it is so often out of the way that it is suspected like the staff of that famous wizard454 to be capable of locomotion went to court and tarried till three oclock after which transacted business with mr gibson and dr inglis as one of miss humes trustees then was introduced to young mr rennie455 or he to me by sir james hall a genteellooking young man and speaks well he was called into public notice by having many years before made a draught of a plan of his fathers for london bridge it was sought for when the building was really about to take place and the assistance which young mr rennie gave to render it useful raised his character so high that his brother and he are now in firstrate practice as civil engineers  january 27read elizabeth de bruce it is very clever but does not show much originality the characters though very entertaining are in the manner of other authors and the finished and filled up portraits of which the sketches are to be found elsewhere one is too apt to feel on such occasions the pettish resentment that you might entertain against one who had poached on your manor but the case is quite different and a claim set up on having been the first who betook himself to the illustration of some particular class of characters or department of life is no more a right of monopoly than that asserted by the old buccaneers by setting up a wooden cross and killing an indian or two on some new discovered island if they can make anything of their first discovery the better luck theirs if not let others come penetrate further into the country write descriptions make drawings or settlements at their pleasure  we were kept in parliament house till three called to return thanks to mr menzies of pitfoddels who lent some pamphlets about the

breakfasted with dr marshman457 the head of the missionaries at serampore a great oriental scholar he is a thin darkfeatured middlesized man about fifty or upwards his eye acute his hair just beginning to have a touch of the grey he spoke well and sensibly and seemed liberal in his ideas he was clearly of opinion that general information must go hand in hand or even ought to precede religious instruction thinks the influence of european manners is gradually making changes in india the natives so far as their religion will allow them are become fond of europeans and invite them to their great festivals he has a conceit that the afghans are the remains of the ten tribes i cannot find he has a better reason than their own tradition which calls them benisrael and says they are not benjudah they have jewish rites and ceremonies but so have all mahometans neither could i understand that their language has anything peculiar the worship of bhoodah he conceives to have been an original or rather the original of hindu religion until the brahmins introduced the doctrines respecting caste and other peculiarities but it would require strong proof to show that the superstition of caste could be introduced into a country which had been long peopled and where society had long existed without such restriction it is more like to be adopted in the early history of a tribe when there are but few individuals the descent of whom is accurately preserved how could the castes be distinguished or told off in a populous nation dr marshman was an old friend of poor john leyden  january 30blank day at court being the martyrdom wrought hard at bon all day though i had settled otherwise i ought to have been at an article for john lockhart and one for poor gillies but there is something irresistible in contradiction even when it consists in doing a thing equally laborious but not the thing you are especially called upon to do it is a kind of cheating the devil which a selfwilled monster like me is particularly addicted to not to make myself worse than i am though i was full of information about the russian campaign which might evaporate unless used like lime as soon after it was wrought up as possible about three pitfoddels called a bauld crack that auld papist body and well informed we got on religion he is very angry with the irish demagogues and a sound

be quite unfit for a good fellow like mother cole in the minor a thimbleful upsets me459i mean annoys my stomach for my brains do not suffer well i have had my time of these merry doings      the haunch of the deer and the wines red dye     never bard loved them better than i  but it was for the sake of sociality never either for the flask or the venison that must endis ended the evening sky of life does not reflect those brilliant flashes of light that shot across its morning and noon yet i thank god it is neither gloomy nor disconsolately lowering a sober twilightthat is all  i am in great hopes that the bannatyne club by the assistance of thomsons wisdom industry and accuracy will be something far superior to the dilettanti model on which it started the historie of k james vi melvilles memoirs and other works executed or in hand are decided boons to scottish history and literature  february 2in confirmation of that which is above stated i see in thorpes salecatalogue a set of the bannatyne books lacking five priced £25 had a dry walk from the court by way of dainty and made it a long one anne went at night to lady mintos  hear of miss whites death poor lydia she had a party at dinner on the friday before and had written with her own hand invitations for another party twenty years ago she used to tease me with her youthful affectationsher dressing like the queen of chimneysweeps on mayday morning and sometimes with rather a free turn in conversation when she let her wit run wild but she was a woman of much wit and had a feeling and kind heart she made her point good a basbleu in london to a point not easily attained and contrived to have every evening a very good literary mêlée and little dinners which were very entertaining she had also the newest lions upon town in a word she was not and would not be forgotten even when disease obliged her as it did for years to confine herself to her couch and the world much abused for hardheartedness was kind in her caseso she lived in the society she liked no great expenditure was necessary for this she had an easy fortune but not more poor lydia i saw the duke of york and her in london when death it seems was brandishing his dart over them460      the view ot gave them little fright461  did not get quite a days work finished today thanks to my walk  february 3there is nought but care on every hand james hogg writes that he is to lose his farm462 on which he laid out or rather threw away the profit of all his publications  then terry has been pressed by gibson for my debt to him that i may get managed  i sometimes doubt if i am in what the good people call the right way not to sing my own praises i have been willing always to do my friends what good was in my power and have not shunned personal responsibility but then that was in money matters to which i am naturally indifferent unless when the consequences press on me but then i am a bad comforter in case of inevitable calamity and feeling proudly able to endure in my own case i cannot sympathise with those whose nerves are of a feebler texture  dined at jeffreys with lord and lady minto john murray and his lady463 a mr featherstone an americoyorkshireman and some others mrs murray is a very amiable person and seems highly accomplished plays most brilliantly  february 4rr these two letters you must understand do not signify as in bibliomania phrase a double degree of rarity but chirurgically a double degree of rheumatism the wine gets to weak places ross says i have a letter from no less a person than that pink of booksellers sir richard phillips who it seems has been ruined and as he sees me floating down the same dark tide sings out his nos poma natamus  february 5r one r will do today if this cursed rheumatism gives way to february weather i will allow she has some right to be called a spring month to which otherwise her pretensions are slender i worked this morning till two oclock and visited mr grants464 pictures who has them upon sale they seem to my inexperienced eye genuine or at least good paintings but i fear picturebuying like horsejockeyship is a profession a gentleman cannot make much of without laying aside some of his attributes the pictures are too highpriced i should think for this market there is a very knowing catalogue by frank grant himself next went to see a show of wild beasts it was a fine one i think they keep them much cleaner than formerly when the strong smell generally gave me a headache for the day the creatures are also much tamer which i impute to more knowledge of their habits and kind treatment a lion and tigress went through their exercise like poodlesjumping standing and lying down at the word of command this is rather degrading i would have the lord chancellor of beasts goodhumoured not jocose i treated the elephant who was a noble fellow to a shillings worth of cakes i wish i could have enlarged the space in which so much bulk and wisdom is confined he kept swinging his head from side to side looking as if he marvelled why all the fools that gaped at him were at liberty and he cooped up in the cage  dined at the royal society clubabout thirty present went to the society in the evening and heard an essay by peter tytler465 on the first encourager of greek learning in england466  february 6was at court till two afterwards wrote a good deal which has become a habit with me dined at sir john hays where met the advocate and a pleasant party there had been a justiciary trial yesterday in which something curious had occurred a woman of rather the better class a farmers wife had been tried on the 5th for poisoning her maidservant there seems to have been little doubt of her guilt but the motive was peculiar the unfortunate girl had an intrigue with her son which this mrs smith i think that is the name was desirous to conceal from some illadvised puritanic notions and also for fear of her husband she could find no better way of hiding the shame than giving the girl with her own knowledge and consent i believe potions to cause abortion which she afterwards changed for arsenic as the more effectual silencing medicine in the course of the trial one of the jury fell down in an epileptic fit and on his recovery was far too much disordered to permit the trial to proceed with only fourteen jurymen it was impossible to go on but the advocate sir william rae says she shall be tried anew since she has not tholed an assize sic paulus aitet recte quidem but having been half tried i think she should have some benefit of it as far as saving her life if convicted on the second indictment the advocate declares however she shall be hanged as certainly she deserves but it looks something like hanging up a man who has been recovered by the surgeons which has always been accounted harsh justice  february 7wrote six leaves today and am tiredthats all  february 8i lost much time today i got from the court about halfpast twelve therefore might have reckoned on four hours or three at least before dinner but i had to call on dr shortt at two which made me lounge till that hour came then i missed him and too tired to return went to see the exhibition where skene was hanging up the pictures and would not let me in then to the oil gas company who propose to send up counsel to support their new bill as i thought the choice unadvisedly made i fairly opposed the mission which i suppose will give much offence but i have no notion of being shamefaced in doing my duty and i do not think i should permit forward persons to press into situations for which their vanity alone renders them competent had many proofsheets to correct in the evening  february 9we had a long day of it at court but i whipped you off halfadozen of letters for as my cases stood last on the roll i could do what i liked in the interim this carried me on till two oclock called on baron hume and found him as usual in high spirits notwithstanding his late illness then crept homemy rheumatism much better though corrected lives of lord somerville and the king george iii467 for the prose works which took a long time but i had the whole evening to myself as anne dined with the swintons and went to a ball at the justiceclerks nbit is the first and only ball which has been given this seasona sign the times are pinching  february 10i got a present of lord francis gowers printed but unpublished tale of the mill468 it is a fine tale of terror in itself and very happily brought out he has certainly a true taste for poetry i do not know why but from my childhood i have seen something fearful or melancholy at least about a mill whether i had been frightened at the machinery when very young of which i think i have some shadowy recollectionwhether i had heard the stories of the miller of thirlestane469 and similar molendinar tragedies i cannot tell but not even recollection of the lass of paties mill or the miller of mansfield or he who dwelt on the river dee have ever got over my inclination to connect gloom with a mill especially when sun is setting so i entered into the spirit of the terror with which lord francis has invested his haunted spot i dine with the solicitor today so quoad labour tis a blank but then tomorrow is a new day      tomorrow to fresh meads and pastures new470  february 11wrought a good deal in the morning and landed boney at smolensk but i have him to bring off again and moreover i must collate the authorities on the movements of the secondary armies of witgenstein and the admiral with the breaktooth name dined with lord minto where i met thomson cranstoun and other gay folks these dinner parties narrow my working hours yet they must sometimes be or one would fall out of the line of society and go to leeward entirely which is not right to venture this is the high time for parties in edinburgh no wonder one cannot keep clear  february 12i was obliged to read instead of writing and the infernal russian names which everybody spells ad libitum makes it difficult to trace the operations on a better map than mine i called today on dr shortt principal surgeon at saint helena and who presided at the opening of bonapartes body he mentions as certain the falsehood of a number of the assertions concerning his usage the unhealthy state of the island and so forth i have jotted down his evidence elsewhere i could not write when i came home nervous a little i think and not yet up to the motions of tchitchagoff as i must be before i can write will clerk and sir a ferguson dine here todaythe first time any one has had that honour for long enough unless at abbotsford the good lord chiefcommissioner invited himself and i asked his son admiral adam col ferguson is of the party  february 13the dining parties come thick and interfere with work extremely i am however beforehand very far yet as james b saysthe tortoise comes up with the hare so puss must make a new start but not this week went to see the exhibitioncertainly a good one for scotlandand less trash than i have seen at somersethouse begging pardon of the pockpuddings there is a beautiful thing by landseera highlander and two staghounds engaged with a deer very spirited indeed i forgot my rheumatism and could have wished myself of the party there were many fine folks and there was a collation chocolate and so forth we dine at sir h jardines with lord chcom lord chiefbaron etc  february 14deaths gien the art an unco devel471 sir george beaumonts dead by far the most sensible and pleasing man i ever knew kind too in his nature and generous gentle in society and of those mild manners which tend to soften the causticity of the general london tone of persiflage and personal satire as an amateur he was a painter of the very highest rank though i know nothing of the matter yet i should hold him a perfect critic on painting for he always made his criticisms intelligible and used no slang i am very sorry as much as is in my nature to be for one whom i could see but seldom he was the great friend of wordsworth and understood his poetry which is a rare thing for it is more easy to see his peculiarities than to feel his great merit or follow his abstract ideas i dined today at lord chcommissionerslord minto and lord chbaron also harden little done today  february 15rheumatism returns with the snow i had thoughts of going to abbotsford on saturday but if this lasts it will not do and sooth to speak it ought not to do though it would do me much pleasure if it would do  i have a letter from baron von goethe472 which i must have read to me for though i know german i have forgot their written hand i make it a rule seldom to read and never to answer foreign letters from literary folks it leads to nothing but the battledore and shuttlecock intercourse of compliments as light as cork and feathers but goethe is different and a wonderful fellow the ariosto at once and almost the voltaire of germany who could have told me thirty years ago i should correspond and be on something like an equal footing with the author of goetz ay and who could have told me fifty things else that have befallen me473  february 16r still snow and alas no time for work so hard am i fagged by the court and the good company of edinburgh i almost wish my rheumatics were bad enough to give me an apology for staying a week at home but we have sunday and monday clear if not better i will cribb off tuesday and wednesday is teind day we dined today with mr borthwick younger of crookston  february 17james ferguson ill of the rheumatism in head and neck and hector b macdonald in neck and shoulders i wonder as commodore trunnion says what the blackguard hellsbaby has to say to the clerks of session474 went to the second division to assist hector nbdont like it half so well as my own for the speeches are much longer home at dinner and wrought in the evening  february 18very cold weather i am rather glad i am not in the country what says dean swift      when frost and snow come both together     then sit by the fire and save shoe leather wrought all morning and finished five pages missie dined with us  february 19as well i give up abbotsford for hamilton is laid up with the gout the snow too continues with a hard frost i have seen the day i would have liked it all the better i read and wrote at the bitter account of the french retreat from moscow in 1812 till the little room and coal fire seemed snug by comparison i felt cold in its rigour in my childhood and boyhood but not since in youth and advanced life we get less sensible to it but i remember thinking it worse than hunger uninterrupted today and did eight leaves475  february 20at court and waited to see the poisoning woman she is clearly guilty but as one or two witnesses said the poor wench hinted an intention to poison herself the jury gave that bastard verdict not proven i hate that caledonian medium quid one who is not proven guilty is innocent in the eye of law it was a face to do or die or perhaps to do to die thin features which had been handsome a flashing eye an acute and aquiline nose lips much marked as arguing decision and i think bad temperthey were thin and habitually compressed rather turned down at the corners as one of a rather melancholy disposition there was an awful crowd but sitting within the bar i had the pleasure of seeing much at my ease the constables knocking the other folks about which was of course very entertaining476  lord liverpool is ill of an apoplexy i am sorry for it he will be missed who will be got for premier not b certainly477 he wants weight if peel would consent to be made a peer he would do better but i doubt his ambition will prefer the house of commons wrought a a good deal  february 21being the vacant wednesday i wrote all the morning had an answer from d of w unsuccessful in getting young skene put upon the engineer list he is too old went out at two with anne and visited the exhibition also called on the mansfield family and on sydney smith jeffrey unwell from pleading so long and late for the poisoning woman he has saved her throat and taken a quinsey in his own adam ferguson has had a fall with his horse  february 22was at court till two then lounged till will murray478 came to speak about a dinner for the theatrical fund in order to make some arrangements there are 300 tickets given out479 i fear it will be uncomfortable and whatever the stoics may say a bad dinner throws cold water on the charity i have agreed to preside a situation in which i have been rather felicitous not by much superiority of wit or wisdom far less of eloquence but by two or three simple rules which i put down here for the benefit of posterity  1st always hurry the bottle round for five or six rounds without prosing yourself or permitting others to prose a slight fillip of wine inclines people to be pleased and removes the nervousness which prevents men from speakingdisposes them in short to be amusing and to be amused  2d push on keep moving as punch says do not think of saying fine thingsnobody cares for them any more than for fine music which is often too liberally bestowed on such occasions speak at all ventures and attempt the mot pour rire you will find people satisfied with wonderfully indifferent jokes if you can but hit the taste of the company which depends much on its character even a very high party primed with all the cold irony and non est tanti feelings or no feelings of fashionable folks may be stormed by a jovial rough round and ready preses choose your texts with discretion the sermon may be as you like if a drunkard or an ass breaks in with anything out of joint if you can parry it with a jest good and wellif not do not exert your serious authority unless it is something very bad the authority even of a chairman ought to be very cautiously exercised with patience you will have the support of every one  when you have drunk a few glasses to play the good fellow and banish modesty if you are unlucky enough to have such a troublesome companion then beware of the cup too much nothing is so ridiculous as a drunken preses  lastly always speak short and skeoch doch na skielcut a tale with a drink      this is the purpose and intent     of gude schir walters testament480  we dined today at mrs dundas of arniston dowager  february 24i carried my own instructions into effect the best i could and if our jests were not good our laugh was abundant i think i will hardly take the chair again when the company is so miscellaneous though they all behaved perfectly well meadowbank taxed me with the novels and to end that farce at once i pleaded guilty so that splore is ended as to the collection it was much cry and little woo as the deil said when he shore the sow only £280 from 300 people but many were to send money tomorrow they did not open books which was impolitic but circulated a box where people might put in what they pleasedand some gave shillings which gives but a poor idea of the company yet there were many respectable people and handsome donations but this fashion of not letting your right hand see what your left hand doeth is no good mode of raising a round sum your pennypig collections dont succeed i got away at ten at night the performers performed very like gentlemen especially will murray they attended as stewards with white rods and never thought of sitting down till after dinner taking care that the company was attended to  february 25very bad report of the speeches in the papers we dined at jeffreys with sydney smithfunny and goodnatured as usual one of his daughters is very pretty indeed both are wellmannered agreeable and sing well the party was pleasant  february 26at home and settled to work but i know not why i was out of spiritsquite laird of humdudgeon and did all i could to shake it off and could not james ballantyne dined with me  february 27humdudgeonish still hang it what fools we are i worked but coldly and ill yet something is done i wonder if other people have these strange alternations of industry and incapacity i am sure i do not indulge myself in fancies but it is accompanied with great drowsinessbile i suppose and terribly jaded spirits i received today dr shortt and major crocket who was orderlyofficer on boney at the time of his death  february 28sir adam breakfasted one of the few old friends left out of the number of my youthful companions in youth we have many companions few friends perhaps in age companionship is ended except rarely and by appointment old men by a kind of instinct seek younger companions who listen to their stories honour their grey hairs while present and mimic and laugh at them when their backs are turned at least that was the way in our day and i warrant our chicks of the present day crow to the same tune of all the friends that i have left i have none who has any decided attachment to literature so either i must talk on that subject to young peoplein other words turn proser or i must turn teatable talker and converse with ladies i

returned the valuable mss lent him by the duke of wellington in nov 1826 see ante p 306 with the following letter  edinburgh 15th february 1827  my dear lord dukethe two manuscripts safely packed leave this by post today as i am informed your graces franks carry any weight    i have been reading with equal instruction and pleasure the memoir on the russian campaign which demonstrates as plainly as possible that the french writers have taken advantage of the snow to cover under it all their generals blunders and impute to it all their losses this i observe is bonapartes general practice and that of his admirers whenever they can charge anything upon the elements or upon accident he and they combine in denying all bravery and all wisdom to their enemies the conduct of kutusow on more than one occasion in the retreat seems to have been singularly cautious or rather timorous for it is impossible to give credit to the immense superiority claimed by ségur beauchamp etc for the french troops over the russians surely they were the same russians who had fought so bravely against superior force and how should the twentieth part of the french army have been able to clear their way without cavalry or artillery in a great measure and it seems natural to suppose that we must impute to tardy and inactive conduct on the part of their general what we cannot account for on the idea of the extremely superior valour or discipline claimed for the french soldiers by their country the snow seems to have become serious on the 6th november when napoleon was within two marches of smolensk which he soon after reached and by that time it appears to me that his army was already mouldered away from 100000 men who left moscow to about 35000 only so that his great loss was incurred before the snow began  i am afraid your grace has done me an unparalleled injury in one respect that the clearness justice and precision of your graces reasoning puts me out of all patience with my own attempts i dare hardly hope in this increase of business for a note or two on waterloo but if your grace had any however hasty which could be copied by a secretary the debt would be never to be forgotten  i am going to mention a circumstance which i do with great apprehension lest i should be thought to intrude upon your graces goodness it respects a youth the son of one of my most intimate friends a gentleman of good family and fortune who is extremely desirous of being admitted a cadet of artillery his father is the best draughtsman in scotland and the lad himself shows a great deal of talent both in science and the ordinary branches of learning i enclose a note of the youths age studies and progress in case your grace might think it possible to place on your list for the engineer service the name of a poor scots hidalgo your grace knows scotland is a breeding not a feeding country and we must send our sons abroad as we send our black cattle to england and as old lady campbell of ardkinglas proposed to dispose of her nine sons we have a strong tendency to put our young folks a to the sword  i have too long detained you my lord duke from the many high occupations which have been redoubled upon your graces head and beg your grace to believe me with an unusually deep sense of respect and obligation my dear lord duke your graces much honoured and grateful humble servant

lawyers long speeches so paid up some of my correspondents which i seldom do upon any other occasion i sometimes let letters lie for days unopened as if that would postpone the necessity of answering them here i am at home and to work we gonot for the first time today for i wrought hard before breakfast so glides away thursday 1st by the by it is the anniversary of bosworth field in former days richard iii was always acted at london on this day now the custom i fancy is disused walpoles historic doubts threw a mist about this reign it is very odd to see how his mind dwells upon it at first as the mere sport of imagination till at length they become such delilahs of his imagination that he deems it far worse than infidelity to doubt his doubts after all the popular tradition is so very strong and pointed concerning the character of richard that it is i think in vain to doubt the general truth of the outline shakespeare we may be sure wrote his drama in the tone that was to suit the popular belief although where that did richard wrong his powerful scene was sure to augment the impression there was an action and a reaction  march 2clerk walked home with me from the court i was scarce able to keep up with him could once have done it well enough funny thing at the theatre among the discourse in high life below stairs481 one of the ladies ladies asks who wrote shakespeare one says ben jonson another finis no said will murray it is sir walter scott he confessed it at a public meeting the other day march 3very severe weather came home covered with snow white as a frostedplumcake by jingo no matter i am not sorry to find i can stand a brush of weather yet i like to see arthurs seat and the stern old castle with their white watchcloaks on but as byron said to moore dn it tom dont be poetical i settled to boney and wrote right long and well  march 4i sat in by the chimneyneuk with no chance of interruption and feagued it away sir adam came and had half an hours chat and laugh my jaws ought to be sore if the unwontedness of the motion could do it but i have little to laugh at but myself and my own bizarreries are more like to make me cry wrought hard thoughtheres sense in that  march 5our young men of first fashion in whom tranquillity is the prime merit a sort of quietism of foppery if one can use the expression have one capital name for a fellow that outrés and outroars the fashion a sort of highbuck as they were called in my days they hold him a vulgarian and call him a tiger mr gibson came in and we talked over my affairs very little to the purpose i doubt dined at home with anne as usual and despatched halfadozen selkirk processes among others one which savours of hamesucken482 i think today i have finished a quarter of vol viii and last shall i be happy when it is doneumph i think not  march 6a long seat at court and an early dinner as we went to the play john kembles brother acted benedick he is a finelooking man and a good actor but not superior he reminds you eternally that he is acting and he had got as the devil directed it hold of my favourite benedick for which he has no power he had not the slightest idea of the part particularly of the manner in which benedick should conduct himself in the quarrelling scene with the prince and claudio in which his character rises almost to the dignity of tragedy the laying aside his light and fantastic humour and showing himself the man of feeling and honour was finely marked of yore by old tom king483 i remember particularly the high strain of grave moral feeling which he threw upon the wordsin a false quarrel there is no true valourwhich spoken as he did checked the very brutal levity of the prince and claudio there were two farces one i wished to see and that being the last was obliged to tarry for it perhaps the headache i contracted made me a severe critic on cramond brig484 a little piece ascribed to lockhart perhaps i am unjust but i cannot think it his485 there are so few good things in it and so much prosing transferred from that mine of marrowless morality called the miller of mansfield486 yet it pleases  march 7we are kept working hard during the expiring days of the session but this being a blank day i wrote hard till dressing time when i went to will clerks to dinner as a bachelor and keeping a small establishment he does not do these things often but they are proportionally pleasant when they come round he had trusted sir adam to bespeak his dinner who did it con amore so we had excellent cheer and the wines were various and capital as i before hinted it is not every day that mnab487 mounts on horseback and so our landlord had a little of that solicitude that the party should go off well which is very flattering to the guests we had a very pleasant evening the chiefcommissioner was there admiral adam jo murray and thomson etc etc sir adam predominating at the head and dancing what he calls his merry andrada in great style in short we really laughed and real laughter is a thing as rare as real tears i must say too there was a hearta kindly feeling prevailed over the party can london give such a dinner it may but i never saw one they are too cold and critical to be so easily pleased in the evening i went with some others to see the exhibition lit up for a promenade where there were all the fashionable folks about town the appearance of the rooms was very gay indeed  march 8it snowed all night which must render the roads impassable and will detain me here till monday hard work at court as hammie is done up with the gout we dine with lord corehousethats not true by the by for i have mistaken the day its tomorrow we dine there wrought but not too hard  march 9an idle morning dalgleish being set to pack my books wrote notes upon a mr kinlochs collection of scottish ballads488 which i communicated to the young author in the court this present morning we were detained till halfpast three oclock so when i came home i was fatigued and slept i walk slow heavily and with pain but perhaps the good weather may banish the fiend of the joints at any rate impatience will do nae good at a man letter from charles for £50 silver and gold have i none but that which i have i will give unto him we dined at the cranstounsi beg his pardon lord corehouse ferguson thomson will clerk etc were there also the smiths and john murray so we had a pleasant evening  march 10the business at the court was not so heavy as i have seen it the last day of the session yet sharp enough about three oclock i got to a meeting of the bannatyne club i hope this institution will be really useful and creditable thomson is superintending a capital edition of sir james melvilles memoirs489 it is brave to see how he wags his scots tongue and what a difference there is in the force and firmness of the language compared to the mincing english edition in which he has hitherto been alone known nothing today but correcting proofs anne went to the play i remained at home  march 11all my books packed this morning and this and tomorrow will be blank days or nearly such but i am far ahead of the printer who is not done with vol vii while i am deep in volume viii i hate packing but my servants never pack books quite to please me james ballantyne dined with us he kept up my heart about bonaparte which sometimes flags and he is such a grumbler that i think i may trust him when he is favourable there must be sad inaccuracies some which might certainly have been prevented by care but as the lazaroni used to say did you but know how lazy i am  abbotsford march 12away we set and came safely to abbotsford amid all the dulness of a great thaw which has set the rivers astreaming in full tide the wind is wintry but for my part      i like this rocking of the battlements490  i was received by old tom and the dogs with the unsophisticated feelings of goodwill i have been trying to read a new novel which i have heard praised it is called almacks and the author has so well succeeded in describing the cold selfish fopperies of the time that the copy is almost as dull as the original i think i will take up my bundle of sheriffcourt processes instead of almacks as the more entertaining avocation of the two  march 13before breakfast prepared and forwarded the processes to selkirk as i had the loan of £250 at march from cadell i am now verging on to the £500 which he promised to allow me in advance on second series canongate chronicles i do not like this but unless i review or write to some other purpose what else can i do my own expenses are as limited as possible but my house expenses are considerable and every now and then starts up something of old scores which i cannot turn over to mr gibson and his cotrustees welltime and the hourmoney is the smallest consideration  had a pleasant walk to the thicket though my ideas were ollapodridaish curiously checkered between pleasure and melancholy i have cause enough for both humours god knows i expect this will not be a day of work but of idleness for my books are not come would to god i could make it light thoughtless idleness such as i used to have when the silly smart fancies ran in my brain like the bubbles in a glass of champagneas brilliant to my thinking as intoxicating as evanescent but the wine is somewhat on the lees perhaps it was but indifferent cider after all yet i am happy in this place where everything looks friendly from old tom to young nym491 after all he has little to complain of who has left so many things that like him  march 14all yesterday spent in putting to rights books and so forth not a word written except interlocutors but this wont do i have tow on the rock and it must be spun off let us see our present undertakings 1 napoleon 2 review home cranbourne chase492 and the mysteries 3 something for that poor faineant gillies 4 essay on ballad and song 5 something on the modern state of france these two last for the prose works but they may      do a little more     and produce a little ore  come we must up and be doing there is a rare scud without which says go spin you jade go spin i loitered on and might have answered      my spinningwheel is auld and stiff  smoked a brace of cigars after dinner as a sedative this is the first time i have smoked these two months i was afraid the custom would master me went to work in the afternoon and reviewed for lockhart mackenzies edition of homes works493 proceeded as far as the eighth page  march 15kept still at the review till two oclock not that there is any hurry but because i should lose my ideas which are not worth preserving went on therefore i drove over to huntly burn with anne then walked through the plantations with toms help to pull me through the snowwreaths returned in a glow of heat and spirits corrected proofsheets in the evening  march 16      a trifling day we have had here     begun with trifle and ended  but i hope no otherwise so ended than to meet the rubrick of the ballad for it is but three oclock in the morning i was lhomme qui chercheeverything fell asidethe very pens absconded and crept in among a pack of letters and trumpery where i had the devils work finding them thus the time before breakfast was idled or rather fidgeted away afterwards it was rather worse i had settled to finish the review when behold as i am apt to do at a set task i jibbd and my thoughts would rather have gone with waterloo so i dawdled as the women say with both now writing a page or two of the review now reading a few pages of the battle of waterloo by captain pringle a manuscript which is excellentlywritten494 well i will find the advantage of it by and by so now i will try to finish this accursed review for there is nothing to prevent me save the untractable character that hates to work on compulsion whether of individuals or circumstances  march 17i wrought away at the review and nearly finished it was interrupted however by a note from ballantyne demanding copy which brought me back from home and mackenzie to boney i had my walk as usual and worked nevertheless very fairly corrected proofs  march 18took up boney again i am now at writing as i used to be at riding slow heavy and awkward at mounting but when i did get fixed in my saddle could screed away with any one i have got six pages ready for my learned theban495 tomorrow morning william laidlaw and his brother george dined with me but i wrote in the evening all the same  march 19set about my labours but enter captain john ferguson from the spanish main where he has been for three years the honest tar sat about two hours and i was heartily glad to see him again i had a general sketch of his adventures which we will hear more in detail when we can meet at kailtime notwithstanding this interruption i have pushed far into the seventh page well done for one day twenty days should finish me at this rate and i read hard too but allowance must be made for interruptions  march 20today worked till twelve oclock then went with anne on a visit of condolence to mrs pringle of yair and her family mr pringle was the friend both of my father and grandfather the acquaintance of our families is at least a century old  march 21wrote till twelve then out upon the heights though the day was stormy and faced the gale bravely tom purdie was not with me he would have obliged me to keep the sheltered ground but i dont know      even in our ashes live our wonted fires  there is a touch of the old spirit in me yet that bids me brave the tempestthe spirit that in spite of manifold infirmities made me a roaring boy in my youth a desperate climber a bold rider a deep drinker and a stout player at singlestick of all which valuable qualities there are now but slender remains i worked hard when i came in and finished five pages  march 22yesterday i wrote to james ballantyne acquiescing in his urgent request to extend the two last volumes to about 600 each i believe it will be no more than necessary after all but makes one feel like a dog in a wheel always moving and never advancing  march 23when i was a child and indeed for some years after my amusement was in supposing to myself a set of persons engaged in various scenes which contrasted them with each other and i remember to this day the accuracy of my childish imagination this might be the effect of a natural turn to fictitious narrative or it might be the cause of it or there might be an action and reaction or it does not signify a pins head how it is but with a flash of this remaining spirit i imagine my mother duty to be a sort of old taskmistress like the hag of the merchant abudah in the tales of the geniinot a hag though by any means on the contrary my old woman wears a rich oldfashioned gown of black silk with ruffles of triple blondelace and a coif as rich as that of pearling jean496 a figure and countenance something like lady dss twenty years ago a clear blue eye capable of great severity of expression and conforming in that with a wrinkled brow of which the ordinary expression is a serious approach to a frowna cautionary and nervous shake of the head in her withered hand an ebony staff with a crutch heada tompion gold watch which annoys all who know her by striking the quarters as regularly as if one wished to hear them occasionally she has a small scourge of nettles which i feel her lay across my fingers at this moment and so tace is latin for a candle497 i have 150 pages to write yet  march 24does duty not wear a pair of round oldfashioned silver buckles buckles she has but they are square ones all belonging to duty is rectangular thus can we poor children of imagination play with the ideas we create like children with soapbubbles pity that we pay for it at other times by starting at our shadows      man but a rush against othellos breast  the hard work still proceeds varied only by a short walk  march 25hard work still but went to huntly burn on foot and returned in the carriage walked well and stoutlygod be praisedand prepared a whole bundle of proofs and copy for the blucher to morrow that damned work will certainly end some time or other as it drips and dribbles out on the paper i think of the old drunken presbyterian under the spout  march 26despatched packets colonel and captain ferguson arrived to breakfast i had previously determined to give myself a day to write letters and as i expect john thomson to dinner this day will do as well as another i cannot keep up with the world without shying a letter now and then it is true the greatest happiness i could think of would be to be rid of the world entirely excepting my own family i have little pleasure in the world less business in it and am heartily careless about all its concerns mr thomson came accordinglynot john thomson of duddingston whom the letter led me to expect but john anstruther thomson of charlton fifeshire the soninlaw of lord chcommissioner  march 27wrote two leaves this morning and gave the day after breakfast to my visitor who is a country gentleman of the best description knows the world having been a good deal attached both to the turf and the field is extremely goodhumoured and a good deal of a local antiquary i showed him the plantations going first round the terrace then to the lake then came down by the rhymers glen and took carriage at huntly burn almost the grand tour only we did not walk from huntly burn the fergusons dined with us  march 28mr thomson left us about twelve for minto parting a pleased guest i hope from a pleased landlord when i see a gemman as is a gemman as the blackguards say why i know how to be civil after he left i set doggedly to work with bonaparte who had fallen a little into arrear i can clear the ground better now by mashing up my old work in the edinburgh register with my new matter a species of colcannen where cold potatoes are mixed with hot cabbage after all i think ballantyne is right and that i have some talents for historywriting after all that same history in the register reads prettily enough coragio cry claymore i finished five pages but with additions from register they will run to more than double i hope like puff in the critic be luxuriant498  here is snow back again a nasty comfortless stormy sort of a day and i will work it off at boney what shall i do when bonaparte is done he engrosses me morning noon and night never mind komt zeit komt rath as the german says i did not work longer than twelve however but went out in as rough weather as i have seen and stood out several snow blasts  march 29 30      he walkd and wrought poor soul what then     why then he walkd and wrought again  march 31day varied by dining with mr scrope where we found mr williams and mr simson499 both excellent artists we had not too much of the palette but made a very agreeable day out i contrived to mislay the

through the courtyard owing to this i had some of my flutterings my trembling exies as the old people called the ague wrote a great many lettersbut no copy  april 13i have sometimes wondered with what regularitythat is for a shrew of my impatient temperi have been able to keep this journal the use of the first person being of course the very essence of a diary i conceive it is chiefly vanity the dear pleasure of writing about the best of good fellows myself which gives me perseverance to continue this idle task this morning i wrote till breakfast then went out and marked trees to be cut for paling and am just returnedand what does any one care ay but gad i care myself though we had at dinner today mr and mrs cranstoun burnss maria of ballochmyle502 mr bainbridge and daughters and colonel russell  april 14went to selkirk to try a fellow for an assault on dr clarksonfined him seven guineas which with his necessary expenses will amount to ten guineas it is rather too little but as his income does not amount to £30 a year it will pinch him severely enough and is better than sending him to an illkept jail where he would be idle and drunk from morning to night i had a dreadful headache while sitting in the courtrheumatism in perfection it did not last after i got warm by the fireside  april 15delightful soft morning with mild rain walked out and got wet as a sovereign cure for the rheumatism was quite well though and scribbled away  april 16a day of work and exercise in the evening a letter from lockhart with the wonderful news that the ministry has broken up and apparently for no cause that any one can explain the old grudge i suppose betwixt peel and canning which has gone on augmenting like a crack in the side of a house which enlarges from day to day till down goes the whole mr canning has declared himself fully satisfied with jl and sent barrow to tell him so his suspicions were indeed most erroneous but they were repelled with no little spirit both by l and myself and canning has not been like another great man i know to whom i showed demonstrably that he had suspected an individual unjustly it may be so he said but his mode of defending himself was offensive503  april 17went to dinner today to mr bainbridges gattonside house and had fireworks in the evening made by captain burchard a goodhumoured kind of will wimble504 one nice little boy announced to us everything that was going to be done with the importance of a prologue some of the country folks assembled and our party was enlivened by the squeaks of the wenches and the longprotracted eh ehs by which a teviotdale tup testifies his wonder  april 18i felt the impatience of news so much that i walked up to mr laidlaw surely for no other purpose than to talk politics this interrupted boney a little after i returned about twelve or one behold tom tack he comes from buenos ayres with a parcel of little curiosities he had picked up for me as tom tack spins a tough yarn i lost the morning almost entirelywhat with one thing what with tother as my friend the laird of raeburn says nor have i much to say for the evening only i smoked a cigar more than usual to get the box ended and give up the custom for a little  april 19another letter from lockhart505 i am sorry when i think of the goodly fellowship of vessels which are now scattered on the ocean there is the duke of wellington the lord chancellor lord melville mr peel and i wot not who besides all turned out of office or resigned i wonder what they can do in the house of lords when all the great tories are on the wrong side of the house canning seems quite serious in his views of helping lockhart i hope it will come to something  april 20a surly sort of day i walked for two hours however and then returned chiefly to nap egad i believe it has an end at last this blasted work i have the fellow at plymouth or near about it well i declare i thought the end of these beastly big eight volumes was like the end of the world which is always talked of and never comes  april 21here is a vile daydownright rain which disconcerts an inroad of bairns from gattonside and of course annihilates a part of the stock of human happiness but what says the proverb of your true rainy day      tis good for book tis good for work     for cup and can or knife and fork  april 22wrote till twelve oclock then sallied forth and walked to huntly burn with tom and so look you sir i drove home in the carriage wrought in the afternoon and tried to read de vere a sensible but heavy book written by an able handbut a great bore for all that506 wrote in the evening  april 23snowy morning white as my shirt the little bainbridges came over invited to see the armoury etc which i stood showman to it is odd how much less cubbish the english boys are than the scotch wellmannered and sensible are the southern boys i suppose the sun brings them forward here comes six oclock at night and it is snowing as if it had not snowed these forty years before well ill work away a couple of chaptersthree at most will finish napoleon  april 24still deep snowa foot thick in the courtyard i dare say severe welcome to the poor lambs now coming into the world but what signifies whether they die just now or a little while after to be united with salad at luncheontime it signifies a good deal too there is a period though a short one when they dance among the gowans and seem happy as for your aged sheep or wether the sooner they pass to the norman side of the vocabulary the better they are like some old dowager ladies and gentlemen of my acquaintanceno one cares about them till they come to be cut up and then we see how the tallow lies on the kidneys and the chine  april 25snow yet and it prevents my walking and i grow bilious i wrote hard though i have now got boney peggd up in the knotty entrails of saint helena and may make a short pause  so i finished the review of john homes works which after all are poorer than i thought them good blank verse and stately sentiment but something lukewarmish excepting douglas which is certainly a masterpiece even that does not stand the closet its merits are for the stage but it is certainly one of the best acting plays going perhaps a play to act well should not be too poetical  there is a talk in london of bringing in the marquis of lansdowne then lauderdale will perhaps come in here it is certain the old tory party is down the wind not from political opinions but from personal aversion to canning perhaps his satirical temper has partly occasioned this but i rather consider emulation as the source of it the head and front of the offending croker no longer rhymes to joker he has made a good coup it is said by securing lord hertford for the new administration dw calls him their viper after all i cannot sympathise with that delicacy which throws up office because the most eloquent man in england and certainly the only man who can manage the house of commons is named minister507  april 26the snow still profusely distributed and the surface as our hair used to be in youth after we had played at some active game half black half white all in large patches i finished the criticism on home adding a string of jacobite anecdotes like that which boys put to a kites tail sent off the packet to lockhart at the same time sent croker a volume of french tracts containing la portefeuille de bonaparte which he wished to see received a great cargo of papers from bernadotte some curious and would have been inestimable two months back but now my siege is almost made still my feelings for poor count itterburg508 the lineal and legitimate make me averse to have much to do with this child of the revolution  april 27this hand of mine gets to be like a kittens scratch and will require much deciphering or what may be as well for the writer cannot be deciphered at all i am sure i cannot read it myself weather better which is well as i shall get a walk i have been a little nervous having been confined to the house for three days well i may be disabled from duty but my tamed spirits and sense of dejection have quelled all that freakishness of humour which made me a voluntary idler i present myself to the morning task as the hackhorse patiently trudges to the pole of his chaise and backs however reluctantly to have the traces fixed such are the uses of adversity  april 28wrought at continuing the works with some criticism on defoe509 i have great aversion i cannot tell why to stuffing the border antiquities into what they call the prose works  there is no encouragement to be sure for doing better for nobody seems to care i cannot get an answer from j ballantyne whether he thinks the review on the highlands would be a better substitution  april 29colonel and captain ferguson dined here with mr laidlaw i wrote all the morning then cut some wood i think the weather gets too warm for hard work with the axe or i get too stiff and easily tired  april 30went to jedburgh to circuit where found my old friend and schoolfellow d monypenny510 nothing today but a pack of riffraff cases of petty larceny and trash

r plumer wardsee july 4  507 a fuller statement of scotts views at this crisis will be found in his letters to lockhart and morritt in life vol ix april may and june 1827  508 count itterburg then in his 20th year was the name under which gustavus the excrown prince of sweden visited scotland in 1819 it was his intention to study at the university of edinburgh during the winter session but his real name becoming known this was rendered impracticable by the curiosity and attention of the public he devoted himself mainly to the study of military matters and outdoor exercises roughing it in all sorts of weather sometimesto his mentor baron poliers uneasinesssetting out on dark and stormy nights and making his way across country from point to point this selfimposed training was no doubt with the secret hope that he might some day be called upon by the swedes to oust bernadotte and mount the throne of the great gustavus mr skene saw a good deal of him and gives many interesting details of his life in edinburgh such as the following account of a meeting at his own house he was interested with a set of portraits of the two last generations of the royal family of scotland which hung in my diningroom and which had been presented to my grandfather by prince charles edward in consideration of the sacrifices he had made for the princes service during the unfortunate enterprise of the year 1745 having raised and commanded one of the battalions of lord lewis gordons brigade the portrait of prince charles edward taken about the same age as comte itterburg and no doubt also the marked analogy existing in the circumstances to which they had been each reduced seemed much to engage his notice and when the ladies had retired he begged me to give him some account of the rebellion and of the various endeavours of the stewarts to regain the scottish crown the subject was rather a comprehensive one but having done my best to put him in possession of the leading features it seemed to have taken very strong hold of his mind as he frequently at our subsequent meetings reverted to the subject upon another occasion by degrees the topic of conversation slipped into its wonted channelthe rebellion of 1745 its final disaster and the singular escape of the prince from the pursuit of his enemies the comte inquired what effect the failure of the enterprise had produced upon the princes character with whose gallant bearing and enthusiasm in the conduct of his desperate enterprise he evinced the strongest interest and sympathy i stated briefly the mortifying disappointments to which charles edward was exposed in france the hopelessness of his cause and the indifference generally shown to him by the continental courts which so much preyed on his mind as finally to stifle every spark of his former character so that he gave himself up to a listless indifference which terminated in his becoming a sot during the latter years of his life on turning round to the prince who had been listening to these details i perceived the big drops chasing each other down his cheeks and therefore changed the subject and he never again recurred to itreminiscences  count itterburg or prince gustavus vasa to give him the title of an old family dignity which he assumed in 1829 entered the austrian army in which he attained the rank of lieutenant fieldmarshal his services it is needless to say were never required by the swedes though he never relinquished his pretensions and claimed the throne at his fathers death in 1837 he died at pillnitz on the 4th august 1877 leaving one daughter the present queen of saxony  notices of his visits to 39 castle street and abbotsford are given in the 6th vol of life  509 this refers to the miscellaneous prose works forming 24 vols the publication of which did not commence until may 1834 although as is shown by the journal the author was busy in its preparation the criticism on defoe will be found in the fourth volume pp 247296 forming a supplement to john ballantynes biographical notice of defoe in the same volume the essay on border antiquities appeared notwithstanding scotts misgivings in the seventh volume  510 lord pitmillysee ante p 125     may   may 1brought andrew shortreed to copy some things i want maxpopple came with us as far as lessudden and we stopped and made a pilgrimage to fair maiden lilliards stone which has been restored lately to the credit of mr walker of muirhouselaw511 set my young clerk to work when we came home and did some laborious business a letter from sir thomas lawrence informed me i am chosen professor of antiquities to the royal academya beautiful professor to be sure  may 2did nothing but proofs this morning at ten went to selkirk to arrange about the new measures which like all new things will throw us into confusion for a little at least the weather was so exquisitely good that i walked after tea to halfpast eight and enjoyed a sort of halflazy halfsulky humourlike calibans theres wood enough within512 well i may be the bear but i must mount the ragged staff all the same i set my myself to labour for rpg513 the germanic horrors are my theme and i think something may be yet made of them  may 3an early visit from mr thomas stewart nephew of duchess of wellington with a letter from his aunt he seems a wellbehaved and pleasant young man i walked him through the glen colonel ferguson came to help us out at dinner and then we had our wine and wassail  may 4corrected proofs in the morning mr stewart still here which prevented work however i am far beforehand with everything we walked a good deal asked mr alexander pringle whytbank to dinner this is rather losing time though  may 5worked away upon those wild affairs of hoffmann for gillies i think i have forgot my german very much and then the stream of criticism does not come freely at all i cannot tell why i gave it up in despair at halfpast one and walked out  had a letter from rpg he seems in spirits about his work i wish it may answer under good encouragement it certainly might but  maxpopple came to dinner and mr laidlaw after dinner so that broke up a day which i can ill spare mr stewart left us this day  may 6wrought again at hoffmannunfructuously i fearunwillingly i am certain but how else can i do a little good in my generation i will try a walk i would fain catch myself in goodhumour with my task but that will not be easy  may 7finished hoffmann talis qualis i dont like it but then i have been often displeased with things that have proved successful our own labours become disgusting in our eyes from the ideas having been turned over and over in our own minds to others to whom they are presented for the first time they have a show of novelty god grant it may prove so i would help the poor fellow if i could for i am poor myself  may 8corrected hoffmann with a view to send him off which however i could not accomplish i finished a criticism on defoes writings514 his great forte is his power of vraisemblance this i have instanced in the story of mrs veals ghost ettrick shepherd arrived  may 9this day we went to dinner at mr scropes at the pavilion where were the haigs of bemerside isaac haig mr and mrs bainbridge etc warm dispute whether par are or are not salmon trout fleas are not lobsters dn their souls  mr scrope has made a painting of tivoli which when mellowed a little by time will be a fine one letters from lockhart with news concerning the beautiful mess they are making in london henry scott will be threatened in roxburghshire this would be bad policy as it would drive the young duke to take up his ground which unless pressed he may be in no hurry to do personally i do not like to be driven to a point as i think canning may do much for the country provided he does not stand committed to his new whig counsellors but if the push does come i will not quit my old friendsthat i am freely resolved and dissolutely as slender says515  may 10we went to breakfast at huntly burn and i wandered all the morning in the woods to avoid an english party who came to see the house when i came home i found my cousin col russell and his sister so i had no work today but my labour at proofs in the morning today i dismiss my aidedecamp shortreeda fine lad the boar of the forest left us after breakfast had a present of a medal forming one of a series from chantreys busts but this is not for nothing the donor wants a motto for the reverse of the kings medal i am a bad hand to apply to  may 11hogg called this morning to converse about trying to get him on the pecuniary list of the royal literary society certainly he deserves it if genius and necessity could do so but i do not belong to the society nor do i propose to enter it as a coadjutor i dont like your royal academies of this kind they almost always fall into jobs and the members are seldom those who do credit to the literature of a country it affected too to comprehend those men of letters who are specially attached to the crown and though i love and honour my king as much as any of them can yet i hold it best in this free country to preserve the exterior of independence that my loyalty may be the more impressive and tell more effectually yet i wish sincerely to help poor hogg and have written to lockhart about it it may be my own desolate feelingsit may be the apprehension of evil from this political hocuspocus but i have seldom felt more moody and uncomfortable than while writing these lines i have walked too but without effect w laidlaw whose very ingenious mind is delighted with all novelties talked nonsense about the new government in which men are to resign principle i fear on both sides  may 12wrote lockhart on what i think the upright and honest principle and am resolved to vex myself no more about it walked with my cousin colonel russell for three hours in the woods and enjoyed the sublime and delectable pleasure of being welland listened to on the subject of my favourite themes of laying out ground and plantation russel seems quite to follow such an excellent authority and my spirits mounted while i found i was haranguing to a willing and patient pupil to be sure ashestiel planting the high knolls and drawing woodland through the pasture could be made one of the most beautiful forest things in the world i have often dreamed of putting it in high order and judging from what i have been able to do here i think i should have succeeded at any rate my blue devils are flown at the sense of retaining some sort of consequence lord what fools we are  may 13a most idle and dissipated day i did not rise till halfpast eight oclock col and capt ferguson came to breakfast i walked halfway home with them then turned back and spent the day which was delightful wandering from place to place in the woods sometimes reading the new and interesting volumes of cyril thornton516 sometimes chewing the cud of sweet and bitter fancy which strangely alternated in my mind idly stirred by the succession of a thousand vague thoughts and fears the gay thoughts strangely mingled with those of dismal melancholy tears which seemed ready to flow unbidden smiles which approached to those of insanity all that wild variety of mood which solitude engenders i scribbled some verses or rather composed them in my memory the contrast at leaving abbotsford to former departures is of an agitating and violent description assorting papers and so forth i never could help admiring the concatenation between ahitophels setting his house in order and hanging himself the one seems to me to follow the other as a matter of course i dont mind the trouble though my head swims with it i do not mind meeting accounts which unpaid remind you of your distress or paid serve to show you you have been throwing away money you would be glad to have back again i do not mind the strange contradictory mode of papers hiding themselves that you wish to see and others thrusting themselves into your hand to confuse and bewilder you there is a clergymans letter about the scottish pronunciation to which i had written an answer some weeks since the person is an ass by the by but i had laid aside my answer being unable to find the letter which bore his address and in the course of this day both his letter with the address and my answer which wanted the address fell into my hands halfadozen times but separately always this was the positive malice of some hobgoblin and i submit to it as such but what frightens and disgusts me is those fearful letters from those who have been long dead to those who linger on their wayfare through this valley of tears these fine lines of spencer came into my head      when midnight oer the pathless skies517  ay and can i forget the authorthe frightful moral of his own vision what is this world a dream within a dreamas we grow older each step is an awakening the youth awakes as he thinks from childhoodthe fullgrown man despises the pursuits of youth as visionarythe old man looks on manhood as a feverish dream the grave the last sleepno it is the last and final awakening  may 14to town per blucher coach well stowed and crushed but saved cash coming off for less than £2 posting costs nearly five and you dont get on so fast by onethird arrived in my old lodgings here with a stouter heart than i expected dined with mr and mrs skene and met lord medwyn and lady  may 15parliament house a queer sight looked as if people were singing to each other the noble song of the skys fallingchickie diddle thinks i to myself ill keep a calm sough      betwixt both sides i unconcerned stand by     hurt can i laugh and honest need i cry  i wish the old government had kept together but their personal dislike to canning seems to have rendered that impossible  i dined at a great dinner given by sir george clerk to his electors the freeholders of midlothian a great attendance of whig and tory huzzaing each others toasts if is a good peacemaker but quarterday is a better i have a guess the best gamecocks would call a truce if a handful or two of oats were scattered among them

who had taken him into his own family at calcutta and now he is drowned in a foolish bathing party  may 18heard from abbotsford all well wrought today but awkwardly tom campbell called warm from his glasgow rectorship he is looking very well he seemed surprised that i did not know anything about the contentions of tories whigs and radicals in the great commercial city i have other eggs on the spit he stayed but a few minutes518  may 19went out today to sir john dalrymples519 at oxenford a pretty place the lady a daughter of lord duncan will clerk and robert graeme went with me a good dinner and pleasant enough party but ten miles going and ten miles coming make twenty and that is something of a journey got a headache too by jolting about after dinner  may 20wrote a good deal at appendix to bonaparte or perhaps i should say tried to write got myself into a fever when i had finished four pages and went out at eight oclock at night to cool myself if possible walked with difficulty as far as skenes520 and there sat and got out of my fidgety feeling learned that the princes street people intend to present me with the key of their gardens which will be a great treat as i am too tenderhoofed for the stones we must now get to work in earnest  may 21accordingly this day i wrought tightly and though not in my very best mood i got on in a very businesslike manner was at the gas council where i found things getting poorly on the treasury have remitted us to the exchequer the committee want me to make private interest with the lc baron that i wont do but i will state their cause publicly any way they like  may 22at courthome by two walking through the princes street gardens for the first time called on mrs jobson worked two hours must dress to dine at mr john borthwicks with the young folk now mr and mrs dempster521 kindly and affectionately received by my good young friends who seem to have succeeded to their parents regard for me  may 23got some books etc which i wanted to make up the saint helena affair set about making up the appendix but found i had mislaid a number of the said postliminary affair had hoggs nephew here as a transcriber a modest and wellbehaved young manclever too i think522 being teind wednesday i was not obliged to go to the court and am now bang up and shall soon finish mr nappy and how then ay marry sir thats the question      lord what will all the people say     mr mayor mr mayor  the fires i the lowest hell fold in the people523 as coriolanus says i live not in their report i hope  may 24mr gibson paid me £70 more of my london journey a good thought came into my head to write stories for little johnnie lockhart from the history of scotland like those taken from the history of england i will not write mine quite so simply as croker has done i am persuaded both children and the lower class of readers hate books which are written down to their capacity and love those that are more composed for their elders and betters i will make if possible a book that a child will understand yet a man will feel some temptation to peruse should he chance to take it up it will require however a simplicity of style not quite my own the grand and interesting consists in ideas not in words a clever thing of this kind will have a run      little to say     but wrought away     and went out to dine with the skenes today  rather too many dinner engagements on my list must be hardhearted i cannot say i like my solitary days the worst by any means i dine when i like on soup or broth and drink a glass of porter or gingerbeer a single tumbler of whisky and water concludes the debauch this agrees with me charmingly at ten oclock bread and cheese a single draught of small beer porter or gingerbeer and to bed  may 26i went the same dull and weary round out to the parliament house which bothers ones brains for the day nevertheless i get on pages vanish from under my hand and find their way to j ballantyne who is grinding away with his presses i think i may say now i begin to get rid of the dust raised about me by so many puzzling little facts that it is plain sailing to the end  dined at skenes with george forbes and lady but that was yesterday  may 27i got ducked in coming home from the court naboclishi thank thee pat for teaching me the word made a hard day of it scarce stirred from one room to another but at bedtime finished a handsome handful of copy i have quoted gourgauds evidence i suppose he will be in a rare passion and may be addicted to vengeance like a longmoustached son of a french bitch as he is naboclish again for that      frenchman devil or don      damn him let him come on        he shant scare a son of the island524  may 28another day of uninterrupted study two such would finish the work with a murrain i have several engagements next week i wonder how i was such a fool as to take them i think i shall be done however before saturday what shall i have to think of when i lie down at night and awake in the morning what will be my plague and my pastime my curse and my blessing as ideas come and the pulse rises or as they flag and something like a snow haze covers my whole imagination i have my highland talesand thennever mind sufficient for the day is the evil thereof  may 29detained at the house till near three made a call on mrs jobson and others also went down to the printingoffice i hope james ballantyne will do well i think and believe he will wrought in the evening  may 30having but a trifle on the roll today i set hard to work and brought myself in for a holiday or rather played truant at two oclock went to a mr mackenzie in my old house at castle street to have some touches given to walkers print525 afterwards having young hogg with me as an amanuensis i took to the oar till near ten oclock526  may 31being a court day i was engaged very late then i called at the printinghouse but got no exact calculation how we come on met mr cadell who bids as the authors copy money 1s profit on each book of hugh littlejohn i thought this too little my general calculation is on such profits that supposing the book to sell to the public for 7s 6d the price ought to go in three sharesone to the trade one to the expense of print and paper and one to the author and publisher between them which of course would be 1s 3d not 1s to the author but in stating this rule i omitted to observe that books for young persons are half bound before they go out into the trade this comes to about 9d for two volumes the allowance to the trade is also heavy so that 1s a book is very well on great numbers there may besides be a third volume  dined at james ballantynes and heard his brother sandy sing and play on the violin beautifully as usual james himself sang the reel of tullochgorum with hearty cheer and uplifted voice when i came home i learned that we had beat the coal gas company which is a sort of triumph  footnotes  511 the rude inscription on

in the morning till the same hour in the evening with the exception of the intervals allowed for breakfast and lunch which were served in the room to save time he noted a striking peculiarity in

with mrs dundas arniston and other friends worked a little not much  june 2do do dined at baron humes these dinners are cruelly in the way but que fautil faire the business of the court must be done and it is impossible absolutely to break off all habits of visiting besides the correcting of proofsheets in itself is now become burdensome three or four a day is hard work  june 3wrought hard i think i have but a trifle more to do but new things cast up we get beyond the life however for i have killed him today the newspapers are very saucy the sun says i have got £4000 for suffering a frenchman to look over my manuscript here is a proper fellow for you i wonder what he thinks frenchmen are made ofwalking moneybags doubtless now as sir fretful plagiary527 says another man would be mad at this but i care not one brass farthing  june 4the birthday of our good old king it was wrong not to keep up the thing as it was of yore with dinners and claret and squibs and crackers and saturnalia the thoughts of the subjects require sometimes to be turned to the sovereign were it but only that they may remember there is such a person  the bannatyne edition of melvilles memoirs is out and beats all print gad it is a fine institution that a rare one by jove beats the roxburghe wrought very bobbishly today but went off at dinnertime to thomas thomson where we had good cheer and good fun by the way we have lost our coal gas bill sorry for it but i cant cry  june 5proofs parliament house till two commenced the character of bonaparte tomorrow being a teindday i will hope to get it finished meantime i go out tonight to see frankenstein at the theatre  june 6frankenstein is entertaining for onceconsiderable art in the man that plays the monster to whom he gave great effect cooper is his name played excellently in the farce too as a sailora more natural one i think than my old friend jack bannister though he has not quite jacks richness of humour i had seven proofsheets to correct this morning by goles so i did not get to composition till nine work on with little interruption save that mr verplanck an american breakfasted with us until seven and then walked for fear of the black dog or devil that worries me when i work too hard  june 7this morning finished boney and now as dame fortune says in quevedos visions go wheel and the devil drive thee528 it was high time i brought up some reinforcements for my pound was come to halfcrowns and i had nothing to keep house when the lockharts come credit enough to be sure but i have been taught by experience to make short reckonings some great authors now will think it a degradation to write a childs book i cannot say i feel it such it is to be inscribed to my grandson and i will write it not only without a sense of its being infra dig but with a grandfathers pleasure  i arranged with mr cadell for the property of tales of a grandfather 10000 copies for £787 10s  june 8a mr maywood much protected by poor alister dhu brought me a letter from the late colonel huxley his connection and approach to me is through the grave but i will not be the less disposed to assist him if an opportunity offers i made a long round today going to david laings about forwarding the books of the bannatyne club to sir george rose and duke of buckingham then i came round by the printingoffice where the presses are groaning upon napoleon and so home through the gardens i have done little today save writing a letter or two for i was fatigued and sleepy when i got home and nodded i think over sir james melvilles memoirs i will do something though when i have dined by the way i corrected the proofs for gillies they read better than i looked for  june 9corrected proofs in the morning when i came home from court i found that john lockhart and sophia were arrived by the steamboat at portobello where they have a small lodging i went down with a bottle of champagne and a flask of maraschino and made buirdly cheer with them for the rest of the day had the great pleasure to find them all in high health poor johnny is decidedly improved in his general health and the injury on the spine is got no worse walter is a very fine child  june 10rose with the odd consciousness of being free of my daily task i have heard that the fishwomen go to church of a sunday with their creels new washed and a few stones in them for ballast just because they cannot walk steadily without their usual load i feel somewhat like this and rather inclined to pick up some light task than to be altogether idle i have my proofsheets to be sure but what are these to a whole day fortunately my thoughts are agreeable cash difficulties etc all provided for as far as i can see so that we go on hooly and fairly betwixt and august 1st i should receive £750 and i cannot think i have more than the half of it to pay away cash to be sure seems to burn in my pocket he wasna gien to great misguiding but coin his pouches wouldna bide in529 by goles this shall be corrected though lockhart gives a sad account of gilliess imprudences lockhart dined with us day idle  june 11the attendance on the committee and afterwards the general meeting of the oil gas company took up my morning and the rest dribbled away in correcting proofs and trifling reading among the rest an odd volume of vivian grey530 clever but not so much so as to make me in this sultry weather go upstairs to the drawingroom to seek the other volumes ah villain but you smoked when you readwell madam perhaps i think the better of the book for that reason made a blunderwent to ravelston on the wrong day this annes fault but i did not reproach her knowing it might as well have been my own  june 12at court a long hearing got home only about three corrected proofs etc dined with baron clerk and met several old friends will clerk in particular  june 13another long seat at court almost overcome by the heat in walking home and rendered useless for the day let me be thankful however my lameness is much better and the nerves of my unfortunate ankle are so much strengthened that i walk with comparatively little pain dined at john swintons a large party these festive occasions consume much valuable time besides trying the stomach a little by late hours and some wine shed though thats not much  june 14anne and sophia dined could not stay at home with them alone we had the skenes and allan and amused ourselves till ten oclock  june 15this being the day long since appointed for our cruise to fife thomas thomson sir a ferguson will clerk and i set off with miss adam and made our journey successfully to charlton where met lord chiefbaron and lord chiefcommissioner all in the humour to be happy though time is telling with us all our goodnatured host mr a thomson his wife and his goodlooking daughters received us most kindly and the conversation took its old roll in spite of woes and infirmities charlton is a good house in the midst of highlycultivated land and immediately surrounded with gardens and parterres together with plantations partly in the old partly in the new taste i like it very much though as a residence it is perhaps a little too much finished not even a bit of bog to amuse one as mr elphinstone said  june 16this day we went off in a body to st andrews which thomas thomson had never seen on the road beyond charlton saw a small cottage said to have been the heritable appanage of a family called the keays  he had a right to feed his horse for a certain time on the adjoining pasture this functionary was sent to falkland with the fish for the royal table the ruins at st andrews have been lately cleared out they had been chiefly magnificent from their sizenot their extent of ornament i did not go up to st rules tower as on former occasions this is a falling off for when before did i remain sitting below when there was a steeple to be ascended but the rheumatism has begun to change that vein for some time past though i think this is the first decided sign of acquiescence in my lot i sat down on a gravestone and recollected the first visit i made to st andrews now thirtyfour years ago what changes in my feeling and my fortune have since then taken place some for the better many for the worse i remembered the name i then carved in runic characters on the turf beside the castlegate and i asked why it should still agitate my heart but my friends came down from the tower and the foolish idea was chased away531  june 17lounged about while the good family went to church the day is rather cold and disposed to rain the papers say that the corn bill is given up in consequence of the duke of wellington having carried the amendment in the house of lords all the party heresir af perhaps exceptedare ministerialists on the present double bottom they say the names of whig and tory are now to exist no longer why have they existed at all  in the forenoon we went off to explore the environs we visited two ancient manorhouses those of elie and balcaskie large roomy mansions with good apartments two or three good portraits and a collection of most extraordinary frights prodigiously like the mistresses of king george i who came for all the goods and chattels of old england there are at elie house two most ferociouslooking ogresses of this cast there are noble trees about the house balcaskie put me in mind of poor philip anstruther dead and gone many a long year since he was a fine gallant lighthearted young sailor i remember the story of his drawing on his father for some cash which produced an angry letter from old sir robert to which philip replied that if he did not know how to write like a gentleman he did not desire any more of his correspondence balcaskie is much dilapidated but they are restoring the house in the good old style with its terraces and yewhedges the beastly fashion of bringing a bare illkept park up to your very doors seems going down we next visited with great pleasure the church of st monans which is under repair designed to correspond strictly with the ancient plan which is the solid gloomy but impressive gothic it was built by david ii in the fulfilment of a vow made to st monan on the field of battle at nevilles cross one would have judged the king to be thankful for small mercies for certainly st monan proved but an ineffective patron  mr hugh cleghorn532 dined at charlton and i saw him for the first time having heard of him all my life he is an able man has seen much and speaks well age has clawed him in his clutch and he has become deaf there is also captain black of the navy second lieutenant of the mars at trafalgar villeneuve was brought on board that ship after the debate he had no expectation that the british fleet would have fought till they had formed a regular line captain black disowns the idea of the french and spaniards being drawn up chequer form for resisting the british attack and imputes the appearance of that array to sheer accident of weather  june 18we visited wemyss castle on our return to kinghorn on the left before descending to the coast are considerable remains of a castle called popularly the old castle or macduffs castle that of the thane was situated at kennochquay at no great distance the front of wemyss castle to the land has been stripped entirely of its castellated appearance and narrowly escaped a new front to the sea it has a noble situation overhanging the red rocks but even there the structure has been much modernised and tamed interior is a good old house with large oak staircases family pictures etc we were received by captain wemyssa gallant seacaptain who could talk against a northwesterby his wife lady emma and her sister lady isabellabeautiful women of the house of errol and vindicating its title to the handsome hays we reached the pettycur about halfpast one crossed to edinburgh and so ended our little excursion of casualties we had only one triton the housedog at charlton threw down thomson and he had his wrist sprained a restive horse threatened to demolish our landau but we got off for the fright happily lcb was not in our carriage  dined at william mkenzies to meet the marquis and marchioness of stafford who are on their road to dunrobin found them both very well  june 19lord stafford desires to be a member of the bannatyne clubalso colin mkenzie sent both names up accordingly  the day furnishes a beggarly record of trumpery from eight oclock till nine wrote letters then parliament house where i had to wait on without anything to do till near two when rain forced me into the antiquarian museum lounged there till a meeting of the oil gas committee at three oclock there remained till near five home and smoked a cheroot after dinner called on thomson who is still disabled by his sprain pereat inter hæc we must do better tomorrow  june 20kept my word being teind wednesday two young frenchmen friends of gallois rather interrupted me i had asked them to breakfast but they stayed till twelve oclock which is scarce fair and plagued me with compliments their names are rémusat and guyzard533 pleasant goodhumoured young men notwithstanding this interruption i finished near six pages three being a good sessiondays work allons vogue la galère dined at the solicitors with lord hopetoun and a parliament house party  june 21finished five leavesthat is betwixt morning and dinnertime the court detained me till two oclock about nine leaves will make the volume quite large enough  by the way the booksellers have taken courage to print up 2000 more of the first edition of napoleon which after the second volume they curtailed from 8000 to 6000 this will be £1000 more in my way at least and that is a good help we dine with the skenes today lockhart being with us534  june 22wrought in the morning as usual received to breakfast dr bishop a brother of bishop the composer he tells me his brother was very ill when he wrote the chough and crow and other music for guy mannering singular but i do think illness if not too painful unseals the mental eye and renders the talents more acute in the study of the fine arts at least535  i find the difference on 2000 additional copies will be £3000 instead of £1000 in favour of the author my good friend publicum is impatient heaven grant his expectations be not disappointed coragio andiamos such another year of labour and success would do much towards making me a free man of the forest but i must to work since we have to dine with lord and lady gray by the way i forgot an engagement to my old friend lord justiceclerk this is shockingly illbred but the invitation was a month old and that is some defence  june 23i corrected proofs and played the grandfather in the morning after court saw lady wedderburn who asked my advice about printing some verses of mrs hemans in honour of the late lord james murray who died in greece also lord gray who wishes me to write some preliminary matter to his ancestor the master of grays correspondence i promised but ancestor was a great rogue and if i am to write about him at all i must take my will of him anne and i dined at home she went to the play and i had some mind to go too but miss foote was the sole attraction and miss foote is only a very pretty woman and if she played rosalind better than i think she can it is a bore to see touchstone and jacques murdered i have a particular respect for as you like it it was the first play i ever saw and that was at bath in 1776 or 1777 that is not yesterday yet i remember the piece very well so i remained at home smoked a cigar and worked leisurely upon the review of the culloden papers which by dint of vamping and turning may make up the lacking copy for the works better i think than that lumbering essay on border antiquities  june 24i dont care who knows it i was lazy this morning but i cheated my laziness capitally as you shall hear my good friend sir watt said i to my esteemed friend it is hard you should be obliged to work when you are so disinclined to it were i you i would not be quite idle though i would do something that you are not obliged to do just as i have seen a cowardly dog willing to fight with any one save that which his master would have desired him to yoke with so i went over the review of the culloden papers and went a great way to convert it into the essay on clanship etc which i intend for the prose works i wish i had thought of it before correcting that beastly border essay naboclish  june 25wrote five pages of the chronicles and hope to conquer one or two more ere night to fetch up the leeway went and saw allans sketch of a picture for abbotsford which is promising a thing on the plan of watteau he intends to introduce some interesting characters and some i suspect who have little business there yesterday i dined with the lockharts at portobello536 today at home with anne and miss erskine they are gone to walk i have a mind to go to trifle so i do not promise to write more tonight having begun the dedication advertisement i mean to the chronicles i have pleasant subjects of reflection the fund in gibsons hands will approach £40000 i think  lord melville writes desiring to be a candidate for the bannatyne club  i made a balance of my affairs and stuck it into my book it should answer very well but still      i am not given to great misguiding      but coin my pouches will na bide in      with me it neer was under hiding        i dealt it free  i must however and will be independent  june 26well if ever i saw such another thing since my mother bound up my head537 here is nine of clock strucken and i am still fast asleep abed i have not done the like of this many a day however it cannot be helped went to court which detained me till two oclock a walk home consumed the hour to three wrote in the court however to the duke of wellington and lord bloomfield and that is a good job over  i

king edward occupying one page as he hurries down the steep mortally wounded by the assassin singular power of speaking at once to the eye and the ear dined at home after dinner sorted papers rather idle  june 27corrected proofs and wrote till breakfast then the court called on skene and charles k sharpe and did not get home until three oclock and then so wet as to require a total change we dine at hector buchanan macdonalds where there are sometimes many people and little conversation sent a little chest of books by the carrier to abbotsford  a visit from a smart young man gustavus schwab of königsberg he gives a flattering picture of prussia which is preparing for freedom the king must keep his word though or the people may chance to tire of waiting dined at hb macdonalds with rather a young party for colin mkenzie and me  june 28wrote a little and corrected proofs how many things have i unfinished at present  chronicles first volume not ended  do second volume begun  introduction to ditto  tales of my grandfather  essay on highlands this unfinished owing to certain causes chiefly want of papers and books to fill up blanks which i will get at abbotsford came home through rain about two and commissioned john stevenson to call at three about binding some books dined with sophia visited on invitation a fine old little commodore trunnion who on reading a part of napoleons history with which he had himself been interested as commanding a flotilla thought he had detected a mistake but was luckily mistaken to my great delight      i fear thee ancient mariner  to be crossexamined by those who have seen the true thing is the devil and yet these eyewitnesses are not all right in what they repeat neither indeed cannot be so since you will have dozens of contradictions in their statements  june 29a distressing letter from haydon imprudent probably but who is not a man of rare genius what a pity i gave that £10 to craig but i have plenty of ten pounds sure and i may make it something i will get £100 at furthest when i come back from the country wrote at proofs but no copy i fear i shall wax fat and kick against madam duty but i augur better things

honoré february 10 1890 my father has often spoken to me of this visit to sir walter scottfor it was indeed my father charles de rémusat member of the french academy and successively minister of the interior and for foreign affairs who went at the age of thirty to abbotsford and he retained to the last days of his life a most lively remembrance of the great novelist who did not acknowledge the authorship of his novels and to whom it was thus impossible otherwise than indirectly to pay any compliment it gives me great pleasure to learn that the visit of those young men impressed him favourably my fathers companion was his contemporary and friend m louis de guizard who like my father was a contributor at that time to the liberal press of the restoration the globe and la revue française and who after the revolution of 1830 entered as did my father likewise upon political life m de guizard was first préfet then député and after 1848 became directeurgénéral des beaux arts he died about 1877 or 1878 after his retirement from public life  534 woodstock placed upwards of £8000 in the hands of sir walters creditors the napoleon first and second editions produced for them a sum which it even now startles me to mention£18000 as by the time the historical work was published nearly half of the first series of chronicles of the canongate had been written it is obvious that the amount to which scotts literary industry from the close of 1825 to the 10th of june 1827 had diminished his debt cannot be stated at less than £28000 had health been spared him how soon must he have freed himself from all his encumbrancesjgl  535 see life vol vi p 89 in mr ballantynes memorandum there is a fuller account of the mode in which the bride of lammermoor the legend of montrose and almost the whole of ivanhoe were produced and the mental phenomenon which accompanied the preparation of the firstnamed work  during the progress of composing the heart of midlothian the bride of lammermoor and legend of montrosea period of many monthsmr scotts health had become extremely indifferent and was often supposed to place him in great danger but it would hardly be credited were it not for the notoriety of the fact that although one of the symptoms of his illness was pain of the most acute description yet he never allowed it to interrupt his labours the only difference it produced that i am aware of was its causing him to employ the hand of an amanuensis in place of his own indeed during the greater part of the day at this period he was confined to his bed the person employed for this purpose was the respectable and intelligent mr wm laidlaw who acted for him in this capacity in the country and i think also attended him to town i have often been present with mr laidlaw during the short intervals of his labour and it was deeply affecting to hear the account he gave of his patrons severe sufferings and the indomitable spirit which enabled him to overmaster them he told me that very often the dictation of caleb balderstons and the old coopers best jokes was mingled with groans extorted from him by pains but that when he mr l endeavoured to prevail upon him to take a little respite the only answer he could obtain from mr scott was a request that he would see that the doors were carefully shut so that the expressions of his agony might not reach his familyas to stopping work laidlaw he said you know that is wholly out of the question what followed upon these exertions made in circumstances so very singular appears to me to exhibit one of the most singular chapters in the history of the human intellect the book having been published before mr scott was able to rise from his bed he assured me that when it was put into his hands he did not recollect one single incident character or conversation it contained he by no means desired me to understand nor did i understand that his illness had erased from his memory all or any of the original family facts with which he had been acquainted from the period probably of his boyhood these of course remained rooted where they had ever been or to speak more explicitly where explicitness is so entirely important he remembered the existence of the father and mother the son and daughter the rival lovers the compulsory marriage and the attack made by his bride upon the unhappy bridegroom with the general catastrophe of the whole all these things he recollected just as he did before he took to his bed but the marvel is that he recollected literally nothing elsenot a single character woven by the romancernot one of the many scenes and points of exquisite humour nor anything with which he was connected as writer of the work for a long time i felt myself very uneasy he said in the course of my reading always kept on the qui vive lest i should be startled by something altogether glaring and fantastic however i recollected that the printing had been performed by james ballantyne who i was sure would not have permitted anything of this sort to pass well i said upon the whole how did you like it oh he said i felt it monstrous gross and grotesque to be sure but still the worst of it made me laugh and i trusted therefore the goodnatured public would not be less indulgent i do not think that i ever ventured to lead to this singular subject again but you may depend upon it that what i have said is as distinctly reported as if it had been taken down at the moment in shorthand i should not otherwise have imparted the phenomenon at allmr ballantynes mss  536 mr lockhart saysmy wife and i spent the summer of 1827 partly at a seabathing place near edinburgh and partly in roxburghshire the arrival of his daughter and her children at portobello was a source of constant refreshment to him during june for every other day he came down and dined there and strolled about afterwards on the beach thus interrupting beneficially for his health and i doubt not for the result of his labours also the new custom of regular nightwork or as he called it serving double tides  537 see swift mary the cook to dr sheridan  538 the answer is printed in the scott centenary catalogue by

parting with this very association of ideas is a serious loss to the cause of devotion and scarce to be incurred without the certainty of corresponding advantages but if these recollections are valuable to persons of education they are almost indispensable to the edification of the lower ranks whose prejudices do not permit them to consider as the words of the inspired poetry the versions of living or modern poets but persist however absurdly in identifying the original with the ancient translationp 158  539 sir james stuart the last baronet of allanbank  540 the life of bonaparte then

certain but whether i am the better for it remains to be proved the duke is very amiable gentle and welldisposed and i am sure he has taken pains enough to accomplish what he says has been the first wish of his heart for the last three years all this is very flattering to an old lady and we lived so long in friendship with each other that i was afraid i should be unhappy if i did not say i

having great reliance upon his critical skill the manuscripts of all his poems and also of the earlier of his prose works were submitted to kinnedders judgment and a considerable correspondence on these subjects had taken place betwixt them which would no doubt have constituted one of the most interesting series of letters sir walter had left  lord kinnedder was a man of retired habits but little known except to those with whom he lived on terms of intimacy and by whom he was much esteemed and being naturally of a remarkably sensitive mind he was altogether overthrown by the circumstance of a report having got abroad of some alleged indiscretions on his part in which a lady was also implicated whether the report had any foundation in truth or not i am altogether ignorant but such an allegation affecting a person in his situation in life as a judge and doing such violence to the susceptibility of his feelings had the effect of bringing a severe illness which in a few days terminated his life i never saw sir walter so much affected by any event and at the funeral which he attended he was quite unable to suppress his feelings but wept like a child the family suddenly bereft of their protector were young orphans their mother daughter of professor john robertson having previously died found also that they had to struggle against embarrassed circumstances neither had they any near relative in scotland to take charge of their affairs but a lady a friend of the family miss m was active in their service and it so happened in the course of arranging their affairs the packet of letters from sir walter scott containing the whole of his correspondence with lord kinnedder came into her hands she very soon discovered that the correspondence laid open the secret of the authorship of the waverley novels at that period the subject of general and intense interest and as yet unacknowledged by sir walter  considering what under these circumstances it was her duty to do whether to replace the letters and suffer any accident to bring to light what the author seemed anxious might remain unknown or to seal them up and keep them in her own custody undivulgedor finally to destroy them in order to preserve the secretwith no doubt the best and most upright motives so far as her own judgment enabled her to decide in the matter in which she was unable to take advice without betraying what it was her object to respect she came to the resolution most unfortunately for the world of destroying the letters and accordingly the whole of them were committed to the flames depriving the descendants of lord kinnedder of a possession which could not fail to be much valued by them and which in connection with lord kinnedders letters to sir walter which are doubtless preserved would have been equally valuable to the public as containing the contemporary opinions prospects views and sentiments under which these works were sent forth into the world it would also have been curious to learn the unbiased impression which the different works created on the mind of such a man as lord kinnedder before the collision of public opinion had suffused

day in the course of which i have not done      the least right thing  before breakfast i employed myself in airing my old bibliomaniacal hobby entering all the books lately acquired into a temporary catalogue so as to have them shelved and marked after breakfast i went out the day being delightfulwarm yet cooled with a gentle breeze all around delicious the rich luxuriant green refreshing to the eye soft to the tread and perfume to the smell wandered about and looked at my plantations came home and received a visit from sir adam loitered in the library till dinnertime if there is anything to be done at all today it must be in the evening but i fear there will be nothing one cant work always nowther      neque semper arcum tendit apollo  theres warrant for it  july 2wrote in the morning correcting the essay on the highlands which is now nearly completed settled accounts with tom and bogie went over to huntly burn at two oclock and reconnoitred the proposed plantation to be called janes wood dined with the fergusons  july 3 worked in the morning upon the introduction to the chronicles it may be thought egotistical learned a bad accident had happened yesterday a tinker drunk i suppose entered the stream opposite to faldonside with an ass bearing his children the ass was carried down by the force of the stream and one of the little creatures was drowned the other was brought out alive poor innocent clinging to the ass it had floated as far down as deadwaterheugh poor thing it is as well dead as to live a tinker the fergusons dine with us en masse also dr brewster  july 4 edinburghworked a little in the morning and took a walk after breakfast the day so delicious as makes it heartbreaking to leave the country set out however about four oclock and reached edinburgh a little after nine slept part of the way read de vere the rest1 it is well written in point of language and sentiment but has too little action in it to be termed a pleasing novel everything is brought out by dialogueor worse through the medium of the authors reflections which is the clumsiest of all expedients  july 5this morning worked and sent off to jb the introduction to the chronicles containing my confessions2 and did something but not fluently to the confessions themselves not happy however the black dog worries me bile i suppose but i will rally and combat the reiver reiver it is that wretched malady of the mind got quite well in the forenoon went out to portobello after dinner and chatted with little johnnie and told him the history of the field of prestonpans few remain who care about these stories  july 6this morning wrought a good deal but scarce a task the court lasted till halfpast three exhausting work in this hot weather i returned to dine alone anne going to roslin with a party after noon a miss bell broke in upon me who bothered me some time since about a book of hers explaining and exposing the conduct of a methodist tartuffe who had broken off by anonymous letters a match betwixt her and an accepted admirer tried in vain to make her comprehend how little the edinburgh people would care about her wrongs since there was no knowledge of the parties to make the scandal acceptable i believe she has suffered great wrong3 letter from longman and co to jb grumbling about bringing out the second edition because they have forsooth 700 copies in hand out of 5000 five days after the first edition4 is out what would they have it is uncomfortable though  july 7night dreadfully warm and bilious i could not be fool enough surely to be anxious for these wise men of the easts prognostication letters from lockhart give a very cheerful prospect if there had been any thundering upsetting broadside he would have noticed it surely more or less r cadell quite stout and determined to go on with the second edition well i hope alls rightthinking wont help it charles came down this morning penniless poor fellow but we will soon remedy that lockhart remits £100 for reviewing i hope the next will be for sophia for cash affairs loom well in the offing and if the trust funds go right i was never so easy i will take care how i get into debt again i do not like this croaking of these old owls of saint pauls when all is done the pitcher has gone often to the well buthowever i worked away at the chronicles i will take pains with them i will by jove  july 8i did little today but arrange papers and put bills receipts etc into applepie order i believe the fair prospect i have of clearing off some encumbrances which are like thorns in my flesh nay in my very eye contribute much to this i did not even correct proofsheets nay could not for i have cancelled two sheets instante jacobo and i myself being of his opinion for as i said yesterday we must and will take pains the fiddlefaddle of arranging all the things was troublesome but they give a good account of my affairs the money for the necessary payments is ready and therefore there is a sort of pleasure which does not arise out of any mean source since it has for its object the prospect of doing justice and achieving independence jb dined with me poor fellow and talked of his views as hopeful and prosperous god send honest industry a fair riddance  july 9wrote in the morning at eleven went by appointment with colin mackenzie to the new edinburgh academy in the fifth class mr mitchells we heard greek of which i am no otherwise a judge than that it was fluently read and explained in the rector mr williamss class we heard virgil and livy admirably translated ad aperturam libri and what i thought remarkable the rector giving the english and the pupils returning with singular dexterity the latin not exactly as in the original but often by synonymes which showed that the exercise referred to the judgment and did not depend on the memory i could not help saying with great truth that as we had all long known how much the pupils were fortunate in a rector so we were now taught that the rector was equally lucky in his pupils of my young friends i saw a son of john swinton a son of johnstone of alva and a son of craufurd tait5 dined at john murrays mr and mrs philips of liverpool general and charles stuart of blantyre lord abercromby clerk and thomson pleasant evening  july 10corrected proofs but wrote nothing to court till two oclock i went to cadells by the mound a long roundabout transacted some business i met baron hume coming home and walked with him in the gardens his remarkable account of his celebrated uncles last moments is in these wordsdr black called on mr d hume6 on the morning on which he died the patient complained of having suffered a great deal during the night and expressed a fear that his struggle might be prolonged to his great distress for days or weeks longer no sir said dr black with the remarkable calmness and sincerity which characterised him i have examined the symptoms and observe several which oblige me to conclude that dissolution is rapidly approaching are you certain of that doctor most assuredly so answered the physician the dying philosopher extended his arm and shook hands with his medical friend i thank you he said for the news so little reason there was for the reports of his having been troubled in mind when on his deathbed  dined at lord abercrombys to meet lord melville in private we had an interview betwixt dinner and tea i was sorry to see my very old friend this upright statesman and honourable gentleman deprived of his power and his official income which the number of his family must render a matter of importance he was cheerful not affectedly so and bore his declension like a wise and brave man i had nursed the idea that he had been hasty in his resignation but from the letters which he showed me confidentially which passed betwixt him and canning it is clear his resignation was to be accomplished not i suppose for personal considerations but because it rendered the admiralty vacant for the duke of clarence as his resignation was eagerly snapped at it cannot be doubted that if he had hesitated or hung back behind his friends forcible means would have been used to compel to the measure which with more dignity he took of his own accordat least so it seemed to me the first intimation which lord melville received of his successor was through mr who told him as great news that there was to be a new duke of york7 lord m understood the allusion so little as to inquire whether his informant meant that the duke of cambridge had taken the duke of yorks situation when it was explained to refer to the duke of clarence getting the admiralty there are some few words that speak volumes lord melville said that none of them suspected cannings negotiations with the whigs but the duke of wellington who found it out through the ladies ten days before i asked him how they came to be so unprepared and could not help saying i thought they had acted without consideration and that they might have shown a face even to canning he allowed the truth of what i said and seemed to blame peels want of courage in his place he said he would have proposed to form a government disclaiming any personal views for himself as being premier and the like but upon the principle of supporting the measures of lord castlereagh and lord liverpool i think this would have been acceptable to the king mr peel obviously feared his great antagonist canning and perhaps threw the game up too soon canning said the office of premier was his inheritance he could not from constitution hold it above two years and then it would descend to peel such is ambition old friends forsakenold principles changedevery effort used to give the vessel of the state a new direction and all to be palinurus for two years  july 11 abbotsfordworked at proofs in the morning composed nothing got off by one and to this place between six and seven weather delicious  july 12unpacking and arranging the urchins are stealing the cherries in the outer garden but i can spare a thousand larchtrees to put it in order with a good fence for next year it is not right to leave fruit exposed for if adam in the days of innocence fell by an apple how much may the little gossoon jamie moffatt be tempted by apples of gold in an age of iron anne and i walked to huntly burna delicious excursion that place is really become beautiful the miss fergusons have displayed a great deal of taste  july 13two agreeable personsrev mr gilly8 one of the prebendaries of durham with his wife a pretty little womandined with us and met mr scrope i heard the whole history of the discovery of st cuthberts9 body at durham cathedral the catholics will deny the identity of course but i think it is constaté by the dress and other circumstances made a pleasant day of it and with a good conscience for i had done my task this morning  july 14did task this morning and believe that i shall get on now very well wrote about five leaves i have been baking and fevering myself like a fool for these two years in a room exposed to the south comfortable in winter but broiling in the hot weather now i have removed myself into the large cool library one of the most refreshing as well as handsomest rooms in scotland and will not use the study again till the heats are past here is an entry as solemn as if it respected the vicar of wakefields removal from the yellow room to the brown but i think my labours will advance greatly in consequence of this arrangement walked in the evening to the lake  july 15achieved six pages today and finished volume i of chronicles it is rather long but i think the last story interesting and it should not be split up into parts jb will i fear think it low and if he thinks so others will yetvamos drove to huntly burn in the evening  july 16made a good mornings work of the tales in the daytime corrected various proofs jb thinks that in the proposed introduction i contemn too much the occupation by which i have thriven so well and hints that i may easily lead other people to follow my opinion in vilipending my talents and the use i have made of them i cannot tell i do not like on the one hand to suppress my own opinion of the floccipaucinihilipilification with which i regard these things but yet in duty to others i cannot afford to break my own bow or befoul my own nest and there may be something like affectation and nolo episcopari in seeming to underrate my own labours so all things considered i will erase the passage truth should not be spoke at all times in the evening we had a delightful drive to ashestiel with colonel and miss ferguson  july 17i wrote a laborious task seven pages of tales kept about the doors all day gave bogie £10 to buy cattle tomorrow at st boswells fair here is a whimsical subject of affliction mr harper a settler who went from this country to botany bay thinking himself obliged to me for a recommendation to general mallister and sir thomas brisbane has thought proper to bring me home a couple of emus i wish his gratitude had either taken a different turn or remained as quiescent as that of others whom i have obliged more materially i at first accepted the creatures conceiving them in my ignorance to be some sort of blue and green parrot which though i do not admire their noise might scream and yell at their pleasure if hung up in the hall among the armour but your emu it seems stands six feet high on his stocking soles and is little better than a kind of cassowary or ostrich hang them they might eat up my collection of old arms for what i know it reminds me of the story of the adjutant birds in theodore hooks novel10 no ill no emuses  july 18entered this morning on the history of sir william wallace i wish i may be able to find my way between what the child can comprehend and what shall not yet be absolutely uninteresting to the grown readers uncommon facts i should think the best receipt learn that mr owen rees and john gibson have amicably settled their differences about the last edition of napoleon the trustees allowing the publishers nine months credit my nerves have for these two or three last days been susceptible of an acute excitement from the slightest causes the beauty of the evening the sighing of the summer breeze brings the tears into my eyes not unpleasingly but i must take exercise and caseharden myself there is no use in encouraging these moods of the mind it is not the law we live on  we had a little party with some luncheon at the lake where mr bainbridge fished without much success captain hamilton and two messrs stirling relatives of my old friend keir were there and walked with me a long round home i walked better than i had done for some days mr scrope dined with us he was complaining of gout which is a bad companion for the stagshooting  july 19i made out my task this forenoon and a good deal more sent five or six pages to james ballantyne ie got them ready and wrote till the afternoon then i drove over to huntly burn and walked through the glens till dinnertime after dinner read and worked till bedtime yet i have written well walked well talked well and have nothing to regret  july 20despatched my letters to jb with supply of copy and made up more than my taskabout four leaves i think offered my emuses to the duke of buccleuch i had an appointment with captain hamilton and his friends the stirlings that they were to go up yarrow today but the weather seems to say no  my visitors came however and we went up to newark here is a little misfortune for spice left me and we could not find her as we had no servant with us on horseback i was compelled to leave her to her fate resolving to send in quest of her tomorrow morning the keepers are my bonos socios as the host says in the devil of edmonton11 and would as soon shoot a child as a dog of mine but there are scamps and traps and i am ashamed to say how reluctantly i left the poor little terrier to its fate  she came home to me however about an hour and a half after we were home to my great delectation our visitors dined with us  july 21this morning wrote five pages of childrens history went to minto where we met besides lord m and his delightful countess thomas thomson kennedy of dunure12 lord carnarvon and his younger son and daughterinlaw the dowager lady minto also whom i always delight to see she is so full of spirit and intelligence we rubbed up some recollections of twenty years ago when i was more intimate with the family till whig and tory separated us for a time by the way nobody talks whig or tory just now and the fighting men on each side go about muzzled and mute like dogs after a proclamation about canine madness am i sorry for this truce or not half and half it is all we have left to stir the blood this little political brawling but better too little of it than too much  july 22 abbotsfordrose a little later than usual and wrote a letter to mrs joanna baillie she is writing a tragedy13 on witchcraft i shall be curious to see it will it be real witchcraftthe ipsissimus diabolusor an impostor or the halfcrazed being who believes herself an ally of condemned spirits and desires to be so that last is a sublime subject we set out after breakfast and reached this about two i walked from two till four chatted a long time with charles after dinner and thus went my day sine linea but we will make it up james ballantyne dislikes my drovers but it shall stand i must have my own way sometimes  i received news of two deaths at once lady die scott my very old friend and archibald constable the bookseller  july 23yes they are both for very different reasons subjects of reflection lady diana scott widow of walter scott of harden was the last person whom i recollect so much older than myself that she kept always at the same distance in point of years so that she scarce seemed older to me relatively two years ago when in her ninetysecond year than fifty years before she was the daughter alone remaining of popes earl of marchmont and like her father had an acute mind and an eager temper she was always kind to me remarkably so indeed when i was a boy  constables death might have been a most important thing to me if it had happened some years ago and i should then have lamented it much he has lived to do me some injury yet excepting the last £5000 i think most unintentionally he was a prince of booksellers his views sharp powerful and liberal too sanguine however and like many bold and successful schemers never knowing when to stand or stop and not always calculating his means to his objects with mercantile accuracy he was very vain for which he had some reason having raised himself to great commercial eminence as he might also have attained great wealth with good management he knew i think more of the business of a bookseller in planning and executing popular works than any man of his time in books themselves he had much bibliographical information but none whatever that could be termed literary he knew the rare volumes of his library not only by the eye but by the touch when blindfolded thomas thomson saw him make this experiment and that it might be complete placed in his hand an ordinary volume instead of one of these libri rariores he said he had overestimated his memory he could not recollect that volume constable was a violenttempered man with those that he dared use freedom with he was easily overawed by people of consequence but as usual took it out of those whom poverty made subservient to him yet he was generous and far from badhearted in person goodlooking but very corpulent latterly a large feeder and deep drinker till his health became weak he died of water in the chest which the natural strength of his constitution set long at defiance i have no great reason to regret him yet i do if he deceived me he also deceived himself14  wrote five pages today and went to see mr scrope who is fast with the gouta bad companion to attend him                   to athole braes     to shoot the dun deer down down     to shoot the dun deer down  july 24finished five pages before eleven oclock at which time mr deputy register15 arrived from minto and we had an agreeable afternoon talking about the old days we have had together i was surprised to find that thomson knew as little as i do myself how to advise charles to a good course of scottish history hailes and pinkerton robertson and laingthere is nothing else for itand pinkerton is poor work laing besides his party spirit has a turn for generalising which renders him rather dull which was not the nature of the acute orcadian  july 25thomson left us this morning early i finished four pages and part of a fifth then drove to huntly burn and returned through the glen i certainly turn heavyfooted not in the female sense however i had one or two falls among the slippy heather not having tom purdie to give me his arm i suppose i shall need a gocart one of these days and if it must be soso let it be fiat voluntas tua  a letter from john gibson in the evening brought me word that lord newton had adjudged the profits of woodstock and napoleon to be my own this is a great matter and removes the most important part of my dispute with constables creditors i waked in the middle of the night sure i am not such a featherheaded gull as not to be able to sleep for good news i am thankful that it is as it is had it been otherwise i could have stood it the money realised will pay onethird of all that i owe in the worldand what will pay the other twothirds i am as well and as capable as when those misfortunes beganjanuary was a year the public favour may wane indeed but it has not failed as yet and i must not be too anxious about that possibility  james b has found fault with my tales for being too historical formerly it was for being too infantine he calls out for starch and is afraid of his cravat being too stiff o ye critics will nothing melt ye  july 26wrote till one oclock and finished the first volume of talesabout six leaves tomorrow i resume the chronicles tooth and nail they must be good if possible after all works of fiction viz cursed lies are easier to write and much more popular than the best truths walked over to the head of the roman road coming round by bauchland and the abbots walk wrote letters in the evening  july 27in the morning still busied with my correspondence no great desire to take up the chronicles but it must be done devil take the necessity and the folly and knavery that occasioned it but this is no matter now accordingly i set tightly to work and got on till two when i took a walk was made very happy by the arrival of sophia and her babies all in good health and spirits  july 28worked hard in the morning the two ballantynes and mr hogarth with them owen rees came early in the day fergusons came to dinner rees in great kindness and goodhumour but a little drumlie i think about napoleon we heard sandies violin after dinner      whose touch harmonious can remove     the pangs of guilty power and hopeless love16  i do not understand or care about fine music but there is something in his violin which goes to the very heart sophia sung too and we were once more merry in hallthe first time for this many a month and many a day  july 29could not do more than undertake my proofs today of which jb has brought out a considerable quantity walked at one with hogarth and reesthe day sultry hot and we hot accordingly but crept about notwithstanding i am sorry to see my old and feal friend james rather unable to walkonce so stout and activeso was i in my way once ah that vile word what a world of loss it involves  july 30one of the most peppering thunderstorms which i have heard for some time routed and roared from six in the morning till eight continuously      the thunder ceased not nor the fire reposed                   well done old botherby  time wasted though very agreeably after breakfast at noon set out for chiefswood in the carriage and walked home footing it over rough and smooth with the vigour of early days james ballantyne marched on too somewhat meltingly but without complaint we again had beautiful music after dinner the heart of age arose i have often wondered whether i have a taste for music or no my ear appears to me as dull as my voice is incapable of musical expression and yet i feel the utmost pleasure in any such music as i can comprehend learned pieces always excepted i believe i may be about the pitch of terrys connoisseurship and that i have a reasonable good ear for a jig but your solos and sonatas give me the spleen  july 31employed the morning writing letters and correcting proofs this is the second day and scarce a line written but circumstances are so much my apology that even duty does not murmur at least not much we had a drive up to galashiels and sent jb off to edinburgh in the mail music in the evening as before  footnotes  1 written by r plumer ward author of tremaine and other works mr wards political life including a diary to 1820 was

scene in the bride of lammermoor  14 did constable ruin scott as has been generally supposed it is right to say that such a charge was not made during the lifetime of either immediately after scotts death miss edgeworth wrote to sir james gibsoncraig and asked him for authentic information as to sir walters connection with constable sir james in reply stated that to his personal knowledge mr constable had in his anxiety to save scott about 1814 1813 commenced a system of accommodation bills which could not fail to produce and actually did produce the ruin of both parties to another correspondent some years later he wrote still more strongly memoirs vol iii p 457  scott appears to have been aware of the facts so far as he says to laidlaw in a letter of december 16 1825 the confusion of 1814 is a joke to this  but it arises out of the nature of the same connection which gives and has given me a fortune and mr lockhart says that the firm of jb  co had more than once owed its escape from utter ruin and dishonour through constables exertionslife vol v p 150  on reading the third volume of constables memoirs 3 vols 8vo 1873 one cannot fail to see that all the three partiesprinter publisher and authorwere equal sharers in the imprudences that led to the disaster in 1826 whether mr constable was right in recommending further advances to the london house is doubtful but if it was an error of judgment it was one which appears to have been shared by mr cadell and mr james ballantyne it must be admitted that the three firms were equally culpable in maintaining for so many years a system of fictitious credit constable at least from a letter to scott printed in vol iii p 274 had become seriously alarmed as early as august 8 1823  that constable was correct in his estimate of the value of the literary property has been shown by the large sums realised from the sale of scotts works since 1829 and that his was the brain the pendulum of the clock as scott termed it to plan is also shown by the fact that the socalled favourite edition the magnum opus appears to have been constables idea memoirs vol iii p 255 although according to the annual register of 1849 mr cadell claimed the merit of a scheme which he had quietly and privately matured  15 thomas thomson deputeclerk register for scotland under lord frederick campbell  16 johnsons epitaph on claude phillips     august   august 1my guests left me and i thought of turning to work again seriously finished five pages dined alone excepting huntly gordon who is come on a visit poor lad i hope he is well fixed under mr plantas17 patronage smoked a cigar after dinner laughed with my daughters and read them the review of hoffmanns production out of gilliess new foreign review  the undertaking would do i am convinced in any other persons hands than those of the improvident editor but i hear he is living as thoughtlessly as ever in london has hired a large house and gives burgundy to his guests this will hardly suit £500 a year  august 2got off my proofs went over to breakfast at huntly burn the great object was to see my cascade in the glen suitably repaired i have had it put to rights by puddling and damming what says the frog in the fairy tale      stuff with moss and clog with clay     and that will weize the water away  having seen the job pretty tightly done walked deliciously home through the woods but no work all this while then for up and at it but in spite of good resolutions i trifled with my children after dinner and read to them in the evening and did just nothing at all  august 3wrote five pages and upwardsscarce amends for past laziness huntly gordon lent me a volume of his fathers manuscript memoirs18 they are not without interest for pryse gordon though a bit of a roué is a clever fellow in his way one thing struck me being the story of an irish swindler who called himself henry king edgeworth an impudent gawsey fellow who deserted from gordons recruiting party enlisted again and became so great a favourite with the colonel of the regiment which he joined that he was made paysergeant here he deserted to purpose with £200 or £300 escaped to france got a commission in the corps sent to invade ireland was taken recognised and hanged what would mr theobald wolfe tone have said to such an associate in his regenerating expedition these are thy gods o israel the other was the displeasure of the present cameron of lochiel on finding that the forty camerons with whom he joined the duke of gordons northern fencible regiment were to be dispersed he had wellnigh mutinied and marched back with them this would be a good anecdote for garth19  august 4spent the morning at selkirk examining people about an assault when i returned i found charlotte kerr here with a clever little boy charles scott grandson of charles of the woll and son of william and grandnephew of john of midgehope he seems a smart boy and considering that he is an only son with expectations not too much spoiled general yermoloff called with a letter from a dr knox whom i do not know if it be vicesimus we met nearly twentyfive years ago and did not agree but general yermoloffs name was luckily known to me he is a man in the flower of life about thirty handsome bold and enthusiastic a great admirer of poetry and all that he had been in the moscow campaign and those which followed but must have been very young he made not the least doubt that moscow was burned by rostopchin and said that there was a general rumour before the french entered the town and while the inhabitants were leaving it that persons were left to destroy it i asked him why the magazine of gunpowder had not been set fire to in the first instance he answered that he believed the explosion of that magazine would have endangered the retreating russians this seemed unsatisfactory the march of the russians was too distant from moscow to be annoyed by the circumstance i pressed him as well as i could about the slowness of koutousoffs operations and he frankly owned that the russians were so much rejoiced and surprised to see the french in retreat that it was long ere they could credit the extent of the advantage which they had acquired this has been but an idle day so far as composition is concerned but i was detained late at selkirk  august 5wrote near six pages general yermoloff left me with many expressions of enthusiastic regard as foreigners use to do he is a kinsman of princess galitzin whom i saw at paris i walked with tom after one oclock dined en famille with miss todd a pretty girl and wrote after dinner  august 6this morning finished proofs and was bang up with everything when i was about to sit down to write i have the agreeable tidings that henderson the fellow who committed the assault at selkirk and who made his escape from the officers on saturday was retaken and that it became necessary that i should go up to examine him returned at four and found mrs george swinton from calcutta to whose husband i have been much obliged with archie and cousin peggie swinton arrived so the evening was done up  august 7cousins still continuing we went to melrose i finished however in the first place a pretty smart task which is so far well as we expect the skenes tomorrow lockhart arrived from london the news are that canning is dangerously ill this is the bowl being broken at the cistern with a vengeance if he dies now it will be pity it was not five months ago the time has been enough to do much evil but not to do anypermanent good  august 8huntly gordon proposed to me that i should give him my correspondence which we had begun to arrange last year i resolved not to lose the opportunity and began to look out and arrange the letters from about 1810 throwing out letters of business and such as are private they are of little consequence generally speaking yet will be one day curious i propose to have them bound up to save trouble it is a sad task how many dead absent estranged and altered i wrought till the skenes came at four oclock i love them well yet i wish their visit had been made last week when other people were here it kills time or rather murders it this companykeeping yet what remains on earth that i like so well as a little society i wrote not a line today  august 9i finished the arrangement of the letters so as to put them into mr gordons hands it will be a great job done but in the meanwhile it interrupts my work sadly for i kept busy till one oclock today with this idle mans labour still however it might have been long enough ere i got a confidential person like gordon to arrange these confidential papers they are all in his hands now walked after one  august 10this is a morning of fidgety nervous confusion i sought successively my box of bramah pens my proofsheets and last not least anxiously my spectacles i am convinced i lost a full hour in these various chases i collected all my insubordinate movables at once but had scarce corrected the proof and written halfascore of lines than enter dalgleish declaring the blucher hour is come the weather however is rainy and fitted for a day of pure work but i was able only to finish my task of three pages  the death of the premier is announced late george canning the witty the accomplished the ambitious he who had toiled thirty years and involved himself in the most harassing discussions to attain this dizzy height he who had held it for three months of intrigue and obloquyand now a heap of dust and that is all he was an early and familiar friend of mine through my intimacy with george ellis no man possessed a gayer and more playful wit in society no one since pitts time had more commanding sarcasm in debate in the house of commons he was the terror of that species of orators called the yelpers his lash fetched away both skin and flesh and would have penetrated the hide of a rhinoceros in his conduct as a statesman he had a great fault he lent himself too willingly to intrigue thus he got into his quarrel with lord castlereagh20 and lost credit with the country for want of openness thus too he got involved with the queens party to such an extent that it fettered him upon that memorable quarrel and obliged him to butter sir robert wilson with dear friend and gallant general and so forth the last composition with the whigs was a sacrifice of principle on both sides i have some reason to think they counted on getting rid of him in two or three years to me canning was always personally most kind i saw with pain a great change in his health when i met him at colonel boltons at stors in 1825 in london i thought him looking better  august 11wrote nearly five pages then walked a visit from henry scott21 nothing known as yet about politics a high tory administration would be a great evil at this time there are repairs in the structure of our constitution which ought to be made at this season and without which the people will not long be silent a pure whig administration would probably play the devil by attempting a thorough repair as to a compound or melodramatic ministry the parts out of which such a one could be organised just now are at a terrible discount in public estimation nor will they be at par in a hurry again the public were generally shocked at the complete lack of principle testified by public men on the late occasion and by some who till then had some credit with the public the duke of w has risen by his firmness on the one side earl grey on the other  august 12wrote my task and no more walked with lockhart from one oclock to four took in our way the glen which looks beautiful i walked with extreme pain and feebleness until we began to turn homewards when the relaxation of the ankle sinews seemed to be removed and i trode merrily home this is strange that exercise should restore the nerves from the chill or numbness which is allied to palsy i am well aware but how it should restore elasticity to sinews that are too much relaxed i for one cannot comprehend colonel russell came to dinner with us and to consult me about some family matters he has the spirit of a gentleman that is certain  august 13a letter from booksellers at brussels informs me of the pleasant tidings that napoleon is a total failure that they have lost much money on a version which they were at great expense in preparing and modestly propose that i should write a novel to make them amends for loss on a speculation which i knew nothing about have you nothing else to ask as sancho says to the farmer who asks him to stock a farm for his son portion off his daughters etc etc they state themselves to be young booksellers certes they must hold me to be a very young author napoleon however has failed on the continentand perhaps in england also for from the mumbling halfgrumbling tone of longman and co dissatisfaction may be apprehended well i can set my face to it boldly i live not in the public opinion not i but egad i live by it and that is worse tu ne cede malis sed contra etc  i corrected and transmitted sheets before breakfast afterwards went and cut wood with tom but returned about twelve in rather a melancholy humour i fear this failure may be followed by others and then what chance of extricating my affairs but they that look to freits freits will follow them hussards en avantcare killed a cat i finished three pagesthat is a full task of the chroniclesafter i returned mr and mrs philips of manchester came to dinner  august 14finished my task before breakfast a bad rainy day for which i should not have cared but for my guests however being goodhumoured persons and gifted with taste we got on very well by dint of showing prints curiosities finally the house up stairs and down and at length by undertaking a pilgrimage to melrose in the rain which pilgrimage we accomplished but never entered the abbey church having just had wetting enough to induce us when we arrived at the gate to turn again whittington  august 15wrote in the morning after breakfast walked with mr philips who is about to build and plan himself and therefore seemed to enter con amore into all i had been doing asked questions and seemed really interested to learn what i thought myself not illqualified to teach the little feeling of superior information in such cases is extremely agreeable on the contrary it is a great scrape to find you have been boring some one who did not care a d about the matter so to speak and that you might have been as well employed in buttering a whinstone mr and mrs philips left us about twelveday bad i wrote nearly five pages of chronicles  august 16a wet disagreeable sulky day but such things may be carried to account i wrote upwards of seven pages and placed myself rectus in curia with madam duty who was beginning to lift up her throat against me nothing remarkable except that huntly gordon left us  august 17wrote my task in the morning after breakfast went out and cut wood with tom and john swanston and hewed away with my own hand remained on foot from eleven oclock till past three doing in my opinion a great deal of good in plantations above the house where the firs had been permitted to predominate too much over the oak and hardwood the day was rough and stormynot the worst for working and i could do it with a good conscience all being well forward in the duty line after tea i worked a little longer on the whole finished four leaves and upwardsabout a printed sheetwhich is enough for one day  august 18finished about five leaves and then out to the wood where i chopped away among the trees laying the foundation for future scenery these woods will one day occupy a great number of hands four years hence they will employ ten stout woodsmen almost every day of the year henry and william scott harden came to dinner  august 19wrote till about one then walked for an hour or two by myself entirely finished five pages before dinner when we had captain and mrs hamilton and young davidoff who is their guest they remained with us all night  august 20i corrected proofs and wrote one leaf before breakfast then went up to selkirk to try a fellow for an assault the people there get rather riotous this is a turbulent fierce fellow some of his attitudes were good during the trial this dissipated my attention for the day although i was back by halfpast two i did not work any more so am behind in my reckoning  august 21wrote four pages then set out to make a call at sunderland hall and yair but the old sociable broke down before we had got past the thicket so we trudged all back on foot and i wrote another page this makes up the deficiency of yesterday  august 22i wrote four or five leaves but begin to get aground for want of indian localities colonel fergusons absence is unlucky and halfadozen qui his besides willing to write chits22 eat tiffin and vent all their pagan jargon when one does not want to hear it and now that i want a touch of their slang lo there is not one near me mr adolphus son of the celebrated counsel and author of a work on the waverley novels23 came to make me a visit he is a modest as well as an able man and i am obliged to him for the delicacy with which he treated a matter in which i was personally so much concerned mr and mrs hamilton asked us to breakfast tomorrow  august 23went to breakfast at chiefswood which with a circuitous walk have consumed the day found in the first place my friend allan the painter busy about a picture into which he intends introducing living charactersa kind of revel at abbotsford second a whimsical party consisting of john stevenson the bookseller peter buchan from peterhead a quiz of a poetical creature and a bookbinder a friend of theirs the plan was to consult me about publishing a great quantity of ballads which this mr buchan has collected i glanced them over he has been very successful for they are obviously genuine and many of them very curious others are various editions of wellknown ballads i could not make the man comprehend that these last were of little value being generally worse readings of what was already published a small edition published by subscription may possibly succeed it is a great pity that few of these ballads are historical almost all being of the romantic cast they certainly ought to be preserved after striking out one or two which have been sophisticated i suppose by mr buchan himself which are easily distinguishable from the genuine ballads24 no one but burns ever succeeded in patching up old scottish songs with any good effect  august 24corrected proofs and wrote letters in the morning began a review upon monteaths planter for lockhart25 other matters at a stand a drive down to mertoun and engaged to dine there on sunday first this consumed the day  august 25mr adolphus left us this morning after a very agreeable visit we all dined at dr brewsters met sir john wright miss haig etc slandered our neighbours and were good company major john scott there i did a little more at the review today but i cannot go on with the tale without i could speak a little hindostaneea small seasoning of currypowder ferguson will do it if i can screw it out of him  august 26encore review walked from twelve till three then drove to mertoun with lockhart and allan dined en famille and home by halfpast ten we thought of adding a third volume to the chronicles but gibson is afraid it would give grounds for a pretext to seize this work on the part of constables creditors who seem determined to take any advantage of me but they can only show their teeth i trust though i wish the arbitration was ended  august 27sent off proofs in morning revised in afternoon walked from one till four what a life of uniformity yet i never wish to change it i even regret i must go to town to meet lady compton26 next week  a singular letter from a lady requesting i would father a novel of hers that wont pass27  cadell writes me transmitting a notice from the french papers that gourgaud has gone or is going to london to verify the facts alleged in my history of napoleon and the bibliopolist is in a great funk i lack some part of his instinct i have done gourgaud no wrong every word imputed to him exists in the papers submitted to me as historical documents28 and i should have been a shameful coward if i had shunned using them at my years it is somewhat late for an affair of honour and as a reasonable man i would avoid such an arbitrament but will not plead privilege of literature the country shall not be disgraced in my person and having stated why i think i owe him no satisfaction i will at the same time most willingly give it to him      il sera reçu       biribi     a la façon de barbaru       mon ami  i have written to will clerk to stand my friend if necessary he has mettle in him and thinks of my honour as well as my safety  august 28i am still bothering with the review but gave lockhart fifteen leaves which is something learned with regret that williams leaves his situation of rector of the new academy it is a shot in the wing of the institution for he is a heavenborn teacher walked at two till four along the thicket and by the riverside where i go seldom i cant say why unless that the walk is less private than those more distant lockhart allan and i talk of an excursion to kelso tomorrow i have no friends there now yet once how many  august 29went on our little expedition breakfasting at mertoun called at fleurs where we found sir john s and his whole family the great lady received us well though we had been very remiss in our duty from that we went to kelso where i saw not a soul to acknowledge former acquaintance how should i when my residence there was before 1783 i fancy29 the little cottage in which i lived with poor aunt jenny is still standing but the great garden is divided betwixt three proprietors its huge platanus tree withered i was told in the same season which was fatal to so many of the species it was cut down the yewhedges labyrinths wildernesses and other marks that it had once been the abode of one of the millers connected with the author of the gardeners dictionary they were a quaker family are all obliterated and the place is as common and vulgar as may be the lady the cottage belongs to was very civil allan as a man of taste was much delighted with what he saw when we returned we found our party at home increased by lady anna maria elliot who had been showing melrose to two friends miss drinkwaters lady ms wit and goodhumour made the evening go pleasantly off there were also two friends of charless by name paley a nephew of the archdeacon and ashworth they seem nice young men with modesty and goodbreeding i am glad as my mother used to say that his friends are so presentable moreover there came my old right trusty and wellbeloved friend john richardson so we were a full party lady anna maria returned in the evening francis scott also dined with us  august 30disposed of my party as i best might and worked at my review walked out at one and remained till near five mr scott of harden and david thomson ws dined with us walked with mr allan through haxel cleugh  august 31went on with my review but i have got sir henrys original pamphlet30 which is very cleverly written i find i cannot touch on his mode of transplantation at all in this article it involves many questions and some of importance so i will make

london at the close of 1826 were some which represented one of bonapartes attendants at st helena general gourgaud as having been guilty of gross unfairness giving the english government private information that the emperors complaints of illusage were utterly unfounded and yet then and afterwards aiding and assisting the delusion in france as to the harshness of sir hudson lowes conduct towards his captive sir walter when using these remarkable documents guessed that gourgaud might be inclined to fix a personal quarrel on himself and there now appeared in the newspapers a succession of hints that the general was seriously bent on this purpose he applied as colonel grogg would have done forty years before to the baronet w clerklife vol ix pp 1423  a short time previously gourgaud had had a quarrel with count ségur regarding the latters history of the russian campaign to which he wrote a reply in 1825 and then fought a duel with the author in support of his allegations in scotts case however it came to nothing beyond a paper war which sir walter declined to prolong leaving the question to be decided by the general public it is due to gourgaud to state that on two occasions he saved napoleons life though his subsequent information to the british government did not tend to increase his popularity with the bonapartists he died at paris in his sixtyninth year on july 25th 1852  29 life vol i pp 47 155156  30 the planters guide by sir henry seton steuart  31 in the north british review no 82 there is an extremely interesting sketch of this learned peerage lawyer he died in his 85th year in 1864 at his country seat kirklands in roxburghshire which he had purchased by sir walters advice  the following amusing narrative of what took place on tweedside when these two old friends were in their prime is given in mr richardsons own words  on a beautiful morning in september 1810 i started with sir walter from ashiestiel we began nearly under the ruins of elibank and in sight of the hanging tree i only had a rod but sir walter walked by my side now quoting izaak walton as fish me this stream by inches and now delighting me with a profusion of border stories after the capture of numerous fine trout i hooked something greater and unseen which powerfully ran out my line sir walter got into a state of great excitement exclaiming its a fish its a fish hold up your rod give him line and so on the rod which belonged to one of his boys broke and put us both into great alarm but i contrived by ascending the steep bank and holding down the rod still to give play to the reel till after a good quarter of an hours struggle a trout for so it turned out to be was conducted round a little peninsula sir walter jumped into the water seized him and threw him out on the grass tom purdie came up a little time after and was certainly rather discomposed at my success it will be some sea brute he observed but he became satisfied that it was a fine rivertrout and such as he afterwards admitted had not been killed in tweed for twenty years and when i moved down the water he went as sir walter afterwards observed and gave it a kick on the head exclaiming to be taen by the like o him frae lunnon     september   september 1colonel ferguson and colonel byers breakfasted the latter from india the nephew of the old antiquarian32 but i had not an opportunity to speak to him about the eastern information required for the chronicles besides my review is not finished though i wrought hard today sir william hamilton and his brother captain hamilton called also young davidoff i am somewhat sorry for my young friend his friends permit him to remain too long in britain to be happy in russia yet this is a prejudice of those who suppose that when the institutions and habits by which they are governed come to be known to strangers they must become exclusively attached to them this is not so the hottentot returns from civilisation to the wild manners of his kraal and wherefore should not a russian resume his despotic ideas when returned to his country  september 2this was a very warm day i remained at home chiefly engaged in arranging papers as i go away tomorrow it is lucky these starts happen from time to time as i should otherwise never get my table clear at five oclock the air became cooler and i sat out of doors and played with the children anne who had been at mertoun the day before brought up anne and elizabeth scott33 with her and francis has been with us since yesterday richardson left us  september 3went on with my arranging of papers till twelve when i took chaise and arrived at melville castle  found lord and lady m and the two young ladies dr hope my old schoolfellow james hope34 and his son made up our party which was very pleasant after they went away we had some private conversation about politics the whigs and tories of the cabinet are strangely divided the former desiring to have mr herries for chancellor of the exchequer the latter to have lord palmerston that calcraft may be secretary of war the king has declared firmly for herries on which lord goderich with tears entreated herries to remove the bone of contention by declining to accept the king called him a blubbering fool that the king does not like or trust the whigs is obvious from his passing over lord lansdowne a man who i should suppose is infinitely better fitted for a premier than goderich but he probably looks with no greater favour on the return of the high tories i fear he may wish to govern by the system of bascule or balancing the two parties a perilous game35 the advocate36 also dined with us   september 4 edinburghcame into town after breakfast and saw gibson whose account of affairs is comfortable also william clerk whom i found quite ready and willing to stand my friend if gourgaud should come my road he agrees with me that there is no reason why he should turn on me but that if he does reason or none it is best to stand buff to him it is clear to me that what is least forgiven in a man of any mark or likelihood is want of that article blackguardly called pluck all the fine qualities of genius cannot make amends for it we are told the genius of poets especially is irreconcilable with this species of grenadier accomplishment37 if so quel chien de génie saw lady compton i dine with her today and go to glasgow with her tomorrow  september 5dined with lady compton yesterday and talked over old stories until nine our têteàtête being a very agreeable one then hence to my good friend john gibsons and talked with him of sundries i had an odd dream last night it seemed to me that i was at a panorama when a vulgar little man behind me was making some very clever but impudent remarks on the picture and at the same time seemed desirous of information which no one would give him i turned round and saw a young fellow dressed like a common carter with a blue coat and red waistcoat and a whip tied across him he was young with a hatchetface which was turned to a brick colour by exposure to the weather sharp eyes and in manner and voice not unlike john leyden i was so much struck with his countenance and talents that i asked him about his situation and expressed a wish to mend it he followed me from the hopes which i excited and we had a dreadful walk among ruins and afterwards i found myself on horseback and in front of a roaring torrent i plunged in as i have formerly done in good sad earnest and got to the other side then i got home among my children and grandchildren and there also was my genius now this would defy daniel and the soothsayers to boot nor do i know why i should now put it down except that i have seldom seen a portrait in life which was more strongly marked on my memory than that mans perhaps my genius was mr dickinson papermaker who has undertaken that the london creditors who hold constables bills will be satisfied with 10s in the pound this would be turning a genius to purpose for 6s 8d is provided and they can have no difficulty about 3s 4d these debts for which i am legally responsible though no party to their contraction amount to £30000 odds now if they can be cleared for £15000 it is just so much gained this would be a giant step to freedom i see in my present comfortable quarters38 some of my own old furniture in castle st which gives me rather queer feelings i remember poor charlotte and i having so much thought about buying these things well they are in kind and friendly hands  september 6went with lady compton to glasgow and had as pleasant a journey as the kindness wit and accomplishment of my companion could make it lady c gives an admirable account of rome and the various strange characters she has met in foreign parts i was much taken with some stories out of a romance called manuscrit trouvé à saragosse by a certain count john polowsky potocki a pole it seems betwixt the style of cazotti count hamilton and le sage the count was a toiler after supernatural secrets an adept and understood the cabbala he put himself to death with many odd circumstances inferring derangement i am to get a sight of the book if it be possible at glasgow bucks head we met mrs maclean clephane and her two daughters and there was much joy after the dinner the ladies sung particularly anna jane who has more taste and talent of every kind than half the people going with great reputations on their backs  a very pleasant day was paid for by a restless night  september 7this day had calls from lord provost and mr rutherford william with invitations which i declined read in manuscript a very clever play comedy by miss aj clephane in the old style which was very happily imitated the plot was confusedtoo much taking and retaking of prisoners but the dialogue was excellent  took leave of these dear friends never perhaps to meet all together again for two of us are old went down by steam to colonel campbells blythswood house where i was most courteously received by him and his sisters we are kinsfolk and very old acquaintance his seat here is a fine one the house is both grand and comfortable  we walked to lawrence lockharts of inchinnan within a mile of blythswood house it is extremely nice and comfortable far beyond the style of a scotch clergyman but lawrence is wealthy i found john lockhart and sophia there returned from largs we all dined at colonel campbells on turtle and all manner of good things miss a and h walker were there the sleep at night made amends for the bucks head  september 8colonel campbell carried me to breakfast in glasgow and at ten i took chaise for corehouse where i found my old friend george cranstoun rejoiced to see me and glad when i told him what lord newton had determined in my affairs i should observe i saw the banks of the clyde above hamilton much denuded of its copse untimely cut and the stools ill cut and worse kept cranstoun and i walked before dinner i never saw the great fall of corehouse from this side before and i think it the best point perhaps at all events it is not that from which it is usually seen so lord corehouse has the sight and escapes the tourists dined with him his sister mrs cunningham and corehouse  i omitted to mention in yesterdays note that within blythswood plantation near to the bridge of inchinnan the unfortunate earl of argyle was taken in 1685 at a stone called argyles stone blythswood says the highland drovers break down his fences in order to pay a visit to the place the earl had passed the cart river and was taken on the renfrew side  september 9this is a superb place of corehouses cranstoun has as much feeling about improvement as other things like all new improvers he is at more expense than is necessary plants too thick and trenches where trenching is superfluous but this is the eagerness of a young artist besides the grand lion the fall of clyde he has more than one lions whelp a fall of a brook in a cleugh called mills gill must be superb in rainy weather the old castle of corehouse is much more castlelike on this than from the other side  left corehouse at eight in the morning and reached lanark by halfpast nine i was thus long in travelling three miles because the postilion chose to suppose i was bound for biggar and was two miles ere i discovered what he was doing i thought he aimed at crossing the clyde by some new bridge above bonnington breakfasted at lanark with the lockharts and reached abbotsford this evening by nine oclock  thus ends a pleasant expedition among the people i like most drawback only one it has cost me £15 including two gowns for sophia and anne and i have lost six days labour both may be soon made up  nbwe lunched dined videlicet with professor wilson at inverleithen and met james hogg39  september 10 abbotsfordgourgauds wrath has burst forth in a very distant clap of thunder in which he accuses me of combining with the ministry to slander his rag of a reputation he be dd for a fool to make his case worse by stirring i shall only revenge myself by publishing the whole extracts i made from the records of the colonial office in which he will find enough to make him bite his nails still i wonder he did not come over and try his manhood otherwise i would not have shunned him nor any frenchman who ever kissed bonapartes breech  september 11went to huntly burn and breakfasted with colonel ferguson who has promised to have some indian memoranda ready for me after breakfast went to choose the ground for a new plantation to be added next week to the end of janes wood came to dinner lord carnarvon and his son and daughter also lord francis leveson gower the translator of faust   september 12walk with lord francis when we return behold ye enter lady hampden and lady wedderburn in the days of george square jane and maria brown40 beauties and toasts there was much pleasure on my side and some i suppose on theirs and there was a riding and a running and a chattering and an asking and a showinga real scene of confusion yet mirth and good spirits our guests quit us next day  september 13fined a man for an assault at selkirk he pleaded guilty which made short work the beggarly appearance of the jury in the new system is very worthy of note one was a menial servant when i returned james ballantyne and mr cadell arrived they bring a good account of matters in general cadell explained to me a plan for securing the copyright of the novels which has a very good face it appears they are going off fast and if the glut of the market is once reduced by sales the property will be excellent and may be increased by notes james b brought his son robert rutherford also here and miss russells  september 14in the morning wrote my answer to gourgaud rather too keen perhaps but i owe him nothing and as for exciting his resentment i will neither seek nor avoid it  cadells views seem fair and he is open and explicit his brothers support him and he has no want of cash he sells two or three copies of bonaparte and one of the novels or two almost every day he must soon he says apply to london for copies read a refutation as it calls itself of napoleons history it is so very polite and accommodating that every third word is a concessionthe work of a man able to judge distinctly on specific facts but erroneous in his general results he will say the same of me perhaps ballantyne and cadell leave us enter miss sinclairs two in number also a translator and a little flemish woman his wifevery goodhumoured rather a little given to compliment name fauconpret they are to return at night in a gig as far as kelsoa bold undertaking  september 16the ladies went to church i god forgive me finished the chronicles41 with a good deal of assistance from colonel fergusons notes about indian affairs the patch is i suspect too glaring to be pleasing but the colonels sketches are capitally good i understand too there are one or two east indian novels which have lately appeared naboclish vogue la galère  september 17received from james b the proofs of my reply to general gourgaud with some cautious balaam from mine honest friend alarmed by a highland colonel who had described gourgaud as a mauvais garçon famous fencer marksman and so forth i wrote in answer which is true that i would hope all my friends would trust to my acting with proper caution and advice but that if i were capable in a moment of weakness of doing anything short of what my honour demanded i would die the death of a poisoned rat in hole out of mere sense of my own degradation god knows that though life is placid enough with me i do not feel anything to attach me to it so strongly as to occasion my avoiding any risk which duty to my character may demand from me  i set to work with the tales of a grandfather second volume and finished four pages  september 18wrote five pages of the tales walked from huntly burn having gone in the carriage smoked my cigar with lockhart after dinner and then whiled away the evening over one of miss austens novels there is a truth of painting in her writings which always delights me they do not it is true get above the middle classes of society but there she is inimitable  september 19wrote three pages but dawdled a good deal yet the tales get on although i feel bilious and vapourish i believe i must call it at such times my loneliness and the increasing inability to walk come dark over me but surely these mulligrubs belong to the mind more than the body  september 22captain and colonel ferguson the last returned from ireland dined here prayer of the minister of the cumbrays two miserable islands in the mouth of the clyde o lord bless and be gracious to the greater and the lesser cumbrays and in thy mercy do not forget the adjacent islands of great britain and ireland  september 23worked in the morning then drove over to huntly burn chiefly to get from the goodhumoured colonel the accurate spelling of certain hindu words which i have been using under his instructions by the way the sketches he gave me of indian manners are highly picturesque i have made up my journal which was three days in arrear also i wrought a little so that the second volume of grandfathers tales is nearly half finished  september 24worked in the morning as usual and sent off the proofs and copy something of the black dog still hanging about me but i will shake him off i generally affect good spirits in company of my family whether i am enjoying them or not it is too severe to sadden the harmless mirth of others by suffering your own causeless melancholy to be seen and this species of exertion is like virtue its own reward for the good spirits which are at first simulated become at length real42  september 25 edinburghgot into town by one oclock the purpose being to give my deposition before lord newton in a case betwixt me and constables creditors my oath seemed satisfactory but new reasons were alleged for additional discussion which is i trust to end this wearisome matter i dined with mr gibson and slept there jb dined with us and we had thoughts how to save our copyright by a bargain with cadell i hope it will turn to good as i could add notes to a future edition and give them some value  september 26 abbotsfordset off in mail coach and my horses met me at yair bridge i travelled with rather a pleasant man an agent i found on lord seafords43 west indian estates got home by twelve oclock and might have been here earlier if the tweed had not been too large for fording i must note down my cash lest it gets out of my head may the foul fa the gear and the blathrie ot44 and yet theres no doing either with it or without it  september 27the morning was damp dripping and unpleasant so i even made a work of necessity and set to the tales like a dragon i murdered mlellan of bomby at thrieve castle stabbed the black douglas in the town of stirling astonished king james before roxburgh and stifled the earl of mar in his bath in the canongate a wild world my masters this scotland of ours must have been no fear of want of interest no lassitude in those days for want of work      for treason d ye see     was to them a dish of tea         and murther bread and butter  we dined at gattonside with mr bainbridge who kindly presented me with six bottles of superexcellent jamaica rum and with a manuscript collection of poetry said to be swifts handwriting which it resembles it is i think poor stellas nothing very new in it  september 28another dropping and busy day i wrought hard at the historical tales which get on fast   september 29i went on with the little history which now ie vol ii doth appropinque an end received in the evening nos 37 to 41 of the roxburghe publications they are very curious and generally speaking well selected the following struck mean italian poem on the subject of floddenfield the legend of st robert of knaresborough two plays printed from ms by mr haslewood it does not appear that mr h fully appreciated the light which he was throwing on the theatrical history by this valuable communication it appears that the change of place or of scene as we term it was intimated in the following manner  in the middle of the stage was placed colchester and the sign of pigots taverncalled the tarltonintimated what part of the town was represented the name was painted above on one side of the stage was in like manner painted a town which the name announced to be maldon on the other side a rangers lodge the scene lay through the piece in one or other of these three places and the entrance of the characters determined where each scene lay if they came in from colchester then colchester was for the time the scene of action when that scene was shifted to maldon it was intimated by the approach of the actors from the side where it was painteda clumsy contrivance doubtless compared to changeable scenery yet sufficient to impress the audience with a sense of what was meant  september 30wet drizzling dismal day i finished odds and ends scarce stirring out of my room yet doing little to the purpose wrote to sir henry seton steuart about his queries concerning transplanted trees and to mr freeling concerning the roxburghe club books i have settled to print the manuscript concerning the murder of the two shaws by the master of sinclair i dallied with the precious time rather than used it read the two roxburghe plays they are by william percy a son of the eighth earl of northumberland worthless and very gross but abounding with matter concerning scenery and so forth highly interesting to the dramatic antiquary       note on the grenadier accomplishment mentioned in p 30       in a letter to the duke of buccleuch of may 1818 scott gives the      following amusing account of an incident in the life of the ettrick      shepherd       our poor friend hogg has had an affair of honour two      mornings ago about seven in the morning my servant announced      while i was shaving in my dressingroom that mr hogg wished      earnestly to speak with me he was ushered in and i cannot      describe the halfstartled halfhumorous air with which he said      scratching his head most vehemently odd scott heres twae      foks come frae glasgow to provoke mey to fecht a duel a duel      answered i in great astonishment and what do you intend to do      odd i just locket them up in my room and sent the lassie for twae      o the police and just gied the men ower to their chairge and i      thocht i wad come and ask you what i should do he had already      settled for himself the question whether he was to fight or not      and all that he had to do was to go to the police office and tell      the charge he had to bring against the two glasgow gentlemen      the glaswegians were greatly too many for him in court they      returned in all triumph and glory and hogg took the wings of the      morning and fled to his cottage at altrive not deeming himself      altogether safe in the streets of edinburgh now although i do not      hold valour to be an essential article in the composition of a man      like hogg yet i heartily wish he could have prevailed on himself      to swagger a little but considering his failure in the field      and the sheriff office i am afraid we must apply to hogg the      apology which is made for waller by his biographer let us not      condemn him with untempered severity because he was not such a      prodigy as the world has seldom seenbecause his character      included not the poet the orator and the hero  footnotes  32 james byers 17331817  33 anne scott of harden afterwards wife of lord jerviswoode

beautiful traits in his character readers of mr lockharts life do not require to be reminded of the active part he took in promoting the welfare of the ettrick shepherd on many occasions from the outset of their acquaintance in 1801 until the end of his life  hogg was a strange compound of boisterous roughness and refinement in expression and these odd contrasts surprised strangers such as moore and ticknor the former was shocked and the latter said his conversation was a perpetual contradiction to the exquisite delicacy of kilmeny  the critics of the day headed by professor wilson declared he was burnss rival as a songwriter and his superior in anything relating to external nature indeed they wrote of him as unsurpassed by poet or painter in his fairy tales of ancient time dubbing him poet laureate to the queen of elfland and yet his unrefined manner tempted these friends to speak of him familiarly as the greatest hog in all apollos herd or the boar of the forest etc

the table i am to set off tomorrow for ravensworth castle to meet the duke of wellington45 a great let off i suppose yet i would almost rather stay and see two days more of lockhart and my daughter who will be off before my return perhaps but there is no end to perhaps we must cut the rope and let the vessel drive down the tide of destiny  october 2set out in the morning at seven and reached kelso by a little past ten with my own horses then took the wellington coach to carry me to wellingtonsmart that nobody inside but an old lady who proved a toywoman in edinburgh her head furnished with as substantial ware as her shop but a good soul ise warrant her heard all her debates with her landlord about a new door to the cellar etc etc propriety of paying rent on the 15th or 25th of may landlords and tenants have different opinions on that subject danger of dirty sheets in inns we dined at wooler and i found out dr douglas on the outside son of my old acquaintance dr james douglas of kelso this made us even lighter in mind till we came to whittingham thence to newcastle where an obstreperous horse retarded us for an hour at least to the great alarm of my friend the toywoman nbshe would have made a good featherbed if the carriage had happened to fall and her undermost the heavy roads had retarded us near an hour more so that i hesitated to go to ravensworth so late but my good womans tales of dirty sheets and certain recollections of a newcastle inn induced me to go on when i arrived the family had just retired lord ravensworth and mr liddell came down however and really received me as kindly as possible  october 3rose about eight or later my morals begin to be corrupted by travelling and fine company went to durham with lord ravensworth betwixt one and two found the gentlemen of durham county and town assembled to receive the duke of wellington i saw several old friends and with difficulty suited names to faces and faces to names there was headlam dr gilly and his wife and a world of acquaintance besides sir thomas lawrence too with lord londonderry i asked him to come on with me but he could not he is from habit of coaxing his subjects i suppose a little too fairspoken otherwise very pleasant the duke arrived very late there were bells and cannon and drums trumpets and banners besides a fine troop of yeomanry the address was well expressed and as well answered by the duke the enthusiasm of the ladies and the gentry was greatthe common people were lukewarm46 the duke has lost popularity in accepting political power he will be more useful to his country it may be than ever but will scarce be so gracious in the peoples eyes and he will not care a curse for what outward show he has lost but i must not talk of curses for we are going to take our dinner with the bishop of durham47 a man of amiable and courteous manners who becomes his station well but has traces of bad health on his countenance  we dined about one hundred and forty or fifty men a distinguished company for rank and property marshal beresford and sir john48 amongst others marquis of lothian lord duncombe marquis londonderry and i know not who besides      lords and dukes and noble princes     all the pride and flower of spain  we dined in the rude old baronial hall impressive from its antiquity and fortunately free from the plaster of former improvement as i trust it will from the gingerbread taste of modern gothicisers the bright moon streaming in through the old gothic windows made a light which contrasted strangely with the artificial lights within spears banners and armour were intermixed with the pictures of old and the whole had a singular mixture of baronial pomp with the graver and more chastened dignity of prelacy the conduct of our reverend entertainer suited the character remarkably well amid the welcome of a count palatine he did not for an instant forget the gravity of the church dignitary all his toasts were gracefully given and his little speeches well made and the more affecting that the failing voice sometimes reminded us that our aged host laboured under the infirmities of advanced life to me personally the bishop was very civil and paid me his public compliments by proposing my health in the most gratifying manner49  the bishops lady received a sort of drawingroom after we rose from table at which a great many ladies attended i ought not to forget that the singers of the choir attended at dinner and sung the anthem non nobis domine as they said who understood them very welland as i think who did not understand the music with an unusual degree of spirit and interest it is odd how this can be distinguished from the notes of fellows who use their throats with as little feeling of the notes they utter as if they were composed of the same metal as their buglehorns  after the drawingroom we went to the assemblyrooms which were crowded with company i saw some very pretty girls dancing merrily that oldfashioned thing called a countrydance which old england has now thrown aside as she would do her creed if there were some foreign frippery offered instead we got away after midnight a large party and reached ravensworth castleduke of wellington lord londonderry and about twenty besidesabout halfpast one soda water and to bed by two  october 4slept till nigh tenfatigued by our toils of yesterday and the unwonted late hours still too early for this castle of indolence for i found few of last nights party yet appearing i had an opportunity of some talk with the duke he does not consider foys book50 as written by himself but as a thing got up perhaps from notes says he knew foy very well in spain mentioned that he was like other french officers very desirous of seeing the english papers through which alone they could collect any idea of what was going on without their own cantonments for napoleon permitted no communication of that kind with france the duke growing tired of this at length told baron tripp whose services he chiefly used in communication with the outposts that he was not to give them the newspapers what reason shall i allege for withholding them said baron tripp none replied the duke let them allege some reason why they want them foy was not at a loss to assign a reason he said he had considerable sums of money in the english funds and wanted to see how stocks fell and rose the excuse did not however go down51 i remember baron tripp a dutch nobleman and a dandy of the first water and yet with an energy in his dandyism which made it respectable he drove a gig as far as dunrobin castle and back again without a whip he looked after his own horse for he had no servant and after all his little establishment of clothes and necessaries with all the accuracy of a petitmaître he was one of the bestdressed men and his horse was in equally fine condition as if he had had a dozen of grooms i met him at lord somervilles and liked him much but there was something exaggerated as appeared from the conclusion of his life baron tripp shot himself in italy for no assignable cause  what is called great society of which i have seen a good deal in my day is now amusing to me because from age and indifference i have lost the habit of considering myself as a part of it and have only the feelings of looking on as a spectator of the scene who can neither play his part well nor ill instead of being one of the dramatis personæ and careless what is thought of myself i have full time to attend to the motions of others  our party went today to sunderland where the duke was brilliantly received by an immense population chiefly of seamen the difficulty of getting into the rooms was dreadful for we chanced to march in the rear of an immense gibraltar gun etc all composed of glass which is here manufactured in great quantities the disturbance created by this thing which by the way i never saw afterwards occasioned an ebbing and flowing of the crowd which nearly took me off my legs i have seen the day i would have minded it little the entertainment was handsome about two hundred dined and appeared most hearty in the cause which had convened themsome indeed so much so that finding themselves so far on the way to perfect happiness they een  after the dinnerparty broke up there was a ball numerously attended where there was a prodigious anxiety discovered for shaking of hands the duke had enough of it and i came in for my share for though as jackal to the lion i got some part in whatever was going we got home about halfpast two in the morning sufficiently tired the duke went to seaham a house of lord londonderrys after all this sunderland trip might have been spared  october 5a quiet day at ravensworth castle giggling and making giggle among the kind and frankhearted young people ravensworth castle is chiefly modern excepting always two towers of great antiquity lord ravensworth manages his woods admirably well and with good taste his castle is but halfbuilt elections52 have come between in the evening plenty of fine music with heart as well as voice and instrument much of the music was the spontaneous effusions of mrs arkwright who had set hohenlinden and other pieces of poetry her music was of a highlygifted character she was the daughter of stephen kemble the genius she must have inherited from her mother who was a capital actress the miss liddells and mrs barrington sang the the campbells are coming in a tone that might have waked the dead  october 6left ravensworth this morning and travelled as far as whittingham with marquis of lothian arrived at alnwick to dinner where i was very kindly received the duke is a handsome man53 who will be corpulent if he does not continue to take hard exercise the duchess very pretty and lively but her liveliness is of that kind which shows at once it is connected with thorough principle and is not liable to be influenced by fashionable caprice the habits of the family are early and regular i conceive they may be termed formal and oldfashioned by such visitors as claim to be the pink of the mode the castle is a fine old pile with various courts and towers and the entrance is magnificent it wants however the splendid feature of a keep the inside fitting up is an attempt at gothic but the taste is meagre and poor and done over with too much gilding it was done half a century ago when this kind of taste was illunderstood i found here the bishop of gloucester etc etc  october 7this morning went to church and heard an excellent sermon from the bishop of gloucester54 he has great dignity of manner and his accent and delivery were forcible drove out with the duke in a phaeton and saw part of the park which is a fine one lying along the alne but it has been illplanted it was laid out by the celebrated brown55 who substituted clumps of birch and scottish firs for the beautiful oaks and copse which grows nowhere so freely as in northumberland to complete this the late duke did not thin so the wood is in poor state all that the duke cuts down is so much waste for the people will not buy it where coals are so cheap had they been oakwood the bark would have fetched its value had they been grown oaks the seaports would have found a market had they been larch the country demands for ruder purposes would have been unanswerable the duke does the best he can to retrieve his woods but seems to despond more than a young man ought to do it is refreshing to see a man in his situation give so much of his time and thoughts to the improvement of his estates and the welfare of the people the duke tells me his people in keeldar were all quite wild the first time his father went up to shoot there the women had no other dress than a bedgown and petticoat the men were savage and could hardly be brought to rise from the heath either from sullenness or fear they sung a wild tune the burden of which was ourina ourina ourina the females sung the men danced round and at a certain part of the tune they drew their dirks which they always wore  we came by the remains of the old carmelite monastery of hulne which is a very fine object in the park it was finished by de vesci the gateway of alnwick abbey also a fine specimen is standing about a mile distant the trees are much finer on the left side of the alne where they have been let alone by the capabilityvillain visited the enceinte of the castle and passed into the dungeon there is also an armoury but damp and the arms in indifferent order one odd petardlooking thing struck memem to consult grose i had the honour to sit in hotspurs seat and to see the bloody gap where the external wall must have been breached the duchess gave me a book of etchings of the antiquities of alnwick and warkworth from her own drawings56 i had half a mind to stay to see warkworth but anne is alone we had prayers in the evening read by the archdeacon57  the marquis of lothian on saturday last told me a remarkable thing which he had from good authority just before bonapartes return from elba there was much disunion at the congress of vienna russia and prussia conscious of their own merits made great demands to which austria france and britain were not disposed to accede this went so far that war became probable and the very prussian army which was so useful at waterloo was held in readiness to attack the english on the other hand england austria and france entered into a private agreement to resist beyond a certain extent prussias demands of a barrier on the rhine etc and what is most singular of all it was from bonaparte that the emperor alexander first heard of this triple alliance58 but the circumstance of finding napoleon interesting himself so far in the affairs of europe alarmed the emperor more than the news he sent him on the same authority gneisenau and most of blüchers personal suite remained behind a house at the battle of ligny and sent out an officer from time to time but did not remain even in sight of the battle till blücher put himself at the head of the cavalry with the zeal of an old hussar  october 8left alnwick where i have experienced a very kind reception and took coach at whittingham at eleven oclock i find there is a new road to be made between alnwick and wooler which will make the communication much easier and avoid remside moor  saw some fine young plantations about whittingham suffering from neglect which is not the case under the dukes own eye he has made two neat cottages at percys cross to preserve that ancient monument of the fatal battle of hedgeley moor the stones marking the adjacent spot called percys leap are thirtythree feet asunder to show the uncertainty of human testimony i measured the distance many years since it is true and would have said and almost sworn that it was but eighteen feet dined at wooler and reached home about seven oclock having left alnwick at halfpast nine so it would be easy to go there to dinner from abbotsford starting at six in the morning or seven would do very well  october 9 abbotsfordno proofs here which i think odd of jas b but i am not sorry to have a day to write letters and besides i have a box of books to arrange it is a bad mizzling day and might have been a good day for work yet it is not quite uselessly spent  october 10breakfasted at huntly burn with the merry knight sir adam ferguson when we returned we found a whole parcel of proofs which had been forgot yesterday at the tollso here ends play and begins work dr brewster and mr thornhill the latter gave me a box made of the real mulberrytree59 very kind of him  october 11being a base melancholy weeping day i een made the best of it and set in for work wrote ten leaves this day equivalent to forty pages but then the theme was so familiar being scottish history that my pen never rested it is more than a triple task  october 12sent off proofs and copy a full task of three pages at one anne drove me to huntly burn and i examined the earthen fence intended for the new planting and altered the line in some points this employed me till near four the time of my walking home being included  october 13wrote in the forenoon lord bessborough and mr and mrs ponsonby called to see the place his lady used to be civil to me in londonan accomplished and pleasing woman they only stayed an hour at dinner we had lord and lady bathurst and my friend lady georgianaalso marquis of lothian and lord castlereagh plenty of fine folks expected also the lord register and mrs dundas but they could not come lord bathurst told me that gourgaud had negotiated with the french government to the last moment of his leaving london and that he had been told so by the french ambassador lord b refused to see him because he understood he talked disrespectfully of napoleon  october 14i read prayers to the company of yesterday and we took a drive round by drygrange bridge lord b told me that the late king made it at one time a point of conscience to read every word of every act of parliament before giving his assent to it there was a mixture of principle and nonsense in this lord lothian left us i did a full task today which is much considering i was a good deal occupied  october 15my noble guests departed pleased i believe with their visit i have had to thank lord bathurst for former kindness i respect him too as one who being far from rich has on the late occasion preferred political consistency to a love of office and its emoluments he seems to expect no opposition of a formal kind this next session what is wonderful no young man of talents seems to spring up in the house of commons i wonder what comes of all the clever lads whom we see at college the fruit apparently does not ripen as formerly lord castlereagh remained with us i bestowed a little advice on him he is a warmhearted young fellow with some of the fashionable affectations of the age about him but with good feelings and an inclination to come forward  october 16with all this racketing the work advances fast the third volume of the tales is now half finished and will i think be a useful work some drizzling days have been of great use to its progress this visiting has made some dawdling but not much perhaps not more than there ought to be for such a task  i walked from huntly burn up the little glen which was in all the melancholy beauty of autumn the little brook brawling and bickering in fine style over its falls and currents  october 17drove down to mertoun and brought up elizabeth scott to be our guest for some days or so various chance guests arrived one of the most welcome was captain mackenzie of the celtic society and the 72d regiment a picture of a highlander in his gigantic person and innocent and generous disposition poor fellow he is going to retreat to brittany to make his halfpay support a wife and family i did not dare to ask how many god send i may have the means of serving him  he told me a maclean story which was new to me at the battle of sheriffmuir that clan was commanded by a chief called hector in the action as the chief rushed forward he was frequently in situations of peril his fosterfather followed him with seven sons whom he reserved as a bodyguard whom he threw forward into the battle as he saw his chief pressed the signal he gave was another for hector the youths replied death for hector and were all successively killed these words make the sign and countersign at this day of the clan gillian60  young shortreed dined with us and the two fergusons sir adam and the colonel we had a pleasant evening  october 19wrought out my task and betteras i have done for these several days past lady anna maria elliot arrived unexpectedly to dinner and though she had a headache brought her usual wit and goodhumour to enliven us  october 20the day being basely muggy i had no walk which i was rather desirous to secure i wrought however and twothirds of the last volume of tales of my grandfather are finished i received a large packet of proofs etc which for some reason had been delayed we had two of dr brewsters boys to dinnerfine children they are spirited promising and very wellbehaved  october 21wrought till one oclock then walked out for two hours though with little comfort the bushes being loaded with rain but exercise is very necessary to me and i have no mind to die of my armchair a letter from skene acquainting me that the censors of the french press have prohibited the insertion of my answer to the man gourgaud this is their freedom of the press the fact is there is an awkward composition between the government and the people of france that the latter will endure the former so long as they will allow them to lull themselves asleep with recollections of their past glory and neither the one nor the other sees that truth and honesty and freedom of discussion are the best policy he knows though there is an answer and that is all i care about  october 22another vile damp drizzling day i do not know any morning in my life so fit for work on which i nevertheless while desirous of employing it to purpose make less progress a hangdog drowsy feeling wrought against me and i was obliged to lay down the pen and indulge myself in a drumly sleep  the haigs of bemerside captain hamilton mr bainbridge and daughter with young nicol milne and the fergusons dined here miss haig sings italian music better than any person i ever heard out of the operahouse but i am neither a judge nor admirer of the science i do not know exactly what is aimed at and therefore cannot tell what is attained had a letter from colin mackenzie who has proposed himself for the little situation in the register house i have written him begging him to use the best interest in his own behalf and never mind me  october 23another sullen rainy day hazy weather mr noah as punch says in the puppetshow61 i worked slow however and untowardly and fell one leaf short of my task  went to selkirk and dined with the forest club for the first time i have been there this season it was the collarday but being extremely rainy i did not go to see them course nbof all things the greatest bore is to hear a dull and bashful man sing a facetious song  october 24vilely low in spirits i have written a page and a half and doubt whether i can write more today a thick throbbing at my heart and fancies thronging on me a disposition to sleep or to think on things melancholy and horrible while i wake strange that ones nerves should thus master them for nervous the case is as i know too well i am beginning to tire of my journal and no wonder faith if i have only such trash as this to record but the best is a little exertion or a change of the current of thought relieves me  god who subjects us to these strange maladies whether of mind or body i cannot say has placed the power within our own reach and we should be grateful i wrestled myself so far out of the slough of despond as to take a good long walk and my mind is restored to its elasticity i did not attempt to work especially as we were going down to mertoun and set off at five oclock  october 25we arrived at mertoun yesterday and heard with some surprise that george had gone up in an air balloon and ascended two miles and a half above this sublunary earth i should like to have an account of his sensations but his letters said nothing serious about them honest george i certainly did not suspect him of being so flighty i visited the new plantations on the riverside with mrs scott i wish her lord and master had some of her taste for planting when i came home i walked through the rhymers glen and i thought how the little fall would look if it were heightened when i came home a surprise amounting nearly to a shock reached me in another letter from ljs62 methinks this explains the gloom which hung about me yesterday i own that the recurrence to these matters seems like a summons from the grave it fascinates me i ought perhaps to have stopped it at once but i have not nerve to do so alas alasbut why alas humana perpessi sumus  october 26sent off copy to ballantyne drove over to huntly burn at breakfast and walked up to the dike they are building for the new plantation returned home the fergusons dined and we had the kirn supper63 i never saw a set of finer lads and lasses and blithely did they ply their heels till five in the morning it did me good to see them poor things  october 27this morning went again to huntly burn to breakfast there picked up sir adam and the colonel and drove down to old melrose to see the hounds cast off upon the gateheugh the high rocky amphitheatre which encloses the peninsula of old melrose the tweed pouring its dark and powerful current between them the galloping of the riders and hallooing of the huntsmen the cry of the hounds and the sight of sly reynard stealing away through the brakes waked something of the old spirit within me      even in our ashes glow their wonted fires  on return home i had despatches of consequence john gibson writes that lord newton has decided most of the grand questions in our favour good that rev mr turner writes that he is desirous by lord londonderrys consent to place in my hands a quantity of original papers concerning the public services of the late lord londonderry with a view to drawing up a memoir of his life now this task they desire to transfer to me it is highly complimentary and there is this of temptation in it that i should be able to do justice to that illrequited statesman in those material points which demand the eternal gratitude of his country but then for me to take this matter up would lead me too much into the hackneyed politics of the house of commons which odi et arceo besides i would have to study the irish question and i detest study itemi might arrive at conclusions different from those of my lord of londonderry and i have a taste for expressing that which i think fourthly i think it is sinking myself into a party writer moreover i should not know what to say to the disputes with canning and to conclude i think my lord londonderry if he desired such a thing at my hands ought to have written to me for all which reasons good bad and indifferent i will write declining the undertaking  october 28wrote several letters and one to mr turner declining the task of lord castlereaghs memoirs64 with due acknowledgments had his public and european politics alone been concerned i would have tried the task with pleasure i wrote out my task and something more corrected proofs and made a handsome remittance of copy to the press  october 31just as i was merrily cutting away among my trees arrives mr gibson with a melancholy look and indeed the news he brought was shocking enough it seems mr abud the same jew broker who formerly was disposed to disturb me in london has given the most positive orders to take out diligence against me for his debt of £1500 this breaks all the measures we had resolved on and prevents the dividend from taking place by which many poor persons will be great sufferers for me the alternative will be more painful to my feelings than prejudicial to my interest to take out a sequestration and allow the persons to take what they can get will be the inevitable consequence this will cut short my labour by several years which i might spend and spend in vain in labouring to meet their demands no doubt they may in the interim sell the liferent of this place with the books and furniture but perhaps it may be possible to achieve some composition which may save these articles as i would make many sacrifices for that purpose gibson strongly advises taking a sequestration at all events but if the creditors choose to let mr abud have his pound of flesh out of the first cut my mind will not be satisfied with the plan of deranging for the pleasure of disappointing him a plan of payment to which all the others had consented we will know more on saturday and not sooner i went to bowhill with sir adam ferguson to dinner and

62 on the 13th of october sir walter had received a letter from one who had in former happy days been no stranger and on turning to the signature he found to his astonishment that it was from lady jane stuart with whom he had had no communication since the memorable visit he had made to invermay in the autumn of 1796 the letter was simply a formal request on behalf of a friend for permission to print some ballads in scotts handwriting which were in an album that had apparently belonged to her daughter yet it stirred his nature to its depths the substance of his reply may be gathered from the second letter which he had just read before making this sad entry in his journallady jane tells him that she would convey to him the manuscript book      as a secret and sacred treasure could i but know that you     would take it as i give it without a drawback or misconstruction of     my intentions  and she adds      were i to lay open my heart of which you know little indeed you     would

of londonderry 3 vols 8vo edinburgh 1861     november   november 1i waked in the night and lay two hours in feverish meditation this is a tribute to natural feeling but the air of a fine frosty morning gave me some elasticity of spirit it is strange that about a week ago i was more dispirited for nothing at all than i am now for perplexities which set at defiance my conjectures concerning their issue i suppose that i the chronicler of the canongate will have to take up my residence in the sanctuary65 for a week or so unless i prefer the more airy residence of the calton jail or a trip to the isle of man these furnish a pleasing choice of expedients it is to no purpose being angry at ehud or ahab or whatever name he delights in he is seeking his own and thinks by these harsh measures to render his road to it more speedy and now i will trouble myself no more about the matter than i can possibly help which will be quite enough after all perhaps something may turn up better for me than i now look for sir adam ferguson left bowhill this morning for dumfriesshire i returned to abbotsford to anne and told her this unpleasant news she stood it remarkably well poor body  november 2i was a little bilious tonightno wonder had sundry letters without any power of giving my mind to answer themone about gourgaud with his nonsense i shall not trouble my head more on that score well it is a hard knock on the elbow i knew i had a life of labour before me but i was resolved to work steadily now they have treated me like a recusant turnspit and put in a redhot cinder into the wheel alongst with me but of what use is philosophyand i have always pretended to a little of a practical characterif it cannot teach us to do or suffer the day is glorious yet i have little will to enjoy it but sit here ruminating upon the difference and comparative merits of the isle of man and of the abbey small choice betwixt them were a twelvemonth over i should perhaps smile at what makes me now very serious  smileno that can never be my present feelings cannot be recollected with cheerfulness but i may drop a tear of gratitude i have finished my tales66 and have now nothing literary in hand it would be an evil time to begin anything  november 3slept ill and lay one hour longer than usual in the morning i gained an hours quiet by it that is much i feel a little shaken at the result of todays post bad it must be whatsoever be the alternative i am not able to go out my poor workers wonder that i pass them without a word i can imagine no alternative but either retreat to the sanctuary or to the isle of man both shocking enough but in edinburgh i am always near the scene of action free from uncertainty and near my poor daughter so i think i will prefer it and thus i rest in unrest but i will not let this unman me our hope heavenly and earthly is poorly anchored if the cable parts upon the strain i believe in god who can change evil into good and i am confident that what befalls us is always ultimately for the best i have a letter from mr gibson purporting the opinion of the trustees and committee of creditors that i should come to town and interesting themselves warmly in the matter they have intimated that they will pay mr abud a composition of six shillings per pound on his debt this is a handsome offer but i understand he is determined to have his pound of flesh if i can prevent it he shall not take a shilling by his hardhearted conduct  november 4put my papers in some order and prepared for my journey it is in the style of the emperors of abyssinia who proclaimcut down the kantuffa in the four quarters of the worldfor i know not where i am going yet were it not for poor annes doleful looks i would feel firm as a piece of granite even the poor dogs seem to fawn on me with anxious meaning as if there were something going on they could not comprehend they probably notice the packing of the clothes and other symptoms of a journey  set off at twelve firmly resolved in body and in mind dined at fushie bridge ah good mrs wilson you know not you are like to lose an old customer67  but when i arrived in edinburgh at my faithful friend mr gibsons lo the scene had again changed and a new hare is started68  the trustees were clearly of opinion that the matter should be probed to the very bottom so cadell sets off tomorrow in quest of robinson whose haunts he knows there was much talk concerning what should be done how to protect my honours person and to postpone commencing a defence which must make ahab desperate before we can ascertain that the grounds are really tenable this much i think i can see that the trustees will rather pay the debt than break off the trust and go into a sequestration they are clearly right for themselves and i believe for me also whether it is in human possibility that i can clear off these obligations or not is very doubtful but i would rather have it written on my monument that i died at the desk than live under the recollection of having neglected it my conscience is free and happy and would be so if i were to be lodged in the calton jail were i shirking exertion i should lose heart under a sense of general contempt and so die like a poisoned rat in a hole  dined with gibson and john home his wife is a pretty ladylike woman slept there at night  november 6i took possession of no 6 shandwick place mrs jobsons house mr cadell had taken it for me terms £100 for four monthscheap enough as it is a capital house i offered £5 for immediate entrance as i do not like to fly back to abbotsford so here we are established ie john nicolson69 and i with good fires and all snug     i waited on ljs an affecting meeting70  sir william forbes came in before dinner to me highspirited noble fellow as ever and true to his friend agrees with my feelings to a comma he thinks cadells account must turn up trumps and is for going the vole71  november 7began to settle myself this morning after the hurry of mind and even of body which i have lately undergone commenced a reviewthat is an essay on ornamental gardening for the quarterly but i stuck fast for want of books as i did not wish to leave the mind leisure to recoil on itself i immediately began the second series of the chronicles of canongate the first having been well approved i went to make another visit and fairly softened myself like an old fool with recalling old stories till i was fit for nothing but shedding tears and repeating verses for the whole night this is sad work the very grave gives up its dead and time rolls back thirty years to add to my perplexities i dont care i begin to grow overhardened and like a stag turning at bay my naturally good temper grows fierce and dangerous yet what a romance to tell and told i fear it will one day be and then my three years of dreaming and my two years of wakening will be chronicled doubtless but the dead will feel no pain  november 8domum mansi lanam feci i may borrow the old sepulchral motto of the roman matron i stayed at home and began the third volume of chronicles or rather the first volume of the second series72 this i pursued with little intermission from morning till night yet only finished nine pages like the machinery of a steamengine the imagination does not work freely when first set upon a new task  november 9finished my task after breakfast at least before twelve then went to college to hear this most amusing good matter of the essay read73 imprimis occurs a dispute whether the magistrates as patrons of the university should march in procession before the royal visitors and it was proposed on our side that the provost who is undoubtedly the first man in his own city should go in attendance on the principal with the chairman of the commission on the principals right hand and the whole commission following taking pas of the other magistrates as well as of the senatus academicusor whether we had not better waive all question of precedence and let the three bodies find their way separately as they best could this last method was just adopted when we learned that the question was not in what order of procession we should reach the place of exhibition but whether we were to get there at all which was presently after reported as an impossibility the lads of the college had so effectually taken possession of the classroom where the essay was to be read that neither learning or law neither magistrates nor magisters neither visitors nor visited could make way to the scene of action so we grandees were obliged to adjourn the sederunt till saturday the 17thand so ended the collieshangie  november 10wrote out my task and little more at twelve oclock i went to poor lady js to talk over old stories i am not clear that it is right or healthful indulgence to be ripping up old sorrows but it seems to give her deepseated sorrow words and that is a mental bloodletting to me these things are now matter of calm and solemn recollection never to be forgotten yet scarce to be remembered with pain  we go out to saint catherines74 today i am glad of it for i would not have these recollections haunt me and society will put them out of my head  november 11sir william rae read us prayers sauntered about the doors and talked of old cavalry stories then drove to melville and saw the lord and lady and family i think i never saw anything more beautiful than the ridge of carnethy pentland against a clear frosty sky with its peaks and varied slopes the hills glowed like purple amethysts the sky glowed topaz and vermilion colours i never saw a finer screen than pentland considering that it is neither rocky nor highly elevated  november 12i cannot say i lost a minutes sleep on account of what the day might bring forth though it was that on which we must settle with abud in his jewish demand or stand to the consequences i breakfasted with an excellent appetite laughed in real genuine easy fun and went to edinburgh resolved to do what should best become me when i came home i found walter poor fellow who had come down on the spur having heard from john lockhart how things stand gibson having taken out a suspension makes us all safe for the present so we dined merrily he has good hopes of his majesty and i must support his interest as well as i can wrote letters to lady shelley john l and one or two chance correspondents one was singular a gentleman writing himself james macturk tells me his friends have identified him with captain macturk of st ronans well and finding himself much inconvenienced by this identification he proposes i should apply to the king to forward his restoration and advance in the service he writes himself late lieutenant 4th dragoon guards as an atonement for having occasioned him though unintentionally no doubt so great an injury this is one road to promotion to be sure lieutenant macturk is i suppose tolerably mad  we dined together anne walter and i and were happy at our reunion when as i was despatching my packet to london      in started to heeze up our howp75  john gibson radiant with goodnatured joy he had another letter from cadell enclosing one from robinson in which the latter pledges himself to make the most explicit affidavit  on these two last days i have written only three pages but not from inaptitude or incapacity to labour it is odd enoughi think it difficult to place me in a situation of danger or disagreeable circumstances purely personal which would shake my powers of mind yet they sink under mere lowness of spirits as this journal bears evidence in too many passages  november 13wrote a little in the morning but not above a page went to the court about one returned and made several visits with anne and walter cadell came glorious with the success of his expedition but a little allayed by the prospect of competition for the copyrights on which he and i have our eyes as joint purchasers we must have them if possible for i can give new value to an edition corrected with notes nous verrons captain musgrave of the house of edenhall dined with us after dinner while we were over our whisky and water and cigars enter the merry knight misses kerr came to tea and we had fun and singing in the evening  november 14a little work in the morning but no gathering to my tackle went to court remained till nigh one then came through a pitiless shower dressed and went to the christening of a boy of john richardsons who was baptized henry cockburn read the gazette of the great battle of navarino in which we have thumped the turks very well but as to the justice of our interference i will only suppose some turkish plenipotentiary with an immense turban and long loose trousers comes to dictate to us the mode in which we should deal with our refractory liegemen the catholics of ireland we hesitate to admit his interference on which the moslem admiral runs into cork bay or bantry bay alongside of a british squadron and sends a boat to tow aside a fireship a vessel fires on the boat and sinks her is there an aggression on the part of those who fired first or of those whose manoeuvres occasioned the firing  dined at henry cockburns with the christening party  november 15wrote a little in the morning detained in court till two then returned home wet enough met with chambers and complimented him about his making a clever book of the 1745 for constables miscellany it is really a lively work and must have a good sale before dinner enter cadell and we anxiously renewed our plan for buying the copyrights on 19th december it is most essential that the whole of the waverley novels should be kept under our management as it is called i may then give them a new impulse by a preface and notes and if an edition of say 30 volumes were to be published monthly to the tune of 5000 which may really be expected if the shops were once cleared of the overglut it would bring in £10000 clear profit over all outlay and so pay any sum of copymoney that might be ventured i must urge these things to gibson for except these copyrights be saved our plans will go to nothing  walter and anne went to hear madame pasta sing after dinner i remained at home wrote to sir william knighton and sundry other letters of importance  november 16there was little to do in court today but ones time is squandered and his ideas broken strangely at three we had a select meeting of the gas directors to consider what line we were to take in the disastrous affairs of the company agreed to go to parliament a second time james gibson craig and i to go up as our solicitors so curiously does interest couple up individuals though i am sure i have no objection whatever to mr james gibsoncraig76  november 17returned home in early time from the court settled on the review of ornamental gardening for lockhart and wrote hard want several quotations thoughthat is the bore of being totally without books anne and i dined quietly together and i wrote after teaan industrious day  november 18this has been also a day of exertion i was interrupted for a moment by a visit from young davidoff with a present of a steel snuffbox tula work wrought and lined with gold having my arms on the top and on the sides various scenes from the environs and principal public buildings of st petersburga joli cadeauand i take it very kind of my young friend i had a letter from his uncle denis davidoff the black captain of the french retreat the russians are certainly losing ground and men in persia and will not easily get out of the scrape of having engaged an active enemy in a difficult and unhealthy country i am glad of it it is an overgrown power and to have them kept quiet at least is well for the rest of europe i concluded the eveningafter writing a double taskwith the trial of malcolm gillespie renowned as a most venturous excise officer but now like to lose his life for forgery a bold man in his vocation he seems to have been but the law seems to have got round to the wrong side of him on the present occasion77  november 19corrected the last proof of tales of my grandfather received cadell at breakfast and conversed fully on the subject of the chronicles and the application of the price of 2d series say £4000 to the purchase of the moiety of the copyrights now in the market and to be sold this day month if i have the command of a new edition and put it into an attractive shape with notes introductions and illustrations that no one save i myself can give i am confident it will bring home the whole purchasemoney with something over and lead to the disposal of a series of the subsequent volumes of the following works  st ronans well        3 vols redgauntlet             3   tales of crusaders      4

20wrought in the morning at the review which i fear will be lengthy called on hector as i came home from the court and found him better and keeping a highland heart i came home like a crow through the mist half dead with a rheumatic headache caused by the beastly northeast wind  what am i now when every breeze appals me78 i dozed for halfanhour in my chair for pain and stupidity i omitted to say yesterday that i went out to melville castle to inquire after my lord melville who had broke his collarbone by a fall from his horse in mounting he is recovering well but much bruised i came home with lord chiefcommissioner adam he told me a dictum of old sir gilbert elliot speaking of his uncles no chance of opulence he said is worth the risk of a competence it was not the thought of a great man but perhaps that of a wise one wrought at my review and despatched about half or better i should hope i incline to longer extracts in the next sheets  november 21wrought at the review at one oclock i attended the general meeting of the union scottish assurance company there was a debate arose whether the ordinary acting directors should or should not have a small sum amounting to about a crown a piece allotted to them each day of their regular attendance the proposal was rejected by many and upon grounds which sound very wellsuch as the shabbiness of men being influenced by a trifling consideration like this and the absurdity of the company volunteering a bounty to one set of men when there are others willing to act gratuitously and many gentlemen volunteered their own services though i cannot help suspecting that as in the case of ultroneous offers of service upon most occasions it was not likely to be acceptable the motion miscarried howeverimpoliticly rejected as i think the sound of five shillings sounds shabby but the fact is that it does in some sort reconcile the party to whom it is offered to leave his own house and business at an exact hour whereas in the common case one man comes too lateanother does not come at allthe attendance is given by different individuals upon different days so that no one acquires the due historical knowledge of the affairs of the company besides the directors by taking even this trifling sum of money render themselves the paid servants of the company and are bound to use a certain degree of diligence much greater than if they continued to serve as hitherto gratuitously the pay is like enlisting money which whether great or small subjects to engagements under the articles of war  a chinamerchant spokea picture of an orator with bandy legs squinting eyes and a voice like an ungreased cartwheela liberty boy i suppose the meeting was somewhat stormy but i preserved order by listening with patience to each in turn determined that they should weary out the patience of the meeting before i lost mine an orator is like a top let him alone and he must stop one time or anotherflog him and he may go on for ever  dined with directors of whom i only knew the manager sutherland mackenzie sir david milne and wauchope besides one or two old oil gas friends it went off well enough  november 22wrought in the morning then made arrangements for a dinner to celebrate the duke of buccleuch coming of agethat which was to have been held at melville castle being postponed owing to lord ms accident sent copy of second series of chronicles of canongate to ballantyne  november 23i bilked the court today and worked at the review i wish it may not be too long yet know not how to shorten it the post brought me a letter from the duke of buccleuch acquainting me with his grandmother the duchessdowagers death79 she was a woman of unbounded beneficence to and even beyond the extent of her princely fortune she had a masculine courage and great firmness in enduring affliction which pressed on her with continued and successive blows in her later years she was about eightyfour and nature was exhausted so life departed like the extinction of a lamp for lack of oil our dinner on monday is put off i am not superstitious but i wish this festival had not been twice delayed by such sinister accidentsfirst the injury sustained by lord melville and then this event spreading crape like the shroud of saladin over our little festival80 god avert bad omens  dined with archie swinton companysir alexander and lady keith mr and mrs anderson clanronald etc clanronald told us as an instance of highland credulity that a set of his kinsmen borradale and others believing that the fabulous water cow inhabited a small lake near his house resolved to drag the monster into day with this view they bivouacked by the side of the lake in which they placed by way of nightbait two small anchors such as belong to boats each baited with the carcase of a dog slain for the purpose they expected the water cow would gorge on this bait and were prepared to drag her ashore the next morning when to their confusion of face the baits were found untouched it is something too late in the day for setting baits for water cows81  november 24wrote at review in the morning i have made my revocation of the invitation for monday for myself it will give me time to work i could not get home today till two oclock and was quite tired and stupid so i did little but sleep or dose till dressingtime then went to sir david wedderburns where i met three beauties of my own day margaret brown maria brown and jane wedderburn now lady wedderburn lady hampden and mrs oliphant we met the pleasant irish family of meath the resemblance between the earl of meath and the duke of wellington is something remarkably strikingit is not only the profile but the mode of bearing the person and the person itself lady theodora brabazon the earls daughter and a beautiful young lady told me that in paris her father was often taken for lord wellington  november 25this forenoon finished the review and despatched it to lockhart before dinner will clerk tom thomson and young frank scott dined with me we had a pleasant day i have wrought pretty well today but i must      do a little more     and produce a little ore  november 26corrected proofsheets of chronicles and tales advised sheriff processes and was busy  dined with robert dundas of arniston lord register etc an agreeable evening  november 27corrected proofs in the morning and attended the court till one or two oclock mr hamilton being again ill i visited lady s on my return came home too fagged to do anything to purpose  anecdote from george bell in the days of charles ii or his brother flourished an old lady elphinstone so old that she reached the extraordinary period of 103 she was a keen whig so did not relish graham of clavers at last having a curiosity to see so aged a person he obtained or took permission to see her and asked her of the remarkable things she had seen indeed said she i think one of the most remarkable is that when i entered the world there was one knox deaving us a with his clavers and now that i am going out of it there is one clavers deaving us with his knocks  november 28corrected proofs and went to court returned about one and called on the lord chiefbaron dined with the duchess of bedford at the waterloo and renewed as i may say an old acquaintance which began while her grace was lady georgiana82 she has now a fine family two young ladies silent just now but they will find their tongues or they are not right gordons a very fine child alister who shouted sung and spoke gaelic with much spirit they are from a shootingplace in the highlands called invereshie in badenoch which the duke has taken to gratify the duchesss passion for the heather  november 29my course of composition is stopped foolishly enough i have sent four leaves to london with lockharts review i am very sorry for this blunder and here is another forgetting i had been engaged for a long time to lord gilliesa first family visit toothe devil tempted me to accept of the office of president of the antiquarian society and now they tell me people have come from the country to be present and so forth of which i may believe as much as i may but i must positively take care of this absurd custom of confounding invitations my conscience acquits me of doing so by malice prepense yet one incurs the suspicion at any rate it is uncivil and must be amended dined at lord c commissionersto meet the duchess and her party she can be extremely agreeable but i used to think her grace journalière she may have been cured of that fault or i may have turned less jealous of my dignity at all events let a pleasant hour go by unquestioned and do not let us break ordinary gems to pieces because they are not diamonds i forgot to say edwin landseer was in the duchesss train he is in my mind one of the most striking masters of the modern school his expression both in man and animals is capital he showed us many sketches of smugglers etc taken in the highlands all capital      some gaed there and some gaed here     and a the town was in a steer     and johnnie on his brocket mear       he raid to fetch the howdie  november 30another idle morning with letters however had the great pleasure of a letter from lord dudley83 acquainting me that he had received his majestys commands to put down the name of my son charles for the first vacancy that should occur in the foreign office and at the same time to acquaint me with his gracious intentions which were signified in language the most gratifying to me this makes me really feel light and happy and most grateful to the kind and gracious sovereign who has always shown i may say so much friendship towards me would to god the kings errand might lie in the cadgers gait that i might have some better way of showing my gratitude than merely by a letter of thanks or this private memorandum of my gratitude the lad is a good boy and clever somewhat indolent i fear yet with the capacity of exertion presuming his head is full enough of greek and latin he has now living languages to study so i will set him to work on french italian and german that like the classic cerberus he may speak a leash of languages at once dined with gillies very pleasant lord chiefcommissioner will clerk cranstoun and other old friends i saw in the evening the celebrated miss grahame stirling so remarkable for her power of personifying a scottish old lady unluckily she came late and i left early in the evening so i could not find out wherein her craft lay she looked like a sensible woman i had a conference with my trustees about the purchase in company with cadell of the copyrights of the novels to be exposed to sale on the 19th december and had the good luck to persuade them fully of the propriety of the project i alone can by notes and the like give these works a new value and in fact make a new edition the price is to be made good from the second series chronicles of canongate sold to cadell for £4000 and it may very well happen that we shall have little to pay as part of the copyrights will probably be declared mine by the arbiter and these i shall have without money and without price cadell is most anxious on the subject he thinks that two years hence £10000 may be made of a new edition  footnotes  65 holyrood remained an asylum for civil debtors until 1880 when by

goles after court i went with lord wriothesley russell84 to dalkeith house to see the pictures charles k sharpe alongst with us we satisfied ourselves that they have actually frames and that i think was all we could be sure of lord wriothesley who is a very pleasant young man wellinformed and with some turn for humour dined with us and mr davidoff met him the misses kerr also dined and spent the evening with us in that sort of society which i like best charles sharpe came in and we laughed over oysters and sherry      and a fig for your sultan and sophi  december 2laboured to make leeway and finished nearly seven pages to eke on to the end of the missing sheets when returned i have yoked charles to monsieur surenne an old soldier in napoleons italian army and i think a clever little fellow with good general ideas of etymology signor bugnie is a good italian teacher and for a german why i must look about it is not the least useful language of the leash  december 3a day of petty business which killed a holiday finished my tale of the mirror85 went with tom allan to see his building at lauriston where he has displayed good tastesupporting instead of tearing down or destroying the old chateau which once belonged to the famous mississippi law the additions are in very good taste and will make a most comfortable house mr burn architect would fain have had the old house pulled down which i wonder at in him86 though it would have been the practice of most of his brethren when i came up to town i was just in time for the bannatyne club where things are going on reasonably well i hope we may get out some good historical documents in the course of the winter dined at the royal society club at the society had some essays upon the specific weight of the ore of manganese which was caviare to the president and i think most of the members but it seemed extremely accurate and i have little doubt was intelligible to those who had the requisite key we supped at mr russells where the conversation was as gay as usual lieutcol ferguson was my guest at the dinner  december 4had the agreeable intelligence that lord newton had finally issued his decree in my favour for all the money in the bank amounting to £32000 this will make a dividend of six shillings in the pound which is presently to be paid a meeting of the creditors was held today at which they gave unanimous approbation of all that has been done and seemed struck by the exertions which had produced £22000 within so short a space they all separated well pleased so far so good heaven grant the talisman break not i sent copy to ballantyne this morning having got back the missing sheets from john lockhart last night i feel a little puzzled about the character and style of the next tale the world has had so much of chivalry well i will dine merrily and thank god and bid care rest till tomorrow how suddenly things are overcast and how suddenly the sun can break out again on the 31st october i was dreaming as little of such a thing as at present when behold there came tidings which threatened a total interruption of the amicable settlement of my affairs and menaced my own personal liberty in less than a month we are enabled to turn chase on my persecutors who seem in a fair way of losing their recourse upon us non nobis domine  december 5i did a good deal in the way of preparing my new tale and resolved to make something out of the story of harry wynd the north inch of perth would be no bad name and it may be possible to make a difference betwixt the old highlander and him of modern date the fellow that swam the tay and escaped would be a good ludicrous character but i have a mind to try him in the serious line of tragedy miss baillie has made the ethling87 a coward by temperament and a hero when touched by filial affection suppose a mans nerves supported by feelings of honour or say by the spur of jealousy supporting him against constitutional timidity to a certain point then suddenly giving wayi think something tragic might be produced james ballantynes criticism is too much moulded upon the general taste of novels to admit i fear this species of reasoning but what can one do i am hard up as far as imagination is concerned yet the world calls for novelty well ill try my brave coward or cowardly brave man valeat quantum being a teind day remained at home adjusting my ideas on this point until one oclock then walked as far as mr cadells finally went to dine at hawkhill with lord and lady binning party were lord chiefcommissioner lord chiefbaron solicitor john wilson lord corehouse the night was so dark and stormy that i was glad when we got upon the paved streets  december 6corrected proofs and went to court bad news of ahabs case i hope he wont beat us after all it would be mortifying to have them paid in full as they must be while better men must lie by spero meliora  i think that copy of beards judgments is the first book which i have voluntarily purchased for nearly two years so i am cured of one folly at least88  december 7being a blank day in the rolls i stayed at home and wrote four leavesnot very freely or happily i was not in the vein plague on it stayed at home the whole day there is one thing i believe peculiar to mei work that is meditate for the purpose of working best when i have a quasi engagement with some other book for example when i find myself doing ill or like to come to a standstill in writing i take up some slight book a novel or the like and usually have not read far ere my difficulties are removed and i am ready to write again there must be two currents of ideas going on in my mind at the same time89 or perhaps the slighter occupation serves like a womans wheel or stocking to ballast the mind as it were by preventing the thoughts from wandering and so give the deeper current the power to flow undisturbed i always laugh when i hear people say do one thing at once i have done a dozen things at once all my life dined with the family after dinner lockharts proofs came in and occupied me for the evening i wish i have not made that article too long and lockhart will not snip away  december 8went to court and stayed there a good while made some consultations in the advocates library not furiously to the purpose  court in the morning sent off lockharts proof which i hope will do him some good a precatory letter from gillies i must do molière for him i suppose but it is wonderful that knowing the situation i am in the poor fellow presses so hard sure i am pulling for life and it is hard to ask me to pull another mans oar as well as my own yet if i can give a little help      well get a blessing wi the lave     and never miss t90  went to john murrays where were sir john dalrymple and lady sir john cayley mr hope vere and lady elizabeth vere a sister of the marquis of tweeddale and a pleasant sensible woman some turn for antiquity too she showsand spoke a good deal of the pictures at yester henderland was there too mrs john murray made some very agreeable music  december 9i set hard to work and had a long day with my new tale i did about twelve leaves cadell came in and we talked upon the great project of buying in the copyrights he is disposed to finesse a little about it but i do not think it will do much good all the fine arguments will fly off and people just bid or not bid as the report of the trade may represent the speculation as a good or bad one i daresay they will reach £7000 but £8000 wont stop us and that for books overprinted so lately and to such an extent is a prodigious price  december 10i corrected proofs and forwarded copy went out for an hour to lady js home and dozed a little half stupefied with a cold in my headmade up this journal however settled i would go to abbotsford on the 24th from arniston before that time i trust the business of the copyrights will be finally settled if they can be had on anything like fair terms they will give the greatest chance i can see of extricating my affairs cadell seems to be quite confident in the advantage of making the purchase upon almost any terms and truly i am of his opinion if they get out of scotland it will not be all i can do that will enable me to write myself a free man during the space i have to remain in this world  i smoked a couple of cigars for the first time since i came from the country and as anne and charles went to the play i muddled away the evening over my sheriffcourt processes and despatched a hugeous parcel to will scott at selkirk it is always something off hand  december 11wrote a little and seemed to myself to get on i went also to court on return had a formal communication from ballantyne enclosing a letter from cadell of an unpleasant tenor it seems mr cadell is dissatisfied with the moderate success of the first series of chronicles91 and disapproves of about half the volume already written of the second series obviously rueing his engagement i have replied that i was not fool enough to suppose that my favour with the public could last for ever and was neither shocked nor alarmed to find that it had ceased now as cease it must one day soon it might he inconvenient for me in some respects but i would be quite contented to resign the bargain rather than that more loss should be incurred i saw i told them no other receipt than lying lea for a little while taking a fallowbreak to relieve my imagination which may be esteemed nearly cropped out i can make shift for myself amid this failure of prospects but i think both cadell and jb will be probable sufferers however they are very right to speak their mind and may be esteemed tolerably good representatives of the popular taste so i really think their censure may be a good reason for laying aside this work though i may preserve some part of it till another day  december 12reconsidered the probable downfall of my literary reputation i am so constitutionally indifferent to the censure or praise of the world that never having abandoned myself to the feelings of selfconceit which my great success was calculated to inspire i can look with the most unshaken firmness upon the event as far as my own feelings are concerned if there be any great advantage in literary reputation i have had it and i certainly do not care for losing it  they cannot say but what i had the crown it is unhappily inconvenient for my affairs to lay by my work just now and that is the only reason why i do not give up literary labour but at least i will not push the losing game of novelwriting i will take back the sheets now objected to but it cannot be expected that i am to write upon return i cannot but think that a little thought will open some plan of composition which may promise novelty at the least i suppose i shall hear from or see these gentlemen today if not i must send for them tomorrow how will this affect the plan of going shares with cadell in the novels of earlier and happier date verymuch i doubt seeing i cannot lay down the cash but surely the trustees may find some mode of providing this or else with cash to secure these copyrights at any rate i will gain a little time for thought and discussion  went to court at returning settled with chiefcommissioner that i should receive him on 26th december at abbotsford  after all may there not be in this failure to please some reliques of the very unfavourable matters in which i have been engaged of latethe threat of imprisonment the resolution to become insolvent i cannot feel that there is what i suffer by is the difficulty of not setting my foot upon such ground as i have trod before and thus instead of attaining novelty i lose spirit and nature on the other hand who would thank me for repented sheets here is a good joke enough lost to all who have not known the clerks table before the jurisdiction act  my two learned thebans are arrived and departed after a long consultation they deprecated a fallowbreak as ruin i set before them my own sense of the difficulties and risks in which i must be involved by perseverance and showed them i could occupy my own time as well for six months or a twelvemonth and let the public gather an appetite they replied and therein was some risk that the expectation would in that case be so much augmented that it would be impossible for any mortal to gratify it to this is to be added what they did not touch uponthe risk of being thrust aside altogether which is the case with the horses that neglect keeping the lead when once they have got it finally we resolved the present work should go on leaving out some parts of the introduction which they object to they are good specimens of the public taste in general and it is far best to indulge and yield to them unless i was very very certain that i was right and they wrong besides i am not afraid of their being hypercritical in the circumstances being both sensible men and not inclined to sacrifice chance of solid profit to the vagaries of critical taste so the word is as you were  december 13a letter from lockhart announcing that murray of albemarle street would willingly give me my own terms for a volume on the subject of planting and landscape gardening this will amuse me very much indeed another proposal invites me on the part of colburn to take charge of the garrick papers the papers are to be edited by colman and then it is proposed to me to write a life of garrick in quarto92 lockhart refused a thousand pounds which were offered and carte blanche was then sent but i will not budge my book and colmans would run each other down it is an attempt to get more from the public out of the subject than they will endure besides my name would be only useful in the way of puff for i really know nothing of the subject so i will refuse thats flat  having turned over my thoughts with some anxiety about the important subject of yesterday i think we have done for the best if i can rally this time as i did in the crusaders why there is the old trade open yet if not retirement will come gracefully after my failure i must get the return of the sales of the three or four last novels so as to judge what style of composition has best answered add to this giving up just now loses £4000 to the trustees which they would not understand whatever may be my nice authorial feelings and moreover it ensures the purchase of the copyrightsie almost ensures them  december 14summoned to pay arrears of our unhappy oil gas concern£140which i performed by draft on mr cadell this will pinch a little close but it is a debt of honour and must be paid the public will never bear a public man who shuns either to draw his purse or his sword when there is an open and honest demand on him  december 15worked in the morning on the sheets which are to be cancelled and on the tale of st valentines evea good title by the way had the usual quantum sufficit of the court which if it did not dissipate ones attention so much is rather an amusement than otherwise but the plague is to fix ones attention to the sticking point after it has been squandered about for two or three hours in such a way it keeps one however in the course and stream of actual life which is a great advantage to a literary man  i missed an appointment for which i am very sorry it was about our advocates library which is to be rebuilt during all my life we have mismanaged the large funds expended on the rooms of our library totally mistaking the objects for which a library is built and instead of taking a general and steady view of the subject patching up disconnected and illsized rooms totally unequal to answer the accommodation demanded and bestowing an absurd degree of ornament and finery upon the internal finishing all this should be reversed the new library should be calculated upon a plan which ought to suffice for all the nineteenth century at least and for that purpose should admit of being executed progressively then there should be no ornament other than that of strict architectural proportion and the rooms should be accessible one through another but divided with so many partitions as to give ample room for shelves these small rooms would also facilitate the purposes of study something of a lounging room would not be amiss which might serve for meetings of faculty occasionally i ought to take some interest in all this and i do so i will attend the next meeting of committee dined at baron humes and met general campbell of lochnell and his lady  december 16worked hard today and only took a half hours walk with hector macdonald colin mackenzie unwell his asthma seems rather to increase notwithstanding his foreign trip alas longseated complaints defy italian climate we had a small party to dinner captain and mrs hamilton davidoff frank scott harden and his chum charles baillie second son of mellerstain who seems a clever young man93 two or three of the party stayed to take wine and water  december 17sent off the beginning of the chronicles to ballantyne i hate cancels they are a double labour  mr cowan trustee for constables creditors called in the morning by appointment and we talked about the upset price of the copyrights of waverley etc i frankly told him that i was so much concerned that they should remain more or less under my control that i was willing with the advice of my trustees to offer a larger upset than that of £4750 which had been fixed and that i proposed the price set up should be £250 for the poetry pauls letters etc and £5250 for the novels in all £5500 but that i made this proposal under the condition that in case no bidding should ensue then the copyrights should be mine so soon as the sale was adjourned without any one being permitted to bid after the sale it is to be hoped this high upset price will      fright the fuds     of the pockpuds  this speculation may be for good or for evil but it tends incalculably to increase the value of such copyrights as remain in my own person and if a handsome and cheap edition of the whole with notes can be instituted in conformity with cadells plan it must prove a mine of wealth threefourths of which will belong to me or my creditors it is possible no doubt that the works may lose their effect on the public mind but this must be risked and i think the chances are greatly in our favour death my own i mean would improve the property since an edition with a life would sell like wildfire perhaps those who read this prophecy may shake their heads and say poor fellow he little thought how he should see the public interest in him and his extinguished even during his natural existence it may be so but i will hope better this i know that no literary speculation ever succeeded with me but where my own works were concerned and that on the other hand these have rarely failed and sovogue la galère  dined with the lord chiefcommissioner and met lord and lady binning lord and lady abercromby sir robert ocallaghan etc these dinners put off time well enough and i write so painfully by candlelight that they do not greatly interfere with business  december 18poor huntly gordon writes me in despair about £180 of debt which he has incurred he wishes to publish two sermons which i wrote for him when he was taking orders but he would get little money for them without my name and that is at present out of the question people would cry out against the undesired and unwelcome zeal of him who stretched out his hands to help the ark with the best intentions and cry sacrilege and yet they would do me gross injustice for i would if called upon die a martyr for the christian religion so completely is in my poor opinion its divine origin proved by its beneficial effects on the state of society were we but to name the abolition of slavery and of polygamy how much has in these two words been granted to mankind by the lessons of our saviour94  december 19wrought upon an introduction to the notices which have been recovered of george bannatyne95 author or rather transcriber of the famous repository of scottish poetry generally known by the bannatyne ms they are very jejune these same noticesa mere record of matters of business putting forth and calling in of sums of money and such like yet it is a satisfaction to learn that this great benefactor to the literature of scotland lived a prosperous life and enjoyed the pleasures of domestic society and in a time peculiarly perilous lived unmolested and died in quiet  at eleven oclock i had an appointment with a person unknown a youth had written me demanding an audience i excused myself by alleging the want of leisure and my dislike to communicate with a person perfectly unknown on unknown business the application was renewed and with an ardour which left me no alternative so i named eleven this day i am too much accustomed to the usual cant of the followers of the muses who endeavour by flattery to make their bad stale butter make amends for their stinking fish i am pretty well acquainted with that sort of thing i have had madmen on my hands too and once nearly was kotzebued by a lad of the name of sharpe all this gave me some curiosity but it was lost in attending to the task i was engaged in when the door opened and in walked a young woman of middling rank and rather good address but something resembling our secretary david laing if dressed in female habiliments there was the awkwardness of a moment in endeavouring to make me understand that she was the visitor to whom i had given the assignation then there were a few tears and sighs i fear madam this relates to some tale of great distress by no means sir and her countenance cleared up still there was a pause at last she asked if it were possible for her to see the king i apprehended then that she was a little mad and proceeded to assure her that the kings secretary received all such applications as were made to his majesty and disposed of them then came the mystery she wished to relieve herself from a state of bondage and to be rendered capable of maintaining herself by acquiring knowledge i inquired what were her immediate circumstances and found she resided with an uncle and aunt not thinking the case without hope i preached the old doctrine of patience and resignation i suppose with the usual effect  went to the bannatyne club and on the way met cadell out of breath coming to say he had bought the copyrights after a smart contention of this tomorrow there was little to do at the club  afterwards dined with lord and lady abercromby where i met my old and kind friend major buchanan of cambusmore his father was one of those from whom i gained much information about the old highlanders and at whose house i spent many merry days in my youth96 the last time i saw old cambusmore was in he sat up an hour later on the occasion though then eightyfive i shall never forget him and was delighted to see the major who comes seldom to town  december 20anent the copyrightsthe pockpuds were not frightened by our high price they came on briskly four or five bidders abreast and went on till the lot was knocked down to cadell at £8400 a very large sum certainly yet he has been offered profit on it already for my part i think the loss would have been very great had we suffered these copyrights to go from those which we possessed they would have been instantly stereotyped and forced on the market to bring home the price and by this means depreciated for ever and all ours must have shared the same fate whereas husbanded and brought out with care they cannot fail to draw in the others in the same series and thus to be a sure and respectable source of profit considered in this point of view even if they were worth only the £8400 to others they were £10000 to us the largeness of the price arising from the activity of the contest only serves to show the value of the property97 had at the same time the agreeable intelligence that the octavo sets which were bought by hurst and company at a depreciated rate are now rising in the market and that instead of 1500 sold they have sold upwards of 2000 copies this mass will therefore in all probability be worn away in a few months and then our operations may commence on the whole i am greatly pleased with the acquisition if this first series be worth £8400 the remaining books must be worth £10000 and then there is napoleon which is gliding away daily for which i would not take the same sum which would come to £24200 in all for copyrights besides £20000 payable by insurance98 add the value of my books and furniture plate etc there would be £50000 so this may be considered my present progress there will still remain upwards of £35000      heavens arm strike with ustis a fearful odds99  yet with health and continued popularity there are chances in my favour  dine at james ballantynes and happy man is he at the result of the sale indeed it must have been the making or marring of him sir henry steuart there who fooled me to the top of my bent  december 21a very sweet prettylooking young lady the prima donna of the italian opera now performing here by name miss ayton100 came to breakfast this morning with her father a bore after the manner of all fathers mothers aunts and other chaperons of pretty actresses miss ayton talks very prettily and i dare say sings beautifully though too much in the italian manner i fear to be a great favourite of mine but i did not hear her being called away by the clerks coach i am like jeremy in love for love101have a reasonable good ear for a jig but your solos and sonatas give me the spleen  called at cadells who is still enamoured of his bargain and with good reason as the london booksellers were offering him £1000 or £2000 to give it up to them he also ascertained that all the copies with which hurst and robinson loaded the market would be off in a half year make us thankful the weather is clearing to windward cadell is cautious steady and hears good counsel and gibson quite inclined were i too confident to keep a good lookout ahead  december 22public affairs look awkward the present ministry are neither whig nor tory and divested of the support of either of the great parties of the state stand supported by the will of the sovereign alone this is not constitutional and though it may be a temporary augmentation of the sovereigns personal influence yet it cannot but prove hurtful to the crown upon the whole by tending to throw that responsibility on the sovereign of which the law has deprived him i pray to god i may be wrong but an attempt to govern par basculeby trimming betwixt the opposite partiesis equally unsafe for the crown and detrimental to the country and cannot do for a long time the fact seems to be that lord goderich a wellmeaning and timid man finds himself on a precipicethat his head is grown dizzy and he endeavours to cling to the person next him this person is lord lansdowne who he hopes may support him in the house of lords against lord grey so he proposes to bring lord lansdowne into the cabinet lord g resigns and his resignation is accepted lord harrowby is then asked to place himself at the head of a new administrationdeclines the tried abilities of marquis wellesley are next applied to it seems he also declines and then lord goderich comes back his point about lord lansdowne having failed and his threatened resignation goes for nothing this must lower the premier in the eyes of every one it is plain the k will not accept the whigs it is equally plain that he has not made a move towards the tories and that with a neutral administration this country hard ruled at anytime can he long governed i for one cannot believe god send the good king to whom i owe so much as safe and honourable extrication as the circumstances render possible102  after court anne set out for abbotsford with the miss kerrs i came off at three oclock to arniston where i found lord register and lady r dundas and lady robt adam dundas durham of calderwood and lady old and young friends charles came with me  december 23went to church to borthwick with the family and heard a wellcomposed welldelivered sensible discourse from mr wright103 the clergymana different sort of person i wot from my old halfmad halfdrunken little humpback acquaintance clunie104 renowned for singing the auld mans mears dead and from the circumstance of his being once interrupted in his minstrelsy by the information that his own horse had died in the stable  after sermon we looked at the old castle which made me an old man the castle was not a bit older for the twentyfive years which had passed away but the ruins of the visitor were very apparent to climb up round staircases to creep through vaults and into dungeons were not the easy labours but the positive sports of my younger years but that time is gone by and i thought it convenient to attempt no more than the access to the large and beautiful hall in which as it is somewhere described an armed horseman might brandish his lance the feeling of growing and increasing inability is painful to one like me who boasted in spite of my infirmity great boldness and dexterity in such feats the boldness remains but hand and foot grip and accuracy of step have altogether failed me the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak and so i must retreat into the invalided corps and tell them of my former exploits which may very likely pass for lies we drove to dalhousie castle where the gallant earl who had done so much to distinguish the british name in all and every quarter of the globe is repairing the castle of his ancestors which of yore stood a siege against john of gaunt i was lord dalhousies companion at school where he was as much beloved by his companions as he has been ever respected by his companionsinarms and the people over whom he has been deputed to exercise the authority of his sovereign he was always steady wise and generous the old castle of dalhousiepotius dalwolseywas mangled by a fellow called i believe douglas who destroyed as far as in him lay its military and baronial character and roofed it after the fashion of a poorhouse the architect burn is now restoring and repairing in the old taste and i think creditably to his own feeling god bless the rooftree  we returned home through the temple banks by the side of the south esk where i had the pleasure to see that robert dundas is laying out his woods with taste and managing them with care his father and uncle took notice of me when i was a fellow of no mark or likelihood and i am always happy in finding myself in the old oak room at arniston where i have drunk many a merry bottle and in the fields where i have seen many a hare killed  december 24left arniston after breakfast and arrived to dinner at abbotsford  my reflections on entering my own gate were of a very different and more pleasing cast than those with which i left my house about six weeks ago i was then in doubt whether i should fly my country or become avowedly bankrupt and surrender my library and household furniture with the liferent of my estate to sale a man of the world will say i had better done so no doubt had i taken this course at once i might have employed the £25000 which i made since the insolvency of constable and robinsons houses in compounding my debts but i could not have slept sound as i now can under the comfortable impression of receiving the thanks of my creditors and the conscious feeling of discharging my duty like a man of honour and honesty i see before me a long tedious and dark path but it leads to true fame and stainless reputation if i die in the harrows as is very likely i shall die with honour if i achieve my task i shall have the thanks of all concerned and the approbation of my own conscience and so i think i can fairly face the return of christmas day  december 25 i drove over to huntly burn and saw the plantation which is to be called janeswood in honour of my daughterinlaw all looking well and in order before dinner arrived mrs george ellis and her nephew and niece mr and mrs charles ellis whom i was delighted to see as there are a thousand kind recollections of old days mrs george ellis is less changed in manner and appearance than any one i know the gay and lighthearted have in that respect superiority over those who are of a deeper mould and a heavier there is something even in the slightness and elasticity of person which outlasts the ponderous strength which is borne down by its own weight colonel ellis is an enthusiastic soldier and though young served in spain and at waterloo      and so we held our christmastide     with mirth and burly cheer  december 26colonel ellis and i took a pretty long walk round by the glen etc where i had an extraordinary escape from the breaking down of a footbridge as i put my foot upon it i luckily escaped either breaking my leg by its passing through the bridge in so awkward a manner or tearing it by some one of the hundred rusty nails through which it fell however i was not thanks to heaven hurt in the slightest degree tom purdie who had orders to repair the bridge long since was so scandalised at the consequence of his negligence that the bridge is repaired by the time i am writing this but how the noiseless step of fate dogs us in our most seeming safe and innocent sports  on returning home we were joined by the lord chiefcommissioner the lord chief baron and william clerk of gentlemen and of ladies miss adam and young miss thomson of charlton also the two miss kerrs lord roberts daughters and so behold us a gallant christmas party full of mirth and harmony moreover captain john ferguson came over from huntly burn so we spent the day jocundly i intend to take a holiday or two while these friends are about us i have worked hard enough to merit it and       maggie will not sleep             for that ere summer105  december 27this morning we took a drive up the yarrow in great force and perambulated the duchesss walk with all the force of our company the weather was delightful the season being considered and newark castle amid its leafless trees resembled a dear old man who smiles upon the ruins which time has spread around him it is looking more venerable than formerly for the repairs judiciously undertaken have now assumed colouring congenial with the old walls formerly they had a raw and patchy appearance i have seldom seen the scene look better even when summer smiled upon it  i have a letter from james hogg the ettrick shepherd asking me to intercede with the duke of buccleuch about his farm106 he took this burthen upon himself without the advice of his best friends and certainly contrary to mine from the badness of the times it would have been a poor speculation in any hands especially in those of a man of letters whose occupation as well as the society in which it involves him are so different but i hope this great family will be kind to him if not cela ne vaudra pas à moi but i cannot and ought not to look for having the same interest with this gentleman which i exercised in the days of duke charles  december 28a demand from cadell to prepare a revised copy of the tales of my grandfather for the press107 i received it with great pleasure for i always had private hopes of that work if i have a knack for anything it is for selecting the striking and interesting points out of dull details and hence i myself receive so much pleasure and instruction from volumes which are generally reputed dull and uninteresting give me facts i will find fancy for myself the first two volumes of these little tales are shorter than the third by seventy or eighty pages cadell proposes to equalise them by adding part of vol ii to vol i and of vol iii to vol ii but then vol i ends with the reign of robert bruce vol ii with the defeat of flodden happy points of pause which i cannot think of disturbing the first in particular for surely we ought to close one volume at least of scottish history at a point which leaves the kingdom triumphant and happy and alas where do her annals present us with such an era excepting after bannockburn so i will set about to fill up the volumes which are too short with some additional matter and so diminish at least if we cannot altogether remove their unsightly inequality in size the rest of the party went to dryburghtoo painful a place of pilgrimage for me108 i walked with the lord chief commissioner through our grounds at huntly burn and by taking the carriage now and then i succeeded in giving my excellent old friend enough of exercise without any fatigue we made our visit at huntly burn  december 29lord chiefbaron lord chiefcommissioner miss adam miss anstruther thomson and william clerk left us we read prayers and afterwards walked round the terrace  i had also time to work hard on the additions to the tales of a grandfather vols 1 and 2 the day passed pleasantly over  december 30the fergusons came over and we welcomed in the new year with the usual forms of song and flagon  looking back to the conclusion of 1826 i observe that the last year ended in trouble and sickness with pressures for the present and gloomy prospects for the future the sense of a great privation so lately sustained together with the very doubtful and clouded nature of my private affairs pressed hard upon my mind i am now perfectly well in constitution and though i am still on troubled waters yet i am rowing with the tide and less than the continuation of my exertions of 1827 may with gods blessing carry me successfully through 1828 when we may gain a more open sea if not exactly a safe port above all my children are well sophias situation excites some natural anxiety but it is only the accomplishment of the burthen imposed on her sex walter is happy in the view of his majority on which matter we have favourable hopes from the duke of wellington anne is well and happy charless entry upon life under the highest patronage and in a line for which i hope he is qualified is about to take place presently  for all these great blessings it becomes me well to be thankful to

was with him at abbotsford and he records a curious incident regarding dryburgh which may be given herefor nearly two years he had to struggle for his life with that severe illness which the natural strength of his constitution at length proved sufficient to throw off with its disappearance although restored to health disappeared also much of his former vigour of body activity and power of undergoing fatigue while in personal appearance he had advanced twenty years in the downward course of life his hair had become bleached to pure white and scanty locks the fire of his eye quenched and his step more uncertain had lost the vigorous swinging gait with which he was used to proceed in fact old age had by many years anticipated its usual progress and marked how severely he had suffered the complaint that of gallstones was one of extreme bodily suffering during his severest attack he had been alone at abbotsford with his daughter sophia before her marriage to mr lockhart and had sent to say that he was desirous i should come to him which i did and remained for ten days till the attack had subsided during its course the extreme violence of the pain end spasmodic contraction of the muscles of the stomach were such that i scarcely expected the powers of endurance could sustain him through the trial and so much at times was he exhausted by it as to leave us in alarm as to what the result had actually been one night i shall not soon forget he had been frequently and severely ill during the day and having been summoned to his room in the middle of the night where his daughter was already standing the picture of deep despair at his bedside the attack seemed intense and we followed the directions left by the physician to assuage it at length it seemed to subside and he fell back exhausted on the pillow his eyes were closed and his countenance wan and livid apparently with corresponding misgivings his daughter at one side of the bed and i at the other gazed for some time intently and in silence on his countenance and then glanced with anxious inquiring looks to each other till at length having placed my finger on his pulse to ascertain whether it had actually ceased to throb i shall never forget the sudden beam which again brightened his daughters countenance and for a moment dispelled the intense expression of anxiety which had for some time overspread it when sir walter aware of my feeling his pulse and the probable purpose whispered with a faint voice but without opening his eyes i am not yet gone after some time he revived and gave us a proof of the mastery of his mind over the sufferings of the body do you recollect he said to me a small round turret near the gate of the monastery of aberbrothwick and placed so as to overhang the street upon answering that i did perfectly and that a picturesque little morsel it was he said well i was over there when a mob had assembled excited by some purpose which i do not recollect but failing of their original intention they took umbrage at the little venerable emblem of aristocracy which still bore its weatherstained head so conspicuously aloft and resolving to humble it with the dust they got a stout hawser from a vessel in the adjoining harbour which a sailor lad climbing up coiled round the body of the little turret and the rabble seizing the rope by both ends tugged and pulled and laboured long to strangle and overthrow the poor old turret but in vain for it withstood all their endeavours now that is exactly the condition of my poor stomach there is a rope twisted round it and the malicious devils are straining and tugging at it and faith i could almost think that i sometimes hear them shouting and cheering each other to their task and when they are at it i always have the little turret and its tormentors before my eyes he complained that particular ideas fixed themselves down upon his mind which he had not the power of shaking off but this was in fact the obvious consequence of the quantity of laudanum which it was necessary for him to swallow to allay the spasms  after he had got some repose and had become rather better in the morning he said with a smile on his countenance if you will promise not to laugh at me i have a favour to ask do you know i have taken a childish desire to see the place where i am to be laid when i go home which there is some probability may not now be long delayed now as i cannot go to dryburgh abbeythat is out of the question at presentit would give me much pleasure if you would take a ride down and bring me a drawing of that spot which he minutely described the position of and mentioned the exact point where he wished it drawn that the site of his future grave might appear his wish was accordingly complied withreminiscences     1828     january      as i walked by myself     i talked to myself     and thus myself said to me  january 1since the 20th november 1825 for two months that is and two years i have kept this custom of a diary that it has made me wiser or better i dare not say but it shows by its progress that i am capable of keeping a resolution perhaps i should not congratulate myself on this perhaps it only serves to show i am more a man of method and less a man of originality and have no longer that vivacity of fancy that is inconsistent with regular labour still should this be the case i should having lost the one be happy to find myself still possessed of the other  january 2cæcæ mentes hominummy last entry records my punctuality in keeping up my diary hitherto my present labour commenced notwithstanding the date upon the 9th january is to make up my little record betwixt the second and that latter date in a word i have been several days in arrear without rhyme or reasondays too when there was so little to write down that the least jotting would have done it this must not be in future  january 3our friends begin to disperse mrs ellis who has been indisposed for the last two days will i hope bear her journey to london well she is the relict of my dear old friend george ellis109 who had more wit learning and knowledge of the world than would fit out twenty literati the hardens remained today and i had a long walk with the laird up the glen and so forth he seemed a little tired and with all due devotion to my chief i was not sorry to triumph over some one in point of activity at my time of day  january 4visited by mr stewart of dalguise who came to collect materials for a description of abbotsford to be given with a drawing in a large work views of gentlemens seats mr stewart is a wellinformed gentlemanlike young man grave and quiet yet possessed of a sense of humour i must take care he does not in civility overpuff my little assemblage of curiosities scarce anything can be meaner than the vanity which details the contents of china closetsbasins ewers and chamberpots horace walpole with all his talents makes a silly figure when he gives an upholsterers catalogue of his goods and chattels at strawberry hill  january 5this day i began to review taschereaus life of molière for mr gillies who is crying help for gods sake messrs treuttel and wurtz offer guerdon i shall accept because it is doing gillies no good to let him have my labour for nothing and an article is about £100 in my pocket it may form a fund to help this poor gentleman or others at a pinch in his i fear it would only encourage a neglect of sober economy when in his prosperity he asked me whether there was not in my opinion something interesting in a man of genius being in embarrassed circumstances god knows he has had enough of them since poor fellow and it should be remembered that if he thus dallied with his good fortune his benevolence to others was boundless  we had the agreeable intelligence of sophia being safely delivered of a girl the mother and child doing well praised be god  january 6i have a letter from the duke of wellington making no promises but assuring me of a favourable consideration of walters case should an opening occur for the majority this same step is represented as the most important but so in their time were the lieutenancy and the troop each in its turn was the step par excellence it appears that these same steps are those of a treadmill where the party is always ascending and never gains the top but the same simile would suit most pursuits in life  the misses kerr left us on fridaytwo charming young persons welllooked wellmannered and wellborn above all wellprincipled they sing together in a very delightful manner and our evenings are the duller without them  i am annoyed beyond measure with the idle intrusion of voluntary correspondents each man who has a pen ink and sheet of foolscap to spare flies a letter at me i believe the postage costs me £100 a year besides innumerable franks and all the letters regard the writers own hopes or projects or are filled with unasked advice or extravagant requests i think this evil increases rather than diminishes on the other hand i must fairly own that i have received many communications in this way worth all the trouble and expense that the others cost me so i must lay the head of the sow to the tail of the grice as the proverb elegantly expresses itself  news again of sophia and baby mrs hughes thinks the infant a beauty johnnie opines that it is not very pretty and grandpapa supposes it to be like other newborn children which are as like as a basket of oranges  january 7wrought at the review and finished a good lot of it mr stewart left us amply provided with the history of abbotsford and its contents it is a kind of conundrum castle to be sure and i have great pleasure in it for while it pleases a fantastic person in the style and manner of its architecture and decoration it has all the comforts of a commodious habitation  besides the review i have been for this week busily employed in revising for the press the tales of a grandfather cadell rather wished to rush it out by employing three different presses but this i repressed smoke the pun i will not have poor james ballantyne driven off the plank to which we are all three clinging110 i have made great additions to volume first and several of these tales and i care not who knows it i think well of them nay i will hash history with anybody be he who he will111 i do not know but it would be wise to let romantic composition rest and turn my mind to the history of england france and ireland to be da capo rotad as well as that of scotland men would laugh at me as an author for mr newberys shop in pauls churchyard i should care little for that virginibus puerisque i would as soon compose histories for boys and girls which may be useful as fictions for children of a larger growth which can at best be only idle folks entertainment but write what i will or to whom i will i am doggedly determined to write myself out of the present scrape by any labour that is fair and honest  january 8despatched my review in part and in the morning walked from chiefswood all about the shearing flats and home by the new walk which i have called the brides walk because jane was nearly stuck fast in the bog there just after her marriage in the beginning of 1825  my post brings serious intelligence today and of a very pleasing description longman and company with a reserve which marks all their proceedings suddenly inform mr gibson that they desire 1000 of the 8vo edition of st ronans well and the subsequent series of novels thereunto belonging for that they have only seven remaining and wish it to be sent to their printers and pushed out in three months thus this great house without giving any previous notice of the state of the sale expect all to be boot and saddle horse and away whenever they give the signal in the present case this may do because i will make neither alteration nor addition till our grand opus the improved edition goes to press but ought we to go to press with this 1000 copies knowing that our project will supersede and render equivalent to waste paper such of them as may not reach the public before our plan is publicly known and begins to operate i have i acknowledge doubt as to this no doubt i feel perfectly justified in letting longman and co look to their own interest since they have neither consulted me nor attended to mine but the loss might extend to the retail booksellers and to hurt the men through whom my works are ultimately to find their way to the public would be both unjust and impolitic on the contrary if the st ronan series be hurried out immediately there is time enough perhaps to sell it off before the improved edition appears in the meantime it appears that the popularity of these works is increasing rather than diminishing that the measure of securing the copyrights was most judicious and that with proper management things will work themselves round successful first editions are good but they require exertion and imply fresh risk of reputation but repeated editions tell only to the agreeable part of literature112  longman and company have also at length opened their oracular jaws on the subject of bonaparte and acknowledged its rapid sale and the probable exhaustion of the present edition  these tidings with the success of the tales speak of africa and golden joys113 but the tidings arriving after dinner rather discomposed me in the evening i wrote to cadell and ballantyne at length proposing a meeting at my house on tuesday first to hold a privy council  january 9my first reflection was on napoleon i will not be hurried in my corrections of that work and that i may not be so i will begin them the instant that i have finished the review it makes me tremble to think of the mass of letters i have to look through in order to select all those which affect the subject of napoleon and which in spite of numerous excellent resolutions i have never separated from the common file from which they are now to be selected confound them but they are confounded already indolence is a delightful indulgence but at what a rate we purchase it today we go to mertoun and having spent some time in making up my journal to this length and in a chat with captain john who dropped in i will presently set to the reviewknock it off if possible before we start at five oclock tomorrow when i return we will begin the disagreeable task of a thorough rummage of papers books and documents my character as a man of letters and as a man of honour depends on my making that work as correct as possible it has succeeded notwithstanding every effort here and in france114 to put it down and it shall not lose ground for want of backing we went to dine and pass the night at mertoun where we met sir john pringle mr and mrs baillie mellerstain and their daughters  january 10when i rose this morning the weather was changed and the ground covered with snow i am sure its winter fairly we returned from mertoun after breakfast through an incipient snowstorm coming on partially and in great flakes the sun bursting at intervals through the clouds at last die wolken laufen zusammen we made a slow journey of it through the swollen river and heavy roads but here we are at last  i am rather sorry we expect friends today though these friends be the good fergusons i have a humour for work to which the sober sad uniformity of a snowy day always particularly disposes me and i am sure i will get poor gillies off my hand at least if i had morning and evening then i would set to work with arranging everything for these second editions of napoleon the romances etc which must be soon got afloat i must say the wark gangs bonnily on115 well i will ring for coals mend my pen and try what can be done  i wrought accordingly on gilliess review for the life of molière a gallant subject i am only sorry i have not time to do it justice it would have required a complete reperusal of his works for which alas i have no leisure      for long though pleasant is the way     and life alas allows but one ill winters day  which is too literally my own case   january 11renewed my labour finished the review talis qualis and sent it off commenced then my infernal work of putting to rights much cry and little woo as the deil said when he shore the sow but i have detected one or two things that had escaped me and may do more tomorrow i observe by a letter from mr cadell that i had somewhat misunderstood his last it is he not longman that wishes to publish the thousand copies of st ronans series and there is no immediate call for napoleon this makes little difference in my computation the pressing necessity of correction is put off for two or three months probably and i have time to turn myself to the chronicles i do not much like the task but when did i ever like labour of any kind my hands were fully occupied today with writing letters and adjusting papersboth a great bore  the news from london assure a change of ministry the old tories come in play but i hope they will compromise nothing there is little danger since wellington takes the lead   january 12my expenses have been considerably more than i expected but i think that having done so much i need not undergo the mortification of giving up abbotsford and parting with my old habits and servants116   january 13 edinburghwe had a slow and tiresome retreat from abbotsford through the worst of weather halfsleet halfsnow dined with the royal society club and being an anniversary sat till nine oclock instead of halfpast seven   january 14i read coopers new novel the red rover the current of it rolls entirely upon the ocean something there is too much of nautical language in fact it overpowers everything else but so people once take an interest in a description they will swallow a great deal which they do not understand the sweet word mesopotamia has its charm in other compositions as well as in sermons he has much genius a powerful conception of character and force of execution the same ideas i see recur upon him that haunt other folks the graceful form of the spars and the tracery of the ropes and cordage against the sky is too often dwelt upon   january 15this day the court sat down i missed my good friend colin mackenzie who proposes to retire from indifferent health a better man never livedeager to serve every onea safeguard over all public business which came through his hands as deputykeeper of the signet he will be much missed he had a patience in listening to every one which is of the highest consequence in the management of a public body for many men care less to gain their point than they do to play the orator and be listened to for a certain time this done and due quantity of personal consideration being gained the individual orator is usually satisfied with the reasons of the civil listener who has suffered him to enjoy his hour of consequence i attended the court but there was very little for me to do the snowy weather has annoyed my fingers with chilblains and i have a threatening of rheumatismwhich heaven avert  james ballantyne and mr cadell dined with me today and talked me into a good humour with my present task which i had laid aside in disgust it must however be done though i am loth to begin to it again  january 16again returned early and found my way home with some difficulty the weathera black frost powdered with snow my fingers suffering much and my knee very stiff when i came home i set to work but not to the chronicles i found a less harassing occupation in correcting a volume or two of napoleon in a rough way my indolence if i can call it so is of a capricious kind it never makes me absolutely idle but very often inclines meas it were from mere contradictions saketo exchange the task of the day for something which i am not obliged to do at the moment or perhaps not at all  january 17my knee so swelled and the weather so cold that i stayed from court i nibbled for an hour or two at napoleon then took handsomely to my gear and wrote with great ease and fluency six pages of the chronicles if they are but tolerable i shall be satisfied in fact such as they are they must do for i shall get warm as i work as has happened on former occasions the fact is i scarce know what is to succeed or not but this is the consequence of writing too much and too often i must get some breathing space but how is that to be managed there is the rub  january 1819remained still at home and wrought hard the fountain trickles free enough but god knows whether the waters will be worth drinking however i have finished a good deal of hard workthats the humour of it  january 20wrought hard in the forenoon at dinner we had helen erskinewhom circumstances lead to go to india in search of the domestic affection which she cannot find heremrs george swinton and two young strangers one a son of my old friend dr stoddart of the times a wellmannered and intelligent youth the other that unnatural character a tame irishman resembling a formal englishman  january 21this morning i sent jb as far as page fortythree being fully twothirds of the volume the rest i will drive on trusting that contrary to the liberated posthorse in john gilpin the lumber of the wheels rattling behind me may put spirit in the poor brute who has to drag it  mr and mrs moscheles were here at breakfast she is a very pretty little jewess he one of the greatest performers on the pianoforte of the daycertainly most surprising and what i rather did not expect pleasing  i have this day the melancholy news of glengarrys death and was greatly shocked the eccentric parts of his character the pretensions which he supported with violence and assumption of rank and authority were obvious subjects of censure and ridicule which in some points were not undeserved he played the part of a chieftain too nigh the life to be popular among an altered race with whom he thought felt and acted i may say in right and wrong as a chieftain of a hundred years since would have done while his conduct was viewed entirely by modern eyes and tried by modern rules117  january 22i am i find in serious danger of losing the habit of my journal and having carried it on so long that would be pity but i am now on the 1st february fishing for the lost recollections of the days since the 21st january luckily there is not very much to remember or forget and perhaps the best way would be to skip and go on  january 23being a teind day i had a good opportunity of work i should have said i had given breakfast on the 21st to mr and mrs moscheles she a beautiful young creature and one that adores me as sir toby says118that is in my poetical capacityin fact a frank and amiable young person i liked mr moscheles playing better than i could have expected considering my own bad ear but perhaps i flatter myself and think i understood it better than i did perhaps i have not done myself justice and know more of music than i thought i did but it seems to me that his variations have a more decided style of originality than those i have commonly heard which have all the signs of a da capo rota  dined at sir archibald campbells119 and drank rather more wine than usual in a sober way to be sure it was excellent and some old acquaintances proved a good excuse for the glass  january 24i took a perverse fit today and went off to write notes et cetera on guy mannering this was perverse enough but it was a composition between humour and duty and as such let it pass  january 25i went on working sometimes at my legitimate labours sometimes at my jobs of notes but still working faithfully in good spirits and contented  huntly gordon has disposed of the two sermons120 to the bookseller colburn for £250well sold i thinkand is to go forth immediately the man is a puffing quack but though i would rather the thing had not gone there and far rather that it had gone nowhere yet hang it if it makes the poor lad easy what needs i fret about it after all there would be little gain in doing a kind thing if you did not suffer pain or inconvenience upon the score  january 26being saturday attended mr moscheles concert and was amused the more so that i had mrs m herself to flirt a little with to have so much beauty as she really possesses and to be accomplished and wellread she is an unaffected and pleasant person mr moscheles gives lessons at two guineas by the hour and he has actually found scholars in this poor country one of them at least mrs john murray may derive advantage from his instructions for i observe his mode of fingering is very peculiar as he seems to me to employ the fingers of the same hand in playing the melody and managing the bass at the same time which is surely most uncommon  i presided at the celtic societys dinner today and proposed glengarrys memory which although there had been a rough dispute with the celts and the poor chief was very well received i like to see men think and bear themselves like men there were fewer in the tartan than usualwhich was wrong  january 27wrought manfully at the chronicles all this day and have nothing to jot down only i forgot that i lost my lawsuit some day last week or the week before the fellow therefore gets his money plack and bawbee but its always a troublesome claim settled121 and there can be no other of the same kind as every other creditor has accepted the composition of 7s in the £ which my exertions have enabled me to pay them about £20000 of the fund had been created by my own exertions since the bankruptcy took place and i had a letter from donald horne by commission of the creditors to express their sense of my exertions in their behalf all this is consolatory  january 28i am in the scrape of sitting for my picture and had to repair for two hours today to mr colvin smithlord gilliess nephew the chief baron122 had the kindness to sit with me great part of the time as the chief commissioner had done on a late occasion the picture is for the chief commissioner and the chief baron desires a copy i trust it will he a good one at home in the evening and wrote i am well on before the press notwithstanding late hours lassitude and laziness i have read coopers prairiebetter i think than his red rover in which you never get foot on shore and to understand entirely the incidents of the story it requires too much knowledge of nautical language its very clever though123  january 29this day at the court and wrote letters at home besides making a visit or tworare things with me i have an invitation from messrs saunders and otley booksellers offering me from £1500 to £2000 annually to conduct a journal but i am their humble servant i am too indolent to stand to that sort of work and i must preserve the undisturbed use of my leisure and possess my soul in quiet a large income is not my object i must clear my debts and that is to be done by writing things of which i can retain the property made my excuses accordingly  january 30after court hours i had a visit from mr charles heath the engraver accompanied by a son of reynolds the dramatist his object was to engage me to take charge as editor of a yearly publication called the keepsake of which the plates are beyond comparison beautiful but the letterpress indifferent enough he proposed £800 a year if i would become editor and £400 if i would contribute from seventy to one hundred pages i declined both but told him i might give him some trifling thing or other and asked the young men to breakfast the next day worked away in the evening and completed in a way and in a manner the notes on guy mannering the first volume of the chronicles is now in ballantynes hands all but a leaf or two am i satisfied with my exertions so so will the public be pleased with them umph i doubt the bubble will burst while it is current however it is clear i should stand by it each novel of three volumes brings £4000 and i remain proprietor of the mine when the first ore is cropped out this promises a good harvest from what we have experienced now to become a stipendiary editor of a newyears giftbook is not to be thought of nor could i agree to work for any quantity of supply to such a publication even the pecuniary view is not flattering though these gentlemen meant it should be so but one hundred of their closeprinted pages for which they offer £400 is not nearly equal to one volume of a novel for which i get £1300 and have the reversion of the copyright no i may give them a trifle for nothing or sell them an article for a round price but no permanent engagement will i make being the martyrdom there was no court i wrought away with what appetite i could  january 31i received the young gentlemen to breakfast and expressed my resolution which seemed to disappoint them as perhaps they expected i should have been glad of such an offer however i have since thought there are these rejected parts of the chronicles which cadell and ballantyne criticised so severely which might well enough make up a trifle of this kind and settle the few accounts which will i nill i have crept in this new year so i have kept the treaty open if i give them 100 pages i should expect £500  i was late at the court and had little time to write any till after dinner and then was not in the vein so commentated  footnotes  109 to whom scott addressed the fifth canto of marmion  110 see letter to r cadell life vol ix p 209  111 the first tales of a grandfather as has already been said appeared early in december and their reception was more rapturous than that of any one of his works since ivanhoe he had solved for the first time the problem of narrating history so as at once to excite and gratify the curiosity of youth and please and instruct the wisest of mature minds the popularity of the book has grown with every year that has since elapsed it is equally prized in the library the boudoir the schoolroom and the nursery it is adopted as the happiest of manuals not only in scotland but wherever the english tongue is spoken nay it is to be seen in the hands of old and young all over the civilised world and has i have little doubt extended the knowledge of scottish history in quarters where little or no interest had ever before been awakened as to any other parts of that subject except those immediately connected with mary stuart and the chevalierlife vol ix pp 1867  112 it may be remarked at this point how the value of these works has been sustained by the public demand during the term of legal copyright and since that date that of waverley expired in 1856 and the others at fortytwo years from the date of publication  on december 19 1827 the copyright of the novels from waverley to quentin durward was acquired as mentioned in the text for £8400 as a joint purchase five years later viz in 1832 mr cadell purchased from sir walters representatives for about £40000 the authors share in stock and entire copyrights  nineteen years afterwards viz on the 26th march 1851 after mr cadells death the stock and copyrights were exposed for sale by auction in london regarding which a trade journal of the date says  mr hodgson offered for sale the whole of the copyrights of sir walter scotts works including stereotypes steels woodcuts etc to a very large meeting of the publishers of this country after one or two of our leading firms had retired from the contest the lot was bought in for we believe £15500 this sum did not include the stock on hand valued at £10000 however the fact is that the trustees have virtually refused £25000 for the stock copyrights etc of scotts works  messrs a  c black in 1851 purchased the property at nearly the same price vizcopyright £17000 stock £10000in all £27000 mr francis black who has kindly given me information regarding the sale of these works tells me that of the volumes of one of the cheaper issues about three millions have been sold since 1851 this of course is independent of other publishers editions in great britain the continent and america  113 in henry iv act v sc 3  114 in an interesting letter to scott from fenimore cooper dated sept 12th 1827 he tells him that the french abuse you a little but as they began to do this to my certain knowledge five months before the book was published you have no great reason to regard their criticism  it would be impossible to write the truth on such a subject and please this nation one frothy gentleman denounced you in my presence as having a low vulgar style very much such an one as characterised the pen of shakespeare  115 a proverb having its rise from an exclamation made by mr david dick a covenanter on witnessing the execution of some of montroses followerswisharts montrose quoting from guthries memoirs p 182  116 scotts biographer records his admiration for the manner in which all his dependants met the reverse of their masters fortunes the butler instead of being the easy chief of a large establishment was now doing half the work of the house at probably half his former wages old peter who had been for fiveandtwenty years a dignified coachman was now ploughman in ordinary only putting his horses to the carriage on high and rare occasions and so on with all that remained of the ancient train and all seemed happier  117 ante vol i p 120  118 twelfth night act ii sc 3  119 sir archibald campbell of succoth he lived at 1 park place  120 the circumstances under

but he was not successful and he writes to scott in the autumn of 1827 this sir is a pitiful account of a project from which i expected something more just to you and creditable to my country     february   february 1i had my two youths again to breakfast but i did not say more about my determination save that i would help them if i could make it convenient the chief commissioner has agreed to let heath have his pretty picture of a study at abbotsford by edwin landseer in which old maida occurs the youth reynolds is what one would suppose his fathers son to be smart and forward and knows the world i suppose i was too much fagged with sitting in the court today to write hard after dinner but i did work however  february 2corrected proofs which are now nearly up with me this day was an idle one for i remained in court till one and sat for my picture till halfpast three to mr smith he has all the steadiness and sense in appearance which his cousin rpg lacks124 whether he has genius or no i am no judge my own portrait is like but i think too broad about the jowls a fault which they all fall into as i suppose by placing their subject upon a high stage and looking upwards to them which must foreshorten the face the chief baron and chief commissioner had the goodness to sit with me  dressed and went with anne to dine at pinkie house where i met the president125 lady charlotte etc above all mrs scott of gala whom i had not seen for some time we had much fun and i was as sir andrew aguecheek says in good fooling126 a lively french girl a governess i think but very pretty and animated seemed much amused with the old gentleman home at eleven oclock  by the by sir john hope had found a roman eagle on his estate in fife with sundry of those pots and coffeepots so to speak which are so common but the eagle was mislaid so i did not see it  february 3i corrected proofs and wrote this morningbut slowly heavily lazily there was a mist on my mind which my exertions could not dispel i did not get two pages finished but i corrected proofs and commentated  february 4wrote a little and was obliged to correct the molière affair for rpg i think his plan cannot go on much longer with so much weakness at the helm a clever fellow would make it take the field with a vengeance but poor g will run in debt with the booksellers and let all go to the devil i sent a long letter to lockhart received from horace smith very gentlemanlike and wellwritten complaining that mr leigh hunt had mixed him up in his life of byron with shelley as if he had shared his irreligious opinions leigh hunt afterwards at the request of smith published a swaggering contradiction of the inference to be derived from the way in which he has named them together horatio smith seems not to have relied upon his disclamation as he has requested me to mention the thing to john lockhart and to some one influential about ebony which i have done accordingly  february 5concluded the first volume before breakfast i am but indifferently pleased either the kind of thing is worn out or i am worn out myself or lastly i am stupid for the time the book must be finished however cadell is greatly pleased with annotations intended for the new edition of the waverley series i believe that work must be soon sent to press which would put a powerful wheel in motion to clear the ship i went to the parliament house and in return strolled into cadells being rather anxious to prolong my walk for i fear the constant sitting for so many hours when i returned the duke of buccleuch came in he is looking very well and stout but melancholy about his sister lady charlotte stopford he is fitting up a part of bowhill and intends to shoot there this year god send him life and health for it is of immense consequence  february 6this and visits wasted my time till past two and then i slept halfanhour from mere exhaustion went in the evening to the play and saw that good old thing an english tragedy well got up it was venice preserved mrs h siddons played belvidera with much truth feeling and tenderness though short of her motherinlaws uncommon majesty which is a thing never to be forgotten mr young played pierre very well and a good jaffier was supplied by a mr vandenhoff and so the day glided by only three pages written which however is a fair task  february 7it was a teind day so no court but very little work i wrote this morning till the boy made his appearance for proofs then i had letters to write item at five oclock i set out with charles for dalkeith to present him to the young duke  i asked the duke about poor hogg i think he has decided to take mr riddells opinion it is unlucky the poor fellow has ever taken that large and dear farm127 altogether dalkeith was melancholy tonight and i could not raise my spirits at all  february 8i had a little work before dinner but we are only seven pages into volume second it is always a beginning however perhaps not a good onei cannot tell i went out to call on gala and jack rutherfurd of edgerstoun saw the former not the latter gala is getting much better he talked as if the increase of his village was like to drive him over the hill to the abbotsford side which would greatly beautify that side and certainly change his residence for the better only that he must remain some time without any appearance of plantation the view would be enchanting  i was tempted to buy a picture of nell gywnne128 which i think has merit at least it pleases me seven or eight years ago graham of gartmore bid for it against me and i gave it up at twentyfive guineas i have now bought it for £18 18s perhaps there was folly in this but i reckoned it a token of good luck that i should succeed in a wish i had formerly harboured in vain i love marks of good luck even in trifles  february 9sent off three leaves of copy this is using the press like the famished sailor who was fed by a comrade with shellfish by one at a time but better anything than stop for the devil is to get set agoing again i know no more than my old boots whether i am right or wrong but have no very favourable anticipations  as i came home from the court about twelve i stepped into the exhibition it makes a very good show the portraits are better than last year those of colvin smith and watson gordon especially improve landseers study at abbotsford is in a capital light and generally admired i particularly distinguished john thomsons picture of turnberry which is of firstrate excellence a picture by scrope was also generally distinguished it is a view in calabria  there is a rival exhibition which does not hurt the earlier foundation but rather excites emulation i am told there are good paintings there i came home with little goodwill to work but i will compel myself to do something unluckily i have again to go out to dinner today being president of the bannatyne  the dinner was a pleasant one about thirty members attended i kept the chair till near eleven and the company were very joyous  february 10i set myself doggedly to work and turned off six leaves before dinner had to dinner sir john pringle my dear gala and his lady and young mackenzie and miss jardine i was quite pleased to see gala so well recovered of the consequences of his frightful fall which hung about him so long he is one of the kindest and bestinformed men whom i know  february 11i had charles young129 to breakfast with us who gave us some striking anecdotes of talma during the reign of terror which may figure in napoleon to great advantage  my son charles left us this morning to take possession of his situation in the foreign office he has been very lucky correcting sheets etc took up the morning hours i wrote three leaves before two oclock day bitter coldwith snow a strong contrast to the mild weather we had last week  salutation of two old scottish lairdsyere maist obedient hummil servant tannachy tullohyour nain man kilspindie  finished six pages twentyfive pages of print that is or about the thirteenth part of a volume that would be a volume in a fortnight with a holiday to boot it would be possible enough for a little while  february 12i wrought hard this morning ballantyne blames the ossianic monotony of my principal characters now they are not ossianic the language of the ossianic poetry is highly figurative that of the knights of chivalry may be monotonous and probably is but it cannot be ossianic sooth to say this species of romance of chivalry is an exhaustible subject it affords materials for splendid description for once or twice but they are too unnatural and formal to bear repetition we must go on with our present work however valeat quantum mr cadell less critical than jb seems pleased the world will soon decide if i get on at this rate for i have finished four leaves today notwithstanding my attendance on the court  february 13mr macintosh mackay minister of laggan breakfasted with us this morning this reverend gentleman is completing the highland dictionary130 and seems very competent for the task he left in my hands some papers of cluny macpherson concerning the affair of 1745 from which i have extracted an account of the battle of clifton for waverley he has few prejudices for a highlander and is a mild wellmannered young man we had much talk on highland matters  the childrens tales continue in demand cadell expects a new edition of 10000 about next year which may be £750 or £800 in pouch besides constituting a fine property  february 14mr edwards a candidate for the situation of rector in the edinburgh academy a pleasant gentlemanlike man and recommended highly for experience and learning but he is himself afraid of wanting bodily strength for the work which requires all the nerve and muscle of williams i wish he had been three inches taller and stout in proportion i went to mr john russells where there was an academical party at dinner home at nine a cigar and to bed  february 15rose this morning about seven and wrote at the desk till breakfast finished about a page and a half i was fagged at court till near two then called on cadell and so home tired enough  february 16there dined with me today tom thomson will clerk mr edwards and my celtic friend mr mackay of laggan  february 17a day of hard work being i think eight pages131 before dinner i cannot i am sure tell if it is worth marking down that yesterday at dinnertime i was strangely haunted by what i would call the sense of preexistencevidelicet a confused idea that nothing that passed was said for the first time that the same topics had been discussed and the same persons had stated the same opinions on the same subjects it is true there might have been some ground for recollections considering that three at least of the company were old friends and kept much company together that is justiceclerk132 lord abercromby and i but the sensation was so strong as to resemble what is called a mirage in the desert or a calenture on board ship when lakes are seen in the desert and silvan landscapes in the sea it was very distressing yesterday and brought to my mind the fancies of bishop berkeley about an ideal world there was a vile sense of want of reality in all i did and said it made me gloomy and out of spirits though i flatter myself it was not observed the bodily feeling which most resembles this unpleasing hallucination is the giddy state which follows profuse bleeding when one feels as if walking on featherbeds and could not find a secure footing i think the stomach has something to do with it i drank several glasses of wine but these only augmented the disorder i did not find the in vino veritas of the philosophers something of this insane feeling remains today but a trifle only  february 18i had other work to do this day in the morning corrected proofs after breakfast made a visit or two and met sandie buchanan whom it joys me to see then despatched all my sheriff processes save one which hitches for want of some papers lastly here i am before dinner with my journal i sent all the county money to andrew lang wrote to mr reynolds too methinks i will let them have the tales which jem ballantyne and cadell quarrelled with133 i have asked £500 for thempretty well that i suppose they will be fools enough to give it me in troth shell no pe cheaper  february 19a day of hard and continued work the result being eight pages but then i hardly ever quitted the table save at mealtime so eight pages of my manuscript may be accounted the maximum of my literary labour it is equal to forty printed pages of the novels i had the whole of this day at my own disposal by the voluntary kindness of sir robert dundas interfering to take up my duty at the court the proofs of my sermons are arrived but i have had no time saving to blot out some flummery which poor gordon had put into the preface134  february 20another day of labour but not so hard i worked from eight till three with little intermission but only accomplished four pages then i went out and made a visit or two and looked in on cadell if i get two pages in the evening i will be satisfied for volume ii may be concluded with the week or run over to sunday at most will it tell this work i doubt it but there is no standing still  a certain mr mackay from ireland called on me an active agent it would seem about the reform of prisons he exclaims justly i have no doubt about the state of our lockup house for myself i have some distrust of the fanaticismeven of philanthropy a good part of it arises in general from mere vanity and love of distinction gilded over to others and to themselves with some show of benevolent sentiment the philanthropy of howard mingled with his illusage of his son seems to have risen to a pitch of insanity yet without such extraordinary men who call attention to the subject by their own peculiarities prisons would have remained the same dungeons which they were forty or fifty years ago i do not see the propriety of making them dandy places of detention they should be a place of punishment and that can hardly be if men are lodged better and fed better than when they are at large the separation of ranks is an excellent distinction and is nominally provided for in all modern prisons but the size of most of them is inadequate to the great increase of crime and so the pack is shuffled together again for want of room to keep them separate there are several prisons constructed on excellent principles the economy of which becomes deranged so soon as the death takes place of some keen philanthropist who had the business of a whole committee which having lost him remained like a carcass without a head but i have never seen a plan for keeping in order these resorts of guilt and misery without presupposing a superintendence of a kind which might perhaps be exercised could we turn out upon the watch a guard of angels but alas jailors and turnkeys are rather like angels of a different livery nor do i see how it is possible to render them otherwise superintendence is all you can trust to and superintendence save in some rare cases is hard to come by where it is to be vigilantly and constantly exercised quis custodiet ipsos custodes as to reformation i have no great belief in it when the ordinary class of culprits who are vicious from ignorance or habit are the subjects of the experiment a shave from a broken loaf is thought as little of by the male set of delinquents as by the fair frail the state of society now leads so much to great accumulations of humanity that we cannot wonder if it ferment and reek like a compost dunghill nature intended that population should be diffused over the soil in proportion to its extent we have accumulated in huge cities and smothering manufactories the numbers which should be spread over the face of a country and what wonder that they should be corrupted we have turned healthful and pleasant brooks into morasses and pestiferous lakeswhat wonder the soil should be unhealthy a great deal i think might be done by executing the punishment of death without a chance of escape in all cases to which it should be found properly applicable of course these occasions being diminished to one out of twenty to which capital punishment is now assigned our ancestors brought the country to order by kilting135 thieves and banditti with strings so did the french when at naples and bandits became for the time unheard of when once the evil habit is alteredwhen men are taught a crime of a certain character is connected inseparably with death the moral habits of a population become altered and you may in the next age remit the punishment which in this it has been necessary to inflict with stern severity i think whoever pretends to reform a corrupted nation or a disorderly regiment or an illordered ship of war must begin by severity and only resort to gentleness when he has acquired the complete mastery by terrorthe terror being always attached to the law and the impression once made he can afford to govern with mildness and lay the iron rule aside  mr mackay talked big of the excellent state of prisons in ireland jen doute un peu that the warmhearted and generous irish would hurry eagerly into any scheme which had benevolence for its motive i readily believe but that pat should have been able to maintain that calm allseeing allenduring species of superintendence necessary to direct the working of the best plan of prison discipline i greatly hesitate to believe  well leaving all this i wish mr mackay good luck with some little doubt of his success but none of his intentions i am come in my work to that point where a lady who works a stocking must count by threads and bring the various loose ends of my story together they are too many  february 21last night after dinner i rested from my work and read third part of theodore hooks sayings and doings which shows great knowledge of life in a certain sphere and very considerable powers of wit which somewhat damages the effect of the tragic parts but he is an able writer and so much of his work is well said that it will carry through what is manqué i hope the same good fortune for other folks  i am watching and waiting till i hit on some quaint and clever mode of extricating but do not see a glimpse of any one james b too discourages me a good deal by his silence waiting i suppose to be invited to disgorge a full allowance of his critical bile but he may wait long enough for i am discouraged enough now here is the advantage of edinburgh in the country if a sense of inability once seizes me it haunts me from morning to night but in edinburgh the time is so occupied and frittered away by official duties and chance occupation that you have not time to play master stephen and be gentlemanlike and melancholy136 on the other hand you never feel in town those spiritstirring influencesthose glances of sunshine that make amends for clouds and mist the country is said to be quieter life not to me i am sure in the town the business i have to do hardly costs me more thought than just occupies my mind and i have as much of gossip and ladylike chat as consumes the time pleasantly enough in the country i am thrown entirely on my own resources and there is no medium betwixt happiness and the reverse  february 22went to court and remained there until one oclock then to mr colvin smiths and sat to be stared at till three oclock this is a great bore even when you have a companion sad when you are alone and can only disturb the painter by your chatter after dinner i had proofs to the number of four jb is outrageous about the death of oliver proudfoot one of the characters but i have a humour to be cruel      his business tis to die  received a present from a mr dobie of a candlestick said to be that of the rev mr guthrie minister of fenwick in the seventeenth centuryvery civil of a gentleman unknown if there comes no request to look over poems or to get made a gauger or the like for i have seen that kind of compliment made on the principle on which small balloons are sent up before a large one to see how the wind sits after dinner proofsheets  february 23morning proofsheets galore then to parliament house after that at one down to sir william macleod bannatyne who has made some discoveries concerning bannatyne the collector of poetry and furnished me with some notes to that purpose he informs me that the macleod alias maccruiskin who met dr johnson on the isle of skye was mr alexander macleod advocate a son of macleod of muiravonside he was subject to fits of insanity at times very clever at others137 sir william mentioned the old laird of bernera who summoned by his chief to join him with all the men he could make when the chief was raising his men for government sent him a letter to this purposedear lairdno man would like better to be at your back than i would but on this occasion it cannot be i send my men who are at your service for myself higher duties carry me elsewhere he went off accordingly alone and joined raasay as a volunteer i returned by the printing office and found jb in great feather he tells me cadell on squaring his books and making allowance for bad debts has made between £3000 and £4000 lodged in bank he does nothing but with me thus we stand on velvet as to finance met staffa138 who walked with me and gave me some gaelic words which i wanted  i may mention that i saw at the printingoffice a part of a review on leigh hunts anecdotes of byron it is written with power apparently by professor wilson but with a degree of passion which rather diminishes the effect for nothing can more lessen the dignity of the satirist than being or seeming to be in a passion i think it may come to a bloody arbitrament139 for if lh should take it up as a gentleman wilson is the last man to flinch i hope lockhart will not be dragged in as second or otherwise went to jeffreys to dinnerthere were mrs and miss sydney smith lords gillies and corehouse etc etc  february 24i fancy i had drunk a glass or two over much last night for i have the heartburn this morning but a little magnesia salves that sore meantime i have had an inspiration which shows me my good angel has not left me for these two or three days i have been at what the critic calls a deadlock140all my incidents and personages ran into a gordian knot of confusion to which i could devise no possible extrication i had thought on the subject several days with something like the despair which seized the fair princess commanded by her ugly stepmother to assort a whole garret full of tangled silk threads of every kind and colour when in comes prince percinet with a wand whisks it over the miscellaneous mass and lo all the threads are as nicely arranged as in a seamstress housewife it has often happened to me that when i went to bed with my head as ignorant as my shoulders what i was to do next i have waked in the morning with a distinct and accurate conception of the mode good or bad in which the plot might be extricated it seems to me that the action of the intellect on such occasions is rather accelerated by the little fever which an extra glass of wine produces on the system of course excess is out of the question now this may seem strange but it is quite true and it is no less so that i have generally written to the middle of one of these novels without having the least idea how it was to end in short in the hab nab at a venture style of composition so now this hitch being over i fold my paper lock up my journal and proceed to labour with good hope  february 25this being monday i carried on my work according to the new model dined at home and in quiet but i may notice that yesterday mr williams the learned rector of our new academy who now leaves us took his dinner here we had a long philological têteàtête he is opinionative as he has some title to be but very learned and with a juster view of his subject than is commonly entertained for he traces words to the same sourcenot from sound but sense he casts backwards thus to the root while many compare the ends of the twigs without going further  this night i went to the funeral of mr henderson late of eildon hall a kindhearted man who rose to great wealth by honest means and will be missed and regretted  in the evening i went to the promenade in the exhibition of pictures which was splendidly lighted up and filled with fashionable company i think there was a want of beautyor perhaps the gaslights were unfavourable to the ladies looks  february 26business filled up the day till one when i sat to mr smith tedious work even though will clerk chaperoned me we dined at archie swintons met lord lothian lord cringletie etc this day i have wrought almost nothing but i am nearly half a volume before the press lord morton141 married to a daughter of my friend sir george rose is come to edinburgh he seems a very gentlemanlike man and she pleasing and willing to be pleased i had the pleasure to be of some little use to him in his election as one of the scottish peers i owe sir george rose much for his attention to walter at berlin  february 27at court till halfpast two then to the waterloo tavern where we had a final and totally unfructuous meeting with the committee of the coal gas people so now my journey to london is resolved on i shall lose at least £500 by the job and get little thanks from those i make the sacrifice for but the sacrifice shall be made anything is better than to break ones word or desert a sinking vessel heartily do i wish these colliers had seen the matter in the best light for their own interest but there is no help one thing is certain that i shall see my whole family once more around me and that is worth the £500 anne too starts at the idea of the sea i am horribly vexed however gibson always expected they would come in but there seemed to me little chance of it perhaps they thought we were not serious in our proposal to push through the act wrought a little in the evening not much  february 28at court till four when i came home i did work a little but as we expected company it was not to much purpose lord chief commissioner dined with us with miss adam mr hutchinson brother of lord donoughmore and miss jones will clerk and john thomson made up the party and we had a pleasant evening as such a handful always secures stayed till wineandwater time thus flew another day  february 29i had my proofsheets as usual in the morning and the court as usual till two then one or two visits and corrected the discourses for gordon this is really a foolish scrape but what could i do it involved the poor lads relief from something very like ruin i got a letter from the young man reynolds accepting on heaths part my terms for article to the keepsake namely £500i to be at liberty to reprint the article in my works after three years mr heath to print it in the keepsake as long and often as he pleases but not in any other form i shall close with them if i make my proposed bargain with murray all pecuniary matters will be easy in an unusual degree dined at robert hamiltons with lord and lady belhaven walter campbell and a number of westlanders  footnotes

such a causebut he must also have had very sad recollections of the bloody results of the two melancholy duels arising from the same party rancour in february 1821 scott and christie and in march 1822 stuart and boswell with all the untold domestic miseries accompanying them it is satisfactory to think that this was about the last of these uncalled for literary onslaughts as one finds in turning over the pages of blackwood that in 1834 professor wilson in the noctes rebukes some one for reviving forgotten falsehoods praises leigh hunts london journal and adds the ecstatic words which he also addressed later on to lord jeffrey the animosities are mortal but the humanities live for ever  140 act iii sc 1  141 sholto douglas eighteenth earl of morton     march   march 1wrought a little this morning always creeping on we had a hard pull at the court and after it i walked a little for exercise as i fear indigestion from dining out so often  dined today with the bankers who went as delegates to london in malachi malagrowthers days sir john hay kinnear and tom allan were my only acquaintances of the party the rest seemed shrewd capable men i particularly remarked a mr sandeman with as intellectual a head as i ever witnessed  march 2a day of hard work with little interruption and completed volume second i am not much pleased with it it wants what i desire it to have and that is passion  the two ballantynes and mr cadell dined with me quietly heard from london all well  march 3i set about clearing my desk of unanswered letters which i had suffered to accumulate to an augean heap i daresay i wrote twenty cards that might have been written at the time without halfaminute being lost to do everything when it ought to be done is the soul of expedition but then if you are interrupted eternally with these petty avocations the current of the mind is compelled to flow in shallows and you lose the deep intensity of thought which alone can float plans of depth and magnitude i sometimes wish i were one of those formalists who can assign each hour of the day its special occupations not to be encroached upon but it always returns upon my mind that i do better à la débandade than i could with rules of regular study a work begun is with me a stone turned over with the purpose of rolling it down hill the first revolutions are made with difficultybut vires acquirit eundo now were the said stone arrested in its progress the whole labour would be to commence again to take a less conceited simile i am like a spavined horse who sets out lame and stiff but when he warms in his gear makes a pretty good trot of it so that it is better to take a good stage of him while you can get it besides after all i have known most of those formalists who were not men of business or of office to whom hours are prescribed as a part of duty but who voluntarily make themselves      slaves to an hour and vassals to a bell142  to be what i call very poor creatures  general ainslie looked in and saddened me by talking of poor don the general is a medallist and entertains an opinion that the bonnetpiece of james v is the work of some scottish artist who died young and never did anything else it is far superior to anything which the mint produced since the roman denarii he also told me that the name of andrea de ferrara is famous in italy as an armourer  dined at home and went to the royal society in the evening after sending off my processes for the sheriff court also went after the society to mr james russells symposium  march 4a letter from italy signed js with many acute remarks on inaccuracies in the life of bonaparte  his tone is hostile decidedly but that shall not prevent my making use of all his corrections where just  the wretched publication of leigh hunt on the subject of byron is to bring forward tom moores life of that distinguished poet and i am honoured and flattered by the information that he means to dedicate it to me143  a great deal of worry in the court today and i lost my spectacles and was a dark and perplexed manfound them again though wrote to lockhart and to charles and will do more if i can but am sadly done up an old friend came and pressed unmercifully some selfish request of his own to ask somebody to do something for his son i shall be glad to be at abbotsford to get rid of this town where i have not in the proper and social sense of the word a single friend whose company pleases me in the country i have always tom purdie  dined at the lord chief commissioners where i met the first time for thirty years my old friend and boon companion with whom i shared the wars of bacchus venus and sometimes of mars the past rushed on me like a flood and almost brought tears into my eyes it is no very laudable exploit to record but i once drank three bottles of wine with this same roguesir william forbes and sir alexander wood being of the party david erskine of cardross keeps his looks better than most of our contemporaries i hope we shall meet for a longer time  march 5i corrected sheets and being a teind wednesday began the second volume and proceeded as far as page fourth  we dined at hector macdonalds with several highlanders most of whom were in their garb intending to go to a great fancy ball in the evening there were young cluny macpherson campbell airds campbell saddell and others of the race of diarmid i went for an hour to the ball where there were many gay and some grotesque figures a dressed ball is for the first halfhour a splendid spectacle you see youth and beauty dressed in their gayest attire unlimited save by their own taste and enjoying the conscious power of charming which gives such life and alacrity to the features but the charm ceases in this like everything else the want of masks takes away the audacity with which the disguised parties conduct themselves at a masquerade and leaves the sullen sheepishness which makes them i suppose the worst maskers in europe at the only real masquerade which i have known in edinburgh there were many if not most of those who had determined to sustain characters who had more illbreeding than facetiousness the jests were chiefly calculated to give pain and two or three quarrels were with difficulty prevented from ripening into duels a fancy ball has no offence in it therefore cannot be wrecked on this rock but on the other hand it is horribly dull work when the first coup dœil is over  there were some good figures and some grossly absurd a very gay cavalier with a broad bright battleaxe was pointed out to me as an eminent distiller and another knight in the black coarse armour of a cuirassier of the 17th century stalked about as if he thought himself the very mirror of chivalry he was the son of a celebrated upholsterer so might claim the broad axe from more titles than one there was some good dancing cluny macpherson footed it gallantly  march 6wrote two pages this morning before breakfast went to the court where i learned that the colliers are in alarm at the determination shown by our committee and are willing to give better terms i hope this is sobut cogan na shiepeace or war i care not i never felt less anxiety about where i went and what i did a feather just lighted on the ground can scarce be less concerned where the next blast may carry it if i go i shall see my childrenif i stay i shall mend my fortune dined at home and went to the play in the evening lady torphichen had commanded the play and there were all my swinton cousins young and old the play was a bold stroke for a wife144charles kemble acting as feignwell the plot is extravagant nonsense but with lively acting the ludicrousness of the situation bears it through and few comedies act better after this came rob roy where the bailie played with his usual excellence the piece was not over until near one in the morning yet i did not feel tiredwhich is much  march 7today i wrought and corrected proofsheets went to the court and had a worry at the usual trashy small wares which are presented at the end of a session an official predecessor of mine the facetious robert sinclair was wont to say the three last days of the session should be abolished by act of parliament145 came home late and was a good deal broken in upon by visitors amongst others john swinton now of swinton brought me the skull of his ancestor sir allan swinton who flourished five hundred years ago i will get a cast made of the stout old carle it is rare to see a genuine relic of the mortal frame drawing so far back went to my lord gilliess to dinner and witnessed a singular exhibition of personification  miss stirling grame146 a lady of the duntroon family from which clavers was descended looks like thirty years old and has a face of the scottish cast with a good expression in point of good sense and good humour her conversation so far as i have had the advantage of hearing it is shrewd and sensible but no ways brilliant she dined with us went off as to the play and returned in the character of an old scottish lady her dress and behaviour were admirable and the conversation unique i was in the secret of course did my best to keep up the ball but she cut me out of all feather the prosing account she gave of her son the antiquary who found an auld wig in a slate quarry was extremely ludicrous and she puzzled the professor of agriculture with a merciless account of the succession of crops in the parks around her old mansionhouse no person to whom the secret was not intrusted had the least guess of an impostor except one shrewd young lady present who observed the hand narrowly and saw it was plumper than the age of the lady seemed to warrant this lady and miss bell147 of coldstream have this gift of personification to a much higher degree than any person i ever saw  march 8wrote in the morning then to court where we had a sederunt till nigh two oclock from thence to the coal gas committee with whom we held another and thank god a final meeting gibson went with me they had mr munro trotter tom burns and inglis the scene put me in mind of chichester cheynes story of a shawnee indian and himself dodging each other from behind trees for six or seven hours each in the hope of a successful shot there was bullying on both sides but we bullied to best purpose for we must have surrendered at discretion notwithstanding the bold face we put on it on the other hand i am convinced they have got a capital bargain  march 9i set about arranging my papers a task which i always take up with the greatest possible illwill and which makes me cruelly nervous i dont know why it should be so for i have nothing particularly disagreeable to look at far from it i am better than i was at this time last year my hopes firmer my health stronger my affairs bettered and bettering yet i feel an inexpressible nervousness in consequence of this employment the memory though it retains all that has passed has closed sternly over it and this rummaging like a bucket dropped suddenly into a well deranges and confuses the ideas which slumbered on the mind i am nervous and i am bilious and in a word i am unhappy this is wrong very wrong and it is reasonably to be apprehended that something of serious misfortune will be the deserved punishment of this pusillanimous lowness of spirits strange that one who in most things may be said to have enough of the care na by should be subject to such vile weakness well having written myself down an ass i will daub it no farther but een trifle till the humour of work comes  before the humour came i had two or three long visits drummond hay the antiquary and lyonherald came in148 i do not know anything which relieves the mind so much from the sullens as trifling discussion about antiquarian oldwomanries it is like knitting a stocking diverting the mind without occupying it or it is like by our lady a milldam which leads ones thoughts gently and imperceptibly out of the channel in which they are chafing and boiling to be sure it is only conducting them to turn a childs mill what signifies thatthe diversion is a relief though the object is of little importance i cannot tell what we talked of but i remember we concluded with a lamentation on the unlikelihood that government would give the museum £2000 to purchase the bronze apollo lately discovered in france although the god of delos stands six feet two in his stockingsoles and is perfectly entire saving that on the right side he wants half a hip and the leg from the knee and that on the left his heel is much damaged colonel ferguson just come to towndines with us  march 10i had a world of trumpery to do this morning cards to write and business to transact visits to make etc received letters from the youth who is to conduct the keepsake with blarney on a £200 bank note no blarney in that i must set about doing something for these worthies i was obliged to go alone to dine at mr scott galas met the sinclair family lady sinclair told me a singular story of a decrepit man keeping a lonely toll at a place called the rowantree on the frontiers as i understood between ayrshire and dumfriesshire wigtownshire it was a wild lonely spot and was formerly inhabited by robbers and assassins who murdered passengers they were discovered by a boy whom they had taken into the cottage as a menial he had seen things which aroused his attention and was finally enlightened as to the trade of his masters by hearing one of them as he killed a goat remark that the cries of the creature resembled those of the last man they had dealt with the boy fled from the house lodged an information and the whole household was seized and executed the present inhabitants lady sinclair described as interesting the mans feet and legs had been frostbitten while herding the cattle and never recovered the strength of natural limbs yet he had acquired some education and was a country schoolmaster for some time till the distance and loneliness of the spot prevented pupils from attending his daughter was a reader and begged for some old magazines newspapers or any printed book that she might enjoy reading they might have been better had they been allowed to keep a cow but if they had been in comfortable circumstances they would have had visitors and lodgers who might have carried guns to destroy the gentlemans creation ie game and for this risk the wretches were kept in absolute and abject poverty i would rather behimself than this brutal earl the daughter showed lady sinclair a well in the midst of a small bog of great depth into which like thurtell and probert they used to thrust the bodies of their victims till they had an opportunity of burying them lady sinclair stooped to taste the water but the young woman said with a strong expression of horror you would not drink it such an impression had the tale probably two centuries old made upon the present inhabitants of this melancholy spot the whole legend is curious i will try to get hold of it149  march 11i sent reynolds a sketch of two scottish stories for subjects of art for his keepsakethe death of the lairds jock the one the other the adventure of duncan stuart with the stag  mr drummond hay breakfasted with mea good fellow but a considerable bore he brought me a beautiful bronze statue of hercules about ten inches or a foot in height beautifully wrought he bought it in france for 70 francs and refused £300 from payne knight it is certainly a most beautiful piece of art the lions hide which hung over the shoulders had been of silver and to turn it to account the arm over which it hung was cut off otherwise the statue was perfect and extremely well wrought allan swintons skull sent back to archibald swinton  march 12the boy got four leaves of copy today and i wrote three more received by mr cadell from treuttel and wurtz for articles in foreign review £52 10s which is at my credit with him poor gillies has therefore kept his word so far but it is enough to have sacrificed £100 to him already in literary labour which i make him welcome to i cannot spare him morewhich besides would do him no good  march 13 abbotsfordi wrote a little in the morning and sent off some copy we came off from edinburgh at ten oclock and got to abbotsford by four where everything looks unusually advanced the birds singing and the hedges budding and all other prospects of spring too premature to be rejoiced in  i found that like the foolish virgins the servants had omitted to get oil for my lamp so i was obliged to be idle all the evening but though i had a diverting book the tales of the munster festivals150 yet an evening without writing hung heavy on my hands the tales are admirable but they have one fault that the crisis is in more cases than one protracted after a keen interest has been excited to explain and to resume parts of the story which should have been told before scenes of mere amusement are often introduced betwixt the crisis of the plot and the final catastrophe this is impolitic but the scenes and characters are traced by a firm bold and true pencil and my very criticism shows that the catastrophe is interestingotherwise who would care for its being interrupted  march 14 to 16the same record applies to these three days from seven to halfpast nine writingfrom halfpast nine to a quarter past ten a hearty breakfast from eleven or thereby to one or two wrote again and from one or two ride drive or walk till dinnertimefor two or three hoursfive till seven dine and rest yourselfseven till nine wrote two pages more from nine to quarter past ten lounge read the papers and then go to bed if your story is tolerably forward you may i think keep at this rate for twelve days which would be a volume but no brain could hold it out longer wrote two additional leaves in the evening  march 17sent away copy this morning to jb with proofs i then wrote all the day till two oclock walked round the thicket and by the waterside and returning set to work again so that i have finished five leaves before dinner and may discuss two more if i can satisfy myself with the way of winding up the story there are always at the end such a plaguey number of stitches to take up which usually are never so well done but they make a botch i will try if the cigar will inspire me hitherto i have been pretty clear and i see my way well enough only doubt of making others see it with sufficient simplicity but it is near five and i am too hungry to write more151      ego nunquam potui scribere jejunus  march 18i was sorely worried by the black dog this morning that vile palpitation of the heartthat tremor cordisthat hysterical passion which forces unbidden sighs and tears and falls upon a contented life like a drop of ink on white paper which is not the less a stain because it conveys no meaning i wrought three leaves however and the story goes on i dined at the club of the selkirkshire yeomanry now disbanded      the eldrich knight gave up his arms     with many a sorrowful sigh  the dissolution of the yeomanry was the act of the last ministry the present did not alter the measure on account of the expense saved i am one of the oldest if not the very oldest yeoman in scotland and have seen the rise progress and now the fall of this very constitutional part of the national force its efficacy on occasions of insurrection was sufficiently proved in the radical time but besides it kept up a spirit of harmony between the proprietors of land and the occupiers and made them known to and beloved by each other and it gave to the young men a sort of military and highspirited character which always does honour to a country the manufacturers are in great glee on this occasion i wish parliament as they have turned the yeoman adrift somewhat scornfully may not have occasion to roar them in again152  march 19i applied myself again to my labour my mind flowing in a less gloomy current than yesterday i laboured with little interruption excepting a walk as far as faldonside with the dogs and at night i had not finished more than three leaves but indeed it is pretty fair i must not work my brains too hard in case of provoking the hypochondria which extreme exertion or entire indolence are equally unfavourable to  march 20thomson breakfasted i left him soon being desirous to finish my labours the volume is finished all but one fourth or somewhat shorter four days should despatch it easily but i have letters to write and things are getting into disorder i took a drive with my daughter for exercise and called at huntly burn this evening went on with work as usual there was not above four pages finished but my conscience is quiet on my exertions  march 21i received young whytbank to breakfast and talked genealogy which he understands well i have not a head for it i only value it as interspersed with anecdote whytbanks relationship and mine exists by the shaws a younger brother of shaw of sauchie afterwards greenock chief of the name was minister of the kirk of selkirk my greatgrandfather john rutherford minister of the gospel at yarrow married one of this reverend gentlemans daughters and john pringle rector of fogo greatgrandfather of the present whytbank married another it was christian shaw my grandmother who possessed the manuscript respecting the murder of the shaws by the master of sinclair153 she could not according to the reckoning of that age be a distant relation whytbank parted agreeing to return to dinner to meet the bride and bridegroom i had little time to write for colonel russell my cousin called between one and two and he also agreed to stay dinner so i had a walk of three hours with him in the plantations at dinner we had mr and mrs bruce mr scrope mrs and dr brewster whytbank russell and young nicol milne who will be a pleasant lad if he had a little polish i was glad of the society as i had rather felt the besoin de parler which was perhaps one cause of my recent dumps scrope and colonel russell stayed all night the rest went home  march 22had a packet from jameslow about the novel but i had another from cadell equally uppish he proposes for three novels in eighteen months which would be £12600 well i like the booksellers predictions better than the printers neither are bad judges but james who is the best is not sensible of historical descriptions and likes your novel style out and out  cadells letter also contained a state of cash matters since much improved i will arrange them a day or two hence i wrote today and took a long walk the thought more than once passed over me why go to london i shall but throw away £150 or £200 which were better saved then on the other hand it is such a gratification to see all the children that i must be tempted if i were alone i could scrub it but theres no doing that with anne  march 23i wrought regularly till one and then took the wood and marked out to tom the places i would have thinned particularly at the carlins hole which will require much thinning i had a letter from cadell stating that 3000 tales of a grandfather must go to press bringing a return to me of £240 the price being £80 per thousand this is snug enough and will prettily cover my london journey and i really think ought in fairness to silence my prudential remorse with my usual delight in catching an apology for escaping the regular task of the day i threw by the novel of st valentines eve and began to run through and correct the grandfathers tales for the press if i live to finish them they will be a good thing for my younger children if i work to the amount of £10000 a year for the creditors i think i may gain a few hundreds for my own family at byhours  march 24sent copy and proof to jb154 i continued my revision of the tales of a grandfather till halfpast one then went to torwoodlee to wait on george pringle and his bride we did not see the young people but the old laird and miss pringle gave us a warm reception and seemed very happy on the occasion we had friends to dinner mr and mrs theobald charles kerr and his wife my old acquaintance magdalen hepburn whose whole kin was known to me and mine i have now seen the fifth generation of the family in mrs kerrs little girl who travels with them welli partly wish we had been alone yet it is perhaps better we made our day out tolerably well having the advantage of mr davidoff and his friend mr collyer to assist us  march 25mr and mrs kerr left us mr davidoff and mr collyer also mr davidoff showed himself a good deal affected i hope well of this young nobleman and trust the result will justify my expectations but it may be doubted if his happiness be well considered by those who send a young person destined to spend his life under a despotic government to receive the ideas and opinions of such a people as we are          where ignorance is bliss     tis folly to be wise155  we drove as far as yair with mr and mrs theobald the lady read after dinnerand read well  march 26the theobalds left us giving me time to work a little a walk of two hours diversified my day i received cadells scheme for the new edition i fear the trustees will think cadells plan expensive in the execution yet he is right for to ensure a return of speedy sale the new edition should be both handsome and cheap he proposes size a royal 12mo with a capital engraving to each volume from a design by the best artists this infers a monstrous expense but in the present humour of the public ensures the sale the price will be 5s per volume and the whole set 32 volumes from waverley to woodstock included will be £8  march 27this also was a day of labour affording only my usual interval of a walk five or six sheets was the result we now appropinque an end my story has unhappily a divided interest there are three distinct strands of the rope and they are not well twisted together ah sirs a foul fawt as captain tommy says  march 28the days have little to distinguish each other very little the morning study the noontide walk all monotonous and inclined to be melancholy god help me but i have not had any nervous attack read tales of an antiquary156 one of the chime of bells which i have some hand in setting aringing he is really entitled to the name of an antiquary but he has too much description in proportion to the action there is a capital wardrobe of properties but the performers do not act up to their character  march 29finished volume third this morning i have let no grass grow beneath my heels this bout  mr cadell with j and a ballantyne came to dinner mr and mrs george pringle new married dined with us and old torwoodlee sandys music made the evening go sweetly down  march 30a long discourse with cadell canvassing his scheme he proposes i should go on immediately with the new novel this will furnish a fund from which may be supplied the advances necessary for the new work which are considerable and may reach from £4000 to £8000the last sum quite improbablebefore it makes returns thus we can face the expenditure necessary to set on foot our great work i have written to recommend the plan to john gibson this theme renewed from time to time during the forenoon dr clarkson157 dined with us we smoked and had whisky and water after  march 31the ballantynes and cadell left us in high spirits expecting much from the new undertaking and i believe they are not wrong as for me i became torpid after a great influx of morning visitors      i grew vapourish and odd       and would not do the least right thing     neither for goddess nor for god       nor paint nor jest nor laugh nor sing  i was quite reluctant to write letters or do anything whatsoever and yet i should surely write to sir cuthbert sharp and surtees we dined alone i was main stupid indeed and much disposed to sleep though my dinner was very moderate  footnotes  142 oldhamlines addressed to a friend about to leave the universitypoems and translations 8vo lond 1694  143 on the 20th april moore writes to scott i am

still the charm and the delight as well as the centre of a large circle of friends one saw a quiet unpretending sensible shrewd kindly little lady perhaps you would not remark anything extraordinary in her but let her put on the old lady it was as if a warlock spell had passed over her not merely her look but her nature was changed her spirit had passed into the character she represented and jest quick retort whimsical fancy the wildest nonsense flowed from her lips with a freedom and truth to nature which appeared to be impossible in her own personality  with this faculty for satire and imitation miss graham never used it to give pain she was as much at home too with old scotch sayings as sir walter himself for example speaking of a field of cold wet land she said it grat a winter and girned a simmer and of herself one morning at breakfast when she thought she was getting too much attention from her guests she was at this time over ninety she exclaimed im like the bride in the

april 1all fools day the only saint that keeps up some degree of credit in the world for fools we are with a vengeance on this memorable festival we played the fool with great decorum at colonel fergusons going to visit them in a cold morning in the evening i had a distressing letter from mrs macbarnet or some such name the daughter of captain macpherson smothered in a great snow storm they are very angry at the review for telling a rawhead and bloody bones story about him i have given the right version of the tale willingly but this does not satisfy i almost wish they would turn out a clansman to be free of the cumber the vexation of having to do with ladies who on such a point must be unreasonable is very great with a man it would be soon ended or mended it really hurts my sleep  april 2i wrote the lady as civilly as i could explaining why i made no further apology which may do some good then a cursed morning of putting to rights which drives me wellnigh mad at two or three i must go to a funerala happy and interesting relief from my employment it is a man i am sorry for who married my old servant bell ormiston he was an excellent person in his way and a capital masona great curler  april 3set off at eight oclock and fought forward to carlislea sad place in my domestic remembrances since here i married my poor charlotte she is gone and i am following faster perhaps than i wot of it is something to have lived and loved and our poor children are so hopeful and affectionate that it chastens the sadness attending the thoughts of our separation we slept at carlisle i have not forgiven them for destroying their quiet old walls and building two lumpy things like madhouses the old gates had such a respectable appearance once      when scotsmens heads did guard the wall  come ill write down the whole stanza which is all that was known to exist of david humes poetry as it was written on a pane of glass in the inn      here chicks in eggs for breakfast sprawl     here godless boys gods glories squall     here scotsmens heads do guard the wall     but corbys walks atone for all  the poetical works of david hume esq might as bookmakers know now be driven out to

history of 1745 with minute memoirs of such as mounted guard on the scotch gate i remember the spikes the heads stood upon lastly a description of corby castle with a plan and the genealogy of the howards gad the booksellers would give me £500 for it i have a mind to print it for the bannatynians  april 4in our stage to penrith i introduced anne to the ancient petreia called old penrith and also to the grave of sir ewain cæsarias158 that knight with the puzzling name which has got more indistinct we breakfasted at buchanans inn penrith one of the best on the road and a fine stanch fellow owned it he refused passage to some of the delegates who traversed the country during the radical row and when the worthies threatened him with popular vengeance answered gallantly that he had not lived so long by the crown to desert it at a pinch the crown is the sign of his inn slept at garstang an indifferent house as a petty grievance my inkholder broke loose in the case and spilt some of the ink on annes pelisse misfortunes seldom come single tis not alone the inky cloak good daughter but i forgot at garstang my two breastpins one with walter and janes hair another a harp of pure irish gold the gift of the ladies of llangollen159  april 5breakfasted at chorley and slept at leek we were in the neighbourhood of some fine rockscenery but the day was unfavourable besides i did not come from scotland to see rocks i trow  april 6easter sunday we breakfasted at ashbourne and went from thence to derby and set off from thence to drycot hall five miles to visit hugh scott but honest hugh was like ourselves on the ramble so we had nothing to do but to drive back to derby and from thence to tamworth where we slept  april 7we visited the castle in the morning it is inhabited by a brotherinlaw of the proprietor and who is the proprietor why mr robbins said the fat housekeeper this was not a name quite according with the fine chivalrous old hall in which there was no small quantity of armour and odds and ends which i would have been glad to possess well but madam before mr robbins bought the place who was the proprietor lord charles townshend sir this would not do neither but a genealogy hanging above the chimneypiece informed me that the ferrars were the ancient possessors of the mansion which indeed the horseshoes in the shield over the castle gate might have intimated tamworth is a fine old place neglected but therefore more like hoar antiquity the keep is round the apartments appear to have been modernised tempore jac imi there was a fine demipique saddle said to have been that of james ii the pommel rose and finished off in the form of a swans crest capital for a bad horseman to hold on by  to show anne what was well worth seeing we visited kenilworth the relentless rain only allowed us a glimpse of this memorable ruin well the last time i was here in 1815160 these trophies of time were quite neglected now they approach so much nearer the splendour of thundertentronckh as to have a door at least if not windows they are in short preserved and protected so much for the novels i observed decent children begging here a thing uncommon in england and i recollect the same unseemly practice formerly  we went to warwick castle the neighbourhood of leamington a wateringplace of some celebrity has obliged the family to decline showing the castle after ten oclock i tried the virtue of an old acquaintance with lord warwick and wrote to him he being in the courthouse where the assizes were sitting after some delay we were admitted and i found my old friend mrs hume in the most perfect preservation though as she tells me now eightyeight she went through her duty wonderfully though now and then she complained of her memory she has laid aside a mass of black plumes which she wore on her head and which resembled the casque in the castle of otranto warwick castle is still the noblest sight in england lord and lady warwick came home from the court and received us most kindly we lunched with them but declined further hospitality when i was last here and for many years before the unfortunate circumstances of the late lord w threw an air of neglect about everything i believe the fine collection of pictures would have been sold by distress if mrs hume my friend had not redeemed them at her own cost161 i was pleased to see lord warwick show my old friend kindness and attention we visited the monuments of the nevilles and beauchamps names which make the heart thrill the monuments are highly preserved we concluded the day at stratforduponavon  april 8we visited the tomb of the mighty wizard it is in the bad taste of james the firsts reign but what a magic does the locality possess there are stately monuments of forgotten families but when you have seen shakspeares what care we for the rest all around is shakspeares exclusive property i noticed the monument of his friend john a combe immortalised as drawing forth a brief satirical notice of four lines  after breakfast i asked after mrs ormsby the old mad woman who was for some time tenant of shakspeares house and conceived herself to be descended from the immortal poet i learned she was dying i thought to send her a sovereign but this extension of our tour has left me no more than will carry me through my journey and i do not like to run short upon the road so i take credit for my good intention andkeep my sovereigna cheap and not unusual mode of giving charity  learning from washington irvings description of stratford that the hall of sir thomas lucy the justice who rendered warwickshire too hot for shakspeare and drove him to london was still extant we went in quest of it  charlcote is in high preservation and inhabited by mr lucy descendant of the worshipful sir thomas the hall is about three hundred years old an old brick structure with a gatehouse in advance it is surrounded by venerable oaks realising the imagery which shakspeare loved so well to dwell upon rich verdant pastures extend on every side and numerous herds of deer were reposing in the shade all showed that the lucy family had retained their land and beeves while we were surveying the antlered old hall with its painted glass and family pictures mr lucy came to welcome us in person and to show the house with the collection of paintings which seems valuable and to which he had made many valuable additions  he told me the park from which shakspeare stole the buck was not that which surrounds charlcote but belonged to a mansion at some distance where sir thomas lucy resided at the time of the trespass the tradition went that they hid the buck in a barn part of which was standing a few years ago but now totally decayed this park no longer belongs to the lucys the house bears no marks of decay but seems the abode of ease and opulence there were some fine old books and i was told of many more which were not in order how odd if a folio shakspeare should be found amongst them our early breakfast did not prevent my taking advantage of an excellent repast offered by the kindness of mr and mrs lucy the last a lively welshwoman this visit gave me great pleasure it really brought justice shallow freshly before my eyes the luces in his arms which do become an old coat well162 were not more plainly portrayed in his own armorials in the hallwindow than was his person in my minds eye there is a picture shown as that of the old sir thomas but mr lucy conjectures it represents his son there were three descents of the same name of thomas the party hath the eye severe and beard of formal cut which fills up with judicial austerity the otherwise social physiognomy of the worshipful presence with his fair round belly with fat capon lined163  we resumed our journey i may mention among the pictures at charlcote one called a roman knight which seemed to me very fine teniers marriage in which contrary to the painters wont only persons of distinction are represented but much in the attitude in which he delights to present his boors two hawking pieces by wouvermans very fine specimens cum aliis  we took our way by edgehill and looked over the splendid richness of the fine prospect from a sort of gazeeboo or modern antique tower the place of a mr miller it is not easy to conceive a richer and more peaceful scene than that which stretched before us and one with which strife or the memory of strife seems to have nothing to do      but man records his own disgrace     and edgehill lives in history  we got on to buckingham an ugly though i suppose an ancient town thence to aylesbury through the wealth of england in the scene of the old ballad      neither drunk nor sober but neighbour to both     i met with a man in aylesbury vale     i saw by his face that he was in good case     to speak no great harm of a pot of good ale  we slept at aylesbury the landlord who seemed sensible told me that the land round the town being the richest in england lets at £3 or £3 10s and some so high as £4 per acre but the poorrates are 13s to the pound now my whitehaugh at huntly burn yielded at last set £4 per acre  april 9 londonwe got to town about midday and found sophia lockhart and the babies quite welldelighted with their companion charles and he enchanted with his occupation in the foreign office i looked into my cash and found £53 had diminished on the journey down to about £3 in former days a journey to london cost about £30 or thirty guineas it may now cost onefourth more but i own i like to pay postilions and waiters rather more liberally than perhaps is right i hate grumbling and sour faces and the whole saving will not exceed a guinea or two for being cursed and damned from dan to beersheba we had a joyful meeting i promise you164  april 10i spent the morning in bringing up my journal interrupted by two of these most sedulous visitants who had objects of their own to serve and smelled out my arrival as the raven scents carriona vile comparison though what better is an old fellow mauled with rheumatism and other deplorables went out at two and saw miss dumergue and other old friends sotheby in particular less changed than any one i have seen looked in at murrays and renewed old habits this great city seems almost a waste to me so many of my friends are gone walter and jane coming up the whole family dined together and were very happy the children joined in our festivity my nameson a bright and blueeyed rogue with flaxen hair screams and laughs like an april morning and the baby is that species of dough which is called a fine baby i care not for children till they care a little for me  april 11made calls walked myself tired saw rogers sharp sotheby and other old friends  april 12dinner at home a little party of sophias in the evening sharp told me that one evening being at sheridans house with a large party tom s came to him as the night drew late and said in a whisper i advise you to secure a waxlight to go to bed with shewing him at the same time a morsel which he had stolen from a sconce sharp followed his advice and had reason to be thankful for the hint tired and sleepy i make a bad night watcher  april 13amused myself by converting the tale of the mysterious mirror into aunt margarets mirror designed for heaths whatdyecallit cadell will not like this but i cannot afford to have my goods thrown back upon my hands the tale is a good one and is said actually to have happened to lady primrose my greatgrandmother having attended her sister on the occasion dined with miss dumergue my proofs from edinburgh reached today and occupied me all the morning  april 14 laboured at proofs and got them sent off per mr freelings cover so theres an end of the chronicles165 james rejoices in the conclusion where there is battle and homicide of all kinds always politic to keep a trot for the avenue like the irish postilions jb always calls to the boys to flog before the carriage gets out of the innyard how we have driven the stage i know not and care notexcept with a view to extricating my difficulties i have lost no time in beginning the second series of grandfathers tales being determined to write as much as i can even here and deserve by industry the soft pillow i sleep on for the moment  there is a good scene supposed to have happened between sam rogers and a lady of fashionthe reporter lord dudley sam enters takes a stool creeps close to the ladys side who asks his opinion of the last new poem or novel in a pathetic voice the spectre repliesmy opinion i like it very muchbut the world dont like it but indeed i begin to think the world wrong in everything except with regard to you now rogers either must have said this somewhere or he has it yet to say we dined at lord melvilles  april 15got the lamentable news that terry is totally bankrupt this is a most unexpected blow though his carelessness about money matters was very great god help the poor fellow he has been illadvised to go abroad but now returns to stand the stormold debts it seems with principal and interest accumulated and all the items which load a falling man and wife such a good and kind creature and children alack alack i sought out his solicitor there are £7000 or more to pay and the only fund his share in the adelphi theatre worth £5000 and upwards and then so fine a chance of independence lost that comes of not being explicit with his affairs the theatre was a most flourishing concern i looked at the books and since have seen yates the ruin is inevitable but i think they will not keep him in prison but let him earn his bread by his very considerable talents i shall lose the whole or part of £500 which i lent him but that is the least of my concern i hope the theatre is quite good for guaranteeing certain payments in 1829 and 1830 i judge they are in no danger  i should have gone to the club today but sir james mackintosh had mistaken the day i was glad of it so stayed at home  it is written that nothing shall flourish under my shadowthe ballantynes terry nelson weber all came to distress nature has written on my brow your shade shall be broad but there shall be no protection derived from it to aught you favour  sat and smoked and grumbled with lockhart  april 16we dined at dr youngs saw captain parry a handsome and pleasant man in the evening at mr cunliffes where i met sundry old friendsgrown older  april 17made up my gurnal which had fallen something behind in this phantasmagorial place the objects of the day come and depart like shadows166 made calls gave ck sharpes memorial to lord leveson gower went to murrays where i met a mr jacob a great economist he is proposing a mode of supporting the poor by compelling them to labour by military force and under a species of military discipline i see no objection to it only it will make a rebellion to a certainty and the tribes of jacob will certainly cut jacobs throat167  cannings conversion from popular opinions was strangely brought round while he was studying at the temple and rather entertaining revolutionary opinions godwin sent to say that he was coming to breakfast with him to speak on a subject of the highest importance canning knew little of him but received his visit and learned to his astonishment that in expectation of a new order of things the english jacobins desired to place him canning at the head of their expected revolution he was much struck and asked time to think what course he should takeand having thought the matter over he went to mr pitt and made the antijacobin confession of faith in which he persevered until canning himself mentioned this to sir w knighton upon occasion of giving a place in the charterhouse of some ten pounds a year to godwins brother he could scarce do less for one who had offered him the dictators curule chair  dined with rogers with all my own family and met sharp lord john russell jekyll and others the conversation flagged as usual and jokes were fired like minute guns producing an effect not much less melancholya wit should always have an atmosphere congenial to him otherwise he will not shine went to lady davys where i saw the kind face and heard the no less friendly greeting of lady selkirk168 who introduced all her children to me  april 18breakfasted with joanna baillie and found that gifted person extremely well and in the display of all her native knowledge of character and benevolence she looks more aged however i would give as much to have a capital picture of her as for any portrait in the world she gave me a manuscript play to read upon witchcraft169 dined with the dean of chester dr phillpotts170      where all above us was a solemn row     of priest and deacons so were all below171  there were the amiable bishop of london howley172 coplestone whom i remember a first man at oxford now bishop of llandaff the dean of st pauls and other dignitaries of whom i knew less it was a very pleasant daythe wigs against the wits for a guinea in point of conversation anne looked queer and much disposed to laugh at finding herself placed betwixt two prelates in black petticoats  april 19breakfasted with sir george philips had his receipt against the blossoms being injured by frost it consists in watering them plentifully before sunrise this is like the mode of thawing beef we had a pleasant morning much the better that morritt was with us he has agreed to go to hampton court with us tomorrow  mr reynolds called on me about the drawing of the lairds jock he is assiduous and attentive but a little forward poor gillies also called both asked me to dinner but i refused i do not incline to make what is called literary acquaintances and as for poor g it is wild to talk about his giving dinner to others when he can hardly get credit for his own  dined with sir robert henry inglis and met sir thomas  acland my old and kind friend i was happy to see him he may be considered now as the head of the religious party in the house of commons a powerful body which wilberforce long commanded it is a difficult situation for the adaptation of religious motives to earthly policy is aptamong the infinite delusions of the human heartto be a snare but i could confide much in sir t aclands honour and integrity bishop blomfield of chester173 one of the most learned prelates of the church also dined  coming home an irish coachman drove us into a cul de sac near battersea bridge we were obliged to get out in the rain the people admitted us into their houses where they were having their bit of supper assisted with lights etc and to the honour of london neither asked nor expected gratification  april 20we went to walters quarters in a body and saw hampton court with which i was more struck than when i saw it for the first time about 1806 the pictures are not very excellent but they are curious which is as interesting except to connoisseurs two i particularly remarked of james i and charles i eating in public the old part of the palace built by wolsey is extremely fine two handsome halls are still preserved one the ceiling of which is garnished at the crossing and combining of the arches with the recurring heads of henry viii and anne boleyngreat stinginess in henry for these ornaments must have been put up after wolseys fall he could surely afford a diversity of this species of ornament if any man could formerly when the palace was completely a fishinghouse it extended into or rather over the river we had a good dinner from walter and wended merrily home  april 21dining is the principal act of the day in london we took ours at kensington with croker there were theodore hook and other witty men he looks unhealthy and bloated there was something i know not what awanting to the cheerfulness of the party and      silence like a heavy cloud     oer all the warriors hung  if the general report of crokers retiring be accurate it may account for this  april 22sophia left this to take down poor johnnie to brighton i feari fearbut we must hope the best anne went with her sister  lockhart and i dined with sotheby where we met a large dining party the orator of which was that extraordinary man coleridge after eating a hearty dinner during which he spoke not a word he began a most learned harangue on the samothracian mysteries which he considered as affording the germ of all tales about fairies past present and to come he then diverged to homer whose iliad he considered as a collection of poems by different authors at different times during a century there was he said the individuality of an age but not of a country morritt a zealous worshipper of the old bard was incensed at a system which would turn him into a polytheist gave battle with keenness and was joined by sotheby our host mr coleridge behaved with the utmost complaisance and temper but relaxed not from his exertions zounds i was never so bethumped with words morritts impatience must have cost him an extra sixpence worth of snuff174  we went to lady davys in the evening where there was a fashionable party  april 23 dined at lady davys with lord and lady lansdowne and several other fashionable folks my keys were sent to bramahs with my desk so i have not had the means of putting matters down regularly for several days but who cares for the whippd cream of london society our poor little johnnie is extremely ill my fears have been uniform for this engaging child we are in gods hands but the comfortable and happy object of my journey is endedseged emperor of ethiopia175 was right after all  april 24spent the day in rectifying a road bill which drew a turnpike road through all the darnickers cottages and a good field of my own i got it put to rights i was in some apprehension of being obliged to address the committee i did not fear them for i suppose they are no wiser or better in their capacity of legislators than i find them every day at dinner but i feared for my reputation they would have expected something better than the occasion demanded or the individual could produce and there would have been a failure  april 25threatened to be carried down to vote at the election of a collector of the cess176 resolved if i did go to carry my son with me which would give me a double vote  had some disagreeable correspondence about this with lord minto and the sheriff  we had one or two persons at home in great wretchedness to dinner lockharts looks showed the misery he felt i was not able to make any fight and the evening went off as heavily as any i ever spent in the course of my life  finished my turnpike business by getting the exceptionable clauses omitted which would be good news to darnick put all the mirror in proof and corrected it this is the contribution part of it to mr reynolds and heaths keepsake we dined at richardsons with the two chief barons of england177 and scotland178 odd enough the one being a scotsman and the other an englishman far the pleasantest day we have had i suppose i am partial but i think the lawyers beat the bishops and the bishops beat the wits  april 26this morning i went to meet a remarkable man mr boyd of the house of boyd benfield  co which broke for a very large sum at the beginning of the war benfield went to the devil i believe boyd a man of a very different stamp went over to paris to look after some large claims which his house had over the french government they were such as it seems they could not disavow however they might be disposed to do so but they used every effort by foul means and fair to induce mr boyd to depart he was reduced to poverty he was thrown into prison and the most flattering prospects were on the other hand held out to him if he would compromise his claims his answer was uniform it was the property he said of his creditors and he would die ere he resigned it his distresses were so great that a subscription was made among his scottish friends to which i was a contributor through the request of poor will erskine after the peace of paris the money was restored and faithful to the last boyd laid the whole at his creditors disposal stating at the same time that he was penniless unless they consented to allow him a moderate sum in name of percentage in consideration of twenty years of danger poverty and exile all of which evils he might have escaped by surrendering their right to the money will it be believed that a muckworm was base enough to refuse his consent to this deduction alleging he had promised to his father on his deathbed never to compromise this debt the wretch however was overpowered by the execrations of all around him and concurred with others in setting apart for mr boyd a sum of £40000 or £50000 out of half a million of money179 this is a man to whom statues should be erected and pilgrims should go to see him he is goodlooking but old and infirm bright dark eyes and eyebrows contrast with his snowy hair and all his features mark vigour of principle and resolution mr morritt dined with us and we did as well as in the circumstances could be expected  released from the alarm of being summoned down to the election by a civil letter from lord minto i am glad both of the relief and of the manner i hate civil war amongst neighbours  april 27breakfasted this day with charles dumergue on a poulet à la tartare and saw all his family specially my godson called on lady stafford and others and dined at crokers in the admiralty with the duke of wellington huskisson wilmot horton and others outs and ins no politics of course and every man disguising serious thoughts with a light brow the duke alone seemed open though not letting out a word he is one of the few whose lips are worth watching i heard him say today that the best troops would run now and then he thought nothing of men running he said provided they came back again in war he had always his reserves poor terry was here when i returned he seems to see his matters in a delusive light  april 28an attack this day or yesterday from poor gillies boring me hard to apply to menzies of pitfoddels to entreat him to lend him money i could not get him to understand that i was decidedly averse to write to another gentleman with whom i was hardly acquainted to do that which i would not do myself tom campbell180 is in miserable distresshis son insanehis wife on the point of becoming so i nunc et versus tecum meditare canoros181  we ie charles and i dined at sir francis freelings with colonel harrison of the board of green cloth dr maltby of lincolns inn and other pleasant people doctor dibdin too and utterson all old roxburghe men pleasant party were it not for a bad cold which makes me bark like a dog  april 29anne and lockhart are off with the children this morning at seven and charles and i left behind and this is the promised meeting of my household i went to dr gillys today to breakfast met sir thomas acland who is the youngest man of his age i ever saw i was so much annoyed with cough that on returning i took to my bed and had a siesta to my considerable refreshment dr fergusson called and advised caution in eating and drinking which i will attend to  dined accordingly duke of sussex had cold and did not come a mr or dr pettigrew made me speeches on his account and invited me to see his royal highnesss library which i am told is a fine one sir peter laurie late sheriff and in nomination to be lord mayor bored me close and asked more questions than would have been thought warrantable at the west end of the town  april 30we had mr adolphus and his father the celebrated lawyer to breakfast and i was greatly delighted with the information of the latter a barrister of extended practice if he has any talents at all is the best companion in the world182  dined with lord alvanley and a fashionable party lord fitzroy somerset marquis and marchioness of worcester etc lord alvanleys wit made the party very pleasant as well as the kind reception of my friends the misses arden  footnotes  158 for an account of this monument see nicolson and burnss

walters visit to them in 1825 is given by mr lockhart in the life vol viii pp 4750  160 the visit to kenilworth in 1815 is not noticed in the life but as scott was in london for some weeks in the spring of that year he may have gone there on his return journey mr charles knight writing in 1842 says that mr bonnington the venerable occupant of the gate house told him that he remembered the visit and the visitor it was about twentyfive years agoand after examining some carving in the interior of the gate house and putting many suggestive questions the middleaged active stranger slightly lame and with keen grey eye passed through the court and remained among the ruins silent and alone for about two hours shakspeare vol i p 89 the famous romance did not appear until six years later viz in january 1821 and in the autumn of that year it is somewhat singular to find that scott and his friend mr stewart rose are at stratfordonavon writing their names on the wall of shakespeares birthplaceand yet leaving kenilworth unvisitedperhaps the reason was that mr stewart rose was not in the secret of the authorship of the novels  161 in the annual register for july 1834 is the

ballantyne and co  166 among the objects that came and departed like shadows in this phantasmagoria of london life was a deeply interesting letter from thomas carlyle and but for the fact that it bears sir walters london address and the postmark of this day one could not imagine he had ever seen it as it remained unacknowledged and unnoticed in either journal or correspondence  it is dated 13th april 1828 and one of the latest letters he indited from 21 comely bank edinburgh after advising scott that goethe has sent two medals which he is to deliver into his own hand he gives an extract from goethes letter containing a criticism on napoleon with the apology that it is seldom such a writer obtains such a critic and in conclusion he adds being in this curious fashion appointed as it were ambassador between two kings of poetry i would willingly discharge my mission with the solemnity that beseems such a business and naturally it must flatter my vanity and love of the marvellous to think that by means of a foreigner whom i have never seen i might soon have access to my native sovereign whom i have so often seen in public and so often wished that i had claim to see and know in private and near at hand  meanwhile i abide your further orders in this matter and so with all the regard which belongs to one to whom i in common with other millions owe so much i have the honour to

improvisation was at a gay young bachelors villa near highgate when the other lion was one of a very different breed mr coleridge much claret had been shed before the ancient mariner proclaimed that he could swallow no more of anything unless it were punch the materials were forthwith produced the bowl was planted before the poet and as he proceeded in his concoction hook unbidden took his place at the piano he burst into a bacchanal of egregious luxury every line of which had reference to the author of the lay sermons and the aids to reflection the room was becoming excessively hot the first specimen of the new compound was handed to hook who paused to quaff it and then exclaiming that he was stifled flung his glass through the window coleridge rose with the aspect of a benignant patriarch and demolished another panethe example was followed generallythe window was a sieve in an instantthe kind host was furthest from the mark and his goblet made havoc of the chandelier the roar of laughter was drowned in theodores resumption of the songand window and chandelier and the peculiar shot of each individual destroyer had apt in many cases exquisitely witty commemoration in walking

highest orderno forced vagaries of the voice no caprices of tone but all telling upon and increasing the feeling the words require this is marrying music to immortal verse185 most people place them on separate maintenance  i met the roxburghe club and settled to dine with them on 15th curt lord spencer in the chair we voted lord olive186 a member  may 2i breakfasted with a mr bell great ormond street a lawyer and narrowly escaped mr irving the celebrated preacher the two ladies of the house seemed devoted to his opinions and quoted him at every word mr bell himself made some apologies for the millennium he is a smart little antiquary who thinks he ought to have been a man of letters and that his genius has been misdirected in turning towards the law i endeavoured to combat this idea which his handsome house and fine family should have checked compare his dwelling his comforts with poor tom campbells  i dined with the literary society rather heavy work though some excellent men were there i saw for the first time archdeacon nares long conductor of the british critic a gentlemanlike and pleasing man sir henry robert inglis presided  may 3breakfasted at my old friend gally knights with whom in former days i used to make little parties to see poor monk lewis after breakfast i drove to lee and kennedys and commissioned seeds and flowers for about £10 including some specimens of the corsican and other pines their collection is very splendid but wants i think the neatness that i would have expected in the first nurserygarden in or near london the essentials were admirably cared for i saw one specimen of the norfolk island pine the only one young lee said which has been raised from all the seed that was sent home it is not treated conformably to its dignity for they cut the top off every year to prevent its growing out at the top of the conservatory sure it were worth while to raise the house alongst with the plant  looked in at murrayswrote some letters etc and walked home with the dean of chester who saw me to my own door i had but a few minutes to dress and go to the royal academy to which i am attached in capacity of professor of antiquities i was too late to see the paintings but in perfect time to sit halfanhour waiting for dinner as the president sir thomas lawrence expected a prince of the blood he came not but there were enough of grandees besides sir thomas lawrence did the honours very well and compliments flew about like sugarplums at an italian carnival i had my share and pleaded the immunities of a sinecurist for declining to answer  after the dinner i went to mrs scott of harden to see and be seen by her nieces the herbert ladies i dont know how their part of the entertainment turned out but i saw two or three pretty girls  may 4i breakfasted this morning with sir coutts trotter and had some scottish talk visited cooper who kindly undertook to make my inquiries in lyons187 i was at home afterwards for three hours but too much tired to do the least right thing the distances in london are so great that no exertions excepting those which a bird might make can contend with them you return weary and exhausted fitter for a siesta than anything else in the evening i dined with mr peel a great cabinet affair and too dignified to be very amusing though the landlord and the pretty landlady did all to make us easy  may 5breakfasted with haydon and sat for my head i hope this artist is on his legs again the king has given him a lift by buying his clever picture of the election in the fleet prison to which he is adding a second part representing the chairing of the member at the moment it was interrupted by the entry of the guards haydon was once a great admirer and companion of the champions of the cockney school and is now disposed to renounce them and their opinions to this kind of conversation i did not give much way a painter should have nothing to do with politics he is certainly a clever fellow but somewhat too enthusiastic which distress seems to have cured in some degree his wife a pretty woman looked happy to see me and that is something yet it was very little i could do to help them188  dined at lord bathursts in company with the duke there are better accounts of johnnie but alas  may 7breakfasted with lord francis gower and again enjoyed the great pleasure of meeting mrs arkwright and hearing her sing she is i understand quite a heavenborn genius having scarce skill enough in music to write down the tunes she composes i can easily believe this there is a pedantry among great musicians that deprives their performances of much that is graceful and beautiful it is the same in the other fine arts where fashion always prefers cant and slang to nature and simplicity  dined at mr watson taylors where plate etc shone in great and somewhat ostentatious quantity croker was there and very decisive and overbearing to a great degree strange so clever a fellow should let his wit outrun his judgment189 in general the english understand conversation well there is that ready deference for the claims of every one who wishes to speak time about and it is seldom nowadays that a la stoccata carries it away thus190  i should have gone to the duchess of northumberlands to hear music tonight but i felt completely fagged and betook myself home to bed  i learned a curious thing from emily lady londonderry namely that in feeding all animals with your hand you should never wear a glove which always affronts them it is good authority for this peculiarity  may 8breakfasted at somerset house with davies gilbert the new preses of the royal society tea coffee and bread and butter which is poor work certainly a slice of ham a plate of shrimps some broiled fish or a mutton chop would have been becoming so learned a body i was most kindly received however by dr d gilbert and a number of the members i saw sir john sievwrighta singular personage he told me his uniform plan was to support ministers but he always found himself voting in opposition i told him his deference to ministers was like that of the frenchman to the enemy who being at his mercy asked for his lifeanything in my power excepting that sir said monsieur sir john has made progress in teaching animals without severity or beating i should have liked to have heard him on this topic  called at northumberland house and saw the duke according to his report i lost much by not hearing the two rival nightingales sontag and pasta last night but i care not for it  met sir w knighton returned from the continent he gives me to understand i will be commanded for sunday sir wk asked me to sit for him to northcote and to meet him there at one tomorrow i cannot refuse this but it is a great bore191  dined with mrs alexander of ballochmyle lord and lady meath who were kind to us in ireland and a scottish partypleasant from hearing the broad accents and honest thoughts of my native land a large party in the evening a gentleman came up to me and asked if i had seen the casket a curious work the most beautiful the most highly ornamentedand then the editor or editressa female so interestingmight he ask a very great favour and out he pulled a piece of this picnic i was really angry and said for a subscription he might command mefor a contribution no that i had given to a great many of these things last year and finding the labour occupied some considerable portion of my time i had done a considerable article for a single collection this year taking a valuable consideration for it and engaged not to support any other this may be misrepresented but i care not suppose this patron of the muses gives five guineas to his distressed lady he will think he does a great deal yet takes fifty from me with the calmest air in the world for the communication is worth that if it be worth anything there is no equality in the proposal  i saw today at northumberland house bridge the jeweller having and holding a george richly ornamented with diamonds being that which queen anne gave to the duke of marlborough which his present representative pawned or sold and which the present king bought and presented to the duke of wellington his grace seemed to think this interesting jewel was one of two which had been preserved since the first institution of that order that from the form and taste i greatly doubt mr bridge put it again into his coat pocket and walked through the street with £10000 in his pocket i wonder he is not hustled and robbed i have sometimes envied rich citizens but it was a mean and erroneous feeling this man who i suppose must be as rich as a jew had a shabby look in the dukes presence and seemed just a better sort of pedlar better be a poor gentleman after all  may 9grounds of footes farce of the cozeners lady  a certain mrs phipps audaciously set up in a fashionable quarter of the town as a person through whose influence properly propitiated favours and situations of importance might certainly be obtainedalways for a consideration she cheated many people and maintained the trick for many months one trick was to get the equipage of lord north and other persons of importance to halt before her door as if the owners were within with respect to most of them this was effected by bribing the drivers but a gentleman who watched her closely observed that charles j fox actually left his carriage and went into the house and this more than once he was then it must be noticed in the ministry when mrs phipps was blown up this circumstance was recollected as deserving explanation which fox readily gave at brookss and elsewhere it seems mrs phipps had the art to persuade him that she had the disposal of what was then called a hyænathat is an heiressan immense jamaica heiress in whom she was willing to give or sell her interest to charles fox without having perfect confidence in the obliging proposal the great statesman thought the thing worth looking after and became so earnest in it that mrs phipps was desirous to back out of it for fear of discovery with this view she made confession one fine morning with many professions of the deepest feelings that the hyæna had proved a frail monster and given birth to a girl or boyno matter which even this did not make charles quit chase of the hyæna he intimated that if the cash was plenty and certain the circumstance might be overlooked mrs phipps had nothing for it but to double the disgusting dose the poor child she said was unfortunately of a mixed colour somewhat tinged with the blood of africa no doubt mr fox was himself very dark and the circumstance might not draw attention etc etc this singular anecdote was touched upon by foote and is the cause of introducing the negress into the cozeners192 though no express allusion to charles fox was admitted lady  tells me that in her youth the laugh was universal so soon as the black woman appeared it is one of the numerous hits that will be lost to posterity jack fuller celebrated for his attempt on the speakers wig told me he was editing foote but i think he has hardly taste enough he told me colman was to be his assistant193  went down in the morning to montagu house where i found the duke going out to suffer a recovery194 i had some fancy to see the ceremony but more to get my breakfast which i took at a coffeehouse at charing cross  i sat to northcote who is to introduce himself in the same piece in the act of painting me like some pictures of the venetian school the artist is an old man low in stature and bent with yearsfourscore at least but the eye is quick and the countenance noble a pleasant companion familiar with recollections of sir joshua samuel johnson burke goldsmith etc his account of the last confirms all that we have heard of his oddities  dined with mr arbuthnot where met duke of rutland lord and lady londonderry etc etc went to hear mrs arkwright at lady charlotte grevilles lockhart came home today  may 10another long sitting to the old wizard northcote he really resembles an animated mummy195 he has altered my ideas of sir joshua reynolds whom from the expressions used by goldsmith johnson and others i used to think an amiable and benevolent character but though not void of generosity he was cold unfeeling and indifferent to his family so much so that his sister miss reynolds after expressing her wonder at the general acceptance which sir joshua met with in society concluded with for me i only see in him a dark gloomy tyrant i own this view of his character hurt me by depriving me of the pleasing vision of the highest talents united with the kindest temper but northcote says his disagreeable points were rather negative than positivemore a want of feeling than any desire to hurt or tyrannise they arose from his exclusive attachment to art  dined with a pleasant party at lord gowers lady gower is a beautiful woman and extremely courteous mrs arkwright was of the party i am getting well acquainted with her and think i can see a great deal of sense mixed with her accomplishment  may 11breakfasted with dr maltby preacher in lincolns inn he was to have been the next bishop if the whigs had held their ground his person manners and attainments would have suited the lawn sleeves well i heard service in the chapel which is a very handsome place of worship it is upstairs which seems extraordinary and the space beneath forms cloisters in which the ancient benchers of this society of lincolns inn are entered i met my old friend sir william grant196 and had some conversation with him dr maltby gave us a good sermon upon the introduction of the gospel there was only one monument in the chapel a handsome tablet to the memory of perceval the circumstance that it was the only monument in the chapel of a society which had produced so many men of talents and distinction was strikingit was a tribute due to the suddenness of his strange catastrophe there is nothing very particular in the hall of lincolns inn nor its parlour which are like those of a college indeed the whole establishment has a monastic look  sat to northcote who only requires deo gratias another sitting dined with his majesty in a very private partyfive or six only being present i was received most kindly as usual it is impossible to conceive a more friendly manner than his majesty used towards me i spoke to swk about the dedication of the collected works and he says it will be highly well taken197  i went after the party broke up to mrs scott of harden where i made acquaintance with her beautiful kinswoman lady sarah ponsonby whose countenance is really seraphic and totally devoid of affectation  may 12old george ii was as is well known extremely passionate on these occasions his small stock of english totally failed him and he used to express his indignation in the following form gdn me who i am got dn you who you be lockhart and i visited a mrs quillinan198 with whom wordsworth and his wife have pitched their tent i was glad to see my old friend whose conversation has so much that is fresh and manly in it i do not at all acquiesce in his system of poetry and i think he has injured his own fame by adhering to it but a better or more sensible man i do not know than ww  afterwards lockhart and i called on miss nicolson and from thence i wandered down into that immense hash of a city to see heath and fortunately caught hold on him all this made me too late for northcotewho was placable however199  dined at sir john shelleys à petit couvert here were the duke of wellington duke of rutland and only one or two more particularly mr and mrs arbuthnot the evening was very pleasant and did not break up till twelve at night  may 13breakfasted with sir george philipsthere was sydney smith full of fun and spirit and his daughter who is a goodhumoured agreeable girl we had a pleasant breakfast party  the catholics have carried their question which i suppose will be thrown out in the lords i think they had better concede this oftdisputed point and dissolve the league which binds so many people in opposition to government it is a matter of great consequence that men should not acquire the habit of opposing no earthly advantage would arise to ireland from ceding what is retained where so much has been already yielded up indeed the catholic gentry do not pretend that the granting the immunities they require would tranquillise the country but only that it would remove from men of honour all pretext for countenancing them this is on the principle of the solicitor of the unhappy rajah nuncomar who after extorting as much money as he could under pretence of bribing persons to procure his pardon facilitate his escape etc found himself pressed by his victim for a final answer the preparations for death are ready said the rajah i fear notwithstanding all you have told me their intention is to take my life by gd replied the trusty solicitor if they do i will never forgive them so if there are further disturbances after the catholic claims are granted i suppose those by whom they are now advocated will never forgive their friends the pats and that will be all john bull will get for it i dined with lady stafford for whom i have much regard i recollect her ever since she stood at her aunt lady glenorchys window in george square reviewing her regiment of sutherland giants she was as she ever is most attentive and kind  may 14i carried lockhart to lady francis gowers to hear mrs arkwright sing and i think he admired her as much as his nature permits him to love anything musical for he certainly is not quickly moved by concord of sweet sounds i do not understand them better than he but the voce del petto always affects me and mrs a has it in perfection i have received as much pleasure from that ladys music as sound could ever give me200 lockhart goes off for brighton i had a round of men in office i waited on the duke at downing st and i think put l right there if he will look to himself but i can only tee the ball he must strike the blow with the golf club himself i saw mr renton and he promised to look after harpers business favourably good gracious what a solicitor we are grown  dined with lady davya pleasant party but i was out of spirits i think partly on johnnies account partly from fatigue there was william henry lyttelton amongst others much of his oddity has rubbed off and he is an honoured courtly gentleman with a great deal of wit and not one of the fine people who perplex you by shutting their mouths if you begin to speak i never fear quizzing so am not afraid of this species of lyinginwait lord have mercy on me if i were  may 15dined at the roxburghe club lord spencer presided but had a cold which limited his exertions lord clive beside whom i sat was deaf though intelligent and goodhumoured the duke of devonshire was still deafer there were many little chirruping men who might have talked but went into committee there was little general conversation i should have mentioned that i breakfasted with kind good mr hughes and met the bishop of llandaffstrongly intelligent i do not understand his politics about the catholic question he seems disposed to concede yet is toryissimus perhaps they wish the question ended but the present opinions of the sovereign are too much interested to permit them to quit it  may 16breakfasted with mr reynolds a miscellaneous party wordsworth right welcome unto me was there i had also a sight of godwin the philosopher grown old and thinof douglas kinnaird whom i asked about byrons statue which is going forwardof luttrell and others whom i knew not i stayed an instant at pickerings a young publishers and bought some dramatic reprints i love them very much but i would not advise a young man to undertake them they are of course dear and as they have not the dignity of scarcity the bibliomaniacs pass them by as if they were plated candlesticks they may hold as good a light for all that as if they were real silver and therefore i buy them when i can light on them but here i am spending money when i have more need to make it on monday the 26th it shall be northward ho  dined at lady georgiana and mr agar elliss201 there were lord and lady stafford there and others to whom i am sincerely attached  may 17a day of busy idleness richardson came and breakfasted with me like a good fellow then i went to mr chantrey and sat for an hour to finish the bust202 thereafter about twelve oclock i went to breakfast the second at lady shelleys where there was a great morning party a young lady203 begged a lock of my hair which was not worth refusing i stipulated for a kiss which i was permitted to take from this i went to the duke of wellington who gave me some hints or rather details afterwards i drove out to chiswick where i had never been before a numerous and gay party were assembled to walk and enjoy the beauties of that palladian dome the place and highly ornamented gardens belonging to it resemble a picture of watteau there is some affectation in the picture but in the ensemble the original looked very well the duke of devonshire received every one with the best possible manners the scene was dignified by the presence of an immense elephant who under charge of a groom wandered up and down giving an air of asiatic pageantry to the entertainment i was never before sensible of the dignity which largeness of size and freedom of movement give to this otherwise very ugly animal as i was to dine at holland house i did not partake in the magnificent repast which was offered to us and took myself off about five oclock i contrived to make a demitoilette at holland house rather than drive all the way to london rogers came to dinner which was very entertaining the duke of manchester was there whom i remember having seen long ago he had left a part of his brain in jamaica by a terrible fracture yet notwithstanding the accident and the bad climate was still a finelooking man lady holland204 pressed me to stay all night which i did accordingly  may 18the freshness of the air the singing of the birds the beautiful aspect of nature the size of the venerable trees all gave me a delightful feeling this morning it seemed there was pleasure even in living and breathing without anything else we ie rogers and i wandered into a green lane bordered with fine trees which might have been twenty miles from a town it will be a great pity when this ancient house must come down and give way to brick works and brickhouses it is not that holland house is fine as a building on the contrary it has a tumbledown look and although decorated with the bastard gothic of james is time the front is heavy but it resembles many respectable matrons who having been absolutely ugly during youth acquire by age an air of dignitythough one is chiefly affected by the air of deep seclusion which is spread around the domain i called on mr peel as i returned home and after that on lord melville the latter undertook for allan cunninghams sons cadetship for which i am right glad  dined at mr and lady sarah ponsonbys who called on us last year at abbotsford the party was very pleasant having lord and lady gower whom i like mr and lady georgiana ellis and other persons of distinction saw wordsworth too and learned that tom moore was come to town  may 19a morning of business breakfasted with dumergue and one or two friends dined by command with the duchess of kent i was very kindly recognised by prince leopold i was presented to the little princess victoriai hope they will change her namethe heir apparent to the crown as things now stand how strange that so large and fine a family as that of his late majesty should have died off and decayed into old age with so few descendants prince george of cumberland is they say a fine boy about nine years olda bit of a pickle swears and romps like a brat that has been bred in a barrack yard this little lady is educated with much care and watched so closely by the duchess and the principal governess that no busy maid has a moment to whisper you are heir of england i suspect if we could dissect the little head we should find that some pigeon or other bird of the air had carried the matter she is fair like the royal family but does not look as if she would be pretty the duchess herself is very pleasing and affable in her manners i sat by mr spring rice a very agreeable man he is a great leader among the procatholics i saw also charles wynn and his ladyand the evening for a court evening went agreeably off i am commanded for two days by prince leopold but will send excuses  may 20i set out for brighton this morning in a light coach which performed the distance in six hoursotherwise the journey was uncomfortable three women the very specimens of womankindi mean trumperya child who was sick but afterwards looked and smiled and was the only thing like company the road is pleasant enough till it gets into the wealds of sussex a huge succession of green downs which sweep along the seacoast for many miles brighton seems grown twice as large since 1815 it is a city of loiterers and invalidsa vanity pair for pipers dancing of bears and for the feats of mr punch i found all my family well excepting the poor pale johnnie and he is really a thing to break ones heart by looking atyet he is better the rest are in high kelter  my old friend will rose dined with us also a doctor yates and his wifethe esculapius of brighton who seems a sensible man i was entertained with the empire he exerted over him as protector of his health i was very happy to find myself at sophias quiet table and am only sorry that i must quit her so soon  may 21this being a fine day we made some visits in the morning in the course of which i waited on mrs davies sister of mrs charlotte smith205 and herself the author of the peacock at home one of the prettiest and liveliest jeux desprit in our language she is a fine stately old ladynot a bit of a literary personi mean having none of the affectation of it but like a lady of considerable rank i am glad i have seen her renewed my acquaintance with lady charlotte hamilton née lady charlotte hume and talked over some stories thirty years old at least we then took a fly as they call the light carriages and drove as far as the devils ditch a rampart it is of great strength and depth enclosing i presume the precincts of a british town that must have held 30000 men at least i could not discover where they got water  we got home at four and dined at five and smoked cigars till eight will rose came in with his man hinvaes206 who is as much a piece of rose as trim was of uncle toby we laughed over tales both old and new till ten oclock came and then broke up  may 22left brighton this morning with a heavy heart poor johnnie looks so very poorly that i cannot but regard his case as desperate and then god help the childs parents amen  we took the whole of one of the postcoaches and so came rapidly to town sophia coming along with us about a new servant this enabled me to dine with mr adolphus the celebrated barrister the father to my young friend who wrote so like a gentleman on my matters207 i met mr gurney archdeacon wrangham and a lawyer or two besides i may be partial but the conversation of intelligent barristers amuses me more than that of other professional persons there is more of real life in it with which in all its phases people of business get so well acquainted mr adolphus is a man of varied information and very amusing he told me a gipsy told him of the success he should have in life and how it would be endangered by his own heat of temper alluding i believe to a quarrel betwixt him and a brother barrister  may 23i breakfasted with chantrey and met the celebrated coke of norfolk208 a very pleasing man who gave me some account of his plantations i understand from him that like every wise man he planted land that would not let for 5s per acre but which now produces £3000 a year in wood he talked of the trees which he had planted as being so thick that a man could not fathom209 them withers he said was never employed save upon one or two small jobs of about twenty acres on which every expense was bestowed with a view to early growth so much for withers i shall have a rod in pickle for him if worth while210 after sitting to chantrey for the last time i called on lady shelley ppc and was sorry to find her worse than she had been dined with lady stafford where i met the two lochs john and james the former gave me his promise for a cadetship to allan cunninghams son i have a similar promise from lord melville and thus i am in the situation in which i have been at gladdies wiel211 where i have caught two trouts one with the fly the other with the bobber i have landed both and so i will now mr loch also promised me to get out shortreed as a free mariner tom grenville was at dinner  may 24this day we dined at richmond park with lord sidmouth before dinner his lordship showed me letters which passed between the great lord chatham and dr addington lord sidmouths father there was much of that familiar friendship which arises and must arise between an invalid the head of an invalid family and their medical adviser supposing the last to be a wise and wellbred man the character of lord chathams handwriting is strong and bold and his expressions short and manly there are intimations of his partiality for william whose health seems to have been precarious during boyhood he talks of william imitating him in all he did and calling for ale because his father was recommended to drink it if i should smoke he said william would instantly call for a pipe and he wisely infers i must take care what i do the letters of the late william pitt are of great curiosity but as like all real letters of business they only allude to matters with which his correspondent is well acquainted and do not enter into details they would require an ample commentary i hope lord sidmouth will supply this and have urged it as much as i can i think though i hate letters and abominate interference i will write to him on this subject  i have bought a certain quantity of reprints from a bookseller in chancery lane pickering by name i urged him to print the controversy between greene and the harveys he wished me to write a third part to a fine edition of cottons angler for which i am quite incompetent212  i met at richmond my old and much esteemed friend lord stowell213 looking very frail and even comatose quantum mutatus he was one of the pleasantest men i ever knew  respecting the letters i picked up from those of pitt that he was always extremely desirous of peace with france and even reckoned upon it at a moment when he ought to have despaired i suspect this false view of the state of france for such it was which induced the british minister to look for peace when there was no chance of it damped his ardour in maintaining the war he wanted the lofty ideas of his fatheryou read it in his handwriting great statesman as he was i saw a letter or two of burkes in which there is an épanchement du cœur not visible in those of pitt who writes like a premier to his colleague burke was under the strange hallucination that his son who predeceased him was a man of greater talents than himself on the contrary he had little talent and no resolution on moving some resolutions in favour of the catholics which were illreceived by the house of commons young burke actually ran away which an orangeman compared to a crossreading in the newspapersyesterday the catholic resolutions were moved etc but the pistol missing fire the villains ran off  may 25after a morning of letterwriting leavetaking papers destroying and god knows what trumpery sophia and i set out for hampton court carrying with us the following lions and lionessessamuel rogers tom moore wordsworth with wife and daughter we were very kindly and properly received by walter and his wife and a very pleasant party214  may 26an awful confusion with paying of bills writing of cards and all species of trumpery business southey who is just come to town breakfasted with us he looks i think but poorly but it may be owing to family misfortune one is always tempted to compare wordsworth and southey the latter is unquestionably the greater scholari mean possesses the most extensive stock of information but there is a freshness vivacity and spring about wordsworths mind which if we may compare two men of uncommon powers shows more originality i say nothing of their poetry wordsworth has a system which disposes him to take the bull by the horns and offend public taste which right or wrong will always be the taste of the public yet he could be popular if he wouldwitness the feast at brougham castlesong of the cliffords i think is the name  i walked down to call with rogers on mrs darblay she showed me some notes which she was making about her novels which she induced me to believe had been recollected and jotted down in compliance with my suggestions on a former occasion it is curious how she contrived to get evelina printed and published without her fathers knowledge her brother placed it in the hands of one lowndes who after its success bought it for £20 and had the magnanimity to add £10the price i think of paradise lost one of her sisters betrayed the secret to her father who then eagerly lent his ears to hear what was said of the new novel and the first opinion which saluted his delighted ears was the voice of johnson energetically recommending it to the perusal of mrs thrale215  at parting rogers gave me a goldmounted pair of glasses which i will not part with in a hurry i really like rogers and have always found him most friendly after many petty delays we set off at last and reached bushy grove to dine with my kind and worthy family friend and relative david haliburton i am delighted to find him in all the enjoyment of life with the vivacity of youth in his sentiments and enjoyments mr and mrs campbell marjoribanks are the only company here with miss parker  may 27well my retreat from london is now accomplished and i may fairly balance the advantage and loss of this london trip it has cost me a good deal of money and johnnies illness has taken away much of the pleasure i had promised myself but if i can judge from the reception i have met with i have the pleasure to know that i stand as fair with the public and as high with my personal friends as in any period of my life and this has enabled me to forward the following objects to myself and others  1st i have been able to place lockhart on the right footing in the right quarter leaving the improvement of his place of vantage to himself as circumstances should occur  2d i have put the chancery suit in the right train which without me could not have been done216  3d i picked up some knowledge of the state of existing matters which is interesting and may be useful  4th i have succeeded in helping to get a commission for james skene  5th i have got two cadetships for the sons of allan cunningham  6th i have got leave to andrew shortreed to go out to india  7th i have put john eckford into correspondence with mr loch who thinks he can do something for his claim  8th i have been of material assistance to poor terry in his affairs  9th i have effectually protected my darnick neighbours and myself against the new road bill  other advantages there are besides the great one of scouring up ones own mind a little and renewing intercourse with old friends bringing onesself nearer in short to the currency of the time  all this may weigh against the expenditure of £200 or £250 when money is fortunately not very scarce with me  we went out for a most agreeable drive through the hertfordshire lanesa strange intricate combination of narrow roads passing through the country winding and turning among oaks and other large timber just like pathways cut through a forest they wind and turn in so singular a manner and resemble each other so much that a stranger would have difficulty to make way amongst them we visited moor park not the house of sir william temple but that where the duke and duchess of monmouth lived having rather a commanding situation you look down on the valley which being divided into small enclosures bordered with wood resembles a forest when so looked down on the house has a handsome entrancehall painted by sir james thornhill in a very french taste yet handsome he was hogarths fatherinlaw and not easily reconciled to the match thornhills paintings are certainly not of the first class yet the practice of painting the walls and roof of a dwellinghouse gives in my eyes a warm and rich air to the apartments lord grosvenor has now bought this fine place once lord ansonshence the moor park apricot is also called ansoniana after seeing moor park we went to the grove the earl of clarendons countryseat the house looks small and of little consequence but contains many good portraits as i was told of the hyde family217 the park has fine views and magnificent trees  we went to cashiobury belonging to the earl of essex an old mansion apparently with a fine park the colne runs through the grounds or rather creeps through them      for the colne     is black and swollen       snakelike he winds his way     unlike the burns     from highland urns       that dance by crag and brae  borthwickbrae218 came to dinner from town and we had a very pleasant evening my excellent old friend reminded me of the old and bitter feud between the scotts and the haliburtons and observed it was curious i should have united the blood of two hostile clans  may 28we took leave of our kind old host after breakfast and set out for our own land our elegant researches carried us out of the highroad and through a labyrinth of intricate laneswhich seem made on purpose to afford strangers the full benefit of a dark night and a drunk driverin order to visit gills hill famous for the murder of mr weare  the place has the strongest title to the description of wordsworth      a merry spot tis said in days of yore     but something ails it now the place is cursed  the principal part of the house has been destroyed and only the kitchen remains standing the garden has been dismantled though a few laurels and garden shrubs run wild continue to mark the spot the fatal pond is now only a green swamp but so near the house that one cannot conceive how it was ever chosen as a place of temporary concealment of the murdered body indeed the whole history of the murder and the scenes which ensued are strange pictures of desperate and shortsighted wickedness the feastingthe singingthe murderer with his hands still bloody hanging round the neck of one of the femalesthe watchchain of the murdered man argue the utmost apathy even probert the most frightened of the party fled no further for relief than to the brandy bottle and is found in the very lane and at the spot of the murder seeking for the murderous weapon and exposing himself to the view of the passengers another singular mark of stupid audacity was their venturing to wear the clothes of their victim there was a want of foresight in the whole arrangement of the deed and the attempts to conceal it which argued strange inconsideration which a professed robber would not have exhibited there was just one single shade of redeeming character about a business so brutal perpetrated by men above the very lowest rank of lifeit was the mixture of revenge which afforded some relief to the circumstances of treachery and premeditation which accompanied it but weare was a cheat and had no doubt pillaged thurtell who therefore deemed he might take greater liberties with him than with others  the dirt of the present habitation equalled its wretched desolation and a truculentlooking hag who showed us the place and received halfacrown looked not unlike the natural inmate of such a mansion she indicated as much herself saying the landlord had dismantled the place because no respectable person would live there she seems to live entirely alone and fears no ghosts she says  one thing about this mysterious tragedy was never explained it is said that weare as is the habit of such men always carried about his person and between his flannel waistcoat and shirt a sum of ready money equal to £1500 or £2000 no such money was ever recovered and as the sum divided by thurtell among his accomplices was only about £20 he must in slang phrase have bucketed his pals219  we came on as far as alconbury where we slept comfortably  may 29we travelled from alconbury hill to ferry bridge upwards of a hundred miles amid all the beauties of flourish and verdure which spring awakens at her first approach in the midland counties of england but without any variety save those of the seasons making i do believe this great north road is the dullest in the world as well as the most convenient for the traveller nothing seems to me to have been altered within twenty or thirty years save the noses of the landlords which have bloomed and given place to another set of proboscises as germane us the old ones to the very welcomeplease to lightorses forward and ready out the skeleton at barnby moor has deserted his gibbet and that is the only change i recollect  i have amused myself today with reading lockharts life of burns which is very well writtenin fact an admirable thing he has judiciously slurred over his vices and follies for although currie i myself and others have not said a word more on that subject than is true yet as the dead corpse is straightened swathed and made decent so ought the character of such an inimitable genius as burns to be tenderly handled after death the knowledge of his vicious weaknesses or vices is only a subject of sorrow to the welldisposed and of triumph to the profligate  may 30we left ferry bridge at seven and turning westwards or rather northwestward at borough bridge we roach rokeby at past three a mile from the house we met morritt looking for us i had great pleasure at finding myself at rokeby and recollecting a hundred passages of past time morritt looks well and easy in his mind which i am delighted to see he is now one of my oldest and i believe one of my most sincere friends a man unequalled in the mixture of sound good sense high literary cultivation and the kindest and sweetest temper that ever graced a human bosom his nieces are much attached to him and are deserving and elegant as well as beautiful young women what there is in our partiality to female beauty that commands a species of temperate homage from the aged as well as ecstatic admiration from the young i cannot conceive but it is certain that a very large proportion of some other amiable quality is too little to counterbalance the absolute want of this advantage i to whom beauty is and shall henceforth be a picture still look upon it with the quiet devotion of an old worshipper who no longer offers incense on the shrine but peaceably presents his inch of taper taking special care in doing so not to burn his own fingers nothing in life can be more ludicrous or contemptible than an old man aping the passions of his youth  talking of youth there was a certain professor at cambridge who used to keep sketches of all the youths who from their conduct at college seemed to bid fair for distinction in life he showed them one day to an old shrewd sarcastic master of arts who looked over the collection and then observed a promising nest of eggs what a pity the great part will turn out addle and so they do looking round amongst the young men one sees to all appearance fine flourishbut it ripens not  may 31i have finished napiers

strangford where his pointed affirmation has been as pointedly repelled it is evident he would require probing his defence of moore is spirited and well argued though it is evident he defends the statesman as much as the general as a liberal and a military man colonel napier finds it difficult to steer his course the former character calls on him to plead for the insurgent spaniards the latter

path over stanmore to brough appleby penrith and carlisle as i have this road by heart i have little amusement save the melancholy task of recalling the sensations with which i have traced it in former times all of which refer to decay of animal strength and abatement if not of mental powers at least of mental energy the non est tanti grows fast at my time of life we reached carlisle at seven oclock and were housed for the night my books being exhausted i lighted on an odd volume of the gentlemans magazine a work in which as in a pawnbrokers shop much of real curiosity and value are stowed away and concealed amid the frippery and trumpery of those reverend old gentlewomen who were the regular correspondents of the work  june 2we intended to walk to the castle but were baffled by rainy weather i was obliged to wait for a certificate from the parish registerhei mihi i cannot have it till ten oclock or rather as it chanced till past eleven when i got the paper for which i waited221 we lunched at hawick and concluded our pilgrimage at abbotsford about nine at night where the joyful barking of the dogs with the sight of the kind familiar faces of our domestics gave us welcome and i enjoyed a sound repose on my own bed i remark that in this journey i have never once experienced depression of spirits or the tremor cordis of which i have sometimes such unpleasant visits dissipation and a succession of trifling engagements prevent the mind from throwing itself out in the manner calculated to exhaust the owner and to entertain other people there is a lesson in this  june 3 abbotsfordthis was a very idle day i waked to walk about my beautiful young woods with old tom and the dogs the sun shone bright and the wind fanned my cheek as if it were a welcoming i did not do the least right thing except packing a few books necessary for writing the continuation of the tales in this merry mood i wandered as far as huntly burn where i found the miss fergusons well and happy then i sauntered back to abbotsford sitting on every bench by the way and thus      it grew to dinner in conclusion  a good appetite made my simple meal relish better than the magnificent cheer which i have lately partaken of i smoked a cigar slept away an hour and read mure of auchendranes trial and thus ended the day i cannot afford to spend many such nor would they seem so pleasant  june 4 edinburghthe former part of this day was employed much as yesterday but some packing was inevitable will laidlaw came to dinner of which we partook at three oclock started at halfpast four and arrived at home if we must call it so at nine oclock in the evening i employed my leisure in the chaise to peruse mure of auchendranes trial out of which something might be coopered up for the public222 it is one of the wildest stories i ever read something might surely be twisted out of it  june 5cadell breakfasted in great spirits with the success of the fair maid of perth a disappointment being always to be apprehended i too am greatly pleased that the evil day is adjourned for the time must comeand yet i can spin a tough yarn still with any one now going  i was much distressed to find that the last of the macdonald buchanans a fine lad of about twentyone is now decidedly infected by the same pulmonary complaint which carried off his four brothers in succession this is indeed a cruel stroke and it is melancholy to witness the undaunted highland courage of the father  i went to court and when i returned did some work upon the tales      and now again boys to the oar  june 6i have determined to work sans intermission for lost time and to make up at least my task every day j gibson called on me with good hopes that the trustees will authorise the grand opus to be set afloat223 they are scrupulous a little about the expense of engravings but i fear the taste of the town will not be satisfied without them it is time these things were settled i wrought both before and after dinner and finished five pages which is two above bargain  june 7saturday was another working day and nothing occurred to disturb me  june 8i finished five sheets this day will clerk and francis scott of harden came to dinner and we spent a pleasant evening  june 9i laboured till about one and was then obliged to go to attend a meeting of the oil gas companyas i devoutly hope for the last time  after that i was obliged to go to sit to colvin smith which is an atrocious bore but cannot be helped224  cadell rendered me report of accounts paid for me with vouchers which very nearly puts me out of all shop debts god grant me grace to keep so  june 1014during these five days almost nothing occurred to diversify the ordinary task of the day which i must own was dull enough i rose to my task by seven and less or more wrought it out in the course of the day far exceeding the ordinary average of three leaves per day i have attended the parliament house with the most strict regularity and returned to dine alone with anne also i gave three sittings to mr colvin smith who i think has improved since i saw him  of important intelligence nothing occurs save the termination of all suspense on the subject of poor james macdonald buchanan he died at malta the celebrated dugald stewart is also dead famous for his intimate acquaintance with the history and philosophy of the human mind there is much of waterpainting in all metaphysics which consist rather of words than ideas but stewart was most impressive and eloquent in former days i was frequently with him but not for many years latterly i am told he had lost not the power of thinking but the power of expressing his thoughts by speech this is like the metamorphosis of ovid the bark binding in and hardening the living flesh  june 15w clerk francis scott and charles sharpe dined with me but my task had been concluded before dinner  june 16dined at dalmahoy with the young earl and countess of morton i like these young noble folks particularly well their manners and style of living are easy and unaffected and i should like to see them often came home at night the task finished today i should mention that the plan about the new edition of the novels was considered at a meeting of trustees and finally approved of i trust it will answer yet who can warrant the continuance of popularity old corri225 who entered into many projects and could never set the sails of a windmill so as to catch the aura popularis used to say that he believed that were he to turn baker it would put bread out of fashion i have had the better luck to dress my sails to every wind and so blow on good wind and spin round whirligig  june 17violent rheumatic headache all day wrought however but what difference this troublesome addition may make on the quality of the stuff produced truly i do not know i finished five leaves  june 18some italian gentlemen landed here under the conveyance of the misses haig of bemerside they were gentlemanlike men but as i did not dare to speak bad french i had not much to say to foreigners gave them and their pretty guides a good breakfast however the scene seemed to me to resemble sheridans scene in the critic226 there are a number of very civil gentlemen trying to make themselves understood and i do not know which is the interpreter after all it is not my fault they who wish to see me should be able to speak my language i called on mrs stewart mackenzie she received me with all the kindness of former days and i was delighted to see her i sat about an hour with her my head aches for all that and i have heavy fits of drowsiness well i have finished my task and have a right to sleep if i have a mind  i dine today with lord mackenzie where i hope to meet mrs stewart mackenzie again for i love her warm heart and lively fancy accordingly i enjoyed this pleasure227  june 19scribbled away lustily went to the ph wrote when i came home both before and after dinnerthats all i think i am become a sort of writing automaton and truly the joints of my knees especially the left are so stiff and painful in rising and sitting down that i can hardly help screamingi that was so robust and active i get into a carriage with great difficulty my head too is bothered with rheumatic headaches why not i got headaches by my folly when i was young and now i am old they come uncalled infirmity gives what indiscretion bought  june 20my course is still the same but i have a painful letter from lockhart which takes away the last hope of poor johnnies recovery it is no surprise to me the poor child so amiable in its disposition and so promising from its talents was not formed to be long with us and i have long expected that it must needs come to this i hope i shall not outlive my children in other cases and i think there is little chance of it my father did not long survive the threescore and ten it will be wonderful if i reach that goal of ordinary mortality god send it may find me prepared and whatever i may have been formerly high spirits are not now like to carry me away  june 21at court and called on ballantyne on my return i was obliged to go to the register office at one where i waited nearly an hour without meeting my brethren but i wrote a letter to lockhart in the meantime my niece ann arrived to my great satisfaction i am glad that anne my daughter has such a sensible and clever companion dined at baron humes  june 22wrought had a note from ballantyne complaining of my manuscript and requesting me to read it over i would give £1000 if i could but it would take me longer to read than to write i cannot trace my pieds de mouche but with great labour and trouble so een take your own share of the burden my old friend and since i cannot read be thankful i can write i will look at his proof however and then be quiet and idle for the rest of the evening i am come to charles the firsts trial and though i have it by heart i must refresh myself with a reading of clarendon charles sharpe and francis scott came in the evening  june 23this morning the two annes and i went to sir robert liston at milburn towera beautiful retreat the travels of the venerable diplomatist are indicated by the various articles of curiosity which he has picked up in different corners of the world and put together with much taste the conservatory and gardens are very fine and contain i suppose very curious plantsi am sure hard names enough but then the little gothic tower embowered amid trees and bushes surrounded by these pleasant gardens offering many a sunny walk for winter many a shade for summer are inexpressibly pleasing the good old knight and his lady are worthy of it for they enjoy it the artificial piece of water is a failure like most things of the kind the offices without being on an extravagant scale are most substantial the piggery in particular is quite a palace and the animals clean and comfortable i think i have caught from them a fit of piggish obstinacy i came at one and cannot prevail upon myself to go to work i answer the calls of duty as caliban does those of prospero theres wood enough within to be sure i have not got the clarendon  june 24it was my fathers own son as john hielandman said who did little both yesterday and todayi mean little in the way of literary work for as to positive work i have been writing letters about chancery business till i am sick of it there was a long hearing and while jeffrey exerted his eloquence in the inner house i plied my eloquence de billet in the library so on the whole i am no bad boy besides the day is not yet over  june 25i was surprised to hear that our academy rector williams has renounced the chair of roman learning in the new london university his alarm was excited by the interest taken by the prelates in opposing a high church institution to that desired by mr brougham both the bishops and williams have been unwise the former have manoeuvred ill they should in the outset have taken the establishment out of the hands of the whigs without suffering them to reinforce themselves by support from others and williams was equally precipitate in joining an institution which a small degree of foresight might have assured him would be opposed by his spiritual superiors however there he stands deprived of his professorship by his resignation and of his rectorship by our having engaged with a successor i think it very doubtful whether the bishops will now admit him into their alliance he has in that case offended both parties but if they are wise they will be glad to pick up the best schoolmaster in europe though he comes for the present graiâ ex urbe i accomplished more than my task today  june 26wrote a long letter to lockhart about williams situation saying how by sitting betwixt two stools he       had fallen with heavy thump     upon his reverential rump  and how the bishops should pick him up if they wanted their establishment to succeed it is an awkward position in which williams has placed himself he loses the whig chair and has perhaps no chance of favour from the high church for having been willing to accept it even if they now give him promotion there will be a great outcry on his having left one institution to join another he would be thickskinned if he stands the clamour yet he has to all appearance rather sacrificed than advanced his interest however i say again the bishops ought not to omit securing him  mr macintosh mackay breakfasted with me modest intelligent and gentle i did my duty and more in the course of the day  i am vexed about mackay missing the church of cupar in angus it is in the crowns gift and peel finding that two parties in the town recommended two opposite candidates very wisely chose to disappoint them both and was desirous of bestowing the presentation on public grounds i heard of this and applied to mr peel for macintosh mackay whose quiet patience and learning are accompanied by a most excellent character as a preacher and a clergyman but unhappily mr peel had previously put himself into the hands of sir george murray who applied to sir peter his brother who naturally applied to certain leaders of the church at edinburgh and these reverend gentlemen have recommended that the church which the minister desired to fill up on public grounds should be bestowed on a boy228 the nephew of one of their number of whom the best that can be said is that nothing is known since he has only been a few months in orders this comes of kith kin and ally but peel shall know of it and may perhaps judge for himself another time  june 27i came out after court to blair adam with our excellent friend the rev john thomson of duddingston so modest and so accomplisheddelightful drive and passage at the ferry we found at blair adam the cc and family admiral adam and lady james thomson of charlton and miss t will clerk and last not least lord chief baron shepherdall in high spirits for our excursions  thomson described to me a fine dungeon in the old tower at cassillis in ayrshire there is an outer and inner vaulted chamber each secured with iron doors at the upper end of the innermost are two great stones or blocks to which the staples and chains used in securing the prisoners are still attached between these stone seats is an opening like the mouth of a still deeper dungeon the entrance descends like the mouth of a drawwell or shaft of a mine and deep below is heard the sullen roar of the river doon one branch of which passing through the bottom of the shaft has probably swept away the body of many a captive whose body after death may have been thus summarily disposed of i may find use for such a placestory of kittleclarkie  june 28off we go to castle campbell after breakfast ie will clerk admiral adam j thomson and myself tremendous hot is the day and the steep ascent of the castle which rises for two miles up a rugged and broken path was fatiguing enough yet not so much so as the streets in london castle campbell is unaltered the window of which the disjointed stone projects at an angle from the wall and seems at the point of falling has still found power to resist the laws of gravitation whoever built that tottering piece of masonry has been long in a forgotten grave and yet what he has made seems to survive in spite of nature itself the curious cleft called kemps score which gave the garrison access to the water in case of siege is obviously natural but had been improved by steps now choked up a girl who came with us recollected she had shown me the way down to the bottom of this terrible gulf seven years ago i am not able for it now      wont to dos awa frae me     frae silly auld john ochiltree229  june 29being sunday we kept about the doors and after two took the drosky and drove over the hill and round by the kiery craigs i should have said williams came out in the morning to ask my advice about staying another year in edinburgh i advised him if possible to gain a few days time till i should hear from lockhart he has made a pretty mess for himself but if the bishops are wise they may profit by it the sound practical advice of williams at the first concoction would be of the last consequence i suspect their systems of eatinghouses are the most objectionable part of the college discipline when their attentions are to be given to the departments of the cook and the butler all zeal in the nobler paths of education is apt to decay  well to return to the woods i think notwithstanding lord chief commissioners assiduity

round the hill of bennarty par terre and returned par mer our route by land led us past lochore where we made a pause for a few moments then proceeded to ballingray or bingray and so by kirkness where late ravages are supplied by the force of vegetation down to the shores of lochleven we embarked and went upon saint serfs island supposed to have been anciently a cell of the culdees an old pinfold or rather a modern pinfold constructed out of the ancient chapel is all that attests its former sanctity we landed on queen marys island a miserable scene considering the purpose for which the castle was appointed and yet the captivity and surrender of the percy was even a worse tale since it was an eternal blight on the name of douglas well we got to blair adam in due time and our fine company began to separate lord chief baron going off after dinner we had wine and wassail and john thomsons delightful flute to help us through the evening  thus end the delectations of the blair adam club

fills my head with pain my heart with sadness and my eyes with tears i do not wonder at the awful feelings which visited men less educated and less firm than i may call myself it is a most hangdog cast of feeling but it may be chased away by study or by exercise the last i have always found most successful but the first is most convenient i wrought therefore and endured all this forenoon being a teind wednesday i am now in such a state that i would hardly be surprised at the worst news which could be brought to me and all this without any rational cause why today should be sadder than yesterday  two things to lighten my spiritsfirst cadell comes to assure me that the stock of 12mo novels is diminished from 3800 which was the quantity in the publishers hands in march 1827 to 600 or 700 this argues gallant room for the publication of the new series second said cadell is setting off straight for london to set affairs agoing if i have success in this it will greatly assist in extricating my affairs  my aches of the heart terminated in a cruel aching of the headrheumatic i suppose but sir adam and clerk came to dinner and laughed and talked the sense of pain and oppression away we cannot at times work ourselves into a gay humour any more than we can tickle ourselves into a fit of laughter foreign agency is necessary my huntress of lions again dined with us i have subscribed to her album and done what was civil  july 3corrected proofs in the morning and wrote a little i was forced to crop vol i as thirty pages too long there is the less to write behind we were kept late at the court and when i came out i bethought me like christian in the castle of giant despair wherefore should i walk along the broiling and stifling streets when i have a little key in my bosom which can open any lock in princes street walks and be thus on the castle banks rocks and trees in a few minutes i made use of my key accordingly and walked from the castle hill down to wallaces tower231 and thence to the west end of princes street through a scene of grandeur and beauty perhaps unequalled whether the foreground or distant view is consideredall down hill too foolish never to think of this before i chatted with the girls a good while after dinner but wrote a trifle when we had tea  july 4the two annes set off to abbotsford though the weather was somewhat lowering for an open carriage but the day cleared up finely hamilton is unwell so we had a long hearing of his on our hands it was four ere i got home but i had taken my newly discovered path by rock bush and ruin i question if europe has such another path we owe this to the taste of james skene but i must dress to go to dr hopes who makes chère exquise and does not understand being kept late  july 5saturday corrected proofs and wrought hard went out to dinner at oxenfoord castle and returned in the company of lord alloway chief baron clerk etc and mr bouverie the english commissioner  july 6a day of hard work the second volume is now well advancedwellnigh one half dined alone and pursued my course after dinner seven pages were finished solitudes a fine thing for work but then you must lie by like a spider till you collect materials to continue your web began simonds switzerlandclever and intelligent but rather conceited as the manner of an american frenchman i hope to knock something out of him though  july 7williams seems in uncertainty again and i cant guess what he will be at surely it is a misery to be so indecisive he will certainly gain the ill word of both parties and might have had the good word of all and indeed deserves it we received his resignation today but if the kings college are disposed to thrive they will keep eyes on this very able man  july 8hard work in the court the sederunts turn long and burthensome i fear they will require some abridgment of vacation  from july 8 1828 to january 10 1829 there are no entries in the journal  footnotes  230 burnss song  231 now called wellhouse tower     1829     january   having omitted to carry on my diary for two or three days i lost heart to make it up and left it unfilled for many a month and day during this period nothing has happened worth particular notice the same occupations the same amusements the same occasional alternations of spirits gay or depressed the same absence of all sensible or rational cause for the one or the other i half grieve to take up my pen and doubt if it is worth while to record such an infinite quantity of nothing but hang it i hate to be beat so here goes for better behaviour  january 10i resume my task at abbotsford we are here alone except lockhart on a flying visit morritt his niece sir james stuart skene and an occasional friend or two have been my guests since 31st december i cannot say i have been happy for the feeling of increasing weakness in my lame leg is a great affliction i walk now with pain and difficulty at all times and it sinks my soul to think how soon i may be altogether a disabled cripple i am tedious to my friends and i doubt the sense of it makes me fretful  everything else goes off well enough my cash affairs are clearing and though last year was an expensive one i have been paying debt yet i have a dull contest before me which will probably outlast my life if well maintained however it will be an honourable one and if the magnum opus succeed it will afford me some repose  january 11i did not write above a page yesterday most weary stale and unprofitable have been my labours received a letter i suppose from mad t proposing a string of historical subjects not proper for my purpose people will not consider that a thing may already be so well told in history that romance ought not in prudence to meddle with it  the ground covered with snow which by slipperiness and the pain occasioned by my lameness renders walking unpleasant  january 12this is the third day i have not walked out pain and lameness being the cause this bodes very ill for my future life i made a search yesterday and today for letters of lord byron to send to tom moore but i could only find two i had several others and am shocked at missing them the one which he sent me with a silver cup i regret particularly it was stolen out of the cup itself by some vile inhospitable scoundrel for a servant would not have thought such a theft worth while  my spirits are low yet i wot not why i have been writing to my sons walters majority was like to be reduced but is spared for the present charles is going on well i trust at the foreign office so i hope all is well  loitered out a useless day half arranging half disarranging books and papers and packing the things i shall want der abschiedstag ist da  january 13the day of return to edinburgh is come i dont know why but i am more happy at the change than usual i am not working hard and it is what i ought to do and must do every hour of laziness cries fie upon me but there is a perplexing sinking of the heart which one cannot always overcome at such times i have wished myself a clerk quilldriving for twopence per page you have at least application and that is all that is necessary whereas unless your lively faculties are awake and propitious your application will do you as little good as if you strained your sinews to lift arthurs seat  january 14 edinburghgot home last night after a freezing journey this morning i got back some of the last copy and tugged as hard as ever did soutar to make ends meet then i will be reconciled to my task which at present disgusts me visited lady jane then called on mr robison and instructed him to call a meeting of the council of the royal society as mr knox proposes to read an essay on some dissections a bold proposal truly from one who has had so lately the boldness of trading so deep in human flesh i will oppose his reading in the present circumstances if i should stand alone but i hope he will be wrought upon to withdraw his essay or postpone it at least it is very bad taste to push himself forward just now lockhart dined with us which made the evening a pleasant but an idle one well i must rouse myself      awake arise or be for ever fallen232  january 15day began with beggars as usual and john nicolson has not sense to keep them out i never yield however to this importunity thinking it wrong that what i can spare to meritorious poverty of which i hear and see too much should be diverted by impudent importunity i was detained at the parliament house till nearly three by the great case concerning prescription maule v maule233 this was made up to me by hearing an excellent opinion from lord corehouse with a curious discussion in apicibus juris i disappointed graham234 of a sitting for my picture  i went to the council of the royal society which was convened at my request to consider whether we ought to hear a paper on anatomical subjects read by mr knox whose name has of late been deeply implicated in a criminal prosecution against certain wretches who had murdered many persons and sold their bodies to professors of the anatomical science some thought that our declining to receive the paper would be a declaration unfavourable to dr knox i think hearing it before mr knox has made any defence as he is stated to have in view would be an intimation of our preference of the cause of science to those of morality and common humanity mr knoxs friends undertook to deal with him about suffering the paper to be omitted for the present while adhuc coram judice lis est235  january 16nothing on the roll today so i did not go to the parliament house but fagged at my desk till two  dr ross called to relieve me of a corn which though my lameness needs no addition had tormented me vilely i again met the royal society council dr knox consents to withdraw his paper or rather suffers the reading to be postponed there is some great error in the law on the subject if it was left to itself many bodies would be imported from france and ireland and doubtless many would be found in our hospitals for the service of the anatomical science but the total and severe exclusion of foreign supplies of this kind raises the price of the subjects as they are called technically to such a height that wretches are found willing to break into the bloody house of life236 merely to supply the anatomists table the law which as a deeper sentence on the guilt of murder declares that the body of the convicted criminal should be given up to anatomy is certainly not without effect for criminals have been known to shrink from that part of the sentence which seems to affect them more than the doom of death itself with all its terrors here and hereafter on the other hand while this idea of the infamy attending the exposition of the person is thus recognised by the law it is impossible to adopt regulations which would effectually prevent such horrid crimes as the murder of vagrant wretches who can be snatched from society without their being missed as in the case of the late conspiracy for instance if it was now to be enacted as seems reasonable that persons dying in hospitals and almshouses who die without their friends claiming their remains should be given up to the men of science this would be subjecting poverty to the penalty of these atrocious criminals whom law distinguishes by the heaviest posthumous disgrace which it can inflict even cultivated minds revolt from the exposure on an anatomical table when the case is supposed to be that of one who is dear to them i should i am conscious be willing that i myself should be dissected in public if doing so could produce any advantage to society but when i think on relations and friends being rent from the grave the case is very different and i would fight kneedeep to prevent or punish such an exposure so inconsistent we are all upon matters of this nature  i dined quietly at home with the girls and wrote after dinner  january 17nothing in the roll corrected proofs and went off at 12 oclock in the hamilton stage to william lockharts at auchinrath my companions mr livingstone the clergyman of camnethan a bailie hamilton the king of trumps i am told in the burgh of hamilton and a mr davie martin qui gaudet equis et canibus got to auchinrath by six and met lord douglas237 his brother captain douglas en john g lockhart also who had a large communication from duke of w upon the subject of the bullion the duke scouts the economists ideas about paper credit after the proposition that all men shall be entitled to require gold  january 18we went the two lockharts and i to williams new purchase of milton we found on his ground a cottage where a man called greenshields238 a sensible powerfulminded person had at twentyeight rather too late a week239 taken up the art of sculpture he had disposed of the person of the king most admirably according to my poor thoughts and had attained a wonderful expression of ease and majesty at the same time he was desirous of engaging on burns jolly beggars which i dissuaded caricature is not the object of sculpture  we went to milton on as fine a day as could consist with snow on the ground the situation is eminently beautiful a fine promontory round which the clyde makes a magnificent bend we fixed on a situation where the sittingroom should command the upper view and with an ornamental garden i think it may be made the prettiest place in scotland  january 19posted to edinburgh with john lockhart we stopped at allanton to see a tree transplanted which was performed with great ease sir henry is a sad coxcomb and lifted beyond the solid earth by the effect of his books success but the book well deserves it240 he is in practice particularly anxious to keep the roots of the tree near the surface and only covers them with about a foot of earth  notelime rubbish dug in among the roots of ivy encourages it much  the operation delayed us three hours so it was seven oclock before we reached our dinner and a good fire in shandwick place and we were wellnigh frozen to death during this excursion i walked very illwith more pain in fact than i ever remember to have feltand even leaning on john lockhart could hardly get on baad that vara baadit might be the severe weather though and the numbing effect of the sitting in the carriage be it what it will i cant help myself  january 20i had little to do at the court and returned home soon honest old mr ferrier is dead at extreme old age i confess i should not wish to live so long he was a man with strong passions and strong prejudices but with generous and manly sentiments at the same time we used to call him uncle adam after that character in his gifted daughters novel of the heiress inheritance i wrote a long letter after i came home to my lord elgin about greenshields the sculptor241 i am afraid he is going into the burlesque line to which sculpture is peculiarly ill adapted so i have expressed my veto to his patron valeat quantum also a letter to mrs professor sandford at glasgow about reprinting macaulays history of st kilda242 advising them to insert the history of lady grange who was kidnapped and banished thither  i corrected my proofs moreover and prepared to dine after dinner we go to euphemia erskines marriage mr dallas came in and presented me with an old pedigree of the mintoshes the wedding took place with the usual april weather of smiles and tears the bridegrooms name is dawson as he as well as the bride is very tall they have every chance of bringing up a family of giants the bridegroom has an excellent character he is only a captain but economy does wonders in the army where there are many facilities for practising it i sincerely wish them happiness  january 21went out to dalkeith house to dine and stay all night found marquis of lothian and a family party i liked the sense and spirit displayed by this young nobleman who reminds me strongly of his parents whom i valued so highly  january 22left dalkeith after breakfast and gained the parliament house where there was almost nothing to do at eleven oclock afterwards sat to graham who is making a good thing of it mr colvin smith has made a better in one sense having sold ten or twelve copies of the portrait to different friends243 the solicitor came to dine with mewe drank a bottle of champagne and two bottles of claret which in former days i should have thought a very sober allowance since lockhart included there were three persons to drink it but i felt i had drunk too much and was uncomfortable the young men stood it like young men skene and his wife and daughter looked in in the evening i suppose i am turning to my second childhood for not only am i filled drunk or made stupid at least with one bottle of wine but i am disabled from writing by chilblains on my fingersa most babyish complaint they say that the character is indicated by the handwriting if so mine is crabbed enough  january 23still severe frost annoying to sore fingers nothing on the roll i sat at home and wrote letters to wilkie landseer mrs hughes charles etc went out to old mr ferriers funeral and saw the last duty rendered to my old friend whose age was      like a lusty winter     frosty but kindly244  i mean in a moral as well as a physical sense i then went to cadells for some few minutes  i carried out lockhart to dalkeith where we dined supped and returned through a clinking frost with snow on the ground lord ramsay and the miss kerrs were at dalkeith the duke shows for so young a man a great deal of character and seems to have a proper feeling of the part he has to play the evening was pleasant but the thought that i was now the visitor and friend of the family in the third generation lay somewhat heavy on me every thing around me seemed to say that beauty power wealth honour were but things of a day  january 24heavy fall of snow lockhart is off in the mail i hope he will not be blockaded the day bitter cold i went to the court and with great difficulty returned along the slippery street i ought to have taken the carriage but i have a superstitious dread of giving up the habit of walking and would willingly stick to the last by my old hardy customs  little but trifles to do at the court my hands are so covered with chilblains that i can hardly use a penmy feet ditto  we bowled away at six oclock to mr wardlaw ramsays found we were a week too early and went back as if our noses had been bleeding  january 25worked seriously all morning expecting the fergusons to dinner alas instead of that i learn that my poor innocent friend mary is no more she was a person of some odd and peculiar habits wore a singular dress and affected wild and solitary haunts but she was at the same time a woman of talent and even genius she used often to take long walks with me up through the glens and i believe her sincere good wishes attended me as i was always glad of an opportunity to show her kindness i shall long think of her when at abbotsford this sad event breaks up our little party will clerk came however and his têteàtête was of course interesting and amusing in the highest degree we drank some whisky and water and smoked a cigar or two till nine at night      no after friendships ere can raise     the endearments of our early days  january 26i muzzed oni can call it little betterwith anne of geierstein the materials are excellent but the power of using them is failing yet i wrote out about three pages sleeping at intervals  january 27a great and general thaw the streets afloat the snow descending on ones head from the roofs went to the court there was little to do left about twelve and took a sitting with graham who begs for another sir james stuart stood bottleholder on this occasion had rather an unfavourable account of the pictures of james stuart of dunearn which are to be sold i had promised to pick up one or two for the duke of buccleuch came home and wrote a leaf or two i shall be soon done with the second volume of anne of geierstein i cannot persuade myself to the obvious risk of satisfying the public although i cannot so well satisfy myself i am like beaumont and fletchers old merrythought who could not be persuaded that there was a chance of his wanting meat i never came into my parlour said he but i found the cloth laid and dinner ready surely it will be always thus use makes perfectness245  my reflections are of the same kind and if they are unlogical they are perhaps not the less comfortable fretting and struggling does no good wrote to miss margaret ferguson a letter of condolence  january 28breakfasted for a wonder abroad with hay drummond whose wife appears a pretty and agreeable little woman we worshipped his tutelar deity the hercules and saw a good model of the hercules bibax or the drunken hercules graham and sir james stuart were there homebaked bread and soldiers coffee were the treat i came home and sir robert dundas having taken my duty at the court i wrote for some time but not much burke the murderer hanged this morning the mob which was immense demanded knox and hare but though greedy for more victims received with shouts the solitary wretch who found his way to the gallows out of five or six who seem not less guilty than he but the story begins to be stale although i believe a doggerel ballad upon it would be popular how brutal soever the wit this is the progress of human passions we ejaculate exclaim hold up to heaven our hand like the rustic phidyle246next morning the mood changes and we dance a jig to the tune which moved us to tears mr bell sends me a specimen of a historical novel but he goes not the way to write it he is too general and not sufficiently minute it is not easy to convey this to an author with the necessary attention to his feelings and yet in good faith and sincerity it must be done  january 29i had a vacant day once more by the kindness of sir robert unasked but most kindly afforded i have not employed it to much purpose i wrote six pages to croker247 who is busied with a new edition of boswells life of johnson to which most entertaining book he hopes to make large additions from mrs piozzi hawkins and other sources i am bound by many obligations to do as much for him as i can which can only respect the scottish tour i wrote only two or three pages of anne i am       as one who in a darksome way     doth walk with fear and dread  but walk i must and walk forward too or i shall be benighted with a vengeance after dinner to compromise matters with my conscience i wrote letters to mr bell mrs hughes and so forth thus i concluded the day with a sort of busy idleness this will not do by cock and pye it will not  january 30mr stuart breakfasted with me a grandnephew of lady louisas a very pleasing young gentleman the coach surprised me by not calling will it be for the martyrdom i trow it will yet strange to say i cannot recollect if it is a regular holiday or not      uprouse ye then my merry merry men     and use it as ye may  i wrote in the morning and went at one oclock to a meeting of country gentlemen about bringing the direct road from london down by jedburgh said to be the nearest line by fifty miles it is proposed the pleasant men of teviotdale should pay not only their own sharethat is the expense of making the road through our own country but also the expense of making the road under the ellsdon trust in northumberland where the english would positively do nothing i stated this to the meeting as an act of quixotry if it be an advantage which unless to individuals may be doubted it is equally one to northumberland as to roxburgh therefore i am clear that we should go acquals  i think i have maybe put a spoke in the wheel the raising the statute labour of roxburgh to an oppressive extent to make roads in england is i think jimp legal and will be much complained of by the poorer heritors henry of harden dines with me têteàtête excepting the girls  january 31i thought i had opened a vein this morning and that it came freely but the demands of art have been more than i can bear i corrected proofs before breakfast went to court after that meal was busy till near one oclock then i went to cadells where they are preparing to circulate the prospectus of the magnum which will have all the effect of surprise on most people i sat to mr graham till i was quite tired then went to lady jane who is getting better then here at four but fit for nothing but to bring up this silly diary  the corpse of the murderer burke is now lying in state at the college in the anatomical class and all the world flock to see him who is he that says that we are not ill to please in our objects of curiosity the strange means by which the wretch made money are scarce more disgusting than the eager curiosity with which the public have licked up all the carrion details of this business  i trifled with my work i wonder how johnson set himself doggedly to itto a work of imagination it seems quite impossible and ones brain is at times fairly addled and yet i have felt times when sudden and strong exertion would throw off all this mistiness of mind as a north wind would disperse it      blow blow thou northern wind248  nothing more than about two or three pages i went to the parliament house today but had little to do i sat to mr graham the last time heaven be praised if i be not known in another age it will not be for want of pictures we dined with mr wardlaw ramsay and lady annea fine family there was little done in the way of work except correcting proofs the bile affects me and makes me vilely drowsy when i should be most awake met at mr wardlaws several people i did not know looked over cumnor hall by mr usher tighe of oxford i see from the inscription on tony fosters tomb that he was a skilful planter amongst other fashionable accomplishments  footnotes  232 miltons paradise lost bk i  233 see cases in court of session vol vii s p 527  234 john graham who afterwards assumed the name of gilbert born 1794 died 1866  he was at this time painting sir walter for the royal society of edinburgh when the portrait was finished it was placed in the rooms of the society where it still hangs the artist retained in his own collection a duplicate with some slight variations which his widow presented to the national portrait gallery london in 1867  235 sir walter in common with the majority of his contemporaries evidently believed that dr robert knox was partly responsible for the west port atrocities but it is only just to the memory of the talented anatomist to say that an independent and influential committee after a careful examination reported on march 13th 1829 that there was no evidence showing that he or his assistants knew that murder had been committed but the committee thought that more care should have been exercised in the reception of the bodies at the anatomical classroom  lord cockburn who was one of the counsel at the trial of burke in writing of these events remarks all our anatomists incurred a most unjust and very alarming though not an unnatural odium dr knox in particular against whom not only the anger of the populace but the condemnation of more intelligent persons was specially directed but tried in reference to the invariable and the necessary practice of the profession our anatomists were spotlessly correct and knox the most correct of them all  at this date dr knox was the most popular teacher in the medical school at edinburgh and as his classroom could not contain more than a third of his students he had to deliver his lectures twice or thrice daily the odium attached to his name might have been removed in time had his personal character stood as high as his professional ability but though he remained in edinburgh until 1841 he never recovered his position there and for the last twenty years of his life this once brilliant teacher subsisted as best he could in london by his pen and as an itinerant lecturer he died in 1862  236 king john act iv so 2  237

days work i have made this long time no interruption and i got pleased with my work which ends the second volume of anne of geierstein after dinner had a letter from lockhart with happy tidings about the probability of the commission on the stewart papers being dissolved the duke of w says commissions never either did or will do any good john will in that case be sole editor of these papers with an apartment at st jamess cum plurimis aliis it will be a grand coup if it takes place  february 2sent off yesterdays work with proofs could i do as toughly for a weekand many a day i have done morei should be soon out of the scrape i wrote letters and put over the day till one when i went down with sir james stuart to see stuart of dunearns pictures now on sale i did not see much which my poor taste covets a hobbema much admired is i think as tame a piece of work as i ever saw i promised to try to get a good picture or two for the young duke  dined with the old club instituted forty years ago there were present lord justiceclerk lord advocate sir peter murray john irving william clerk and i it was a party such as the meeting of fellow scholars and fellow students alone could occasion we told old stories laughed and quaffed and resolved rashly perhaps that we would hold the club at least once a year if possible twice we will see how this will fudge our mirth was more unexpected as sir adam our first fiddle was wanting owing to his family loss  february 3rose at eightfelt my revel a little in my head the court business light returned by cadell and made one or two calls at skenes especially dinner and evening at home laboriously employed  february 4today i was free from duty and made good use of my leisure at home finishing the second volume of anne and writing several letters one to recommend captain pringle to lord beresford which i send tomorrow through morritt my mother whips me and i whip the top the girls went to the play  february 5attended the court as usual got dismissed about one finished and sent off volume ii of anne dined with robert rutherford my cousin and the whole clan of swinton  february 6corrected proofs in the morning then to the court thence to cadells where i found some business cut out for me in the way of notes which delayed me walked home the weary way giving my feet the ancient twinges of agony such a journey is as severe a penance as if i had walked the same length with peas in my shoes to atone for some horrible crime by beating my toes into a jelly i wrote some and corrected a good deal we dined alone and i partly wrought partly slept in the evening its now pretty clear that the duke of w intends to have a catholic bill249 he probably expects to neutralise and divide the catholic body by bringing a few into parliament where they will probably be tractable enough rather than a large proportion of them rioting in ireland where they will be to a certain degree unanimous  february 7up and wrought a little i had at breakfast a son of sir thomas dick lauder a very quick smartlooking young fellow who is on his way to the continent with a tutor dined at mrs george swintons with the whole clan  february 8i wrought the whole day and finished about six pages of manuscript of vol iii anne of geierstein sat cito si sat bene the skenes came in to supper like the olden world  february 9was up in good time say halfpast seven and employed the morning in correcting proofs at twelve i went to stuart of dunearns sale of pictures this poor man fell like myself a victim to speculation and though i had no knowledge of him personally and disliked him as the cause of poor sir alexander boswells death yet had he been slaughterman to all my kin250 i could but pity the miserable sight of his splendid establishment broken up and his treasures of art exposed to public and unsparing sale i wanted a picture of the earl of rothes for the duke of buccleuch a fine sir joshua but balfour of balbirnie fancied it also and followed it to 160 guineas charles sharpes account is that i may think myself in luck for the face has been repainted there is he says a print taken from the picture at leslie house which has quite a different countenance from the present  this job however took me up the whole morning to little purpose captain and mrs hall dined with us also sir james stuart charles sharpe john scott of gala etc  february 10i was up at seven this morning and will continue the practice but the shoal of proofs took up all my leisure i will not i think go after these secondrate pictures again today if i could get a quiet day or two i would make a deep dint in the third volume but hashed and smashed as my time is who can make anything of it i read over henrys history of henry vi and edward iv he is but a stupid historian after all this took me up the whole day  february 11up as usual and wrought at proofs mr hay drummond and macintosh mackay dined the last brought me his history of the blara leine or white battle battle of the shirts to the court and remained there till two when we had some awkward business in the council of the royal society  february 12w lockhart came to breakfast full of plans for his house which will make a pretty and romantic habitation after breakfast the court claimed its vassal  as i came out mr chambers introduced a pretty little romantic girl to me who possessed a laudable zeal to know a live poet i went with my fair admirer as far as the new rooms on the mound where i looked into the royal societys rooms then into the exhibition in mere unwillingness to work and desire to dawdle away time learned that lord haddington had bought the sir joshua i wrought hard today and made out five pages  february 13this morning col hunter blair breakfasted here with his wife a very pretty woman with a good deal of pleasant conversation she had been in india and had looked about her to purpose i wrote for several hours in the forenoon but was nervous and drumlie also i bothered myself about geography in short there was trouble as miners say when the vein of metal is interrupted went out at two and walked thank god better than in the winter which gives me hopes that the failure of the unfortunate limb is only temporary owing to severe weather we dined at john murrays with the mansfield family lady caroline murray possesses i think the most pleasing taste for music and is the best singer i ever heard no temptation to display a very brilliant voice ever leads her aside from truth and simplicity and besides she looks beautiful when she sings  february 14wrote in the morning which begins to be a regular act of duty it was late ere i got home and i did not do much the letters i received were numerous and craved answers yet the third volume is getting on hooly and fairly i am twenty leaves before the printers but ballantynes wife is ill and it is his nature to indulge apprehensions of the worst which incapacitates him for labour i cannot help regarding this amiable weakness of the mind with something too nearly allied to contempt i keep the press behind me at a good distance and i like the      postboys horse am glad to miss     the lumber of the wheels251  february 15i wrought today but not muchrather dawdled and took to reading chamberss beauties of scotland252 which would be admirable if they were more accurate he is a clever young fellow but hurts himself by too much haste i am not making too much myself i know and i know too it is time i were making it unhappily there is such a thing as more haste and less speed i can very seldom think to purpose by lying perfectly idle but when i take an idle book or a walk my mind strays back to its task out of contradiction as it were the things i read become mingled with those i have been writing and something is concocted i cannot compare this process of the mind to anything save that of a woman to whom the mechanical operation of spinning serves as a running bass to the songs she sings or the course of ideas she pursues the phrase hoc age often quoted by my father does not jump with my humour i cannot nail my mind to one subject of contemplation and it is by nourishing two trains of ideas that i can bring one into order  colin mackenzie came in to see me poor fellow he looks well in his retirement partly i envy himpartly i am better pleased as it is  february 16stayed at home and laboured all the forenoon young invernahyle called to bid me interest myself about getting a lad of the house of scott a commissionhow is this possible the last i tried for there was about 3000 on the listand they say the boy is too old being twentyfour i scribbled three or four pages forbore smoking and whisky and water and went to the royal society there sir william hamilton read an essay the result of some anatomical investigations which contained a masked battery against the phrenologists  february 17in the morning i sent off copy and proof i received the melancholy news that james ballantyne has lost his wife with his domestic habits the blow is irretrievable what can he do poor fellow at the head of such a family of children i should not be surprised if he were to give way to despair  i was at the court where there was little to do but it diddled away my time till two i went to the library but not a book could i get to look at it is i think a wrong system the lending books to private houses at all and leads to immense annual losses i called on skene and borrowed a volume of his journal to get some information about burgundy and provence something may be made out of king rené but i wish i had thought of him sooner253 dined alone with the girls  february 18this being teind wednesday i had a holiday worked the whole day interrupted by calls from dr ross sir hugh palliser sir david hunter blair and colonel blair i made out about six pages before dinner and go to lord gilliess to dine with a good conscience hay drummond came in and discharged a volley at me which mons meg could hardly have equalled i will go to work with skenes journal my head aches violently and has done so several days it is cold i think  at lord gilliess we found sir john dalrymple lady dalrymple and miss ferguson mr hope vere of craigiehall and lady elizabeth a sister of lord tweeddale sir robert ocallaghan captain cathcart and othersa gay party  february 19an execrable dayhalf frost half fresh half sleet half rain and wholly abominable having made up my packet for the printinghouse and performed my duty at the court i had the firmness to walk round by the north bridge and face the weather for two miles by way of exercise called on skene and saw some of his drawings of aix it was near two before i got home and now i hear three strike part of this hour has been consumed in a sound sleep by the fireside after putting on dry things i met baron hume254 and we praised each others hardihood for daring to take exercise in such weather agreeing that if a man relax the custom of his exercise in scotland for a bad day he is not likely to resume it in a hurry the other moiety of the time was employed in looking over the mémoires de faucheborel255  february 20the court duly took me up from eleven till about three but left some time for labour which i employed to purpose at least i hope so i declined going to the exhibition of paintings tonight neither the beauties of art nor of nature have their former charms for me i finished however about seven pages of manuscript which is a fair half of volume iii i wish i could command a little more time and i would soon find you something or other but the plague is that time is wanting when i feel an aptitude to work and when time abounds the will at least the real efficient power of the faculties is awanting still however we make way by degrees i glanced over some metrical romances published by hartshorne several of which have not seen the light they are considerably curious but i was surprised to see them mingled with blanchefleur and florês and one or two others which might have been spared there is no great display of notes or prolegomena and there is moreover no glossary but the work is well edited256  february 21colonel ferguson breakfasted with us i was detained at the parliament house till the hour of poor mrs ballantynes funeral then attended that melancholy ceremony the husband was unable to appear the sight of the poor children was piteous enough james ballantyne has taken his brother sandy into the house i mean the firm about which there had formerly been some misunderstanding  i attended the bannatyne club we made a very good election bringing in lord dalhousie and the lord clerk register257 our dinner went pretty well off but i have seen it merrier to be sure old dr j like an immense featherbed was burking me as the phrase now goes during the whole time i am sure that word will stick in the language for one while  february 22very rheumatic i een turned my table to the fire and feagued it away as bayes says neither did i so much as cast my eyes round to see what sort of a day it wasthe splashing on the windows gave all information that was necessary yet with all my leisure during the whole day i finished only four leaves of copysomewhat of the least master matthew258  there was no interruption during the whole day though the above is a poor account of it  february 23up and at it after breakfast mr hay drummond came in enchanted about mons meg259 and roaring as loud as she could have done for her life when she was in perfect voice  james ballantyne came in to my surprise about twelve oclock he was very serious and spoke as if he had some idea of sudden and speedy death he mentioned that he had named cadell cowan young hughes and his brother to be his trustees with myself he has settled to go to the country poor fellow to timpendean as i think  we dined at skenes where we met mr and mrs george forbes colonel and mrs blair george bell etc the party was a pleasant one colonel blair said that during the battle of waterloo there was at the commencement some trouble necessary to prevent the men from breaking their ranks he expostulated with one man why my good fellow you cannot propose to beat the french alonebetter keep your ranks the man who was one of the 71st returned to his ranks saying i believe you are very right sir but i am a man of very hot temper there was much bonhomie in the reply  february 24snowy miserable morning i corrected my proofs but had no time to write anything we ie myself and the two annes went to breakfast with mr drummond hay where we again met colonel and mrs blair with thomas thomson we looked over some most beautiful drawings260 which mrs blair had made in different parts of india exhibiting a species of architecture so gorgeous and on a scale so extensive as to put to shame the magnificence of europe and yet in most cases as little is known of the people who wrought these wonders as of the kings who built the pyramids fame depends on literature not on architecture we are more eager to see a broken column of ciceros villa than all those mighty labours of barbaric power mrs blair is full of enthusiasm she told me that when she worked with her pencil she was glad to have some one to read to her as a sort of sedative otherwise her excitement made her tremble and burst out acrying i can understand this very well having often found the necessity of doing two things at once she is a very pretty dark woman too and has been compared to rebecca daughter of the jew isaac of york  detained in the court till halfpast two bothering about lady essex kerrs will without coming to a conclusion i then got home too late to do anything as i must prepare to go to dalmahoy mr gibson came in for a little while no news  i went to dalmahoy where we were most kindly received it is a point of friendship however to go eight miles to dinner and return in the evening and my day has been cut up without a brush of work smoked a cigar on my return being very cold  february 25this morning i corrected my proofs we get on as john ferguson said when they put him on a hunter i fear there is too much historical detail and the catastrophe will be vilely huddled up and who can help it dick visited james ballantyne and found him bearing his distress sensibly and like a man i called in at cadells and also inquired after lady jane stuart who is complaining three oclock placed me at home and from that hour till ten deduct two hours for dinner i was feaguing it away  february 26sent off ten pages this morning with a revise we spy land but how to get my catastrophe packed into the compass allotted for it      it sticks like a pistol half out of its holster     or rather indeed like an obstinate bolster     which i think i have seen you attempting my dear     in vain to cram into a small pillowbeer  there is no help for iti must make a tour de force and annihilate both time and space dined at home nevertheless made small progress but i must prepare my dough before i can light my oven i would fain think i am in the right road  february 27the last post brought a letter from mr heath proposing to set off his engravings for the magnum opus against my contributions for the keepsake a pretty mode of accounting that would be he be i wrote him declining his proposal and as he says i am still in his debt i will send him the old drama of the house of aspen which i wrote some thirty years ago and offered to the stage this will make up my contribution and a good deal more if as i recollect there are five acts besides it will save me further trouble about heath and his annual secondly there are several manuscript copies of the play abroad and some of them will be popping out one of these days in a contraband manner thirdly if i am right as to the length of the piece there is £100 extra work at least which will not be inconvenient at all  dined at sir john hays with ramsay of barnton and his young bride sir david and lady hunter blair etc  i should mention that cadell breakfasted with me and entirely approved of my rejecting heaths letter there was one funny part of it in which he assured me that the success of the new edition of the waverley novels depended entirely on the excellence of the illustrationsvous êtes joaillier mons josse261 he touches a point which alarms me he greatly undervalues the portrait which wilkie has prepared to give me for this edition if it is as little of a likeness as he says it is a scrape but a scrape be it wilkie behaved in the kindest way considering his very bad health in agreeing to work for me at all and i will treat him with due delicacy and not wound his feelings by rejecting what he has given in such kindness262 and so farewell to mr heath and the conceited vulgar cockney his editor  february 28finished my proofs this morning and read part of a curious work called memoirs of vidocq a fellow who was at the head of bonapartes police it is a pickaresque tale in other words a romance of roguery the whole seems much exaggerated and got up but i suppose there is truth au fond i came home about two oclock and wrought hard and fast till night  footnotes  249 sir walter had written to mr lockhart on october 26th 1828 on hearing of an impending article in the quarterly the following letter  i cannot repress the strong desire i have to express my regret at some parts of your kind letter just received i shall lament most truly a purple article at this moment when a strong plain moderate statement not railing at catholics and their religion but reprobating the conduct of the irish catholics and pointing out the necessary effects which that conduct must have on the catholic question would have a powerful effect and might really serve king and country nothing the agitators desire so much as to render the broil general as a quarrel between catholic and protestant nothing so essential to the protestant cause as to confine it to its real causes southey as much a fanatic as eer a catholic of them all will i fear pass this most necessary landmark of debate i like his person admire his genius and respect his immense erudition butnon omnia in point of reasoning and political judgment he is a perfect harpadonothing better than a wild bull the circumstances require the interference of vir gravis pietate et moribus and you bring it a highland piper to blow a highland charge the more mischievous that it possesses much wild power of inflaming the passions  your idea that you must give southey his swing in this matter or he will quit the reviewthis is just a pilot saying if i do not give the helm to such a passenger he will quit the ship let him quit and be dd  my own confidence is you know entirely in the d as bruce said to the lord of the isles at bannockburn my faith is constant in thee now a hurlyburly charge may derange his line of battle and therein be of the most fatal consequence for gods sake avail yourself of the communication i opened while in town and do not act without it send this to the d of w if you will he will appreciate the motives that dictate it if he approves of a calm moderate but firm statement stating the unreasonable course pursued by the catholics as the great impediment to their own wishes write such an article yourself no one can make a more impressive appeal to common sense than you can  the circumstances of the times aremust bean apology for disappointing southey but nothing can be an apology for indulging him at the expense of aggravating public disturbance which for one i see with great apprehension  it has not yet come our length those to whom you allude ought certainly to be served but the d is best judge how they may be best served if the d says nothing on the subject you can slip your derwentwater greyhound if you like i write hastily but most anxiously  i repeat that i think it possible to put the catholic question as it now stands in a light which the most zealous of their supporters in this country cannot but consider as fair while the result would be that the question should not be granted at all under such guarantees but i think this is scarce to be done by inflaming the topic with all mutual virulence of polemical discussion  250 henry vi act i sc 4  251 john gilpin  252 the picture of scotland by robert chambers author of traditions of edinburgh etc 8vo 1829  253 mr skene remarks that at this time sir walter was engaged in the composition of the novel of anne of geierstein for which purpose he wished to see a paper which i had some time before contributed to the memoirs of the society of antiquaries on the subject of the secret tribunals of germany and upon which accordingly he grounded the scene in the novel upon his describing to me the scheme which he had formed for that work i suggested to him that he might with advantage connect the history of rené king of provence which would lead to many interesting topographical details which my residence in that country would enable me to supply besides the opportunity of illustrating so eccentric a character as le bon roi rené full of traits which were admirably suited to sir walters graphic style of illustration and that he could besides introduce the ceremonies of the fête dieu with great advantage as i had fortunately seen its revival the first time it was celebrated after the interruption of the revolution he liked the idea much and accordingly a journal which i had written during my residence in provence with a volume of accompanying drawings and papons history of provence was forthwith sent for and the whole dénouement of the story of anne ogeierstein was changed and the provence part woven into it in the form in which it ultimately came forthreminiscences  254 this learned gentleman died in his house 34 moray place edinburgh on the 30th august 1838

he had responded to scotts request  7 terrace kensington london jan 1829  dear sir walteri pass over all those disastrous events that have arrived to us both since our last as you justly call it melancholy parting to assure you how delighted i shall be if i can in the most inconsiderable degree assist in the illustrations of the great work which we all hope may lighten or remove that load of troubles by which your noble spirit is at this time beset considering it as only repaying a debt of obligation which you yourself have laid upon me when with an unseen hand in the antiquary you took me up and claimed me the humble painter of domestic sorrow as your countryman     march   march 1i laboured hard the whole day and between hands refreshed myself with vidocqs memoirs no one called except hay drummond who had something to say about mons meg so i wrote before and after dinner till no less than ten pages were finished  march 2i wrought but little today i was not in the vein and felt sleepy i thought to go out but disgust of the pavement kept me at home o rus etc it is pleasant to think that the 11th march sets us on the route for abbotsford i shall be done long before with this confounded novel i wish i were for i find trouble in bringing it to a conclusion people compliment me sometimes on the extent of my labour but if i could employ to purpose the hours that indolence and lassitude steal away from me they would have cause to wonder indeed but day must have night vigilance must have sleep and labour bodily or mental must have rest as edgar says i cannot fool it further263 anne is gone to hopetoun house for two days  dined at the royal society club and went to the society in the evening  march 3began this day with labour as usual and made up my packet then to the court where there is a deal of business hamilton having now a serious fit of the gout is not expected to aid any more this season i wrote a little both before and after dinner niece anne and i dined alone three poets called each bawling louder than the othersubscribe subscribe i generally do if the work be under 10s but the wares were every one so much worse than another that i declined in the three instances before me i got cross at the repeated demands and could have used richards apology      thou troublst me i am not in the vein264  march 4being teind wednesday i settled myself at my desk and laboured the whole forenoon got on to page seventytwo so there cannot be more than twenty pages wanted mr drummond hay who has an alertness in making business out of nothing came to call once more about mons meg he is a goodhumoured gentlemanlike man but i would meg were in his belly or he in hers william laidlaw also called whom i asked to dinner at four oclock arrives mr cadell with his horn charged with good news the prospectus of the magnum already issued only a week has produced such a demand among the trade that he thinks he must add a large number of copies that the present edition of 7000 may be increased to the demand he talks of raising it to 10000 or 12000 if so i shall have a constant income to bear on my unfortunate debts to a large amount yearly and may fairly hope to put them in a secure way of payment even if i should be cut off in life or in health and the power of labour i hope to be able in a year or two to make proposals for eating with my own spoons and using my own books which if i can give value for them can hardly i think be refused to me265 in the meantime i have enough and something to bequeath to my poor children this is a great mercy but i must prepare for disappointment and i will not be elated  laidlaw dined with me and poor fellow was as much elated with the news as i am for it is not of a nature to be kept secret i hope i shall have him once more at kaeside to debate as we used to do on religion and politics meanwhile patience cousin and shuffle the cards  i must do what i can to get cadells discharge from his creditors this i have always done and so far effectually but it would be most inconvenient to be at the mercy of creditors who may at any moment make inquiry into his affairs and so stop his operations the old bank of scotland are the only parties whose consent has not been obtained to his discharge and they must see their interest in consenting to it for the expediting of my affairs since to what purpose oppose it for they have not the least chance of mending their own by refusing it  march 5proofs arranged in the morning sir patrick walker that solomon the second came to propose to me that some benefit society which he patronises should attend upon mons meg but with the celts at my disposal i have every reason to think they would be affronted at being marched along with sir peter and his tail of trades lads i went to the court which detained me till two then to poor old lady seaforths funeral266 which was numerously attended it was near four ere i got home bringing skene with me we called at cadells the edition of the magnum is raised from 7000 to 10000 there will really be a clearance in a year or two if rc is not too sanguine i never saw so much reason for indulging hope by the bye i am admitted a member of the maitland club a society on the principle of the roxburghe and bannatyne what a tail of the alphabet i should draw after me were i to sign with the indications of the different societies i belong to beginning with president of the royal society of edinburgh and ended with umpire of the sixfoothigh club267 dined at home and in quiet with the girls  march 6made some considerable additions to the appendix to general preface i am in the sentiments towards the public that the buffoon player expresses towards his patron      go tell my young lord said this modest young man       if he will but invite me to dinner     ill be as diverting as ever i can       i will on the faith of a sinner  i will multiply the notes therefore when there is a chance of giving pleasure and variety there is a stronger gleam of hope on my affairs than has yet touched on them it is not steady or certain but it is bright and conspicuous ten years may last with me though i have little chance of it at the end of this time these works will have operated a clearance of debt especially as cadell offers to accommodate with such money as their house can save to pay off what presses i hope to save rather than otherwise and if i leave my literary property to my children it will make a very good thing for them and abbotsford must in any event go to my family so on the whole i have only to pray for quiet times for how can men mind their serious businessthat is according to cadells viewsbuying waverley novels when they are going mad about the catholic question dined at mr nairnes where there was a great meeting of bannatynians rather too numerous being on the part of our host an election dinner  march 7sent away proofs this extrication of my affairs though only a pisgah prospect occupies my mind more than is fitting but without some such hope i must have felt like one of the victims of the wretch burke struggling against a smothering weight on my bosom till nature could endure it no longer no i will not be the sport of circumstances come of it what will ill bend my brows like highland trows and make a bold fight of it      the best ot the warst ot     is only just to die268  and die i think i shall though i am not such a coward as mortem conscire me ipso but i gin to grow aweary of the sun and when the plant no longer receives nourishment from light and air there is a speedy prospect of its withering  dined with the banking club of scotland in virtue of sir malachi malagrowther splendid entertainment of course sir john hay in the chair  march 8spent the morning in reading proofs and additions to magnum i got a note from cadell in which ballantyne by a letter enclosed totally condemns anne of geiersteinthree volumes nearly finisheda pretty thing truly for i will be expected to do it all over again great dishonour in this as trinculo says269 besides an infinite loss sent for cadell to attend me next morning that we may consult about this business peel has made his motion on the catholic question with a speech of three hours it is almost a complete surrender to the catholics and so it should be for half measures do but linger out the feud this will or rather ought to satisfy all men who sincerely love peace and therefore all men of property but will this satisfy pat who with all his virtues is certainly not the most sensible person in the world perhaps not and if not it is but fighting them at last i smoked away and thought of ticklish politics and bad novels skene supped with us  march 9cadell came to breakfast we resolved in privy council to refer the question whether anne of gn be seaworthy or not to further consideration which as the book cannot be published at any rate during the full rage of the catholic question may be easily managed after breakfast i went to sir william arbuthnots270 and met there a select party of tories to decide whether we should act with the whigs by owning their petition in favour of the catholics i was not free from apprehension that the petition might be put into such general language as i at least was unwilling to authenticate by my subscription the solicitor271 was voucher that they would keep the terms quite general whereupon we subscribed the requisition for a meeting with a slight alteration affirming that it was our desire not to have intermeddled had not the anticatholics pursued that course and so the whigs and we are embarked in the same boat vogue la galère  went about one oclock to the castle where we saw the auld murderess mons meg brought up there in solemn procession to reoccupy her ancient place on the argyle battery lady hopetoun was my belle the day was cold but serene and i think the ladies must have been cold enough not to mention the celts who turned out upon the occasion under the leading of cluny macpherson a fine spirited lad mons meg is a monument of our pride and poverty the size is immense but six smaller guns would have been made at the same expense and done six times as much execution as she could have done there was immense interest taken in the show by the people of the town and the numbers who crowded the castlehill had a magnificent appearance about thirty of our celts attended in costume and as there was a highland regiment on duty with dragoons and artillerymen the whole made a splendid show the dexterity with which the last manned and wrought the windlass which raised old meg weighing seven or eight tons from her temporary carriage to that which has been her basis for many years was singularly beautiful as a combined exhibition of skill and strength my daughter had what might have proved a frightful accident some rockets were let off one of which lighted upon her head and set her bonnet on fire she neither screamed nor ran but quietly permitted charles k sharpe to extinguish the fire which he did with great coolness and dexterity all who saw her especially the friendly celts gave her merit for her steadiness and said she came of good blood i was very glad and proud of her presence of mind my own courage was not put to the test for being at some distance escorting the beautiful and lively countess of hopetoun i did not hear of the accident till it was over we lunched with the regiment 73d now in the castle the little entertainment gave me an opportunity of observing what i have often before remarkedthe improvement in the character of the young and subaltern officers in the army which in the course of a long and bloody war had been in point of rank and manners something deteriorated the number of persons applying for commissions 3000 being now on the lists gives an opportunity of selection and officers should certainly be gentlemen with a complete opening to all who can rise by merit the style in which duty and the knowledge of their profession is enforced prevents fainéants from long remaining in the profession  in the evening i presided at the celtic club who received me with their usual partiality i like this society and willingly give myself to be excited by the sight of handsome young men with plaids and claymores and all the alertness and spirit of highlanders in their native garb there was the usual degree of excitationexcellent dancing capital songs a general inclination to please and to be pleased a severe cold caught on the battlements of the castle prevented me from playing first fiddle so well as usual but what i could do was received with the usual partiality of the celts i got home fatigued and vino gravatus about eleven oclock we had many guests some of whom english officers seemed both amused and surprised at our wild ways especially at the dancing without ladies and the mode of drinking favourite toasts by springing up with one foot on the bench and one on the table and the peculiar shriek of applause so unlike english cheering  march 10this may be a short day in the diary though a busy one to me i arranged books and papers in the morning and went to court after breakfast where as sir robert dundas and i had the whole business to discharge i remained till two or three then visited cadell and transacted some pecuniary matters  march 11 abbotsfordi had as usual a sort of levée the day i was to leave town all petty bills and petty business being reserved to the last by those who might as well have applied any one day of the present month but i need not complain of what happens to my betters for on the last day of the session there pours into the court a succession of trifles which give the court and especially the clerks much trouble insomuch that a cidevant brother of mine proposed that the last day of the session should be abolished by statute we got out of court at a quarterpast one and got to abbotsford at halfpast seven cold and hungry enough to make scots broth english roast beef and a large fire very acceptable  march 12i set apart this day for trifles and dawdling yet i meditate doing something on the popish and protestant affray i think i could do some good and i have the sincere wish to do it i heard the merry birds sing reviewed my dogs and was cheerful i also unpacked books deuce take arrangement i think it the most complete bore in the world but i will try a little of it i afterwards went out and walked till dinnertime i read reginald hebers journal272 after dinner i spent some merry days with him at oxford when he was writing his prize poem he was then a gay young fellow a wit and a satirist and burning for literary fame my laurels were beginning to bloom and we were both madcaps who would have foretold our future lot      oh little did my mither ken       the day she cradled me     the land i was to travel in       or the death i was to die273  march 13wrought at a review of fraser tytlers history of scotland it is somewhat saucy towards lord hailes i had almost stuck myself into the controversy slough of despondthe controversy that is between the gothic and celtic systembut cast myself like christian with a strong struggle or two to the further side of this slough and now will i walk on my way rejoicingnot on my article however but to the fields came home and rejoiced at dinner after tea i worked a little more i began to warm in my gear and am about to awake the whole controversy of goth and celt i wish i may not make some careless blunders274  march 14up at eight rather of the latestthen fagged at my review both before and after breakfast i walked from one oclock till near three i make it out i think rather better than of late i have been able to do in the streets of edinburgh where i am ashamed to walk so slow as would suit me indeed nothing but a certain suspicion that once drawn up on the beach i would soon break up prevents me renouncing pedestrian exercises altogether for it is positive suffering and of an acute kind too  march 15altogether like yesterday wrote in the morningbreakfastedwrote again till oneout and walked about two hoursto the quills once moredinnersmoked a brace of cigars and looked on the firea page of writing and so to bed  march 16day sullen and bitter cold i fear it brings chilblains on its wings a dashing of snow in thin flakes wandering from the horizon and threatening a serious fall as the murderer says to banquo let it come downwe shall have the better chance of fair weather hereafter it cleared up however and i walked from one or thereabout till within a quarter of four a card from mr dempster of skibo275 whose uncle george dempster i knew many years since a friend of johnson sir joshua reynolds and all that seta fine goodhumoured old gentleman young mrs dempster is a daughter of my early friend and patron robert dundas of arniston lord advocate and i like her for his sake mr dempster is hunting and i should have liked to have given his wife and sister refuge during the time he must spend over moss and moor but the two annes going to edinburgh to a fancy ball makes it impossible till they return on friday night  march 17the annes went off at eight morning after breakfast i drove down to melrose and waited on mrs and miss dempster and engaged them for saturday weather bitter cold yea atrociously so naboclishthe better for work ladies whose husbands love foxhunting are in a poor way here are two pleasant and pretty women pegged up the whole day      in the worst inns worst room276  for the whole twentyfour hours without interruption they manage the matter otherwise in france where ladies are the lords of the ascendant i returned from my visit to my solitary work and solitary meal i eked out the last two hours length by dint of smoking which i find a sedative without being a stimulant  march 18i like the hermit life indifferent well nor would i sometimes think break my heart were i to be in that magic mountain where food was regularly supplied by ministering genii277 and plenty of books were accessible without the least intervention of human society but this is thinking like a fool solitude is only agreeable when the power of having society is removed to a short space and can be commanded at pleasure it is not good for man to be alone it blunts our faculties and freezes our active virtues and now my watch pointing to noon i think after four hours work i may indulge myself with a walk the dogs see me about to shut my desk and intimate their happiness by caresses and whining by your leave messrs genii of the mountain library if i come to your retreat ill bring my dogs with me  the day was showery but not unpleasantsoft dropping rains attended by a mild atmosphere that spoke of flowers in their seasons and a chirping of birds that had a touch of spring in it i had the patience to get fully wet and the grace to be thankful for it  come a leetle flourish on the trumpet let us rouse the genius of this same red mountain so called because it is all the year covered with roses there can be no difficulty in finding it for it lies towards the caspian and is quoted in the persian tales well i open my ephemerides form my scheme under the suitable planet and the genie obeys the

written yesterday before dinner though appearances are to the contrary i only meant that the studious solitude i have sometimes dreamed of unless practised with rare stoicism and privation was apt to degenerate into secret sensual indulgences of coarser appetites which when the cares and restraints of social life are removed are apt to make us think with dr johnson our dinner the most important event of the day so much in the way of explanationa humour which i love not go to  my girls returned from edinburgh with full news of their bal paré  march 20we spent this day on the same terms as formerly i wrought walked dined drank and smoked upon the same pattern  march 21today brought mrs dempster and her sisterinlaw to dinner came robert dundas of arniston from the huntingfield and with him mr dempster of skibo both favourites of mine mr stuart the grandnephew of my dear friend lady louisa also dined with us together with the lyons from gattonside and the day passed over in hospitality and social happiness  march 22being sunday i read prayers to our guests then went a long walk by the lake to huntly burn it is somewhat uncomfortable to feel difficulties increase and the strength to meet them diminish but why should man fret while iron is dissolved by rust and brass corrodes can our dreams be of flesh and blood enduring but i will not dwell on this depressing subject my liking to my two young guests is founded on things that are long enough ago the first statesman of celebrity whom i personally knew was mr dempsters granduncle george dempster of dunnichen celebrated in his time and dundass father was when lord advocate the first man of influence who showed kindness to me  march 23arrived to breakfast one of the courland nobility baron a von meyersdorff a fine lively spirited young man fond of his country and incensed at its degradation under russia he talked much of the orders of chivalry who had been feudal lords of livonia especially the order of porte glaive to which his own ancestors had belonged if he report correctly there is a deep principle of action at work in germany poland russia etc which if it does not die in thinking will one day make an explosion the germans are a nation however apt to exhaust themselves in speculation the baron has enthusiasm and is well read in english and foreign literature i kept my state till one and wrote notes to croker upon boswells scottish tour it was an act of friendship for time is something of a scarce article with me but croker has been at all times personally kind and actively serviceable to me and he must always command my best assistance then i walked with the baron as far as the lake our sportsmen came in good time to dinner and our afternoon was pleasant  march 24this morning our sportsmen took leave and their ladykind to renchérir on anthony awood and mr oldbuck followed after breakfast and i went to my work till one and at that hour treated the baron to another long walk with which he seemed highly delighted he tells me that my old friend the princess galitzin279 is dead after dinner i had a passing visit from kinnear to bid me farewell this very able and intelligent young man so able to throw a grace over commercial pursuits by uniting them with literature is going with his family to settle in london i do not wonder at it his parts are of a kind superior to the confined sphere in which he moves in scotland in london he says there is a rapid increase of business and its opportunities thus london licks the butter off our bread by opening a better market for ambition were it not for the difference of the religion and laws poor scotland could hardly keep a man that is worth having and yet men will not see this i took leave of kinnear with hopes for his happiness and fortune but yet with some regret for the sake of the country which loses him the baron agreed to go with kinnear to kelso and exit with the usual demonstrations of german enthusiasm  march 25i worked in the morning and think i have sent croker a packet which may be useful and to lockhart a critique on rather a dry topic viz the ancient scottish history i remember e ainslie commonly called the plain man who piqued himself on his powers of conversation striving to strike fire from some old flinty wretch whom he found in a corner of a public coach at length addressed him friend i have tried you on politics literary matters religion fashionable news etc etc and all to no purpose the dry old rogue twisting his muzzle into an infernal grin replied can you claver about bend leather the man be it understood was a leather merchant the early history of caledonia is almost as hopeless a subject but off it goes i walked up the glen with tom for my companion dined heard anne reading a paper of anecdotes about cluny macpherson and so to bed  march 26as i have been so lately johnsonizing i should derive if possible some personal use johnson advises boswell to keep a diary and to omit registers of the weather and like trumpery i am resolved in future not to register what is yet more futilemy gleams of bright and clouded temper boswellwhose nerves were one half madness and half affectationhas thrummed upon this topic till it is threadbare i have at this moment forty things to do and great inclination to do none of them i ended by working till two walking till five writing letters and so to bed  march 27letters again let me see i wrote to lord montagu about scott of beirlaws commission in which invernahyle interests himself item to a lady who is pestering me about a miss campbell sentenced to transportation for stealing a silver spoon item to john eckford item to james loch to get an appointment for sandie ballantynes son not one as dangle says280 about any business of my own my correspondence is on a most disinterested footing this lasts till past eleven then enters my cousin r and remains for two hours till politics family news talk of the neighbourhood are all exhausted and two or three reputations torn to pieces in the scouring of them at length i walk him out about a mile and come back from that empêchement but it is only to find mr henry cranstoun281 my neighbour in the parlour with the girls and there is another sederunt of an hour well such things must be and our friends mean them as civility and we must take and give the currency of the country but i am diddled out of a day all the same the ladies came from huntly burn and cut off the evening282  march 28in spite of the temptation of a fine morning i toiled manfully at the review till two oclock commencing at seven i fear it will be uninteresting but i like the muddling work of antiquities and besides wish to record my sentiments with regard to the gothic question no one that has not laboured as i have done on imaginary topics can judge of the comfort afforded by walking on allfours and being grave and dull i dare say when the clown of the pantomime escapes from his nightly task of vivacity it is his special comfort to smoke a pipe and be prosy with some goodnatured fellow the dullest of his acquaintance i have seen such a tendency in sir adam ferguson the gayest man i ever knew and poor tom sheridan has complained to me of the fatigue of supporting the character of an agreeable companion  march 29i wrote read and walked with the most stoical regularity this muddling among old books has the quality of a sedative and saves the tear and wear of an overwrought brain i wandered on the hills pleasantly enough and concluded a pleasant and laborious day  march 30i finished the remainder of the criticism and sent it off pray heaven it break not the mail coach down  lord and lady dalhousie and their relation miss hawthorne came to dinner to meet whom we had dr and mrs brewster lord dalhousie has more of the caledonian prisca fides than any man i know now alive he has served his country in all quarters of the world and in every climate yet though my contemporary looks ten years my junior he laughed at the idea of rigid temperance and held an occasional skirmish no bad thing even in the west indies thinking perhaps with armstrong of the rare debauch283 in all incidents of life he has been the same steady honest truehearted lord dalhousie that lordie ramsay promised to be when at the high school how few such can i remember and how poorly have honesty and valour been rewarded here at the time when most men think of repose he is bundled off to command in india284 would it had been the chief governorship but to have remained at home would have been bare livelihood and that is all i asked him what he thought of strangling a nabob and rifling his jewel closet and he answered no no an honest man i fear we must add a poor one lady dalhousie formerly miss brown of coalstoun is an amiable intelligent and lively woman who does not permit society to cream and mantle like a standing pool285  the weather drifting and surly does not permit us to think of melrose and i could only fight round the thicket with dr brewster and his lordship lord dalhousie gave me some interesting accounts of the american indians they are according to his lordship decaying fast in numbers and principle lord selkirks property now makes large returns from the stock of the north west company and hudsons bay companies having united i learned from lord dalhousie that he had been keeping a diary since the year 1800 should his narrative ever see the light what a contrast will it form to the flourishing vapouring accounts of most of the french merchants mr and mrs skene with their daughter kitty who has been indisposed came to dinner and the party was a wellassorted one  footnotes  263 see lear act iv sc 1  264 richard

utterly forgotten till this recalled it to remembrance ergo there was no sort of call on the duke after beating buonaparte to go to war with a booby but he could not stand the fling at the fair his correspondence seems admirable every way and the whole affair was gone through in excellent tastethe duke and hardinge trotting out the two peaceful lords rumbling down in a coach and four the duke had no halfpence and was followed and bothered for some time by the tollman on battersea bridge when hardinge fished out some silver or a groom came up there were various market gardeners on the road who when lord winchelseas equipage stopped stopped also and looked on one of them advised a turn up with natures weapons the moment all was done the duke clapped spars to his horse and was back in downing street within the two hours breakfasted and off to windsor where he transacted business for an hour or so and then said bytheby i was forgetting i have had a fieldday with lord w this morning

noble guests left about noon i wrote letters as if i had not bile enough in my bosom already and did not go out to face the snow wreaths till halfpast two when i am resolved to make a brush for exercise there will be fine howling among the dogs for i am about to shut my desk found mrs skene disposed to walk so i had the advantage of her company the snow lay three inches thick on the ground but we had the better appetite for dinner after which we talked and read without my lifting a pen  april 2begins with same brilliant prospect of snow and sunshine dazzling to the eyes and chilling to the fingers a beastly disagreeable coldness in the air i stuck by the pen till one then took a drive with the ladies as far as chiefswood and walked home young william forbes286 came and along with him a southron mr cleasby  april 3still the same party i fagged at writing letters to lockhart to charles and to john gibson to mr cadell croker lord haddington and others lockhart has had an overture through croker requesting him to communicate with some newspaper on the part of the government which he has wisely declined nothing but a thoroughgoing blackguard ought to attempt the daily press unless it is some quiet country diurnal lockhart has also a wicked wit which would make an office of this kind more dangerous to him than to downright dulness i am heartily glad he has refused it287  sir james mackintosh and lord haddington have spoken very handsomely of my accession to the catholic petition and i think it has done some good yet i am not confident that the measure will disarm the catholic spleen288 and i was not entirely easy at finding myself allied to the whigs even in this instance where i agree with them this is witless prejudice however  my walk today was up the rhymers glen with skene colonel ferguson dined with us  april 4mr cleasby left this morning he has travelled much and is a young man of copious conversation and ready language aiming i suppose at parliament289 william forbes is singing like an angel in the next room but he sings only italian music which says naught to me i have a letter from one david patterson who was dr knoxs jackal for buying murdered bodies suggesting that i should write on the subject of burke and hare and offering me his invaluable collection of anecdotes curse him imperance and him dam insurance290 as mungo says in the farce did ever one hear the like the scoundrel has been the companion and patron of such atrocious murderers and kidnappers and he has the impudence to write to any decent man  corrected proofsheets and dedication of the magnum and sent them off  april 5read prayers to what remains of our party being anne my niece anne the four skenes and william forbes we then walked and i returned time enough to work a little at the criticism thus it drew towards dinner in conclusion after which we smoked told stories and drank tea  april 6worked at the review for three or four hours yet hang it i cant get on i wonder if i am turning clumsy in other matters certainly i cannot write against time as i used to do my thoughts will not be duly regulated my pen declares for itself will neither write nor spell and goes under independent colours i went out with the child kitty skene on her pony i dont much love children i suppose from want of habit but this is a fine merry little girl  william forbes sang in the evening with a feeling and taste indescribably fine but as he had no scottish or english songs my ears were not much gratified i have no sense beyond mungo what signify me hear if me no understand  william forbes leaves us as to the old story scribble till two then walk for exercise till four deil hae it else for company eats up the afternoon so nothing can be done that is not achieved in the forenoon  april 7we had a gay scene this morningthe foxhounds and merry hunters in my little base court which rung with trampling steeds and rejoiced in scarlet jackets and ringing horns i have seen the day worlds would not have bribed me to stay behind them but that is over and i walked a sober pace up to the abbots knowe from which i saw them draw my woods but without finding a fox i watched them with that mixture of interest affection and compassion which old men feel at looking on the amusements of the young i was so far interested in the chase itself as to be sorry they did not find i had so far the advantage of the visit that it gave me an object for the morning exercise which i would otherwise only have been prompted to by health and habit it is pleasant to have ones walkas heralds say with a difference by the way the foxhunters hunted the cover far too fast when they found a path they ran through it pellmell without beating at all they had hardly left the harehole cover when a fox which they had overrun stole away this is the consequence of breeding dogs too speedy  april 8we have the news of the catholic question being carried in the house of lords by a majority of 105 upon the second reading this is decisive and the balsam of fierabras must be swallowed291 it remains to see how it will work since it was indubitably necessary i am glad the decision on the case has been complete on these last three days i have finished my review of tytler for lockhart and sent it off by this post i may have offended peter by censuring him for a sort of petulance towards his predecessor lord hailes this day visited by mr carr who is a sensible clever young man and by his two sisters292beautiful singer the youngestand to my taste and english music  april 9laboured correcting proofs and revising the day infinitely bad worked till three oclock then tried a late walk and a wet one  i hear bad news of james ballantyne hypochondriac i am afraid and religiously distressed in mind  i got a book from the duke de lévis the same gentleman with whom i had an awkward meeting at abbotsford owing to his having forgot his credentials which left me at an unpleasant doubt as to his character and identity293 his book is inscribed to me with hyperbolical praises now i dont like to have like the persian poets who have the luck to please the sun of the universe my mouth crammed with sugarcandy which politeness will not permit me to spit out and my stomach is indisposed to swallow the book is better than would be expected from the exaggerated nonsense of the dedication  april 10left abbotsford at seven to attend the circuit nota benehalfpast six is the better hour waters are extremely flooded lord meadowbank at the circuit nothing tried but a few trumpery assaults meadowbank announces he will breakfast with me tomorrow so i shall return tonight promised to my cousin charles scott to interest myself about his getting the farm of milsington upon borthwick water and mentioned him to colonel riddell as a proposed offerer the tender was well received i saw james the piper and my cousin anne sent to james veitch the spyglass of professor ferguson to be repaired dined with the judge and returned in the evening  april 11meadowbank breakfasted with us and then went on to edinburgh pressed by bad news of his family his wife daughter of my early patron president blair is very ill indeed i fear fatally so i am sorry to think it is so when the king was here she was the finest woman i saw at holyrood my proofs kept me working till two then i had a fatiguing and watery walk after dinner we smoked and i talked with mr carr over criminal jurisprudence the choicest of conversation to an old lawyer and the delightful music of miss isabella carr closed the day still i dont get to my task but i will tomorrow or next day  april 12read prayers put my books in order and made some progress in putting papers in order which have been multiplying on my table i have a letter from that impudent lad reynolds about my contribution to the keepsake sent to him the house of aspen as i had previously determined this will give them a lumping pennyworth in point of extent but thats the side i would have the bargain rest upon it shall be a warning after this to keep out of such a scrape  april 13in the morning before breakfast i corrected the proof of the critique on the life of lord pitsligo in blackwoods magazine294 after breakfast skene and his lady and family and mr carr and his sisters took their departure time was dawdled away till nearly twelve oclock and then i could not work much i finished however a painful letter to j ballantyne which i hope will have effect upon the nervous disorder he complains of he must awake arise or be for ever fallen i walked happily and pleasantly from two oclock till four and now i must look to anne of geierstein hang it it is not so bad after all though i fear it will not be popular in fact i am almost expended but while i exhort others to exertion i will not fail to exert myself i have a letter from rp gillies proposing to subscribe to assist him from £25 to £50 it will do no good but yet i cannot help giving him something      a daimenicker in a thraves a sma request     ill get a blessing wi the lave and never misst295  i will try a review for the foreign and he shall have the proceeds  april 14i sent off proofs of the review of tytler for john lockhart then set a stout heart to a stay brae and took up anne of geierstein i had five sheets standing by me which i read with care and satisfied myself that worse had succeeded but it was while the fashion of the thing was new i retrenched a good deal about the troubadours which was really hors de place as to king rené i retained him as a historical character in short i will let the sheets go nearly as they are for though jb be an excellent judge of this species of composition he is not infallible and has been in circumstances which may cross his mind i might have taken this determination a month since and i wish i had but i thought i might strike out something better by the braes and burnsides alas i walk along them with painful and feeble steps and invoke their influence in vain but my health is excellent and it were ungrateful to complain either of mental or bodily decay we called at elliston today and made up for some illbred delay in the evening i corrected two sheets of the magnum as we call it  april 15i took up anne and wrote with interruption of a nap in which my readers may do well to imitate me till two oclock i wrote with care having digested comines whether i succeed or not it would be dastardly to give in a bold countenance often carries off an indifferent cause but no one will defend him who shows the white feather at two i walked till near four dined with the girls smoked two cigars and to work again till suppertime slept like a top amount of the days work eight pagesa round task  april 16i meant to go out with bogie to plant some shrubs in front of the old quarry but it rains cats and dogs as they say a rare day for grinding away at the old mill of imagination yet somehow i have no great will to the task after all however the morning proved a true april one sunshine and shower and i both worked to some purpose and moreover walked and directed about planting the quarry  the post brought matter for a may or april morninga letter from sir james mackintosh telling me that moore and he were engaged as contributors to longmans encyclopædia and asking me to do a volume at £1000 the subject to be the history of scotland in one volume this would be very easy work i have the whole stuff in my head and could write currente calamo the size is as i compute it about onethird larger than the tales of my grandfather there is much to be said on both sides let me balance pros and cons after the fashion of honest robinson crusoe proit is the sum i have been wishing for sufficient to enable me to break the invisible but magic circle which petty debts of myself and others have traced round me with common prudence i need no longer go from hand to mouth or what is worse anticipate my means i may also pay off some small shop debts etc belonging to the trust clear off all annes embarrassment and even make some foundation of a purse for her nbi think this whacking reason is like to prove the gallon of cognac brandy which a lady recommended as the foundation of a liqueur stop dear madam if you please said my grandfather dr rutherford you can add nothing to that it is flaconnadé with £1000 and a capital hit egad contrait is terribly like a hack author to make an abridgement of what i have written so lately probut a difference may be taken a history may be written of the same country on a different plan general where the other is detailed and philosophical where it is popular i think i can do this and do it with unwashed hands too for being hacked what is it but another word for being an author i will take care of my name doubtless but the five letters which form it must take care of me in turn i never knew name or fame burn brighter by over chary keeping of it besides there are two gallant hacks to pull with me contrai have a monstrous deal on hand let me see life of argyll296 and life of peterborough for lockhart297 third series tales of my grandfatherreview for gilliesnew novelend of anne of geierstein probut i have just finished too long reviews for lockhart the third series is soon discussed the review may be finished in three or four days and the novel is within a week and less of conclusion for the next we must first see how this goes off in fine within six weeks i am sure i can do the work and secure the independence i sigh for must i not make hay while the sun shines who can tell what leisure health and life may be destined to me  adjourned the debate till tomorrow morning  april 17i resumed the discussion of the bargain about the history the ayes to the right the noes to the left the ayes have itso i will write to sir james of this date but i will take a walk first that i will a little shaken with the conflict for after all were i as i have been my poverty but not my will consents298  i have been out in a most delicious real spring day i returned with my nerves strung and my mind determined i will make this plunge and with little doubt of coming off no loser in character what is given in detail may be suppressed general views may be enlarged upon and a birdseye prospect given not the less interesting that we have seen its prominent points nearer and in detail i have been of late in a great degree free from wafered letters sums to make up notes of hand wanted and all the worry of an embarrassed mans life this last struggle will free me entirely and so help me heaven it shall be made i have written to sir james stating that i apprehend the terms to be £1000 namely for one volume containing about onethird more than one of the volumes of tales of my grandfather and agreeing to do so certes few men can win a thousand pounds so readily  we dine with the fergusons today at four so off we went and safely returned  april 18corrected proofs i find jb has not returned to his business though i wrote him how necessary it was my pity begins to give way to anger must he sit there and squander his thoughts and senses upon cloudy metaphysics and abstruse theology till he addles his brains entirely and ruins his business i have written to him again letter third and i am determined last  wrote also to the fop reynolds with preface to the house of aspen then to honest joseph train desiring he would give me some notion how to serve him with messrs carr and to take care to make his ambition moderate and feasible  my neighbour mr kerr of kippielaw struck with a palsy while he was looking at the hounds his pony remained standing by his side a sudden call if a final one  that strange desire to leave a prescribed task and set about something else seized me irresistibly i yielded to it and sat down to try at what speed and in what manner i could execute this job of sir james mackintoshs and i wrote three leaves before rising well enough i think the girls made a round with me we drove to chiefswood and from that to janeswood up the rhymers glen and so home this occupied from one to four in the evening i heard anne read mr peels excellent bill on the police of the metropolis which goes to disband the whole generation of dogberry and verges wrote after tea  april 19i made this a busy day i wrote on at the history until two oclock then took a gallant walk then began reading for gilliess article james ferguson dined with us we smoked and i became woundy sleepy now i have taken collar to this arrangement i find an open sea before me which i could not have anticipated for though i should get through well enough with my expectations during the year yet it is a great thing to have a certainty to be clear as a new pin of every penny of debt there is no being obliged or asking favours or getting loans from some grudging friend who can never look at you after but with fear of losing his cash or you at him without the humiliating sense of having extorted an obligation besides my large debts i have paid since i was in trouble at least £2000 of personal encumbrances so no wonder my nose is still under water i really believe the sense of this apparently unending struggle schemes for retrenchment in which i was unseconded made me lowspirited for the sun seems to shine brighter upon me as a free man nevertheless devil take the necessity which makes me drudge like a very hack of grub street      may the foul fa the gear and the bletherie o t299  i walked out with toms assistance came home went through the weary work of cramming and so forth wrought after tea and then to bed  april 20as yesterday till twosixteen pages of the history written and not less than onefifth of the whole book what if they should be off i were finely holpd for throwing my time away a toy they dare not  lord buchan is dead a person whose immense vanity bordering upon insanity obscured or rather eclipsed very considerable talents his imagination was so fertile that he seemed really to believe the extraordinary fictions which he delighted in telling his economy most laudable in the early part of his life when it enabled him from a small income to pay his fathers debts became a miserable habit and led him to do mean things he had a desire to be a great man and a mæcenas bon marché the two celebrated lawyers his brothers were not more gifted by nature than i think he was but the restraints of a profession kept the eccentricity of the family in order henry erskine was the bestnatured man i ever knew thoroughly a gentleman and with but one fault he could not say no and thus sometimes misled those who trusted him tom erskine was positively mad i have heard him tell a cockandabull story of having seen the ghost of his fathers servant john burnet with as much sincerity as if he believed every word he was saying both henry and thomas were saving men yet both died very poor the one at one time possessed £200000 the other had a considerable fortune the earl alone has died wealthy it is saving not getting that is the mother of riches they all had wit the earls was crackbrained and sometimes caustic henrys was of the very kindest besthumoured and gayest that ever cheered society that of lord erskine was moody and maddish but i never saw him in his best days  went to haining time has at last touched the beautiful mrs pringle i wonder he was not ashamed of himself for spoiling so fine a form but what cares he corrected proofs after dinner james b is at last at work again  april 21spent the whole morning at writing still the history such is my wilful whim twenty pages now finishedi suppose the clear fourth part of a volume i went out but the day being sulky i sat in the conservatory after trying a walk i have been glancing over the works for gilliess review and i think on them betweenhands while i compose the historyan odd habit of doing two things at once but it has always answered with me well enough  april 22another hard days work at the history now increased to the bruce and baliol period and threatening to be too lengthy for the cyclopædia but i will make short work with wars and battles i wrote till two oclock and strolled with old tom and my dogs300 till halfpast four hours of pleasure and healthful exercise and today taken with ease a letter from jb stating an alarm that he may lose the printing of a part of the magnum but i shall write him he must be his own friend set shoulder to the wheel and remain at the head of his business and of that i must make him aware and so i set to my proofs better to work says the inscription on hogarths bridewell than stand thus  april 23a cold blustering daybad welcome for the poor lambs i made my walk short and my task long my work turning entirely on the historyall on speculation but the post brought me a letter from dr lardner the manager of the cyclopædia agreeing to my terms so all is right there and no labour thrown away the volume is to run to 400 pages so much the better i love elbowroom and will have space to do something to purpose i replied agreeing to his terms and will send him copy as soon as i have corrected it the colonel and miss ferguson dined with us i think i drank rather a cheerful glass with my good friend smoked an extra cigar so no more at present  april 25after writing to mr cochrane301 to cadell and jb also to mr pitcairn302 it was time to set out for lord buchans funeral the funeral letters were signed by mr h david erskine his lordships natural son his nephew the young earl was present but neither of them took the head of the coffin his lordships funeral took place in a chapel amongst the ruins his body was in the grave with its feet pointing westward my cousin maxpopple303 was for taking notice of it but i assured him that a man who had been wrong in the head all his life would scarce become rightheaded after death i felt something at parting with this old man though but a trumpery body he gave me the first approbation i ever obtained from a stranger his caprice had led him to examine dr adams class when i a boy twelve years old and then in disgrace for some aggravated case of negligence was called up from a low bench and recited my lesson with some spirit and appearance of feeling the poetryit was the apparition of hectors ghost in the Æneidof which called forth the noble earls applause i was very proud of this at the time  i was sad on another accountit was the first time i had been among these ruins since i left a very valued pledge there my next visit may be involuntary even so gods will be done at least i have not the mortification of thinking what a deal of patronage and fuss lord buchan would bestow on my funeral304 maxpopple dined and slept here with four of his family much amused with what they heard and saw by good fortune a ventriloquist and partial juggler came in and we had him in the library after dinner he was a halfstarved wretchedlooking creature who seemed to have ate more fire than bread so i caused him to be well stuffed and gave him a guinea rather to his poverty than to his skilland now to finish anne of geierstein  april 26but not a finger did i lay on the jacket of anne looking for something i fell in with the little drama long missing called the doom of devorgoil i believe it was out of mere contradiction that i sat down to read and correct it merely because i would not be bound to do aught that seemed compulsory so i scribbled at a piece of nonsense till two oclock and then walked to the lake at night i flung helve after hatchet and spent the evening in reading the doom of devorgoil to the girls who seemed considerably interested anne objects to the mingling the goblinry which is comic with the serious which is tragic after all i could greatly improve it and it would not be a bad composition of that odd kind to some picnic receptacle of all things  april 27this day must not be wasted i breakfast with the fergusons and dine with the brewsters but by heaven i will finish anne of geierstein this day betwixt the two engagements i dont know why nor wherefore but i hate anne i mean anne of geierstein the other two annes are good girls accordingly i well nigh accomplished my work but about three oclock my story fell into a slough and in getting it out i lost my way and was forced to postpone the conclusion till tomorrow wrote a good days work notwithstanding  april 28i have slept upon my puzzle and will now finish it jove bless my pia mater as i see not further impediment before me the story will end and shall end because it must end and so here goes after this doughty resolution i went doggedly to work and finished five leaves by the time when they should meet the coach but the misfortune of writing fast is that one cannot at the same time write concisely i wrote two pages more in the evening stayed at home all day indeed the weathersleety rainy stormyforms no tempting prospect bogie too who sees his flourish going to wreck is looking as spiteful as an angry fiend towards the unpropitious heavens so i made a day of work of it      and yet the end was not  april 29this morning i finished and sent off three pages more and still there is something to write but i will take the broad axe to it and have it ended before noon  this has proved impossible and the task lasted me till nine when it was finished tant bien que mal now will people say this expresses very little respect for the public in fact i have very little respect for that dear publicum whom i am doomed to amuse like goody trash in bartholomew fair with rattles and gingerbread and i should deal very uncandidly with those who may read my confessions were i to say i knew a public worth caring for or capable of distinguishing the nicer beauties of composition they weigh good and evil qualities by the pound get a good name and you may write trash get a bad one and you may write like homer without pleasing a single reader i am perhaps lenfant gâté de succés but i am brought to the stake305 and must perforce stand the course  having finished anne306 i began and revised fifteen leaves of the history and sent them to dr lardner i think they read more trashy than i expected but when could i ever please myself even when i have most pleased others then i walked about two hours by the thicket and riverside watching the appearance of spring which as coleridge says      comes slowly up this way  after dinner and tea i resumed the task of correction which is an odious one but must be attempted ay and accomplished too  april 30dr johnson enjoins bozzy to leave out of his diary all notices of the weather as insignificant it may be so to an inhabitant of bolt court in fleet street who need care little whether it rains or snows except the shilling which it may cost him for a jarvie but when i wake and find a snow shower sweeping along and destroying hundreds perhaps of young lambs and famishing their mothers i must consider it as worth noting for my own poor share i am as indifferent as any grub streeter of them all      and since tis a bad day     rise up rise up my merry men     and use it as you may  i have accordingly been busy the weather did not permit me to go beyond the courtyard for it continued cold and rainy i have employed the day in correcting the history for cyclopædia as far as page 35 exclusive and have sent it off or shall tomorrow i wish i knew how it would run out dr lardners measure is a large one but so much the better i like to have ample verge and space enough and a mere abridgment would be discreditable well nobody can say i eat the bread of idleness why should i those who do not work from necessity take violent labour from choice and were necessity out of the question i would take the same sort of literary labour from choicesomething more leisurely though  footnotes  286 son of lord medwyn mr forbes had lately returned from italy where he had had as travelling companion mr cleasby and it was owing to mr forbess recommendation that mr cleasby came to edinburgh to pursue his studies mr forbes possessed a fine tenor voice and his favourite songs at that time were the neapolitan and calabrian canzonetti to which sir walter alludes under april 4  287 mr lockharts own account of the overture is sufficiently amusing and characteristic of the men and the times  i had not time to write more than a line the other day under crokers cover having received it just at post time he sent for me i found him in his nightcap at the admiralty colded badly but in audacious spirits his business was this the duke of wellington finds himself without one newspaper he can depend on he wishes to buy up some evening print such as the dull star and could i do anything for it i said i was as well inclined to serve the duke as he could be but it must be in other fashion he then said he agreed with mebut there was a second question could i find them an editor and undertake to communicate between them and himin short save the treasury the inconvenience of maintaining an avowed intercourse with the newspaper press he said he himself had for some years done thisthen others i said i would endeavour to think of a man for their turn and would call on him soon again  i have considered the matter at leisure and resolve to have nothing to do with it they can only want me as a writer any understrapper mp would do well enough for carrying hints to a newspaper office and i will not even to secure the duke mix myself up with the newspapers that work it is which has damned croker and i cant afford to sacrifice the advantage which i feel i have gained in these later years by abstaining altogether from partisan scribbling or to subject the quarterly to risk of damage the truth is i dont admire after all that has come and gone being applied to through the medium of friend crokey i hope you will approve of my resolution  288 peel in writing to scott says the mention of your name in parliament as attached to the

review and i wish the other half at old nick  may 4a poor young woman came here this morning welldressed and wellbehaved with a strong northern accent she talked incoherently a long story of a brother and a lover both dead i would have kept her here till i wrote to her friends particularly to mr sutherland an aberdeen bookseller to inform them where she is but my daughter and her maidens were frightened as indeed there might be room for it and so i sent her in one of davidsons chaises to the castle at jedburgh and wrote to mr shortreed to see she is humanely treated i have written also to her brother      long shall i see these things forlorn        and long again their sorrows feel  the rest was write walk eat smoke smoke and write again  may 5a moist rainy day mild however and promising good weather i sat at my desk the whole day and worked at gilliess review so was the day exhausted  may 6i sent off the review received the sheets of the secret tribunal from master reynolds keith scott a grandson of james scott my fathers cousingerman came here a fine lively boy with good spirits and amiable manners just when i had sent off the rest of gilliess manuscript w laidlaw came so i had him for my companion in a walk which the late weather has prevented for one or two days colonel and mrs ferguson and margaret ferguson came to dinner and so passed the evening  may 7captain percy brother of lord lovaine and son of lord beverley came out to dinner dr and mrs brewster met him he is like his brother lord lovaine an amiable easy and accomplished man who has seen a great deal of service and roamed about with tribes of western indians  may 8went up yarrow with captain percy which made a complete days idleness for which i have little apology to offer i heard at the same time from the president309 that sir robert dundas is very unwell so i must be in edinburgh on monday 11th very disagreeable now the weather is becoming pleasant  may 9captain percy left us at one oclock he has a sense of humour and aptness of comprehension which renders him an agreeable companion i am sorry his visit has made me a little idle but there is no help for it  i have done everything today previous to my going away butque fautil faire one must see society now and then and this is really an agreeable man and so transeat ille i walked and was so fatigued as to sleep and now i will attack john lockharts proofsheets of which he has sent me a revise in the evening i corrected proofs for the review  may 10this must be a day of preparation which i hate yet it is but laying aside a few books and arranging a few papers and yet my nerves are fluttered and i make blunders and mislay my pen and my keys and make more confusion than i can repair after all i will try for once to do it steadily  well i have toiled through it it is like a ground swell in the sea that brings up all that is disgusting from the bottomadmonitory lettersunpaid billsfew of these thank my starsall that one would wish to forget perks itself up in your face at a thorough redding updevil take it i will get out and cool the fever that this turmoil has made in my veins the delightful spring weather conjured down the evil spirit i sat a long time with my nerves shaking like a frightened child and then laughed at it all by the side of the river coming back by the thicket  may 11 edinburghwe passed the morning in the little arrangements previous to our departure and then returned at night to edinburgh bringing keith scott along this boys grandfather james scott by name very clever and particularly well acquainted with indian customs and manners he was one of the first settlers in prince of wales island he was an activeminded man and therefore wrote a great deal i have seen a trunkful of his mss unhappily instead of writing upon some subject on which he might have conveyed information he took to writing on metaphysics and lost both his candles and his labour i was consulted about publishing some part of his works but could not recommend it they were shallow essays with a good deal of infidelity exhibited yet james scott was a very clever man he only fell into the common mistake of supposing that arguments new to him were new to all others his son when i knew him long since in this country was an ordinary man enough this boy seems smart and clever we reached the house in the evening it was comfortable enough considering it had been shut up for two months i found a letter from cadell asserting his continued hope in the success of the magnum i begin to be jealous on the subject but i will know tomorrow  may 12went to parliament house sir robert dundas very unwell poor hamilton on his back with the gout so was obliged to have the assistance of rolland310 from the second division saw cadell on the way home i was right he had been disappointed in his expectations from glasgow and other mercantile places where trade is low at present but      tidings did he bring of africa and golden joys  the magnum has taken extremely in ireland which was little counted on and elsewhere hence he proposes a new edition of tales of my grandfather first series also an enlargement of the third series all this drives poverty and pinch which is so like poverty from the door  i visited lady js and had the pleasure to find her well i wrote a little and got over a place that bothered me cadell has apprehensions of anne of geierstein so have i well the worst of it is we must do something better311  may 13attended the court which took up a good deal of time on my return saw sir robert dundas who is betterand expects to be out on tuesday i went to the highland society to present miss grahame stirlings book being a translation of gelieus work on bees312 which was well received went with the girls to dine at dalhousie castle where we were very kindly received i saw the edgewell tree313 too fatal says allan ramsay to the family from which he was himself descended i also saw the fatal coalston pear314 said to have been preserved many hundred years it is certainly a pear either petrified or turned into wood with a bit out of one side of it  it is a pity to see my old schoolcompanion this fine truehearted nobleman of such an ancient and noble descent after having followed the british flag through all quarters of the world again obliged to resume his wanderings at a time of life equal i suppose to my own he has not however a grey hair in his head  may 14left dalhousie at eight to return here to breakfast where we received cold tidings walter has had an inflammatory attack and i fear it will be necessary to him to return without delay to the continent i have letters from sophia and sir andrew halliday the last has been of the utmost service by bleeding and advising active measures how little one knows to whom they are to be obliged i wrote to him and to jane recommending the ionian islands where sir frederick adam would i am sure give walter a post on his staff the kind old chief commissioner at once interested himself in the matter it makes me inexpressibly anxious yet i have kept up my determination not to let the chances of fate overcome me like a summerscloud315 i wrote four or five pages of the history today notwithstanding the agitation of my feelings  may 15attended the court where mr rolland and i had the duty of the first division sir robert and hamilton being both laid up dined at granton and met lord and lady dalhousie sir john hope etc i have spelled out some work this day though i have been rather knocked about  may 16after the court this day i went to vote at the archers hall where some of the members had become restive they were outvoted two to one there had been no division in the royal body guard since its commencement but these times make divisions everywhere a letter from lockhart brings better news of walter but my heart is heavy on the subject i went on with my history however for the point in this world is to do what we ought and bear what we must  dined at home and wrote in the evening  may 17i never stirred from my seat all this day my reflections as suggested by walters illness were highly uncomfortable and to divert it i wrought the whole day save when i was obliged to stop and lean my head on my hand real affliction however has something in it by which it is sanctified it is a weight which however oppressive may like a bar of iron be conveniently disposed on the sufferers person but the insubstantiality of a hypochondriac affection is one of its greatest torments you have a huge featherbed on your shoulders which rather encumbers and oppresses you than calls forth strength and exertion to bear it there is something like madness in that opinion and yet it has a touch of reality heaven help me  may 18i resolved to take exercise today so only wrought till twelve i sent off some sheets and copy to dr lardner i find my written page goes as better than one to two of his print so a little more than one hundred and ninety of my writing will make up the sum wanted i sent him off as far as page sixtytwo went to mr colvin smiths at one and sat for my picture to three there must be an end of this sitting it devours my time  i wrote in the evening to walter james macculloch to dr lardner and others and settled some other correspondence  may 19i went to the court and abode there till about one and in the library from one to two when i was forced to attend a public meeting about the kings statue i have no turn for these committees and yet i get always jammd into them they take up a cruel deal of time in a way very unsatisfactory dined at home and wrought hard i shall be through the bruces reign it is lengthy but hang it it was our only halcyon period i shall be soon done with onehalf of the thousand pounds worth  may 20mr cadell breakfasted with us with a youngster for whom he wants a letter to the commander or governor of bombay after breakfast c and i had some talk of business his tidings like those of ancient pistol are of africa and golden joys he is sure of selling at the starting 8000 copies of the magnum at a profit of £70 per 1000that is per month this seems certain but he thinks the sale will rise to 12000 which will be £280 more or £840 in all this will tell out a gross divisible profit of upwards of £25000 this is not unlikely but after this comes a series of twenty volumes at least which produce only half that quantity indeed but then the whole profits save commissions are the authors that will come to as much as the former say £50000 in all this supposes i carry on the works of fiction for two or three novels more but besides all this cadell entertains a plan of selling a cheaper edition by numbers and numbermen on which he gives half the selling price one man mr ireland offers to take 10000 copies of the magnum and talks of 25000 this allows a profit of £50 per thousand copies not much worse than the larger copy and cadell thinks to carry on both i doubt this i have great apprehension that these interlopers would disgust the regular trade with whom we are already deeply engaged i also foresee selling the worst copies at the higher price all this must be thought and cared for in the meantime i see a fund from which large payments may be made to the trustees capable of extinguishing the debt large as it is in ten years or earlier and leaving a reversion to my family of the copyrights sweet bodements316goodbut we must not reckon our chickens before they are hatched though they are chipping the shell now we will see how the stream takes  dined at a public dinner given to the excellent lord dalhousie before his departure for india an odd way of testifying respect to public characters by eating drinking and roaring the names however will make a good show in the papers home at ten good news from sophia and walter i am zealous for the mediterranean when the season comes which may be the beginning of september  may 21this is only the 23d on which i write yet i have forgotten anything that has passed on the 21st worthy of note i wrote a good deal i know and dined at home the step of time is noiseless as it passes over an old man the non est tanti mingles itself with everything  may 22i was detained long in the court though ham had returned to his labour we dined with captain basil hall and met a mr codman or some such name with his lady from boston the last a pleasant and wellmannered woman the husband bostonian enough we had sir william arbuthnot besides and his lady  bythebye i should have remembered that i called on my old friend lady charlotte campbell and found her in her usual goodhumour though miffed a littlei suspect at the history of gillespie grumach in the legend of montrose i saw haining also looking thin and pale these should have gone to the memorandum of yesterday  may 23went today to call on the commissioner317 and saw at his graces levee the celebrated divine soidisant prophet irving318 he is a finelooking man bating a diabolical squint with talent on his brow and madness in his eye his dress and the arrangement of his hair indicated that much attention had been bestowed on his externals and led me to suspect a degree of selfconceit consistent both with genius and insanity  came home by cadells who persists in his visions of el dorado he insists that i will probably bring £60000 within six years to rub off all constables debts which that sum will do with a vengeance cadell talks of offering for the poetry to longman i fear they will not listen to him the napoleon he can command when he likes by purchasing their stock in hand the lives of the novelists may also be had pleasant schemes all these but dangerous to build upon yet in looking at the powerful machine which we have put in motion it must be owned as broken ships have come to land  waited on the commissioner at five oclock and had the pleasure to remain till eight when the debate in the assembly was over the question which employed their eloquence was whether the celebrated mr irving could sit there as a ruling elder319 it was settled i think justly that a divine being of a different order of officers in the kirk cannot assume the character of a ruling elder seeing he cannot discharge its duties  mr irving dined with us i could hardly keep my eyes off him while we were at table he put me in mind of the devil disguised as an angel of light so ill did that horrible obliquity of vision harmonise with the dark tranquil features of his face resembling that of our saviour in italian pictures with the hair carefully arranged in the same manner there was much real or affected simplicity in the manner in which he spoke he rather made play and spoke much across the table to the solicitor and seemed to be goodhumoured but he spoke with that kind of unction which is nearly allied to cajolerie he boasted much of the tens of thousands that attended his ministry at the town of annan his native place till he wellnigh provoked me to say he was a distinguished exception to the rule that a prophet was not esteemed in his own country but time and place were not fitting  may 24i wrote or wrought all the morning yea even to dinnertime miss kerr and mrs skene and will clerk dined skene came from the commissioners at seven oclock we had a merry evening clerk exults in the miscarriage of the bill for the augmentation of the judges salaries he and the other clerks in the jury court had hoped to have had a share in the proposed measure but the court had considered it as being nos poma natamus i kept our friends quiet by declining to move in a matter which was to expose us to the insult of a certain refusal clerk with his usual felicity of quotation said they should have remembered the clowns exhortation to lear good nuncle tarry and take the fool with you320  may 25wrote in the morning dr macintosh mackay came to breakfast and brought with him to show me the young chevaliers target purse and snuffbox the property of cluny macpherson the pistols are for holsters and no way remarkable a good serviceable pair of weapons silver mounted the targe is very handsome indeed studded with ornaments of silver chiefly emblematic chosen with much taste of device and happily executed there is a contrast betwixt the shield and purse the targe being large and heavy the purse though very handsome unusually small and light after one oclock i saw the duke and duchess of gordon then went to mr smiths to finish a painting for the last time the duchess called with a swiss lady to introduce me to her friend while i was doing penance i was heartily glad to see her grace once more called in at cadells his orders continue so thick that he must postpone the delivery for several days to get new engravings thrown off etc vogue la galère from all that now appears i shall be much better off in two or three years than if my misfortunes had never taken place periissem ni periissem  dined at a dinner given by the antiquarian society to mr hay drummond secretary to the society now going consul to tangiers it was an excellent dinnerturtle champagne and all the agrémens of a capital meal for £1 6s ahead how barry managed i cant say the object of this compliment spoke and drank wine incessantly goodnaturedly delighted with the compliment which he repeatedly assured me he valued more than a hundred pounds i take it that after my departure which was early it would be necessary to carry mr silence to bed321  may 26the business at the court heavy dined at galas and had the pleasure to see him in amended health sir john and lady hope were there and the evening was lively and pleasant george square is always a melancholy place for me i was dining next door to my fathers former house322  may 27i got up the additional notes for the waverley novels they seem to be setting sail with a favourable wind i had today a most kind and friendly letter from the duke of wellington which is a thing to be vain of he is a most wonderful man to have climbed to such a height without ever slipping his foot who would have said in 1815 that the duke would stand still higher in 1829 and yet it indubitably is so we dined with lady charlotte campbell now lady charlotte bury and her husband who is an egregious fop but a fine draughtsman here is another day gone without work in the evening  may 28the court as usual till one oclock but i forgot to say mr macintosh mackay breakfasted and inspected my curious irish ms which dr brinkley gave me323 mr mackay i should say doctor who well deserved the name reads it with tolerable ease so i hope to knock the marrow out of the bone with his assistance i came home and despatched proofsheets and revises for dr lardner i saw kind john gibson and made him happy with the fair prospects of the magnum he quite agrees in my views a young clergyman named mcombie from aberdeenshire also called today i have had some consideration about the renewal or retranslation of the psalmody i had peculiar views adverse to such an undertaking324 in the first place it would be highly unpopular with the lower and more ignorant rank many of whom have no idea of the change which those spiritual poems have suffered in translation but consider their old translations as the very songs which david composed at any rate the lower class think that our fathers were holier and better men than we and that to abandon their old hymns of devotion in order to grace them with newer and more modish expression would be a kind of sacrilege even the best informed who think on the subject must be of opinion that even the somewhat bald and rude language and versification of the psalmody gives them an antique and venerable air and their want of the popular graces of modish poetry shows they belong to a style where ornaments are not required they contain besides the very words which were spoken and sung by the fathers of the reformation sometimes in the wilderness sometimes in fetters sometimes at the stake if a church possessed the vessels out of which the original reformers partook of the eucharist it would be surely bad taste to melt them down and exchange them for more modern no no let them write hymns and paraphrases if they will but let us have still      all people that on earth do dwell325  law and devotion must lose some of their dignity as often as they adopt new fashions  may 30the skenes came in to supper last night dr scott of haslar hospital came to breakfast he is a nephew of scott of scalloway who is one of the largest proprietors in shetland i have an agreeable recollection of the kindness and hospitality of these remote isles and of this gentlemans connections in particular who welcomed me both as a stranger and a scott being duly tenacious of their clan this young gentleman is high in the medical department of the navy he tells me that the ultima thule is improving rapidly the old clumsy plough is laid aside they have built several stout sloops to go to the deepsea fishing instead of going thither in open boats which consumed so much time between the shore and the haaf or fishing spot pity but they would use a steamboat to tow them out i have a real wish to hear of zetlands advantage i often think of its long isles its towering precipices its capes covered with seafowl of every class and description that ornithology can find names for its deep caves its smoked geese and its sour sillocks i would like to see it again after the court i came round by cadell who is like jemmy taylor      full of mirth and full of glee  for which he has good reason having raised the impression of the magnum to 12000 copies and yet the end is not for the

apprehensions the subjoined extract from a letter written by mr gpr james may be givenwhen i first read anne of geierstein i will own that the multitude of surpassing beauties which it contained frightened me but i find that after having read it the public mind required to be let gently down from the tone of excitement to which it had been raised and was contented to pause at my book

the old metrical version of the psalms continued unabated to the end a story has been told on the authority of the nurse in attendance that on the morning of the day on which he died viz on the 21st sept 1832 he opened his eyes once more quite conscious and calmly asked her to read to him a psalm she proceeded to do so when he gently interposed saying no no the scotch psalms after reading to him

of the edinburgh review was succeeded by macvey napier whose first no was published in october 1829     june   june 1being sunday i remained to work the whole day and finished half of the proposed volume of history i was not disturbed the whole day a thing rather unusual  june 2received mr rees of london and col ferguson to breakfast mr rees is clearly of opinion our scheme the magnum must answer328 i got to letterwriting after breakfast and cleared off old scores in some degree dr ross called and would hardly hear of my going out i was obliged however to attend the meeting of the trustees for the theatre329 the question to be decided was whether we should embrace an option left to us of taking the old theatre at a valuation or whether we should leave it to mrs siddons and mr murray to make the best of it there were present sir patrick murray baron hume lord provost sir john hay mr gilbert innes and myself we were all of opinion that personally we ought to have nothing to do with it but i thought as trustees for the public we were bound to let the public know how the matter stood and that they might if they pleased have the theatrical property for £16000 which is dog cheap they were all clear to give it up the right of reversion to mrs siddons i am glad she should have it for she is an excellent person and so is her brother but i think it has been a little jobbish there is a clause providing the new patentees may redeem i desired that the circumstance should be noted that we were only exercising our own judgment leaving the future trustees to exercise theirs i rather insisted that there should be some saving clause of this kind even for the sake of our honour but i could not prevail upon my colleagues to put such a saving clause on the minutes though they agreed to the possibility of the new patentees redeeming on behalf of the public i do not think we have done right  i called on mr cadell whose reports of the magnum might fill up the dreams of alnaschar should he sleep as long as the seven sleepers the rest was labour and letters till bedtime  june 3the ugly symptoms still continue dr ross does not make much of it and i think he is apt to look grave330 i wrote in the morning dr macintosh mackay came to breakfast and brought a gaelic book which he has publishedthe poetry of rob donnsome of which seems pretty as he explained it court kept me till near two and then home comes i afternoon and evening was spent as usual in the evening dr ross ordered me to be cupped an operation which i only knew from its being practised by that eminent medical practitioner the barber of bagdad it is not painful and i think resembles a giant twisting about your flesh between his finger and thumb  june 4i was obliged to absent myself from the court on dr rosss positive instance and what is worse i was compelled to send an apology to hopetoun house where i expected to see madame caradori who was to sing jock of hazeldean i wrote the song for sophia and i find my friends here still prefer her to the foreign syren      however madame caradori     to miss you i am very sorry     i should have taken it for glory     to have heard you sing my border story  i worked at the tales of my grandfather but leisurely  june 5cadell came to dine with me têteàtête for the girls are gone to hopetoun house we had ample matter to converse upon for his horn was full of good news while we were at dinner we had letters from london and ireland which decided him to raise the impression of waverley to 15000 this with 10000 on the number line which ireland is willing to take will make £18000 a year of divisible profit this leads to a further speculation as i said of great importance longman  co have agreed to sell their stock on hand of the poetry in which they have certain shares their shares included for £8000 cadell thinks he could by selling off at cheap rates sorting making waste etc get rid of the stock for about £5000 leaving £3000 for the purchase of the copyrights and proposes to close the bargain as much cheaper as he can but at all events to close it whatever shall fall short of the price returned by the stock the sale of which shall be entirely at his risk shall be reckoned as the price of the copyright and we shall pay half of that balance i had no hesitation in authorising him to proceed in his bargain with owen rees of longmans house upon that principle for supposing according to cadells present idea the loss on the stock shall amount to £2000 or £3000 the possession of the entire copyright undivided would enable us calculating upon similar success to that of the novels to make at least £500 per cent longman  co have indeed an excellent bargain but then so will we we pay dear indeed for what the ostensible subject of sale is but if it sets free almost the whole of our copyrights and places them in our own hands we get a most valuable quid pro quo there is only onefourth i think of marmion in mr murrays hands and it must be the deuce if that cannot be secured331 mr cadell proposed that as he took the whole books on his risk he ought to have compensation and that it should consist in the sum to be given to me for arranging and making additions to the volumes of poetry thus to be republished i objected to this for in the first place he may suffer no loss for the books may go off more rapidly than he thinks or expects in the second place i do not know what my labours in the poetry may be in either case it is a blind bargain but if he should be a sufferer beyond the clear half of the loss which we agree to share with him i agreed to make him some compensation and he is willing to take what i shall think just so stands our bargain remained at home and wrote about four pages of tales i should have done more but my head as squire sullen says aiked consumedly332 rees has given cadell a written offer to be binding till the twelfth meantime i have written to lockhart to ask john murray if he will treat for the fourth share of marmion which he possesses it can be worth but little to him and gives us all the copyrights i have a letter from sir thomas dick lauder touching a manuscript of messrs hay allan called the vestiarium scotiæ by a sir richard forrester if it is an imposition it is cleverly done but i doubt the quarter it comes from these hay allans are men of warm imaginations it makes the strange averment that all the lowcountry gentlemen and border clans wore tartan and gives sets of them all i must see the manuscript before i believe in it the allans are singular men of much accomplishment but little probitythat is in antiquarian matters cadell lent me £10funny enough after all our grand expectations for croesus to want such a gratility  june 7i rose at seven and wrote to sir thomas lauder a long warning on the subject of these allans and their manuscript333 proceeded to write but found myself pulled up by the necessity of reading a little this occupied my whole morning the lord president called very kindly to desire me to keep at home tomorrow i thought of being out but it may be as well not i am somehow or other either listless or lazy my head aches cruelly i made a fight at reading and working till eleven and then came sleep with a partycoloured mantle of fantastic hues and wrapt me into an imaginary world  june 8i wrote the whole morning till two oclock then i went into the gardens of princes street to my great exhilaration i never felt better for a walk also it is the first i have taken this whole week and more i visited some remote garden grounds where i had not been since i walked there with the good samaritan skene sadly enough at the time of my misfortunes334 the shrubs and young trees which were then invisible are now of good size and gay with leaf and blossom i too old trunk as i am have put out tender buds of hope which seemed checked for ever  i may now look with fair hope to freeing myself of obligation from all men and spending the rest of my life in ease and quiet god make me thankful for so cheering a prospect  june 9i wrote in the morning set out for a walk at twelve oclock as far as mr cadells i found him hesitating about his views and undecided about the number plan he thinks the first plan answers so much beyond expectation it is a pity to interfere with it and talks of reengraving the plates this would be touchy but nothing is resolved on  anne had a little party where lady charlotte bury lady hopetoun and others met the caradori who sung to us very kindly she sung jock of hazeldean very well and with a peculiar expression of humour sandie ballantyne kindly came and helped us with fiddle and flageolet willie clerk was also here we had a lunch and were very gay not the less so for the want of mr bury who is a thoroughpaced coxcomb with some accomplishments however i drank two glasses of champagne which have muddled my brains for the day will clerk promised to come back and dine on the wreck of the turkey and tongue pigeonpie etc he came accordingly and stayed till nine so no time for work it was not a lost day however335  june 10nota bene my complaint quite gone i attended the court and sat there till late evening had its lot of labour which is i think a second nature to me it is astonishing how little i look into a book of entertainment i have been reading over the five nights of st albansvery much extra mœnia nostri mundi and possessed of considerable merit though the author336 loves to play at cherrypit with satan337  june 11i was kept at court by a hearing till near three then sat to mr graham for an hour and a half when i came home behold a letter from mr murray very handsomely yielding up the fourth share of marmion which he possessed338 afterwards we went to the theatre where st ronans well was capitally acted by murray and the bailiethe part of clara mowbray being heavy for want of mrs siddons poor old mrs renaud once the celebrated mrs powell took leave of the stage as i was going to bed at twelve at night in came rpgillies like a tobacco cask i shook him off with some difficulty pleading my having been lately ill but he is to call tomorrow morning   june 12gillies made his appearance i told him frankly i thought he conducted his affairs too irregularly for any one to assist him and i could not in charity advise any one to encourage subscriptions but that i should subscribe myself so i made over to him about £50 which the foreign review owes me and i will grow hardhearted and do no more i was not long in the court but i had to look at the controversy about the descent of the douglas family then i went to cadell and found him still cockahoop he has raised the edition to 17000 a monstrous number yet he thinks it will clear the 20000 but we must be quiet in case people jalouse the failure of the plates i called on lady js339 when i came home i was sleepy and overwalked by the way i sat till graham finished my picture340 i fell fast asleep before dinner and slept for an hour after dinner i wrote to walter charles lockhart and john murray and took a screed of my novel so concluded the evening idly enough  june 13we hear of sophias motions she is to set sail by steamboat on the 16th tuesday and charles is to make a run down with her but alas my poor johnnie is i fear come to lay his bones in his native land sophia can no longer disguise it from herself that as his strength weakens the disease increases the poor child is so much bent on coming to see abbotsford and grandpapa that it would be cruel not to comply with his wishand if affliction comes we will bear it best together      not more the schoolboy who expires     far from his native home desires     to see some friends familiar face     or meet a parents last embrace  it must be all as god wills it perhaps his native air may be of service  more news from cadell he deems it necessary to carry up the edition to 20000  abbotsfordthis day was fixed for a start to abbotsford where we arrived about six oclock evening to my thinking i never saw a prettier place and even the trees and flowers seemed to say to me we are your own again but i must not let imagination jade me thus it would be to make disappointment doubly bitter and god knows i have in my childs family matter enough to check any exuberant joy  june 14a delicious daythreatening rain but with the languid and affecting manner in which beauty demands sympathy when about to weep i wandered about the banks and braes all morning and got home about three and saw everything in tolerable order excepting that there was a good number of branches left in the walks there is a great number of trees cut and bark collected colonel ferguson dined with us and spent the afternoon  june 15another charming day up and despatched packets for ballantyne and cadell neither of them was furiously to the purpose but i had a humour to be alert i walked over to huntly burn and round by chiefswood and janeswood where i saw captain hamilton he is busy finishing his peninsular campaigns341 he will not be cut out by napier whose work has a strong party cast and being besides purely abstract and professional to the public seems very dull i read general millers account of the south american war342 i liked it the better that basil hall brought the author to breakfast with me in edinburgh a fine tall military figure his left hand withered like the prophets gourd and plenty of scars on him there have been rare doings in that vast continent but the strife is too distant the country too unknown to have the effect upon the imagination which european wars produce  this evening i indulged in the far nientea rare event with me but which i enjoy proportionally  june 16made up parcel for dr lardner and now i propose to set forth my memoranda of byron for moores acceptance which ought in civility to have been done long since343 i will have a walk however in the first place  i did not get on with byron so far as i expectedbegan it though and that is always something i went to see the woods at huntly burn and mars lea etc met captain hamilton who tells me a shocking thing two messrs stirling of drumpellier came here and dined one day and seemed spirited young men the younger is murdered by pirates an indian vessel in which he sailed was boarded by these miscreants who behaved most brutally and he offering resistance i suppose was shockingly mangled and flung into the sea he was afterwards taken up alive but died soon after such horrid accidents lie in wait for those whom we see all joyous and unthinking344 sweeping along the course of life and what end may be waiting ourselves who can tell  june 17must take my leave of sweet abbotsford and my leisure hour my eve of repose to go to town will take up the morning  edinburghwe set out about eleven oclock got to edinburgh about four where i dined with baron clerk and a few exchequer friendslord chief baron sir patrick murray sir henry jardine etc etc  june 18corrected proofs for dr dionysius lardner cadell came to breakfast poor fellow he looks like one who had been overworked and the difficulty of keeping papermakers up to printers printers up to draughtsmen artists to engravers and the whole party to time requires the utmost exertion he has actually ordered new plates although the steel ones which we employ are supposed to throw off 30000 without injury but i doubt something of this well since they will buckle fortune on our back we must bear it scholarly and wisely345 i went to court called on my return on jb and cadell at home i set to correct ivanhoe i had twenty other things more pressing but after all these novels deserve a preference poor terry is totally prostrated by a paralytic affection continuance of existence not to be wished for  tomorrow i expect sophia and her family by steam  june 19sophia and charles who acted as her escort arrived at nine oclock morning fresh from the steamboat they were in excellent healthalso the little boy and girl but poor johnnie seems very much changed indeed and i should not be surprised if the scene shortly closes there is obviously a great alteration in strength and features at dinner we had our family chat on a scale that i had not enjoyed for many years the skenes supped with us  june 20corrected proofsheets in the morning for dr lardner then i had the duty of the court to perform  as i came home i recommended young shortreed to mr cadell for a printing job now and then when ballantyne is overloaded which mr cadell promised accordingly  lady anna maria elliots company at dinner helped on our family party and passed the evening pleasantly enough my anxiety considering  june 21a very wet sunday i employed it to good purpose bestowing much labour on the history ten pages of which are now finished were it not for the precarious health of poor johnnie i would be most happy in this reunion with my family but poor child this is a terrible drawback  june 22i keep working though interruptedly but the heat in the midst of the day makes me flag and grow irresistibly drowsy mr and mrs skene came to supper this evening skene has engaged himself in drawing illustrations to be etched by himself for waverley i wish it may do346  june 23i was detained in the court till halfpast three captain william lockhart dined with skene the captains kind nature had brought him to edinburgh to meet his sisterinlaw  june 24i was detained late in the court but still had time to go with adam wilson and call upon a gentlemanlike east indian officer called colonel francklin who appears an intelligent and respectable man he writes the history of captain thomas347 a person of the condition of a common seaman who raised himself to the rank of a native prince and for some time waged a successful war with the powers around him the work must be entertaining  june 25finished correcting proofs for tales 3d series the court was over soon but i was much exhausted on the return home quite sleepy and past work i looked in on cadell whose hand is in his housewifes cap driving and pushing to get all the works forward in due order and cursing the delays of artists and engravers i own i wish we had not hampered ourselves with such causes of delay  june 26mr ellis missionary from the south sea islands breakfasted introduced by mr fletcher minister of the parish of stepney  mr elliss account of the progress of civilisation as connected with religion is very interesting knowledge of every kind is diffusedreading writing printing abundantly common polygamy abolished idolatry is put down the priests won over by the chiefs dividing among them the consecrated lands which belonged to their temples great part of the population are still without religion but willing to be instructed wars are become infrequent and there is in each state a sort of representative body or senate who are a check on the despotism of the chief all this has come hand in hand with religion mr ellis tells me that the missionaries of different sects avoided carefully letting the natives know that there were points of disunion between them not so some jesuits who had lately arrived and who taught their own ritual as the only true one mr ellis described their poetry to me and gave some examples it had an ossianic character and was composed of metaphor he gave me a small collection of hymns printed in the islands if this gentleman is sincere which i have no doubt of he is an illustrious character he was just about to return to the friendly islands having come here for his wifes health  blairadamafter the court we set off the two thomsons and i for blairadam where we held our macduff club for the twelfth anniversary we met the chief baron lord sydney osborne will clerk the merry knight sir adam ferguson with our venerable host the lord chief commissioner and merry men were we  june 27i ought not where merry men convene to omit our jovial son of neptune admiral adam the morning proving delightful we set out for the object of the day which was falkland we passed through lochore but without stopping and saw on the road eastward two or three places as balbedie strathendry and some others known to me by name also we went through the town of leslie and saw what remains of the celebrated rendezvous of rustic gallantry called christs kirk on the green348 it is now cut up with houses one of the most hideous of which is a new church having the very worst and most offensive kind of venetian windows this i am told has replaced a quiet lowly little gothic building coeval perhaps with the royal poet who celebrated the spot next we went to falkland where we found mr howden factor of mr tyndall bruce waiting to show us the palace  falkland has most interesting remains a double entrancetower and a side building running east from it is roofed and in some degree habitable a corresponding building running northward from the eastern corner is totally ruinous having been destroyed by fire the architecture is highly ornamented in the style of the palace at stirling niches with statues with projections cornices etc are lavished throughout many cornice medallions exhibited such heads as those procured from the kings room at stirling the originals perhaps being the same the repeated cypher of james v and mary of guise attest the builder of this part of the palace when complete it had been a quadrangle there is as much of it as remained when slezer published his drawings some part of the interior has been made what is called habitable that is a halfdozen of bad rooms have been gotten out of it am clear in my own mind a ruin should be protected but never repaired the proprietor has a beautiful place called nuthill within ten minutes walk of falkland and commanding some fine views of it and of the lomond hill this should be the residence but mr bruce and his predecessor my old professor john bruce349 deserve great credit for their attention to prevent dilapidation which was doing its work fast upon the ancient palace the only remarkable apartment was a large and wellproportioned gallery with a painted rooftempore jacobi sextiand built after his succession to the throne of england i noticed a curious thinga hollow column concealed the rope which rung the castle bell keeping it safe from injury and interruption  the town of falkland is old with very narrow streets the arrival of two carriages and a gig was an event important enough to turn out the whole population they are said to be less industrious more dissipated and readier to become soldiers than their neighbours so long a court retains its influence  we dined at wellfield with my mend george cheape with whom i rode in the cavalry some thirty years ago much mirth and good wine made us return in capital tune the chief baron and admiral adam did not go on this trip when we returned it was time to go to bed by a candle  june 28being sunday we lounged about in the neighbourhood of the crags called kiery craigs etc the sheriffsubstitute of kinross came to dinner and brought a gold signet350 which had been found in that town it was very neat work about the size of a shilling it bore in a shield the arms of scotland and england parti per pale those of scotland occupying the dexter side the shield is of the heater or triangular shape there is no crown nor legend of any kind a slip of gold folds upwards on the back of the hinge and makes the handle neatly enough it is too well wrought for david iis time and james iv is the only monarch of the scottish line who marrying a daughter of england may carry the arms of both countries parti per pale mr skelton is the name of the present possessor  two reported discoveries one that the blaeberry shrub contains the tanning quality as four to one compared to the oakwhich may be of great importance as it grows so commonly on our moors  the other that the cutting of an appletree or other fruittree may be preserved by sticking it into a potato and planting both together curious if true  june 29 edinburghwe dined together at blairadam having walked in the woods in the morning and seen a beautiful new walk made through the woody hill behind the house in a fine evening after an early dinner our party returned to edinburgh and there each dispersed to his several home and restingplace i had the pleasure of finding my family all well except johnnie  june 30after my short sniff of country air here am i again at the receipt of custom the sale with longman  co for stock and copyrights of my poetical works is completed for £7000 at dates from twelve to thirtysix months there are many sets out of which we may be able to clear the money and then we shall make something to clear the copyright i am sure this may be done and that the bargain will prove a good one in the long run  dined at home with my family whom as they disperse tomorrow i have dedicated the evening to  footnotes  328 the first volume had just been issued with a dedication to the king the series was completed in 48 vols published at the beginning of each month between 182933 and the circulation went on increasing until it reached 35000 monthly  329 theatre royal edinburgh which stood at that time in shakespeare square the site of the present general postoffice  330 mr lockhart remarks that besides the usual allowance of rheumatism and other lesser ailments sir walter had an attack that season of a nature which gave his family great alarm and which for some days he himself regarded with the darkest prognostications after some weeks during which he complained of headache and nervous irritation certain hæmorrhages indicated the sort of relief required and he obtained it from copious cuppinglife vol ix p 3278  331 see infra p 299  332 the beauxs stratagem farquhar  333 through the courtesy of miss dick lauder i am enabled to give the letter referred to  my dear sir thomasi received your kind letter and interesting communication yesterday and hasten to reply i am ashamed of the limited hospitality i was able to offer mr lauder but circumstances permitted me no more i was much pleased with his lively and intelligent manners and hope he will live to be a comfort and a credit to lady lauder and you  i need not say i have the greatest interest in the ms which you mention in case it shall really prove an authentic document there would not be the least difficulty in getting the bannatyne club to take perhaps 100 copies or obtaining support enough so as at the least to preclude the possibility of loss to the ingenious messrs hay allan but i think it indispensable that the original ms should be sent for a month or so to the register house under the charge of the deputy register mr thomson that its antiquity be closely scrutinised by competent persons the art of imitating ancient writing has got to a considerable perfection and it has been the bane of scottish literature and disgrace of her antiquities that we have manifested an eager propensity to believe without inquiry and propagate the errors which we adopt too hastily ourselves the general proposition that the lowlanders ever wore plaids is difficult to swallow they were of twenty different races and almost all distinctly different from the scots irish who are the proper scots from which the royal family are descended for instance there is scarce a great family in the lowlands of scotland that is not to be traced to the normans the proudest as well as most civilised race in the eleventh and twelfth centuries is it natural to think that holding the scots in the contempt in which they did they would have adopted their dress if you will look at bruces speech to david i as the historian Ælred tells the story you will see he talks of the scots as a british officer would do of cherokees or take our country the central and western part of the border it was british welsh if you please with the language and manners of that people who certainly wore no tartan it is needless to prosecute this though i could show i think that there is no period in scottish history when the manners language or dress of the highlanders were adopted in the low country they brought them with them from ireland as you will see from the very curious prints in derricks picture of ireland where you see the chiefs and followers of the wild irish in the ordinary highland dress tempore queen elizabeth besides this where has slept this universal custom that nowhere unless in this ms is it even heard of lesley knew it not though the work had been in his possession and his attention must have been called to it when writing concerning the three races of scotshighlanders lowlanders and bordermen and treating of their dress in particular andrew borde knows nothing of it nor the frenchman who published the geographical work from which pinkerton copied the prints of the highlander and lowlander the former in a frieze plaid or mantle while the lowlander struts away in a cloak and trunk hose liker his neighbour the fleming i will not state other objections though so many occur that the authenticity of the ms being proved i would rather suppose the author had been some tartanweaver zealous for his craft who wished to extend the use of tartan over the whole kingdom i have been told and believe till now that the use of tartan was never general in scotland lowlands until the union when the detestation of that measure led it to be adopted as the national colour and the ladies all affected tartan screens or mantles  now a word to your own private ear my dear sir thomas i have understood that the messrs hay allan are young men of talent great accomplishments enthusiasm for scottish manners and an exaggerating imagination which possibly deceives even themselves i myself saw one of these gentlemen wear the badge of high constable of scotland which he could have no more right to wear than the crown davidoff used also to amuse us with stories of knighthoods and orders which he saw them wear at sir william cumming gordons now this is all very well and i conceive people may fall into such dreaming habits easily enough and be very agreeable and talented men in other respects and may be very amusing companions in the country but their authority as antiquaries must necessarily be a little apocryphal when the faith of mss rests upon their testimony an old acquaintance of mine captain watson of the navy told me he knew these gentlemens father and had served with him he was lieutenant and of or about captain watsons age between sixty i suppose and seventy at present now what chance was there that either from age or situation he should be receiving gifts from the young chevalier of highland manuscripts  all this my dear sir thomas you will make your own but i cannot conceal from you my reasons because i would wish you to know my real opinion if it is an imitation it is a very good one but the title liber vestiarium is false latin i should think not likely to occur to a scotsman of buchanans age did you look at the watermark of the ms if the manuscript be of undeniable antiquity i consider it as a great curiosity and most worthy to be published but i believe nothing else than ocular inspection will satisfy most cautious antiquariesyours my dear sir thomas always  walter scott  edinburgh 5 june 1829  the messrs hay allan subsequently took the names of john sobieski stuart who assumed the title of comte dalbanie and charles edward stuart john sobieski died in 1872 and charles edward in 1880 the original of sir richard forresters manuscript was never submitted to the inspection of the deputy register as suggested by scott but it was published in a very handsome shape a dozen years later and furnished a text for an article in the quarterly in which the authenticity of the book and the claims of the author and his brother were unsparingly criticised by the late professor skene of glasgowsee the heirs of the stuarts in quarterly review vol lxxxii  334 ante vol i p 91 92  335 there are so few of darsie latimers letters preserved that the following may be given relating to the bride of lammermoor  edin sept 1 1829  my dear sir walteri greet you well which by the way is the proper mode of salutation in this cursed weather that is enough to make us all greet but to come to my proposal which is to forward to you a communication i had within these few days from sir robert horne dalrymple elphinstone  after expressing the great pleasure the perusal of your notes to the new edition of the novels had given him he adds i wish you would give him a hint of what i formerly mentioned to you regarding my greatgrandaunt and your own relative the unfortunate bride of lammermoor it was first mentioned to me by miss maitland the daughter of lady rothes they were the nearest neighbours of the stair family in wigtownshire and i afterwards heard the tradition from others in that country it was to the following effect that when after the noise and violent screaming in the bridal chamber comparative stillness succeeded and the door was forced the window was found open and it was supposed by many that the lover lord rutherford had by the connivance of some of the servants found means during the bustle of the marriage feast to secrete himself within the apartment and that soon after the entry of the married pair or at least as soon as the parents and others retreated and the door was made fast he had come out from his concealment attacked and desperately wounded the bridegroom and then made his escape by the window through the garden as the unfortunate bride never spoke after having uttered the words mentioned by sir walter no light could be thrown on the matter by them but it was thought that bucklaws obstinate silence on the subject favoured the supposition of the chastisement having been inflicted by his rival it is but fair to give the unhappy victim who was by all accounts a most gentle and feminine creature the benefit of an explanation on a doubtful point  so far my worthy friend who seems a little jealous of the poor brides reputation i send you his note and you can make what you like of it i am intending a little jaunt to his country and we mean to visit sundry old castles in aberdeenshire and wish you were of the party i have heard nothing of linton cognomen for sir adam ferguson this summer i hope you have been passing your time agreeablywith best compliments to all friends i remain my dear sir walter ever yours  wm clerk    336 written by william mudford born 1782 died 1848  337 twelfth night

that taskmistressposterity but you may thank your stars that i have let you off so long all that you promised me about mrs gordon and gicht and a variety of other things is remitted to you but i positively must have something from you of your recollections personally of byronand that as soon as possible for i am just coming to the period of your acquaintance with him which was i think in the year 1814 tell me all the particulars of the presents you exchanged and if his letters to you are really all lost which i will still hope is not the case try as much as possible with your memory  to

write to you immediately on receipt of the last ms you sent me to press your asking hobhouse for the letter of your own in 1812 that produced byrons reply but i was doubtful whether you would like to

constable you know the modern rage for publication and it might serve some newsmens purpose by publishing something about my old friend who was an humourist which may be unpleasing to his friends and surviving relations  i did not think on craignethan in writing about tillietudlem and i believe it differs in several respects from my chateau en espagne it is not on the clyde in particular and if i

series of sketches of the existing localities alluded to in the waverley novels etched from original drawings by james skene esq  347 a copy of this rather rare book is still in the abbotsford library its title is colonel wm francklins military memoirs of george thomas who by extraordinary talents and enterprise rose from an obscure situation to the rank of general in the service of the native powers in the nw of india 4to calcutta 1803  348 the poem of this name is attributed to king james i of scotland but dr irving in his history of scottish poetry says the earliest edition known to him dates only from 1663  349 professor of logic in the university of edinburgh from 1775 till 1792 when he resigned his chair and became keeper of the state paper office and historiographer to the east india company in london he wrote several elaborate and valuable reports for the government which though printed were never published among others one in 1799 in 2 vols 8vo on the union between england and scotland its causes effects and influence of great britain in europe in the previous year he also prepared another on the arrangements made for repelling the armada and their application to the crisis of 1798 this able man returned to scotland and died in falkland about two years before scott visited the place  350 an account of the finding of this seal which was thought to be that of joan

i was at home to witness the departure of my family which was depressing my two daughters with the poor boy johnnie went off at ten oclock my son charles with my niece about twelve the house filled with a little bustle attendant on such a removal then became silent as the grave the voices of the children which had lately been so clamorous with their joyous shouts are now hushed and still a blank of this kind is somewhat depressing and i find it impossible to resume my general tone of spirits a lethargy has crept on me which no efforts can dispel and as the day is rainy i cannot take exercise i have read therefore the whole morning and have endeavoured to collect ideas instead of expending them i have not been very successful in short diem perdidi  localities at blairadam      lochornie and lochornie moss     the loutingstane and dodgells cross     craigen cat and craigen crow     craiggaveral the kings cross and dunglow  july 2i made up for my deficiencies yesterday and besides attending the court wrote five close pages which i think is very near double task i was alone the whole day and without interruption i have little doubt i will make my solitude tell upon my labours especially since they promise to prove so efficient i was so languid yesterday that i did not record that j ballantyne his brother sandy and mr cadell dined here on a beefsteak and smoked a cigar and took a view of our el dorado  july 3laboured at court where i was kept late and wrought on my return home finishing about five pages i had the great pleasure to learn that the party with the infantry got safe to abbotsford  july 4after court i came home and set to work still on the tales when i had finished my bit of dinner and was in a quiet way smoking my cigar over a glass of negus adam ferguson comes with a summons to attend him to the justiceclerks where it seems i was engaged i was totally out of case to attend his summons redolent as i was of tobacco but i am vexed at the circumstance it looks careless and what is worse affected and the justice is an old friend moreover351 i rather think i have been guilty towards him in this respect before devil take my stupidity i will call on monday and say here is my sabre and here is my heart  july 5sir adam came to breakfast and with him mr and mrs johnstone of bordeaux the lady his cousin i could not give them a right scottish breakfast being on a sunday morning laboured on the tales the whole morning  the post brought two letters of unequal importance one from a person calling himself haval announcing to me the terrific circumstance that he had written against the waverley novels in a publication called la belle assemblée at which doubtless he supposes i must be much annoyed he be d and thats plain speaking the other from lord aberdeen announcing that lockhart dr gooch and myself are invested with the power of examining the papers of the cardinal duke of york and reporting what is fit for publication this makes it plain that the invisible352 neither slumbers nor sleeps the toil and remuneration must be lockharts and to any person understanding that sort of work the degree of trust reposed holds out hope of advantage at any rate it is a most honourable trust and i have written in suitable terms to lord aberdeen to express my acceptance of it adverting to my necessary occupations here and expressing my willingness to visit london occasionally to superintend the progress of the work treated myself being considerably fagged with a glass of poor glengarrys superexcellent whisky and a cigar made up my journal wrote to the girls and so to roost upon a crust of bread and a glass of small beer my usual supper  july 6i laboured all the morning without anything unusual save a call from my cousin mary scott of jedburgh whom i persuaded to take part of my chaise to abbotsford on saturday at two oclock i walked to cadells and afterwards to a committee of the bannatyne club thereafter i went to leith where we had fixed a meeting of the club now of fortyone years standing353 i was in the chair and sir adam croupier we had the justiceclerk lord abercromby lord pitmilly lord advocate james ferguson john irving and william clerk and passed a merry day for old fellows it is a curious thing that only three have died of this club since its formation these were the earl of selkirk james clerk lieutenant in the navy and archibald miller ws sir patrick murray was an unwilling absentee there were absentprofessor davidson of glasgow besides glassford who has cut our society and poor james edmonstoune whose state of health precludes his ever joining society again we took a fair but moderate allowance of wine sung our old songs and were much refreshed with a hundred old stories which would have seemed insignificant to any stranger the most important of these were old college adventures of love and battle  july 7i was rather apprehensive that i might have felt my unusual dissipation this morning but not a whit i rose as cool as a cucumber and set about to my work till breakfasttime i am to dine with ballantyne today tomorrow with john murray this sounds sadly like idleness except what may be done either in the morning before breakfast or in the broken portion of the day between attendance on the court and my dinner meala vile drowsy yawning fagged portion of existence which resembles ones day as a portion of the shirt escaping betwixt ones waistcoat and breeches indicates his linen  dined with james ballantyne who gave us a very pleasant party there was a great musician mr neukomm a german a pupil of haydn a sensible pleasant man  july 8this morning i had an ample dose of proofs and could do nothing but read them the court kept me till two i was then half tempted to go to hear mr neukomm perform on the organ which is said to be a most masterly exhibition but i reflected how much time i should lose by giving way to temptation and how little such ears as mine would be benefited by the exhibition and so i resolved to return to my proofs having not a little to do i was so unlucky as to meet my foreigner along with mr laine the french consul and his lady who all invited me to go with them but i pleaded business and was set down doubtless for a goth as i deserved however i got my proofs settled before dinnertime and began to pack up books etc  i dined at john murrays and met amongst others mr schutze the brotherinlaw of poor george ellis we conversed about our mutual friend and about the life canning was to have written about him and which he would have done con amore he gave me two instances of poor georges neatness of expression and acuteness of discrimination having met for the first time one perceval a young lawyer he records him as a person who with the advantages of life and opportunity would assuredly rise to the head of affairs another gentleman is briefly characterised as a man of few words and fewer ideas schutze himself is a clever man with something dry in his manner owing perhaps to an imperfection of hearing murrays parties are always agreeable and well chosen  july 9i began an immense arrangement of my papers but was obliged to desist by the approach of four oclock having been enabled to shirk the court i had the whole day to do what i wished and as i made some progress i hope i will be strengthened to resume the task when at abbotsford  heard of the death of poor bob shortreed354 the companion of many a long ride among the hills in quest of old ballads he was a merry companion a good singer and mimic and full of scottish drollery in his company and under his guidance i was able to see much of rural society in the mountains which i could not otherwise have attained and which i have made my use of he was in addition a man of worth and character i always burdened his hospitality while at jedburgh on the circuit and have been useful to some of his family poor fellow he died at a most interesting period for his family when his eldest daughter was about to make an advantageous marriage so glide our friends from ushaec poena diu viventibus many recollections die with him and with poor terry355 i dined with the skenes in a family way  july 10had a hard days work at the court till about two and then came home to prepare for the country i made a talis qualis arrangement of my papers which i trust i shall be able to complete at abbotsford for it will do much good i wish i had a smart boy like red robin the tinker wrote also a pack of letters  abbotsford july 11i was detained in the court till nearly one oclock then set out and reached abbotsford in five or six hours found all well and johnnie rather better he sleeps by virtue of being in the open air a good deal  july 12the day excessively rainy or as we call it soft i een unpacked my books and did a great deal to put them in order but i was sick of the labour by two oclock and left several of my books and all of my papers at sixes and sevens sir adam and the colonel dined with us a spanish gentleman with his wife whom i had seen at the french consuls also dropped in he was a handsome intelligent and sensible man his name i have forgot we had a pleasant evening  july 13this day i wrote till one resuming the history and making out a days task then went to chiefswood and had the pleasure of a long walk with a lady well known in the world of poetry mrs hemans she is young and pretty though the mother of five children as she tells me there is taste and spirit in her conversation my daughters are critical and call her blue but i think they are hypercritical i will know better when we meet again i was home at four had an evening walk with little walter who held me by the finger gabbling eternally much that i did and more that i did not understand then i had a long letter to write to lockhart356 correct and read and despatch proofs etc and to bed heartily tired though with no great exertion  july 14a rainy forenoon broke the promise of a delightful morning i wrote four and a half pages to make the best of a bad bargain if i can double the daily task i will be something in hand but i am resolved to stick to my three pages a day at least the twelfth of august will then complete my labours  july 15this day two very pretty and wellbred boys came over to breakfast with us i finished my task of three pages and better and went to walk with the little fellows round the farm by the lake etc etc they were very good companions tom has been busy thinning the terrace this day or two and is to go on  july 16i made out my taskwork and betook myself to walk about twelve i feel the pen turn heavy after breakfast perhaps my solemn morning meal is too much for my intellectual powers but i wont abridge a single crumb for all that i eat very little at dinner and cant abide to be confined in my hearty breakfast the work goes on as taskwork must slow sure and i trust not drowsy though the author is i sent off to dionysius lardner goodness be with us what a name as far as page thirtyeight inclusive but i will wait to add tomorrows quota i had a long walk with tom357 i am walking with more pleasure and comfort to myself than i have done for many a day may heaven continue this great mercy which i have so much reason to be thankful for  july 17 we called at chiefswood and asked captain hamilton and mrs h and mrs hemans to dinner on monday she is a clever person and has been pretty i had a long walk with her têteàtête she told me of the peculiar melancholy attached to the words no more i could not help telling as a different application of the words how an old dame riding home along cockenzie sands pretty bowsy fell off the pillion and her husband being in good order also did not miss her till he came to prestonpans he instantly returned with some neighbours and found the good woman seated amidst the advancing tide which began to rise with her lips ejaculating to her cummers who she supposed were still pressing her to another cup nae ae drap mair i thank you kindly we dined in family and all well  july 18 a sunday with alternate showers and sunshine wrote double task which brings me to page fortysix inclusive i read the spaewife of galt there is something good in it and the language is occasionally very forcible but he has made his story difficult to understand by adopting a region of history little known and having many heroes of the same name whom it is not easy to keep separate in ones memory some of the traits of the spaewife who conceits herself to be a changeling or twin are very good indeed his highland chief is a kind of caliban and speaks like caliban a jargon never spoken on earth but full of effect for all that  july 19i finished two leaves this morning and received the hamiltons and mrs hemans to breakfast afterwards we drove to yarrow and showed mrs hemans the lions the party dined with us and stayed till evening of course no more work  july 20a rainy day and i am very drowsy and would give the world to 358 transcribers note in original there was a blank space instead of the dashes i wrote four leaves however and then my understanding dropped me i have made up for yesterdays short task                                            notefrom july 20th 1329 to may 23d 1830 there are no entries      in the journal but during that time sir walter met with a sad      loss he was deprived of his humble friend and staunch henchman      thomas purdie the following little note to laidlaw shows how      keenly he felt his death       my dear williei write to tell you the shocking news of poor tom      purdies death by which i have been greatly affected he had      complained or rather spoken of a sore throat and the day before      yesterday as it came on a shower of rain i wanted him to walk      fast on to abbotsford before me but you know well how impossible      that was he took some jelly or trifle of that kind but made no      complaint this morning he rose from bed as usual and sat down by      the table with his head on his hand and when his daughter spoke to      him life had passed away without a sigh or groan poor fellow      there is a heart cold that loved me well and i am sure thought      of my interest more than his own i have seldom been so much      shocked i wish you would take a ride down and pass the night      there is much i have to say and this loss adds to my wish to see      you we dine at four the day is indifferent but the sooner the      betteryours

really wish to be quit of the country i have this day laid him in      the grave       on coming to edinburgh sir walter found that his old friend and      neighbour lady jane stuart360 was no longer

expedition among the border hills in quest of the materials of legendary lore which have at length filled so many volumes this collection of the results of their former rambles is presented by his sincere friend walter scottjgl  355 who had died on the 22d june 1829  356 see p 329 n  357 mr skene in his reminiscences records thattom purdie identified himself with all his masters pursuits and concerns he had in early life been a shepherd and came into sir walters service upon his first taking up his abode at ashiestiel of which he became at last the farm manager and upon the family removing to abbotsford continued that function to which was added gamekeeper forester librarian and henchman to his master in all his rambles about the property he used to talk of sir walters publications as our books and said that the reading of them was the greatest comfort to him for whenever he was off his sleep which sometimes happened to him he had only to take one of the novels and before he read two pages it was sure to set him asleep tom with the usual shrewdness common to his countrymen in that class of life joined a quaintness and drollery in his notions and mode of expressing himself that was very amusing he was familiar but at the same time perfectly respectful although he was sometimes tempted to deal sharp cuts particularly at sir adam ferguson whom he seemed to take a pleasure in assailing when sir walter obtained the honour of knighthood for sir adam upon the plea of his being custodier of the regalia of scotland tom was very indignant because he said it would take some of the shine out of us meaning sir walter tom was very fond of salmon fishing which from an accordance of taste contributed much to elevate my merits in his eyes and i believe i was his greatest favourite of all sir walters friends which he used occasionally to testify by imparting to me in confidence some secret about fishing which he concluded that no one knew but himself he was remarkably fastidious in his care of the library and it was exceedingly amusing to see a clodhopper for he was always in the garb of a ploughman moving about in the splendid apartment which had been fitted up for the library scrutinising the state of the books putting derangement to rights remonstrating when he observed anything that indicated carelessness  358 blank in original  359

   1830     may   may 23 abbotsfordabout a year ago i took the pet at my diary chiefly because i thought it made me abominably selfish and that by recording my gloomy fits i encouraged their recurrence whereas out of sight out of mind is the best way to get rid of them and now i hardly know why i take it up again but here goes i came here to attend raeburns funeral i am near of his kin my greatgrandfather walter scott being the second son or first cadet of this small family my late kinsman was also married to my aunt a most amiable old lady he was never kind to me and at last utterly ungracious of course i never liked him and we kept no terms he had forgot though an infantine cause of quarrel which i always remembered when i was four or five years old i was staying at lessudden house an old mansion the abode of this raeburn a large pigeonhouse was almost destroyed with starlings then a common bird though now seldom seen they were seized in their nests and put in a bag and i think drowned or threshed to death or put to some such end the servants gave one to me which i in some degree tamed and the brute of a laird seized and wrung its neck i flew at his throat like a wild cat and was torn from him with no little difficulty long afterwards i did him the mortal offence to recall some superiority which my father had lent to the laird to make up a qualification which he meant to exercise by voting for lord mintos interest against poor don this made a total breach between two relations who had never been friends and though i was afterwards of considerable service to his family he kept his illhumour alleging justly enough that i did these kind actions for the sake of his wife and family not for his benefit i now saw him at the age of eightytwo or three deposited in the ancestral grave dined with my cousins and returned to abbotsford about eight oclock  may 24 edinburghcalled on my neighbour nicol milne of faldonside to settle something about the road to selkirk afterwards went to huntly burn and made my compliments to the family lunched at halfpast two and drove to town calling at george square on gala he proposed to give up the present road to selkirk in favour of another on the north side of the river to be completed by two bridges this is an object for abbotsford in the evening came to town letter from mr haydon soliciting £20 wait till lockhart comes  may 25got into the old mill this morning and grind away walked in very bad day to george square from the parliament house through paths once familiar but not trod for twenty years met scott of woll and scott of gala and consulted about the new road between galashiels and selkirk i am in hopes to rid myself of the road to selkirk which goes too near me at abbotsford dined at lord chief commissioners where we met the new chief baron abercromby361 and his lady i thought it was the first time we had met for above forty years but he put me in mind we had dined one day at john richardsons  may 26wrought with proofs etc at the demonology which is a cursed business to do neatly i must finish it though for i need money i went to the court from that came home and scrambled on with half writing half reading half idleness till evening i have laid aside smoking much and now unless tempted by company rarely take a cigar i was frightened by a species of fit which i had in february which took from me my power of speaking i am told it is from the stomach it looked woundy like palsy or apoplexy well be it what it will i can stand it362  may 27court as usual i am agitating a proposed retirement from the court as they are only to have four instead of six clerks of session in scotland it will be their interest to let me retire on a superannuation probably i shall make a bad bargain and get only twothirds of the salary instead of threefourths this would be hard but i could save between two and three hundred pounds by giving up town residence and surely i could do enough with my time at reviews and other ways so as to make myself comfortable at abbotsford at any rate jacta est aha sir robert peel and the advocate seem to acquiesce in the arrangement and sir robert dundas retires alongst with me i think the difference will be infinite in point of health and happiness  may 28wrought in the morning then the court then cadells my affairs go on up to calculation and the magnum keeps its ground if this can last for five or six years longer we may clear our hands of debt but perhaps i shall have paid that of nature before that time come they will have the books and cadell to manage them who is a faithful pilot the poetry which we purchased for £7000 payable in two years is melting off our hands and we will feed our magnum in that way when we have sold the present stock by which we hope to pay the purchasemoney and so go on velvet with the continuation so my general affairs look well i expect lockhart and sophia to arrive this evening in the roads and breakfast with us tomorrow this is very reviving  may 29the lockharts were to appear at nine oclock but it is past four and they come not there has been easterly wind and a swell of the sea at the mouth of the firth but nevertheless i wish they would come the machinery is liable to accidents and they may be delayed thus  mr piper the great contractor for the mail coaches one of the sharpest men in his line called here today to give his consent to our line of road he pays me the compliment of saying he wishes my views on the subject that is perhaps fudge but at least i know enough to choose the line that is most for my own advantage i have written to make gala acquainted that my subscription depends on their taking the gala foot road no other would suit me after dinner i began to tease myself about the children and their parents and night went down on our uncertainty  may 30our travellers appeared early in the morning cum tota sequela right happy were we all poor johnnie looks well his deformity is confirmed poor fellow but he may be a clever lad for all that an imposthume in his neck seems to be the crisis of his complaint he is a gentle placid creature walter is remarkably handsome and so is little whippety stourie363 as i call her after breakfast i had a chat with lockhart about affairs in general which as far as our little interests are concerned are doing very well lockhart is now established in his reputation and literary prospects364 i wrote some more in his demonology which is a scrape i think  may 31set to work early and did a good days work without much puffing and blowing had lockhart at dinner and a têteàtête over our cigar he has got the right ideas for getting to the very head of the literary world and now stands very high as well for taste and judgment as for genius i think there is no fear now of his letting a love of fun run away with him at home the whole day except a walk to cadells who is enlarging his sale as he comes upon heavy months and is come now to the abbot the monastery and the less profitable or popular of the novels this is a fortunate circumstance the management seems very judicious  footnotes  361 james abercromby who succeeded sir samuel shepherd as chief baron was the third son of sir ralph abercromby he was afterwards elected member for edinburgh in 1832 and speaker of the house of commons in 1835 on mr abercrombys retirement in 1839 he was raised to the peerage as lord dunfermline he died at colinton house on april 17th 1858 aged 81  362 of this illness sir walter had written the following account to mr lockhart a week after its occurrence  anne would tell you of an awkward sort of fit i had on monday last it lasted about five minutes during which i lost the power of articulation or rather of speaking what i wished to say i revived instantly but submitted to be bled and to keep the house for a week except exercising walks they seem to say it is from the stomach it may or may not be a paralytic affection we must do the best we can in either event i think by hard work i will have all my affairs regulated within five or six years and leave the means of clearing them in case of my death i hope there will be enough for all and provision besides for my own family the present return of the novels to me is about £8000 a year which moves fast on to clear off old scores  this awkward turn of health makes my motions very uncertain on the one hand i want to save money and push forward work both which motives urge me to stay at home this spring on the other besides my great wish to see you all and besides my desire to look at the fortyfive affairs i am also desirous to put in for my interest upon the changes at the court it must be very much as health and weather shall determine for if i see the least chance of a return of this irritation my own house will be the only fit place for me do not suppose i am either lowspirited or frightened at the possibilities i calculate upon but there is no harm in looking at what may be as what needs must be i really believe the ugly symptoms proceed from the stomach particularly i feel thank god no mental injury which is most of all to be deprecated still i am a good deal failed in body within these two or three last years and the singula praedantur come by degrees to make up a sum they say do not work but my habits are such that it is not easily managed for i would be driven mad with idleness adieu love to all the odds are greatly against my seeing you till you come down here but i will have the cottage in such order for you and as will laidlaw comes back at whitsunday i will have him to lend me an arm to chiefswood and i have no doubt to do gallantly  edinburgh 22d february 1830  363 his granddaughter charlotte whom he playfully named after the fairy in the old scottish nursery story  364 mr lockhart had some thoughts of entering parliament at this time and sir walter had expressed his opinion a few days before their meeting  your letter this day received namely wednesday gave me the greatest pleasure on account of the prosperous intelligence which it gives me of your own advancing prospects i take it for granted that you have looked to the income of future years before thinking of disposing of the profits of a successful one in a manner which cannot be supposed to produce positive or direct advantage but may rather argue some additional degree of expense  but this being premeesed i cannot help highly approving of your going into parliament especially as a member entirely unfettered and left to act according to the weal of the public or what you conceive such it is the broad turnpike to importance and consequence which you as a man of talents in the full vigour of your youth ought naturally to be ambitious of the present times threaten to bring in many occasions when there will and must be opportunities of a man distinguishing himself and serving his country  to go into the house without speaking would be useless i will frankly tell you that when i heard you speak you seemed always sufficiently up to the occasion both in words and matter but too indifferent in the manner in which you pressed your argument and therefore far less likely to attract attention than if you had seemed more earnestly persuaded of the truth and importance of what you have been saying i think you may gain advantage from taking this hint no one is disposed to weigh any mans arguments more favourably than he himself does and if you are not considered as gravely interested in what you say and conscious of its importance your audience will not be so  edinburgh 20th may 1830     june   june 1proofs and court the inevitable employment of the day louisa kerr dined with us and williams looked in we talked a good deal on celtic witchery and fairy lore i was glad to renew my acquaintance with this able and learned man  june 2the lockharts left us again this morning and although three masons are clanking at their work to clear a well the noise is mitigated now the poor babies clang of tongues is removed i set myself to write determining to avoid reasoning and to bring in as many stories as possible being a teind wednesday i may work undisturbed and i will try to get so far ahead as may permit a journey to abbotsford on saturday at nine oclock was as far ahead as page 57 it runs out well and 150 pages will do  june 3finished my proofs and sent them off with copy i saw mr dickinson365 on tuesday a right plain sensible man he is so confident in my matters that being a large creditor himself he offers to come down with the support of all the london creditors to carry through any measure that can be devised for my behoof mr cadell showed him that we are four years forward in matter prepared for the press got heaths illustrations which i dare say are finely engraved but commonplace enough in point of art  june 4court as usual and not long detained visited cadell all right and his reports favourable it being the launch of our annual volume now traversing a year with unblemished reputation and success uninterrupted i should have said i overhauled proofs and furnished copy in the morning between seven and ten oclock  after coming from the court i met woll and gala and agreed upon the measures to be attempted at selkirk on the eighth at the meeting of trustees in the evening smoked an extra cigar none since tuesday and dedicated the rest to putting up papers etc for abbotsford anne wants me to go to hear the tyrolese minstrels but though no one more esteems that bold and highspirited people i cannot but think their yodelling if this be the word is a variation or set of variations upon the tones of a jackass so i remain to dribble and scribble at home  june 5i rose at seven as usual and to say truth dawdled away my time in putting things to rights which is a vile amusement and writing letters to people who write to ask my opinion of their books which is as much as to saytom come tickle me this is worse than the other pastime but either may serve for a broken day and both must be done sometimes  abbotsfordafter the court started for abbotsford at halfpast twelve at noon and here we are at halfpast five impransi the country looks beautiful though the foliage larches in particular have had a blight yet they can hardly be said to lose foliage since they have but a sort of brushes at best  june 6went through a good deal of duty as to proofs and the like at two set out and reached by four chiefswood where i had the happiness to find the lockharts all in high spirits well and happy johnnie must be all his life a weakly child but he may have good health and possesses an admirable temper we dined with the lockharts and were all very happy  june 7same duty carefully performed i continued working till about one when lockhart came to walk we took our course round by the lake i was a good deal fagged and must have tired my companion by walking slow the fergusons came oversir adam in all his gloryand the night drave on wi sangs and clatter366  june 8had not time to do more than correct a sheet or two about eleven set off for selkirk where there was a considerable meeting of road trustees the consideration of the new road was intrusted to a committee which in some measure blinks the question yet i think it must do in the end i dined with the club young chesters president it is but bad fun but i might be father of most of them and must have patience at length      hame cam our gudeman at een       and hame cam he367  june 9in the morning i advised sheriff court processes carried on the demonology till twelve then put books etc in some order to leave behind me will it be ordered that i come back not like a stranger or sojourner but to inhabit here i do not know i shall be happy either way it is perhaps a violent change in the end of life to quit the walk one has trod so long and the cursed splenetic temper which besets all men makes you value opportunities and circumstances when one enjoys them no longer well things must be as they may as says that great philosopher corporal nym368  edinburghi had my walk and on my return found the lockharts come to take luncheon and leave of us reached edinburgh at nine oclock found among less interesting letters two from lord northampton on the death of the poor marchioness369 and from anna jane clephane on the same melancholy topic hei mihi  june 10corrected proofs prepared some copy and did all that was right dined and wrought in the evening yet i did not make much way after all  june 11in the morning the usual labour of two hours god bless that habit of being up at seven i could do nothing without it but it keeps me up to the scratch as they say i had a letter this morning with deep mourning paper and seal the mention of my nephew in the first line made me sick fearing it had related to walter it was from poor sir thomas bradford who has lost his lady but was indeed an account of walter370 and a good one  june 12a day of general labour and much weariness  june 13the same may be said of this day  june 14and of this only i went out for an hour and a half to mr colvin smith to conclude a picture for lord gillies this is a sad relief from labour       sedet æternumque sedebit     infelix theseus371  but lord gillies has been so kind and civil that i must have his picture as like as possible  june 15i had at breakfast the son of mr fellenburg372 of hofwyll switzerland a modest young man i used to think his father something of a quack in proposing to discover how a boys natural genius lies with a view to his education how would they have made me a scholar is a curious question whatever was forced on me as a task i should have detested there was also a gentlemanlike little man the chevalier de silent and speaks no english poor george scott harden is dead of the typhus fever poor dear boy i am sorry for him and yet more for his parents i have a letter from henry on the subject  june 16i wrote this forenoon till i completed the 100 pages which is well done i had a call from colin mackenzie whom i had not seen for nearly two years he has not been so well and looks ghastly but i think not worse than i have seen him of late years we are very old acquaintances i remember he was one of a small party at college that formed ourselves into a club called the poetical society the other members were charles kerr of abbotrule a singular being colin mlaurin insane colin and i who have luckily kept our wits i also saw this morning a mr low a youth of great learning who has written a good deal on the early history of scotland373 he is a goodlooking frank gentlemanlike lad with these good gifts only a parish schoolmaster in aberdeenshire having won a fair holiday i go to see miss kemble for the first time it is two or three years since i have been in a theatre once my delight  june 17went last night to theatre and saw miss fanny kembles isabella374 which was a most creditable performance it has much of the genius of mrs siddons her aunt she wants her beautiful countenance her fine form and her matchless dignity of step and manner on the other hand miss fanny kemble has very expressive though not regular features and what is worth it all great energy mingled with and chastened by correct taste i suffered by the heat lights and exertion and will not go back tonight for it has purchased me a sore headache this theatrical excursion besides the play is mrs beverley375 and i hate to be made miserable about domestic distress so i keep my gracious presence at home tonight though ive and respect miss kemble for giving her active support to her father in his need and preventing covent garden from coming down about their ears i corrected proofs before breakfast attended court but was idle in the forenoon the headache annoying me much dinner will make me better and so it did i wrote in the evening three pages and tolerably well though i may say with the emperor titus not titus oates that i have lost a day  june 18 blairadamyoung john colquhoun of killermont and his wife breakfasted with usa neat custom that and saves wine and wassail then to court and arranged for our departure for blairadam it being near midsummer when the club meets anne with me and sir adam ferguson the day was execrable our meeting at blairadam was cordial but our numbers diminished the good and very clever lord chief baron376 is returned to his own country with more regrets than in scotland usually attend a stranger will clerk has a bad cold thomas thomson is detained but the chief commissioner admiral adam sir adam john thomson and i make an excellent concert i only hope our venerable host will not fatigue himself tomorrow we go to culross which sir robert preston is repairing and the wise are asking for whose future enjoyment he is upwards of ninety but still may enjoy the bustle of life  june 19arose and expected to work a little but a friends house is not favourable you are sure to want the book you have not brought and are in short out of sorts like the minister who could not preach out of his own pulpit there is something fanciful in this and something real too and i have forgot my watch and left half my glasses at home  off we set at halfpast eight oclock lord chief commissioner being left at home owing to a cold we breakfasted at luscar a place belonging to adam rolland but the gout had arrested him at edinburgh so we were hospitably received by his family the weather most unpropitious very cold and rainy after breakfast to culross where the veteran sir robert preston377 showed us his curiosities life has done as much for him as most people in his ninetysecond year he has an ample fortune a sound understanding not the least decay of eyes ears or taste is as big as two men and eats like three yet he too experiences the singula prædantur anni and has lost something since i last saw him if his appearance renders old age tolerable it does not make it desirable but i fear when death comes we shall be unwilling for all that to part with our bundle of sticks sir robert amuses himself with repairing the old house of culross built by the lord bruce of kinloss to what use it is destined is not very evident to me it is too near his own comfortable mansion of valleyfield to be useful as a residence if indeed it could be formed into a comfortable modern house but it is rather like a banqueting house well he follows his own fancy we had a sumptuous cold dinner adam grieves it was not hot so little can war and want break a man to circumstances we returned to blairadam in the evening through the wind but and the rain for june weather it is the most ungenial i have seen the beauty of culross consists in magnificent terraces rising on the seabeach and commanding the opposite shore of lothian the house is repairing in the style of james the sixth the windows have pediments like heriots work378 there are some fine relics of the old monastery with large saxon arches at luscar i saw with pleasure the painting by raeburn of my old friend adam rolland esq379 who was in the external circumstances but not in frolic or fancy my prototype for paul pleydell380  june 20we settled this morning to go to church at lochore that is at ballingray but when we came to the earthly paradise so called we were let off for there was no sermon for which i could not in my heart be sorry so after looking at lochore back we came to lounge and loiter about till dinnertime the rest of the day was good company good cheer and good conversation yet to be idle here is not the thing and to be busy is impossible so i wish myself home again in spite of good entertainment we leave tonight after an early dinner and i will get to work again  june 21 edinburghwrote to walter a long letter the day continued dropping occasionally but sir adam was in high fooling and we had an amazing deal of laughing we stole a look at the kiery craigs between showers in the meantime george cheape and his son came in we dined at halfpast three but it was seven ere we set off and did not reach the house in shandwick place till eleven at night thus ended our club for the year 1830 its thirteenth anniversary its numbers were diminished by absence and indisposition but its spirit was unabated  june 22finished proofs and some copy in the morning returned at noon and might have laboured a good days work but was dull drowsy and indolent and could not at least did not write above half a page it was a day lost and indeed it is always with me the consequence of mental indolence for a day or two so i had a succession of eating and dozing which i am ashamed of for there was nothing to hinder me but thickcoming fancies pshaw rabbit un  june 23worked well this morning and then to court at two called on mr gibson and find him disposed for an instalment cadell has £10000 and gibson thinks £12000 will pay 2s 6d i wish it could be made three shillings which would be £15000  presided at a meeting of the bannatyne club the whigs made a strong party to admit kennedy of dunure which set aside lord medwyn who had been longer on the roll of candidates if politics get into this club it will ruin the literary purpose of the meeting and the general goodhumour with which it has gone on i think it better to take the thing goodhumouredly and several of them volunteered to say that medwyn must be the next which will finish all à laimable if it come to partywork i will cut and run confound it my eyes are closing now even now at halfpast four  dined with lord medwyn a pleasant party the guest of importance mrs peter latouche from dublin a fine old dame who must have been beautiful when young being pleasant and comely at seventysaintly it appears  june 24hard work with ballantynes proofs and revises but got them accomplished i am at the twelfth hour but i think i shall finish this silly book before the tenth of july  notwithstanding this sage resolution i did not write half a page of the said demonology this day i went to the court called on mr cadell returned dogtired and trifled my time with reading the trial of corder what seemed most singular was his love to talk of the young woman he had murdered in such a manner as to insinuate the circumstances of his own crime which is a kind of necessity which seems to haunt consciencestruck men charles sharpe came in at night and supped with us  june 25slept little later than i should the proofs occupied the morning the court and walk home detained me till two when i returned set to work and reached page 210 of copy there is little or nothing else to say skene was with me for a few minutes i called at cadells also who thinks a dividend of 3s per pound will be made out381 this will be onehalf of the whole debts and leave a sinking fund for the rest about £10000 a year if the beast live and the branks bide hale382  june 26miss kemble and her father breakfasted here with sir adam and lady ferguson i like the young lady very much respecting both her talents and the use she has made of them she seems merry unaffected and goodhumoured she said she did not like the apathy of the scottish audiences who are certain not to give applause upon credit i went to the court but soon returned a bad cold in my head makes me cough and sneeze like the dragon of wantley the advocates bill383 is read a third time i hardly know whether to wish it passed or no and am therefore in utrumque paratus  june 27in the morning worked as usual at proofs and copy of my infernal demonologya task to which my poverty and not my will consents about twelve oclock i went to the country to take a days relaxation we ie mr cadell james ballantyne and i went to prestonpans and getting there about one surveyed the little village where my aunt and i were lodgers for the sake of seabathing in 1778 i believe i knew the house of mr warroch where we liveda poor cottage of which the owners and their family are extinct i recollected my juvenile ideas of dignity attendant on the large gate a black arch which lets out upon the sea i saw the church where i yawned under the inflictions of a dr mcormick a name in which dulness seems to have been hereditary i saw the links where i arranged my shells upon the turf and swam my little skiffs in the pools many comparisons between the man and the recollections of my kind aunt of old george constable who i think dangled after her of dalgetty a veteran halfpay lieutenant who swaggered his solitary walk on the parade as he called a little open space before the same pool we went to preston and took refuge from a thunderplump in the old tower i remembered the little garden where i was crammed with gooseberries and the fear i had of blind harrys spectre of fawdon showing his headless trunk at one of the windows i remembered also a very goodnatured pretty girl my mary duff whom i laughed and romped with and loved as children love she was a miss dalrymple daughter of lord westhall384 a lord of session was afterwards married to anderson of winterfield and her daughter is now the spouse of my colleague robert hamilton so strangely are our cards shuffled i was a mere child and could feel none of the passion which byron alleges yet the recollection of this goodhumoured companion of my childhood is like that of a morning dream nor should i now greatly like to dispel it by seeing the original who must now be sufficiently timehonoured  well we walked over the field of battle saw the princes park copes loan marked by slaughter in his disastrous retreat the thorntree which marks the centre of the battle and all besides that was to be seen or supposed we saw two broadswords found on the field of battle one a highlanders an andrew ferrara another the dragoons sword of that day lastly we came to cockenzie where mr francis cadell my publishers brother gave us a kind reception i was especially glad to see the mother of the family a fine old lady who was civil to my aunt and me and i recollect well used to have us to tea at cockenzie curious that i should long afterwards have an opportunity to pay back this attention to her son robert once more what a kind of shuffling of the hand dealt us at our nativity there was mrs f cadell and one or two young ladies and some fine fat children i should be a bastard to the time385 did i not tell our fare we had a tiled whiting386 a dish unknown elsewhere so there is a bone for the gastronomers to pick honest john wood387 my old friend dined with us i only regret i cannot understand him as he has a very powerful memory and much curious information the whole day of pleasure was damped by the news of the kings death it was fully expected however as the termination of his long illness but he was very good to me personally and a kind sovereign the common people and gentry join in their sorrow much is owing to a kindly recollection of his visit to this country which gave all men an interest in him  june 29the business of the court was suspended so back i came without stop or stay and to work went i as i had risen early i was sadly drowsy however i fought and fagged away the day i am still in hope to send my whole manuscript to ballantyne before the 10th july well i must devise something to myself i must do something better than this demonological trash it is nine oclock and i am weary yea my very spirits tired388 after ten oclock mr daveis389 an american barrister of eminence deputed to represent the american states in a dispute concerning the boundaries of nova scotia and new england with an introduction to me from mr ticknor called i was unable to see him and put him off till tomorrow morning at breakfast  june 30the new king was proclaimed and the college of justice took the oaths i assisted mr daveis who is a pleasant and wellinformed man to see the ceremony which probably he would hardly witness in his own country a day of noise and bustle we dined at mr and mrs strange chère exquise i suppose many friends of the arniston family i thought there was some belief of lord melville losing his place that he may exchange it for another is very likely but i think the duke will not

nearer acquaintance i was more galled by some portion of continental manners than i had been at first so difficult is it for an american to correct his manner to our ideas of perfect goodbreeding390 i did all that was right however and asked miss ferrier whom he admires prodigiously to meet him at dinner hither came also a young friend so i have done the polite thing every way thomson also dined with us after dinner i gave my strangers an airing round the corstorphine hills and returned by the cramond road i sent to mr gibson cadells project for lammas which raises £15000 for a dividend of 3s to be then made i think the trustees should listen to this which is paying onehalf of my debt  july 2have assurances from john gibson that £15000 should be applied as i proposed if this can be repeated yearly up to 1835 the matter is ended and well ended yet woes me the public change their taste and their favourites get old yet if i was born in 1771 i shall only be sixty in 1831 and by the same reasoning sixtyfour in 1835 so i may rough it out yet be no sir robert preston at any rate it is all i have to trust to  i did a mornings task and was detained late at the court came home ate a hearty dinner slumbered after it in spite of my teeth and made a poor nights work of it ones mind gets so dissipated by the fagging yet insignificant business of the offices my release comes soon but i fear for a term only for i doubt if they will carry through the court bill  july 3my day began at seven as usual sir adam came to breakfast i read southeys edition of the pilgrims progress and think of reviewing the same i would i had books at hand to the court and remained till two then went to look at the drawings for repairing murthly the house of sir john or james stewart now building by gillespie graham and which he has planned after the fashion of james vis reign a kind of bastard grecian391very fanciful and pretty though read hones everyday book and with a better opinion of him than i expected from his antireligious frenzy we are to dine with the skenes today  which we did accordingly meeting mr and mrs strange lord forbes and other friends  july 4was a complete and serious day of work only interrupted in the evening by who with all the freedom and ease of continental manners gratified me with his gratuitous presence yet it might have been worse for his conversation is well enough but it is strange want of tact to suppose one must be alike welcome to a stranger at all hours of the day but i have stuffed the portfolio so do not grudge halfanhour  july 5i was up before seven and resumed my labours and by breakfasttime i had reached p 133 it may reach to 160 or 170 as i find space and matter buchanan392 came and wrote about fifteen of his pages equal to mine in proportion of three to one we are therefore about p 138 and in sight of land at two oclock went to bury poor george burnet the son of gilbert innes in as heavy a rain as i ever saw was in shandwick place again by four and made these entries i dine today with the club grant heaven it fair before six oclock  we met at barrys393 and had a gallant dinner but only few of our number was present alas sixty does not rally to such meetings with the alacrity of sixteen and our club has seen the space between these terms i was home and abed when charles arrived and waked me poor fellow he is doing very well with his rheumatic limbs  july 6i did little this morning but correct some sheets and was at the court all morning about two i called at mr cadells and i learned the dividend was arranged sir adam fell in with us and laid anchors to windward to get an invitation to cockenzie for next year being struck with my lifelike description of a tiled haddock i came home much fagged slept for halfanhour i dont like this lethargy read i promessi sposi and was idle miss kerr dined and gave us music  july 7this morning corrected proofs with which jb proceeds lazily enough and alleges printing reasons of which he has plenty at hand though it was the teind wednesday the devil would have it that this was a court of session day also for a cause of mine so there i sat hearing a dozen cases of augmentation of stipend pleaded and wondering within myself whether anything can be predicated of a scottish parish in which there cannot be discovered a reason for enlarging the endowments of the minister i returned after two with a sousing shower for companion i got very wet and very warm but shall we go mourn for that my dear394 i rather like a flaw of weather it shows something of the old man is left i had mr buchanan to help pack my papers and things and got through part of that unpleasant business  july 8i had my letters as usual but no proofs till i was just going out returning from the court met skene who brought me news that our visit was at an end for saturday poor colin having come to town very unwell i called to see him and found him suffering under a degree of slow palsy his spirits depressed and his looks miserable worse a great deal than when i last saw him his wife and daughter were in the room dreadfully distressed we spoke but a few words referring to recovery and better days which i suspect neither of us hoped395 for i looked only on the ghost of my friend of many a long day and he while he said to see me did him good must have had little thought of our meeting under better auspices we shall of course go straight to abbotsford instead of travelling by harcus as we intended  july 9two distressed damsels on my hands one a friend of harriet swinton translates from the italian a work on the plan of i promessi sposi but i fear she must not expect much from the trade a translation with them is a mere translationthat is a thing which can be made their own at a guinea per sheet and they will not have an excellent one at a higher rate second is miss young daughter of the excellent dr young of hawick if she can from her fathers letters and memoranda extract materials for a fair simple account of his life i would give my name as editor and i think it might do but for a large publicationpalabras neighbour dogberry396 the time is by dined

july 10rose rather late the champagne and turtle i suppose for our reform includes no fasting then poor ardwell came to breakfast then dr youngs daughter i have projected with cadell a plan of her fathers life to be edited by me398 if she does but tolerably she may have a fine thing of it next came the court where sixty judgments were pronounced and written by the clerks i hope all correctly though an error might well happen in such a crowd and one of the best men possible is beastly stupid be that as it may off came anne charles and i for abbotsford we started about two and the water being too deep didnt arrive till past seven dinner etc filled up the rest of the day  july 11 abbotsfordcorrected my proofs and the lave of it till about one oclock then started for a walk to

cooper aboard but he follows far behind no wonder galt poor fellow was in the kings bench when he wrote it no whetter of genius is necessity though said to be the mother of invention  july 12another wet day but i walked twice up and down the terrace and also wrote a handsome scrap of copy though mystified by the want of my books and so forth dr and mrs lockhart and violet came to luncheon and left us to drive on to peebles i read and loitered and longed to get my things in order got to work however at seven in the morning  july 13now what a thing it is to be an ass400 i have a letter from a certain young man of a sapient family announcing that his sister had so far mistaken my attentions as to suppose i was only prevented by modesty from stating certain wishes and hopes etc the party is a woman of rank so far my vanity may be satisfied but to think i would wish to appropriate a grim grenadier made to mount guard at st jamess the lord deliver me i excused myself with little picking upon the terms and there was no occasion for much delicacy in repelling such an attack  july 14the court of session bill is now committed in the house of lords so it fairly goes on this season and i have i suppose to look for my congé i can hardly form a notion of the possibility that i am not to return to edinburgh my clerk buchanan came here and assists me to finish the demonology letters and be dd to them but it is done to their hand two ladies mrs latouche of dublin and her niece miss boyle came to spend a day or two the aunt is a fine old lady the conversation that of a serious person frightened out of her wits by the violence and superstition of our workers of miracles in the west401 miss boyle is a pretty young woman rather quiet for an irish lass  july 16we visited at lessudden yesterday and took mrs latouche thither today as they had left us we went alone to major johns house of ravenswood and engaged a large party of cousins to dine tomorrow  in the evening a party of foreigners came around the door and going out i found le comte ladislaus de potocki a great name in poland with his lady and brotherinlaw so offered wine coffee tea etc the lady is strikingly pretty if such a woman as she had taken an affection for a lame baronet nigh sixty years old it would be worth speaking about i have finished the demonology402  july 17another bad day wet past all efforts to walk and threatening a very bad harvest persecuted with begging letters an authors pegasus is like a postchaise leaving the door of the inn the number of beggars is uncountable the language they hold of my character for charity makes my good reputation as troublesome as that of joseph surface403 a dinner of cousins the young laird of raeburn so he must be called though nearly as old as i am at their head his brother robert who has been in india for forty years excepting one short visit a fine manly fellow who has belled the cat with fortune and held her at bay as a man of mould may being all kinsmen and friends we made a merry day of our reunion all left at night  july 18      time runs i know not how away  here am i beginning the second week of my vacationthough what needs me note thatvacation and session will probably be the same to me in the future the long remove must then be looked to for the final signal to break up and that is a serious thought  i have corrected two sets of proofs one for the mail another for the blucher tomorrow       no entry between july 18 and september 5       mr lockhart remarks that it was during this interval that the      highest point of his recovery was reached the following little      note accompanied the review of southeys bunyan to chiefswood on      august 6th       dear lockhart i send you the enclosed i intended to have brought

case is so      well known to your grace that i would be greatly to blame if i      enlarged upon it his morals are irreproachable his talents very      respectable he has some oddity of manner but it is far from      attaching to either the head or the heart       it would be felt by me among one of the deepest obligations of the      many which i owe to the house of buccleuch i daresay your grace

letter  dear skenei observe from the papers that our invaluable friend is no more i have reason to think that as i surmised when i saw him last the interval has been a melancholy one at least to those who had to watch the progress i never expected to see his kind face more after i took leave of him in charlotte square yet the certainty that such must be the case is still a painful shock as i can never hope again to meet during the remaining span of my own life a friend in whom high talents for the business of life were more happily mingled with all those affections which form the dearest part of human intercourse in that respect i believe his like hardly is to be found i hope mrs skene and you will make my assurance of deep sympathy of which they know it is expressed by a friend of poor colin of fifty years standing  i hope my young friend his son will keep his fathers example before his eyes his best friend cannot wish him a better model  i am just setting off to the west for a longpromised tour of a week i shall be at abbotsford after monday 27th current and i hope mrs skene and you with some of our young friends will do us the pleasure to come here for a few days we see how separations may happen among friends and should not neglect the opportunity of being together while we can besides entre nous it is time to think what is to be done about the society as the time of my retirement draws nigh and i am determined at whatever loss not to drag out the last sands of my life in that sandcart of a place the parliament house i think it hurt poor colin this is however subject for future consideration as i have not breathed a syllable about resigning the chair to any one but it must soon follow as a matter of coursec  should you think of writing to let me know how

have left my diary for some weeks i cannot tell why we have had the usual number of travelling counts and countesses yankees male and female and a yankeedoodledandy into the bargain a smart young virginia man we have had friends of our own also the miss ardens young mrs morritt and anne morritt most agreeable visitors404 cadell came out here yesterday with his horn filled with good news this will in effect put an end to the trust only the sales and produce must be pledged to insure the last £15000 and the annuity interest of £600 in this way mr cadell will become halfpartner in the remaining volumes of the books following st ronans with all my heart but he must pay well for it for it is good property neither is any value stated for literary profits yet four years should have four novels betwixt 18304 this at £2500 per volume might be £8000 which would diminish mr cadells advance considerably all this seems feasible enough so my fits of sullen alarm are ill placed it makes me care less about the terms i retire upon the efforts by which we have advanced thus far are new in literature and what is gained is secure       no entry between september 5 and december 20   footnotes  404 sir walter had written to morritt on his retirement from the court of session and his old friend responded in the following cordial letter  november 1830  my dear scott i am sorry to read what you tell me of your lameness but legs are not so obedient to many of us at our age as they were twenty years ago non immunes ab illis malis sumus as the learned partridge and lillys grammar tells us i find mine swell and am forced to bandage and should not exert them with impunity in walking as i used to do either in long walks or in rough ground i am glad however you have escaped from the court of session even at the risk of sometimes feeling the want you allude to of winter society you think you shall tire of solitude in these months and in spite of books and the love of them i have discovered by experience the possibility of such a feeling but can we not in some degree remedy this why should we both be within two days march of each other and not sometimes together as of old how i have enjoyed in your house the summum bonum of sir wm temples philosophy something which is not home and yet with the liberty of home which is not solitude and yet hath the ease of solitude and which is only found in the house of an old friend our summer months are well provided with summer friends you have plenty and to spare of sightseers lions and their hunters and i have travellers moorshooters etc in equal abundance but now when the country is abandoned and walter is leaving you how i wish you would bring dear anne and partake for a while our little circle herewe stir not till christmasif before that time such a pleasure could be attainable well then for auld lang syne will you not now that the session has no claim on you combine our forces against the possibility of ennui if you will do this i will positively and in good faith hold myself in readiness to do as much by you in the next november and in every alternate november nor shall the month ever pass without bringing us together do not tell me as wm rose would not fail to do if i gave him so good an opportunity that my proposal would be a greater bore than the solitude it destroyed it shall be no such thing but only the trouble of a journey i feel too as i grow older the vis inertiæ and fancy that locomotion is more difficult but let us abjure the doctrine for it baulks much pleasure praypray as the children saycome to us think of it first as not impossible then weigh fairly the objections and if they resolve themselves into mere aversion to change overcome them by an assurance that the very change will give value to the resumption of your home avocations if i plead thus strongly perhaps it is because i feel the advantage to myself time has made gaps in the list of old friends as in yours young ones though very cheering and useful are not and cannot be the same i enjoy them too when present but in absence i regret the others what remains but to make the most of those we have still left when both body and mind permit us to enjoy them i have books also a room that shall be your own and a pony off which i can shoot which i will engage shall neither tumble himself or allow you to tumble in any excursion on which you may venture dear anne will find and make my womenkind as happy as you will make me and we have only to beg you to stay long and be most cordially welcome  adieu dear scott i fear you will not come for all i can say i could almost lose a tooth or a finger if it were necessary to find myself mistaken come and come soon stay long be assured of welcome  all unite in this and in love to you and anne with your assured friend  jb morritt     december   december 20from september 5 to december 20 is a long gap and i have seen plenty of things worth recollecting had i marked them down when they were gliding past but the time has gone by when i feel capable of taking it up i will  little self will jostle out everything else and my affairs which in some respects are excellent in others like the way of the world are far from being pleasant  of good i have the pleasure of saying i have my children well and in good health the dividend of 3s in the pound has been made to the creditors and the creditors have testified their sense of my labours by surrendering my books furniture plate and curiosities i see some friends of mine think this is not handsomely done in my opinion it is extremely so there are few things so easy as to criticise the good things one does and to show that we ourselves would have done more handsomely but those who know the world and their own nature are always better pleased with one kind action carried through and executed than with twenty that only glide through their minds while perhaps they tickle the imagination of the benevolent barmecide who supposes both the entertainment and the eater these articles do not amount to less than £10000 at least and without dispensing with them entirely might furnish me with a fund for my younger children405 now suppose these creditors had not seriously carried their purpose into execution the transaction might have been afterwards challenged and the ease of mind which it produced to me must have been uncertain in comparison well onehalf of these claims are cleared off furnished in a great measure by onehalf issue of the present edition of the waverley novels which had reached the 20th of the series  it cannot be expected that twenty more will run off so fast the later volumes are less favourites and are really less interesting yet when i read them over again since their composition i own i found them considerably better than i expected and i think if other circumstances do not crush them and blight their popularity they will make their way mr cadell is still desirous to acquire onehalf of the property of this part of the work which is chiefly my own he proposes assembling all my detached works of fiction and articles in annuals so that the whole supposing i write as is proposed six new volumes will run the collection to fifty when it is time to close it between cash advanced on this property and a profit on the sale of the second part mr cadell thinks having taken a year or two years time to gather a little wind into the bag i will be able to pay on my part a further sum of £30000 or the moiety remaining of the whole debts amounting now to less than £60000  should this happy period arrive in or about the year 1832 the heavy work will be wellnigh finished tor although £30000 will still remain yet there is £20000 actually secured upon my life and the remaining £10000 is set against the sale of waverley which shall have been issued besides which there is the whole poetry bonaparte and several other articles equally available in a short time to pay up the balance and afford a very large reversion  this view cannot be absolutely certain but it is highly probable and is calculated in the manner in which building schemes are dealt with and is not merely visionary the year 1833 may probably see me again in possession of my estate  a circumstance of great consequence to my habits and comforts was my being released from the court of session on november 1830 18th day my salary which was £1300 was reduced to £840 my friends just then leaving office were desirous to patch up the deficiency with a pension i do not see well how they could do this without being exposed to obloquy which they shall not be on my account besides though £500 a year is a round sum yet i would rather be independent than i would have it  my kind friend the lord chief commissioner offered to interfere to have me named a privy councillor but besides that when one is poor he ought to avoid taking rank i would be much happier if i thought any act of kindness was done to help forward charles and having said so much i made my bow and declared my purpose of remaining satisfied with the article of my knighthood and here i am for the rest of my life i suppose with a competent income which i can increase  all this is rather pleasing nor have i the least doubt that i could make myself easy by literary labour but much of it looks like winding up my bottom for the rest of my life but there is a worse symptom of settling accounts of which i have felt some signs  last spring miss young the daughter of dr young had occasion to call on me on some business in which i had hopes of serving her as i endeavoured to explain to her what i had to say i had the horror to find i could not make myself understood i stammered stuttered said one word in place of anotherdid all but speak miss young went away frightened enough poor thing and anne and violet lockhart were much alarmed i was bled with cuppingglasses took medicine and lived on panada but in two or three days i was well again the physicians thought or said at least that the evil was from the stomach it is very certain that i have seemed to speak with an impediment and i was or it might be fancied myself troubled with a mispronouncing and hesitation i felt this particularly at the election and sometimes in society this went on till last november when lord  came out to make me a visit i had for a long time taken only one tumbler of whisky and water without the slightest reinforcement this night i took a very little drop not so much as a bumper glass of whisky altogether it made no difference on my head that i could discover but when i went to the dressingroom i sank stupefied on the floor i lay a minute or twowas not found luckily gathered myself up and got to my bed i was alarmed at this second warning consulted abercrombie and ross and got a few restrictive orders as to diet i am forced to attend to them for as mrs cole says lackaday a thimbleful oversets me  to add to these feelings i have the constant increase of my lameness the thighjoint kneejoint and anklejoint  december 21i walk with great pain in the whole limb and am at every minute during an hours walk reminded of my mortality i should not care for all this if i was sure of dying handsomely cadells calculations would be sufficiently firm though the author of waverly had pulled on his last nightcap nay they might be even more trustworthy if remains and memoirs and such like were to give a zest to the posthumous but the fear is the blow be not sufficient to destroy life and that i should linger on an idiot and a show406  we parted on good terms and hopes407 but fall back fall edge nothing shall induce me to publish what i do not think advantageous to the community or suppress what is  december 23to add for this day to the evil thereof i am obliged to hold a blackfishing court at selkirk this is always a very unpopular matter in one of our counties as the salmon never do get up to the heads of the waters in wholesome season and are there in numbers in spawningtime so that for several years during the late period the gentry finding no advantage from preserving the spawning fish neglected the matter altogether in a kind of dudgeon and the peasantry laid them waste at their will as the property is very valuable the proprietors down the country agreed to afford some additional passage for fish when the river is open providing they will protect the spawning fish during closetime a new act has been passed with heavy penalties and summary powers of recovery some persons are cited under it today and a peculiar licence of poaching having distinguished the district of late years we shall be likely to have some disturbance they have been holding a meeting for reform in selkirk and it will be difficult to teach them that this consists in anything else save the privilege of obeying only such laws as please them we shall see but i would have counselled the matter to have been delayed for a little season i shall do my duty however do what is right come what will  six blackfishers were tried four were condemned all went very quietly till the conclusion when one of the criminals attempted to break out i stopped him for the time with my own hand408 but after removing him from the courthouse to the jail he broke from the officers who are poor feeble old men the very caricature of peace officers  december 24this morning my old acquaintance and good friend miss bell ferguson died after a short illness an old friend and a woman of the most excellent condition the last two or almost three years were very sickly  a bitter cold day anne drove me over to huntly burn to see the family i found colonel ferguson and captain john rn in deep affliction expecting sir adam hourly anne sets off to mertoun and i remain alone i wrote to walter about the project of making my succession in movables jb sent me praises of the work i am busy with409 but i suspect a little supercherie though he protests not he is going to the country without sending me the political article but he shall either set up or return it as i wont be tutored by any one in what i do or forbear  december 25i have sketched a political article on a union of tories and an income tax but i will not show my teeth if i find i cannot bite arrived at mertoun and found with the family sir john pringle

purchaser of his grandfathers valuable library which was collected by popes lord marchmont part of it is a very valuable collection of tracts during the great civil war i spent several hours in turning them over but i could not look them through with any accuracy i passed my time very pleasantly and made some extracts however and will resume my research another day  major pringle repeated some pretty verses of his own composing  i had never a more decided inclination to go loose yet i know i had better keep quiet  december 27 abbotsfordcommences snow and extremely bitter cold when i returned from mertoun halffrozen i took up the magnum and began to notify the romance called woodstock in which i got some assistance from hardens ancient tracts i ought rather to get on with robert

magnum work i the day was indeed broken great part having been employed in the return from mertoun  december 28drove down to huntly burn sir adam very melancholy the death of his sister having come with a particular and shocking surprise upon him after halfanhours visit i returned and resumed the magnum  december 29attended poor miss bell fergusons funeral i sat by the rev mr thomson though ten years younger than me i found the barrier between him and me much broken down we remember it though with more or less accuracy we took the same old persons for subjects of correspondence of feeling and sentiment the difference of ten years is little after sixty has passed in a cold day i saw poor bell laid in her cold bed life never parted with a less effort letter from cadell offering to advance on second series french tales this will come in good time and keep me easy he proposes views for the magnum i fear politics may disappoint them  december 30meeting at selkirk today about the new road to galashiels it was the largest meeting i ever saw in selkirkshire we gain the victory by no less than 14 to 4 i was named one of the committee to carry the matter on so in gaining my

particulars of which are given in the life vol x pp 6 1017 2123 but they found their host much better than they had ventured to anticipate and he made the gift of his library the chief subject of

cannot say the world opens pleasantly with me this new year i will strike the balance there are many things for which i have reason to be thankful  firstcadells plans seem to have succeeded and he augurs well as to the next two years reckoning £30000 on the stuff now on hand and £20000 on the insurance money and £10000 to be borrowed somehow this will bring us wonderfully home  secondcadell is of opinion if i meddle in politics and i am strongly tempted to do so i shall break the milkpail and threatens me with the fate of basil hall who as he says destroyed his reputation by writing impolitic politics well it would be my risk and if i can do some good which i rather think i can is it right or manly to keep myself back  thirdi feel myself decidedly weaker in point of health and am now confirmed i have had a paralytic touch i speak and read with embarrassment and even my handwriting seems to stammer this general failure      with mortal crisis doth portend     my days to appropinque an end410  i am not solicitous about this only if i were worthy i would pray god for a sudden death and no interregnum between i cease to exercise reason and i cease to exist  the scotts of harden pringles of stitchill and russells of ashestiel are all here i am scarce fit for company though  january 2held a great palaver with the scotts etc  i find my language apt to fail me but this is very like to be fancy and i must be cautious of giving way to it this cautions me against public exertion much more than cadells prognostications which my blood rises against and which are ill calculated to keep me in restraint we dozed through a gloomy day being the dullest of all possible thaws  january 3i had a letter from the lord chief commissioner mentioning the kings intention to take care of charless interests and promotion in the foreign office an additional reason why i should not plunge rashly into politics yet not one which i can understand as putting a padlock on my lips neither i may write to lcc that i may be called on to express an opinion on the impending changes that i have an opinion and a strong one and that i hope this fresh favour may not be regarded as padlocking my lips at a time when it would otherwise be proper to me to speak or write i am shocked to find that i have not the faculty of delivering myself with facilityan embarrassment which may be fanciful but is altogether as annoying as if real  january 4a base gloomy day and dispiriting in proportion i walked out with swanston411 for about an hour everything gloomy as the back of the chimney when there is no fire in it my walk was a melancholy one feeling myself weaker at every step and not very able to speak this surely cannot be fancy yet it looks something like it if i knew but the extent at which my inability was like to stop but every day is worse than another i have trifled much time too much i must try to get afloat tomorrow perhaps getting an amanuensis might spur me on for onehalf is nerves it is a sad business though  january 5very indifferent with more awkward feelings than i can well bear up against my voice sunk and my head strangely confused when i begin to form my ideas for conversation expressions fail me even in private conversation yet in solitude they are sufficiently arranged i incline to hold that these ugly symptoms are the work of imagination but as dr adam ferguson412 a firm man if ever there was one in the world said on such an occasion what is worse than imagination as anne was vexed and frightened i allowed her to send for young clarkson of course he could tell but little save what i knew before  january 6a letter from henry scott about the taking ground for keeping the reform in scotland upon the scottish principles i will write him my private sentiments but avoid being a boutefeu  go this day to selkirk where i found about 120 and more persons of that burgh and galashiels who were sworn in as special constables enough to maintain the peace what shocked me particularly was the weakness of my voice and the confusion of my head attempting to address them which was really a poor affair on my return i found the rev mr milne of quebec a friend of my sisterinlaw another time would have been better for company but captain john ferguson and mr laidlaw coming in to dinner we got over the day well enough  january 7a fine frosty day and my spirits lighter i have a letter of great comfort from walter who in a manly handsome and dutiful manner expressed his desire to possess the library and movables of every kind at abbotsford with such a valuation laid upon them as i choose to impose this removes the only delay to making my will supposing the literary property to clear the debts by aid of insurances and other things about 1835 it will come into my person and i will appoint the whole to work off the heritable debt of £10000 if the literary property can produce that sum besides what it has already done i would convey it to the three younger children  january 8spent much time in writing instructions for my last will and testament sent off parcel by dr milne who leaves today have up two boys for shoplifting remained at galashiels till four oclock and returned starved could work none and was idle all eveningtry tomorrow for a workday so loiter on  january 10went over to galashiels and was busied the whole time till three oclock about a petty thieving affair and had before me a pair of gallowsbirds to whom i could say nothing for total want of proof except like the sapient elbow thou shalt continue there know thou thou shalt continue413 a little gallow brood they were and their fate will catch them sleepy idle and exhausted on this wrought little or none in the evening  wrote a long letter to henry scott who is a fine fellow and what i call a heart of gold he has sound parts good sense and is a true man also i wrote to my excellent friend the lord chief commissioner i thought it right to say that i accepted with gratitude his majestys goodness but trusted it was not to bind me to keep my fingers from pen and ink should a notion impress me that i could help the country i walked a little to my exceeding refreshment i am using that family ungratefully but i will not for a punctilio avoid binding if i can a strong party together for the king and country and if i see i can do anything or have a chance of it i will not fear for the skincutting it is the selfishness of this generation that drives me mad      a hundred pounds     ha thou hast touched me nearly  i will get a parcel copied tomorrow wrote several letters at night  january 11wrote and sent off three of my own pages in the morning then walked with swanston i tried to write before dinner but with drowsiness and pain in my head made little way my friend will laidlaw came in to dinner and after dinner kindly offered his services as amanuensis too happy was i and i immediately plunged him into the depths of count robert so we got on three or four pages worth perhaps double the number of print i hope it did not take him too short but after all to keep the press going without an amanuensis is impossible and the publishers may well pay a sponsible person he comes back tomorrow it eases many of my anxieties and i will stick to it i really think mr laidlaw is pleased with the engagement for the time sent off six close pages  january 12i have a visit from mr macdonald the sculptor who wishes to model a head of me he is a gentlemanlike man and pleasant as most sculptors and artists of reputation are yet it is an awful tax upon time i must manage to dictate while he models which will do well enough  so there we sat for three hours or four i sitting on a stool mounted on a packingbox for the greater advantage macdonald modelling and plastering away and i dictating without interval to goodnatured will laidlaw who wrought without intermission it is natural to ask do i progress but this is too feverish a question a man carries no scales about him to ascertain his own value i always remember the prayer of virgils sailor in extremity      non jam prima peto mnestheus neque vincere certo     quamquam osed superent quibus hoc neptune dedisti     extremos pudeat rediisse hoc vincite cives     et prohibete nefas414   we must to our oar but i think this and another are all that even success would prompt me to write and surely those that have been my defenders      have they so long held out with me untired     and stop they now for breath well be it so415  january 13went to selkirk on the business of the new high road i perceive whytbank and my cousin colonel russell of ashestiel are disposed to peep into the expenses of next years outlay which must be provided by loan this will probably breed strife wrote a hint of this to charles balfour agreed with smith so far as contracting for the bridges at £1200 each i suspect we are something like the good manager who distressed herself with buying bargains  january 15gave the morning from ten till near two to mr macdonald who is proceeding admirably with his bust it is bloody cold work but he is an enthusiast and much interested besides i can sit and dictate owing to mr laidlaw and so get forward while i am advancing lorenzo di guasco which is his travelling name i wrote several letters too and got through some business walked and took some exercise between one and three  january 16being sunday read prayers mr and mrs james416 go to look for a house which they desire to take in this country as anne is ill the presence of strangers though they are pleasant is rather annoying macdonald continues working to form a new bust out of my old scalp i think it will be the last sitting which i will be enticed to thanks to heaven the work finishes tomorrow417  january 17this morning when i came downstairs i found mr macdonald slabbering away at the model he has certainly great enthusiasm about his profession which is a sine qua non it was not till twelve that a postchaise carried off my three friends  i had wrote two hours when dr turner came in and i had to unfold my own complaints i was sick of these interruptions and dismissed mr laidlaw having no hope of resuming my theme with spirit god send me more leisure and fewer friends to peck it away by teaspoonfuls  another fool sends to entreat an autograph which he should be ashamed in civility to ask as i am to deny it i got notice of poor henry mackenzies death he has long maintained a niche in scottish literaturegayest of the gay though most sensitive of the sentimental  january 18came down from my bedroom at eight and took a rummage in the way of putting things to rights dictated to laidlaw till about one oclock during which time it was rainy afterwards i walked sliding about in the mud and very uncomfortable in fact there is no mistaking the three sufficients418 and fate is now straitening its circumvallations round me little likely to be better than i am i am heartwhole as a biscuit and may last on as now for eight or ten years the thing is not uncommon considering i am only in my sixtieth year i cannot walk but the intense cold weather may be to blame in this my riding is but a scramble but it may do well enough for exercise and though it is unpleasant to find ones enjoyment of hill and vale so much abridged yet still when i enjoy my books and am without acute pain i have but little to complain of considering the life i have led so long                so hap what may     time and the hour run through the roughest day419  mr laidlaw came down at ten and we wrought till one this should be a good thing for an excellent man and is an important thing to me as it saves both my eyesight and nerves which last are cruelly affected by finding those who look out of the windows grow gradually darker and darker420 rode out or more properly was carried out into the woods to see the course of a new road which may serve to carry off the thinnings of the trees and for rides it is very well lined and will serve both for beauty and convenience mr laidlaw engages to come back to dinner and finish two or three more pages met my agreeable and ladylike neighbour mrs brewster on my pony and i was actually ashamed to be seen by her      sir dennis brand and on so poor a steed421  i believe detestable folly of this kind is the very last that leaves us one would have thought i ought to have little vanity at this time o day but it is an abiding appurtenance of the old adam and i write for penance what like a fool i actually felt  january 19wrote on by mr laidlaws assistance things go bobbishly enough we have a good deal finished before dinner henry scott comes to dine with me visàvis and we have a grand dish of politics the friends of old scotland want but a signal a certain great lawyer says that if sir ws wrote another malachi it would set more men on fire than a dozen associations this almost tempts me but the canny lad says moreover that to appeal to national partiality ie that you should call on scotsmen to act like scotsmen is unfair and he would be sorry it was known he late and future placeman should encourage such pawpaw doings yet if sir ws could be got to stand forlorn hope the legal gentleman would suggest etc etc suggest and be dd sir ws knows when to doff his bonnet and when to cock it in the face of all and sundry moreover he will not be made a catspaw of look you now  january 20wrought all morning a monstrous packet of letters at midday borrow honest laidlaws fingers in the evening i hope his pay will recompense him it is better than grieveing or playing triptolemus422 should be if i am hardworking 100 guineas which with his house cow and free rent would save i believe some painful thoughts to him and his amiable wife and children we will see how the matter fudges almost finished the first volume  january 21james ballantyne in ecstasies at our plan of an amanuensis i myself am sensible that my fingers begin to stammerthat is to write one word instead of another very often i impute this to fancy the terrible agency of which is too visible in my illness and it encourages me to hope the fatal warning is yet deferred i feel lighter by a million ton since i made this discovery if i can dictate freely and without hesitation my fear to speak at the meeting about the road was vain terror and so andiamo caracci wrote some letters this afternoon  january 22mr laidlaw rather late of coming one of his daughters has been ill and he is an approved physician pity when one so gifted employs his skill on himself and family for all patients we got on however to page 46  january 23i wrought a little today walked to chiefswood or rather from it as far only as habbies howe came home cold indeed but hearty slept after dinner i think the peep real or imaginary at the gates of death has given me firmness not to mind little afflictions i have jumbled this and the preceding day strangely when i went to chiefswood and huntly burn i thought this a weekday  january 24worked with mr laidlaw and as the snow was on the ground did so without intermission which must be sinking to the spirits held on however  january 25same drizzling waste rendering my footing insecure and leaving me no refuge but in sitting at home and working till one oclock then retired upon the sheriff court processes bran423 poor fellow lies yawning at my feet and cannot think what is become of the daily scamper which is all his masters inability affords him this grieves me by calling back the days of old but i may call them as i may      youth winna return nor the days of lang syne  january 26i have skene and mr mculloch of ardwell to the relief of my spirits and the diminishing of my time mr laidlaw joined us at dinner  bitter cold  january 27so fagged with my frozen vigils that i slept till after ten when i lose the first two hours in the morning i can seldom catch them again during the whole day  a friendly visit from ebenezer clarkson of selkirk a medical gentleman in whose experience and ingenuity i have much confidence as well as his personal regard for myself he is quite sensible of the hesitation of speech of which i complain and thinks it arises from the stomach recommends the wild mustard as an aperient but the brightest ray of hope is the chance that i may get some mechanical aid made by fortune at broughton street which may enable me to mount a pony with ease and to walk without torture this would indeed be almost a restoration of my youth at least of a green old age full of enjoyment the shutting one out from the face of living nature is almost worse than sudden death  january 28i wrote with laidlaw it does not work clear i do not know why the plot is nevertheless a good plot and full of expectation424 but there is a cloud over me i think and interruptions are frequent i creep on however  january 29much in the same way as yesterday rather feeling than making way mr williams and his brother came in after dinner welcome both yet the day was not happy it consumed me an afternoon which though well employed and pleasantly had the disagreeable effect of my being kept from useful work  january 30snow deep which makes me alter my purpose of going to town tomorrow for today my friends must amuse themselves as they can  january 31 to february 9 edinburghretain my purpose however and set out for edinburgh alonethat is no one but my servant the snow became impassable and in edinburgh i remain immovably fixed for ten daysthat is till wednesdaynever once getting out of doors save to dinner when i went and returned in a sedan chair i commenced my quarantine in mackenzies hotel425 where i was deadly cold and it was tolerably noisy the second day mr cadell made a point of my coming to his excellent house where i had no less excellent an apartment and the most kind treatment that is not making a show of me for which i was in but bad tune426 the physical folks abercrombie and ross bled me with cuppingglasses purged me confoundedly and restricted me of all creature comforts but they did me good as i am sure they meant to do sincerely and i got rid of a giddy feeling which i have been plagued with and have certainly returned much better i did not neglect my testamentary affairs i executed my last will leaving walter burdened by his own choice with £1000 to sophia and another received at her marriage and £2000 to anne and the same to charles he is to advance them money if they want it if not to pay them interest which is his own choice otherwise i would have sold the books and rattletraps i have made provisions for clearing my estate by my publications should it be possible and should that prove possible from the time of such clearance being effected to be a fund available to all my children who shall be alive or leave representatives my bequests must many of them seem hypothetical but the thing being uncertain must be so stated  besides during the unexpected stay in town i employed mr fortune an ingenious artist427 to make a machine to assist my lame legan odd enough purchase to be made at this time of day yet who would not purchase ease i dined with the lord chief commissioner with the skenes twice with lord medwyn and was as happy as anxiety about my daughter would permit me  the appearance of the streets was most desolate the hackneycoaches with four horses strolling about like ghosts the footpassengers few but the lowest of the people  i wrote a good deal of count robert yet i cannot tell why my pen stammers egregiously and i write horridly incorrect i long to have friend laidlaws assistance  footnotes  410 hudibras  411 john swanston a forester at abbotsford who did

tells us that when no 39 castle street was displenished in 1826 scott sent him the fulllength portrait of himself by raeburn now at abbotsford saying that he did not hesitate to claim his protection for the picture which was threatened to be paraded under the hammer of the auctioneer and he felt that his interposition to turn aside that buffet might admit of being justified as a piece of successful art many might fancy the acquisition but for the sake of the original he knew no refuge where it was likely to find a truer welcome the picture accordingly remained many years in my possession but when his health had begun to break and the plan of his going abroad was proposed i thought it would be proper to return the picture for which purpose i had a most successful copy made

what must be said with painful feeling and you would be vexed with reading  one thing i will put to rights with all others respecting my little personal affairs i am putting in order this house with what it contains and as walter will probably be anxious to have a memorial of my better days i intend to beg you and my dear mrs skene  to have it the picture copied by such an artist as you should approve of to supply the blank which must then be made on your hospitable walls with the shadow of a shade if the opportunity should occur of copying the picture to your mind i will be happy to have the copy as soon as possible you must not think that i am nervous or foolishly apprehensive that i take these precautions they are necessary and right and if one puts off too long we sometimes are

the haugh covered with water dogs pigs cows to say nothing of human beings all who slept at the offices in danger of being drowned they came up to the mansionhouse about midnight with such various clamour that anne thought the house was attacked by captain swing and all the radicals  february 10i set to work with mr laidlaw and had after that a capital ride my pony little used was somewhat frisky but i rode on to huntly burn began my diet on my new régime and like it well especially porridge to supper it is wonderful how old tastes rise  february 11wrought again today and john swanston walked with me wrote many letters and sent copy to ballantyne rode as usual it is well enough to ride every day but confoundedly tiresome to write it down  february 13i did not ask down mr laidlaw thinking it fair to spare his sunday i had a day of putting to rights a disagreeable work which must be done i took the occasion to tell mr cadell that malachi will break forth again but i will not make a point of it with him i do not fear there will be as many to strike up as to strike down and i have a strong notion we may gain the day i have a letter from the duchess of wellington asking a copy of melvilles memoirs she shall have it if it were my last  february 14i had hardly begun my letter to mr cadell than i began also to pull in resolution428 i considered that i had no means of retreat and that in all my sober moments meaning my unpassionate ones for the doctors have taken from me the means of producing dutch courage i have looked on political writing as a false step and especially now when i have a good deal at stake so upon the whole i cancelled the letter announcing the publication if this was actually meanness it is a foible nobody knows of anne set off for edinburgh after breakfast poor girl she is very nervous i wrote with mr l till onethen had a walk till threethen wrote this diary till four must try to get something for mr laidlaw for i am afraid i am twaddling i do not think my head is weakened but a strange vacillation makes me suspect is it not thus that men begin to fail becoming as it were infirm of purpose       that way madness lies let me shun that     no more of that 429  yet why be a child about it what must be will be  february 15i wrote and corrected through the long day till one oclock then rode out as far as dr scotts and called on him got a fresh dose of proofs at mathiesons and returned home at nine oclock at night had a card from miss bell maclachlan wishing to speak to me about some highland music wrote for answer i knew nothing of the matter but would be happy to see mrs and miss bell to breakfast i had a letter of introduction by robert chambers which i declined being then unwell but as trotter of braid said the ladies maun come  february 16mrs and miss bell maclachlan of the west highlands mother and daughter made their way to me to breakfast i did not wish to see them being strangers but she is very prettythat is the daughterand enthusiastic and that is always flattering to an old gentleman she wishes to have words to celtic melodies and i have promised her some to the air of crochallan and incline to do her good perhaps to the extent of getting her words from lord francis leveson gower lockhart and one or two others we parted she pleased with my willing patronage and i with an uncommon handsome countenance she showed me  this detained mr laidlaw re infecta and before i had written a page the pony came to the door but wrote something after dinner  february 17 and 18we had the usual course of food study and exercise in the forenoon was extremely sleepy in the afternoon which made i fear but bad work we progress however in riding met sir adam ferguson and asked him and his brother the colonel to dinner tomorrow wrote in the meantime as usual  february 19plagued by the stay for leg starting a screw bolt which is very inconvenient sent off this morning proofs as far as end of first volume and 20 manuscript pages equal to about a quarter of the second is it good or not i cannot say i think it better as it goes on and so far so good i am certain i have written worse abomination as john ballantyne poor fellow used to say  february 20wrote five pages this morning then rode out to the hill and looked at some newly planted rather transplanted trees mr laidlaw gone for the day i trust i shall have proofs to correct in the meantime i may suck my paws and prepare some copy or rather assemble the raw material  february 21i made up parcels by mailcoach and blucher to go tomorrowsecond volume redgauntlet at one fetched a walk through wet and dry looking at the ravages of the late flood after i came in till two hours after teatime busied with the sheriff court processes which i have nearly finished after this i will lounge over my annotating the tales of the crusades come next  february 22wrought with mr l from ten to three then took the pony carriage with the purpose of going to chiefswood but a heavy squall came on with snow so we put aboutship and returned read lytteltons history of england to get some notes for crusaders vol i after dinner mr laidlaw from six to eight sent off six pages  february 23 24 25these three days i can hardly be said to have varied from my ordinary  rose at seven dressed before eight wrote letters or did any little business till a quarter past nine then breakfast mr laidlaw comes from ten till one then take the pony and ride quantum mutatus two or three miles john swanston walking by my bridlerein lest i fall off come home about three or four then to dinner on a single plain dish and half a tumbler or byr lady threefourths of a tumbler of whisky and water then sit till six oclock when enter mr laidlaw again and work commonly till eight after this work usually alone till halfpast nine then sup on porridge and milk and so to bed the work is half done if any one asks what time i take to think on the composition i might say in one point of view it was seldom five minutes out of my head the whole day in another light it was never the serious subject of consideration at all for it never occupied my thoughts entirely for five minutes together except when i was dictating to mr laidlaw  february 26went through the same routine only being saturday mr laidlaw does not come in the evening i think there is truth in the wellknown phrase aurora musis amica i always have a visit of invention between six and seventhat is if anything has been plaguing me in the way of explanation i find it in my head when i wake i have need of it tonight  february 27being saturday no mr laidlaw came yesterday evening nor today being sunday truth is i begin to fear i was working too hard and gave myself to putting things in order and working at the magnum and reading stupid german novels in hopes a thought will strike me when i am half occupied with other things in fact i am like the servant in the clandestine marriage430 who assures his mistress he always watches best with his eyes shut  february 28past ten and mr laidlaw the model of a clerk in other respects is not come yet he has never known the value of time so is not quite accurate in punctuality but that i hope will come if i can drill him to it without hurting him i think i hear him coming i am like the poor wizard who is first puzzled how to raise the devil and then how to employ him but vogue la galère worked till one then walked with great difficulty and pain till halfpast two i think i can hardly stir without my pony which is a sad pity mr laidlaw dines here  footnotes  428 macbeth act v sc 5  429 lear act iii sc 4  430 colman the elder     march   march 1 2 3all these three days i wrote forenoon and fagged afternoon kept up the ball indifferent well but began to tire on the third and suspected that i was flata dreary suspicion not easily chased away when once it takes root  march 4laid aside the novel and began with vigour a review of robsons essay on heraldry431 but i missed some quotations which i could not get on without i gave up and took such a rash ride nowadays returned home and found colonel russell there on a visit then we had dinner and afterwards the making up this miserable journal  march 5i have a letter from our member whytbank adjuring me to assist the gentlemen of the county with an address against the reform bill which menaces them with being blended with peeblesshire and losing of consequence one half of their franchise mr pringle conjures me not to be very nice in choosing my epithets mr pringle torwoodlee comes over and speaks to the same purpose adding it will be the greatest service i can do the county etc this in a manner drives me out of a resolution to keep myself clear of politics and let them fight dog fight bear but i am too easy to be persuaded to bear a hand the young duke of buccleuch comes to visit me also so i promised to shake my duds and give them a cast of my calling fall back fall edge  march 710in these four days i drew up with much anxiety an address reprobatory of the bill both with respect to selkirkshire and in its general purport i was not mealymouthed and those who heard the beginning could hardly avoid listening to the end it was certainly in my best style and would have made a deal of noise from the uncompromising style it would have attracted attention mr laidlaw though he is on tother side on the subject thinks it the best thing i ever wrote and i myself am happy to find that it cannot be said to smell of the apoplexy the pointed passages were on the contrary clever and well put but it was too declamatory too much like a pamphlet and went far too generally into opposition to please the country gentlemen who are timidly inclined to dwell on their own grievances rather than the public wrongs  march 11this day we had our meeting at selkirk i found borthwickbrae late member had sent the form of an address which was finished by mr andrew lang432 it was the reverse of mine in every respect it was short and to the point it only contained a remonstrance against the incorporation with peeblesshire and left it to be inferred that they approved the bill in other respects433 as i saw that it met the ideas of the meeting six in number better by far than such an address as mine i instantly put it in my pocket but i endeavoured to add to their complaint of a private wrong a general clause stating their sense of the hazard of passing a bill full of such violent innovations at once on the public but though harden alva and torwoodlee voted for this measure it was refused by the rest of the meeting to my disappointment since in its present state it will not be attended to and is in fact too milkandwater to attract notice i am however personally out of the scrape i was a fool to stir such a mess of skimmed milk with so honourable an action434 if some of the gentlemen of the press get hold of this story what would they make of it and how little would i care one thing is clear it gives me a right to decline future interference and let the world wag sessa435  march 12wrote the history of my four days labour in vain to sandy pringle whytbank and so transeat with cæteris erroribus i only gave way to one jest a ratcatcher was desirous to come and complete his labours in my house and i who thought he only talked and laughed with the servants recommended him to go to the head courts and meetings of freeholders where he would find rats in plenty  march 13i have finally arranged a thorny transaction mr cadell has an interest in some of the novels amounting to onehalf but the following are entirely my own viz  st ronans well    3 vols tales of crusaders  4  first chronicles    2  anne of geierstein  3  redgauntlet         3  woodstock           3  second chronicles   3  count robert        3   in all twentyfour volumes which will begin printing after quentin durward and concludes the year 1831 for half the property he proposes to pay 6000 guineas on 2d february 1831 1832 i think that with this sum and others coming in i may reduce the debt to £45000  but i do not see clearly enough through this affair to accept this offer first i cannot see that there is wisdom in engaging mr cadell in deep speculations unless they served him very much i am in this respect a burnt child i have not forgotten the fire or rather the furnace second i think the property worth more if publicly sold third i cannot see any reasons which should render it advantageous for me to sell one half of this property it being admittedly at the same time highly judicious to keep the other half this does not fadge fourth as to the immediate command of the money i am not pressed for it not having any advantage by paying it a year or two sooner or later the actual proceeds of the sales will come in about 1834 and i daresay will not be far behind in amount the sum of £6000  in short i will not sell on a rainy day as our proverb says i have communicated my resolution to cadell to whom no doubt it will be a disappointment for which i am sorry but cannot help it  march 14had a very sensible and goodhumoured answer from mr cadell readily submitting to my decision he mentions what i am conscious of the great ease of accomplishing if the whole is divided into two halves but this is not an advantage to me but to them who keep the books and therefore i cannot be moved by it it is the great advantage of uniformity of which malachi malagrowther tells so much i do not fear that mr cadell will neglect the concern because he has not the large share in it which he had in the other he is i think too honest a man he has always shown himself every way willing and ready to help me and verily he hath his reward and i can afford him on that property a handsome percentage for the management but if his fate was to lose considerably by this transaction i must necessarily be a sufferer if he be a great gainer it is at my expense so it is like the childrens game of odds i win evens you loseso will say no more about it i think i will keep my ground nearly so these cursed politics do not ruin the country i am unable to sit at good mens boards and anne has gone to mertoun today without me i cannot walk or ride but for a mile or two naboclish never mind i am satisfied that i am heartwhole as a biscuit and i may live to see the end of those affairs yet i am driving on the count of paris right merrily i have plenty of leisure and vive la plume i have arranged matters as i think for the best so will think no more about it  march 16the affair with mr cadell being settled i have only to arrange a set of regular employment for my time without overfatiguing myself what i at present practise seems active enough for my capacity and even if i should reach the threescore and ten from which i am thrice three years distant or nearer ten the time may pass honourably usefully and profitably both to myself and other people my ordinary runs thusrise at a quarter before seven at a quarter after nine breakfast with eggs or in the singular number at least before breakfast private letters etc after breakfast mr laidlaw comes at ten and we write together till one i am greatly helped by this excellent man who takes pains to write a good hand and supplies the want of my own fingers as far as another person can we work seriously at the task of the day till one oclock when i sometimes walknot often however having failed in strength and suffering great pain even from a very short walk oftener i take the pony for an hour or two and ride about the doors the exercise is humbling enough for i require to be lifted on horseback by two servants and one goes with me to take care i do not fall off and break my bones a catastrophe very like to happen my proud promenade à pied or à cheval as it happens concludes by three oclock an hour intervenes for making up my journal and such light work at four comes dinnera plate of broth or soup much condemned by the doctors a bit of plain meat no liquors stronger than small beer and so i sit quiet to six oclock when mr laidlaw returns and remains with me till nine or three quarters past as it happens then i have a bowl of porridge and milk which i eat with the appetite of a child i forgot to say that after dinner i am allowed half a glass of whisky or gin made into weak grog i never wish for any more nor do i in my secret soul long for cigars though once so fond of them about six hours per day is good working if i can keep at it  march 17little of this day but that it was so uncommonly windy that i was almost blown off my pony and was glad to grasp the mane to prevent its actually happening rode round by brigends i began the third volume of count robert of paris which has been on the anvil during all these vexatious circumstances of politics and health but the blue heaven bends over all it may be ended in a fortnight if i keep my scheme but i will take time enough this would be on thursday i would like it much  march 18we get well on count robert is finished so far as the second goes and some twenty pages of the third blackwoods magazine after long bedaubing me with compliment has began to bedaub lockhart for my sake or perhaps me for lockharts sake with abuse lockharts chief offence seems to have been explaining the humbug of showing up hogg as a fool and blackguard in what he calls the noctes436 for me i care wonderfully little either for his flattery or his abuse437  march 19i made a hard working dayalmost equal to twenty pages but there was some reason for it for ballantyne writes me that the copy sent will not exceed 265 pages when the end of volume ii is reached so 45 more pages must be furnished to run it out to page 329 this is an awful cast back so the gap is to be made up  march 20i thought i was done with politics but it is easy getting into the mess and difficult and sometimes disgraceful to get out i have a letter from sheriff oliver desiring me to go to jedburgh on monday tomorrow and show countenance by adhering to a set of propositions being a resolution though not well drawn they are uncompromising enough so i will not part company had a letter too from henry scott he still expects to refuse the bill i wrote him that would but postpone the evil day unless they could bring forward a strong administration and what is most essential a system of finance otherwise it wont do henry has also applied to me for the rejected address but this i shall decline  march 22went today at nine oclock to the meeting a great number present with a tribune full of reformers who showed their sense of propriety by hissing hooting and making all sorts of noises and these unwashed artificers are from henceforth to select our legislators there was some speaking but not good i said something for i could not sit quiet438  we did not get home till about nine having fasted the whole time james the blockhead lost my poor spice a favourite terrier the fool shut her in a stable and somebody he says opened the door and let her out i suspect she is lost for aye for she was carried to jedburgh in a postchaise  march 23the measure carried by a single vote439 in other circumstances one would hope for the interference of the house of lords but it is all habnab at a venture the worst is that there is a popular party who want personal power and are highly unfitted to enjoy it it has fallen easily the old constitution no bullying mirabeau to assail no eloquent maury to defend it has been thrown away like a childs broken toy well trained the good sense of the people is much trusted to we will see what it will do for us440  the curse of cromwell on those whose conceit brought us to this pass sed transeat it is vain to mourn what cannot be mended  march 24frank grant and his lady came here frank will i believe and if he attends to his profession be one of the celebrated men of the age he is well known to me as the companion of my sons and the partner of my daughters in youth that is in extreme youth he was passionately fond of foxhunting and other sports but not of any species of gambling he had also a strong passion for painting and made a little collection as he had sense enough to feel that a younger brothers fortune would not last long under the expenses of a good stud and a rare collection of chefdœuvres he used to avow his intention to spend his patrimony about £10000 and then again to make his fortune by the law the first he soon accomplished but the law is not a profession so easily acquired nor did franks talents lie in that direction his passion for painting turned out better nature had given him the rare power of judging soundly of painting and in a remarkable degree the power of imitating it connoisseurs approved of his sketches both in pencil and oils but not without the sort of criticisms made on these occasionsthat they were admirable for an amateur but it could not be expected that he should submit to the technical drudgery absolutely necessary for a profession and all that species of criticism which gives way before natural genius and energy of character  meantime frank grant who was remarkably handsome and very much the man of fashion married a young lady with many possibilities as sir hugh evans says441 she was eldest sister of farquharson of invercauld chief of that clan and the young man himself having been almost paralysed by the malaria in italy franks little boy by this match becomes heir to the estate and chieftainship in the meantime fate had another chance for him in the matrimonial line at meltonmowbray during the hunting season he had become acquainted even before his first marriage with a niece of the duke of rutland a beautiful and fashionable young woman with whom he was now thrown into company once more it was a natural consequence that they should marry the lady had not much wealth but excellent connections in society to whom grants good looks and good breeding made him very acceptable  march 25in the meantime frank saw the necessity of doing something to keep himself independent having i think too much spirit to become a stulko442 drinking out the last glass of the bottle riding the horses which the laird wishes to sell and drawing sketches to amuse the lady and the childrenbesides a prospect on invercauld elevating him when realised to the rank of the lairds father  march 26grant was above all this and honourably and manfully resolved to cultivate his taste for painting and become a professional artist i am no judge of painting but i am conscious that francis grant possesses with much taste a sense of beauty derived from the best source that of really good society while in many modern artists the total want of that species of feeling is so great as to be revolting his former acquaintances render his immediate entrance into business completely secure and it will rest with himself to carry on his success he has i think that degree of energy and force of character which will make him keep and enlarge any reputation which he may acquire he has confidence too in his own powers always a requisite for a young painter whose aristocratic pretensions must be envied by his less fortunate brethren  march 27frank grant is still with me and is well pleasedi think very deservedly sowith a cabinet picture of myself armour and so forth together with my two noble staghounds of the greyhound race i wish cadell had got it it is far better than watsonsthough his is well too the dogs sat charmingly but the picture took up some time443  march 28we went out a little ride the weather most tempting the day beautiful we rode and walked a little  march 29we had an hours sitting of the dogs and a good deal of success i cannot compose my mind on this public measure it will not please those whom it is the object to please  march

antireform meeting in edinburgh exhorting me to take up the pen but i declined and pleaded health which god knows i have a right to urge i might have urged also the chance of my breaking down but there would be a cry of this kind which might very well prove real  march 31swinton returned in the forenoon yesterday after lunch he took my denial very quietly and said it would be wrong to press me i have not shunned anything that came fairly on me but i do not see the sense of standing forth a champion it is said that the duke of buccleuch has been offered the title of monmouth if he would cease to oppose he said there were two objectionsthey would not give it him if he seriously thought of it and he would not take it if they did the dundases went off today i was glad i had seen them

winton never forgot either the picturesque old house the supposed ravenswood castle of the bride of lammermoor or its venerable mistress as she sat of an evening in her unique drawingroom the walls of which were adorned with pictures of grecian temple and landscape her own handiwork in days long gone by when she was styled by her friends queen of athens her conversation after she was ninety was fresh and vigorous and despite blindness and imperfect hearing she kept herself well acquainted with the affairs of the day the last great speech in parliament or the newest bon mot were equally acceptable and equally relished her sense of humour and fun made her at times forget her own sufferings and her splendid memory enabled her to while away many a sleepless hour by repeating long passages from the bible or milton the former she had so much in her heart that it was scarcely possible to believe she was not reading from the book above all was her truly divine gift of charity the practical application of which in her everyday life was only bounded by her means  it was said of her by one who knew her well  she lived to a great age dispensing kindness and benevolence to the last and cheered in the sore infirmities of her later years by the love of friends of all ranks and all parties of all ages  the living lamp of lothian which from winton has so long shed its beneficent

a very good poem worthy of pope or churchill in oldfashioned hexameters called the illegible he has promised me a copy for it is still being printed there are some characters very well drawn the force of it belies the character of a dandie too hastily ascribed to the author he is accomplished as an artist and musician and certainly has a fine taste for poetry though he may never cultivate it445 he promises to bring his ladywho is very clever but pretty high they say in the temperto spend a day or two with us after leaving edinburgh  april 5this fifth day of april is the march fair at selkirk almost every one of the family goes there mr laidlaw among others i have a hideous paralytic custom of stuttering with my pen and cannot write without strange blunders yet i cannot find any failure in my intellect being unable to write to purpose with my own hand this forenoon was a sort of holiday to me the third volume of count robert is fairly begun but i fear i shall want stuff to fill it for i would not willingly bombast it with things inappropriate if i could fix my mind to the task today my temper notwithstanding my oath sets strong towards politics where i would be sure of making a figure and feel i could carry with me a great part of the middleclass who wait for a shot between wind and waterhalf comic half serious which is a better argument than most which are going the regard of my health is what chiefly keeps me in check the provoking odium i should mind much less for there will always be as many for as against me but it would be a foolish thing to take flight to the next world in a political gale of wind if cadell gave me the least encouragement i would give way to the temptation meantime i am tugging at the chain for very eagerness i have done enough to incense people against me without perhaps doing so much as i could would or should have done  april 6i have written to alva and lord elgin explaining why i cannot as they encourage me to do take upon me the cause of the public and bellthecat with the reformers i think i have done enough for an individual  i have more than half dictated the third volume to mr laidlaw but i feel the subject wants action and that a little repose will be very necessary resolve tomorrow shall be a restingday i have not had one this long time i had a letter from croker advising a literary adventurethe personal history of charles edward446 i think it will do rode to melrose and brought home the letters from the postoffice  april 8i took leave of poor major john scott447 who being afflicted with a distressing asthma has resolved upon selling his house in ravenswood which he had dressed up with much neatness and going abroad to jamaica without having been intimate friends we were always affectionate relations and now we part probably never to meet in this world he has a good deal of the character said to belong to the family our parting with mutual feeling may be easily supposed  april 9this being saturday i expect the bibliopolist and typographer about two oclock i suppose when i shall have much to journalise failures among the trade are alarming yet not if we act with prudence nous verrons  mr cadell and j ballantyne with the son of the latter their courage is much stouter than i apprehended cadell says he has lost £1000 by bad debts which is less than he expected by bad times coming on at this time we have been obliged to publish the less popular part of the waverley novels at present i incline to draw a period after 48 volumes and so close the publication about nine or ten volumes will then conclude our magnum opus so called and mr cadell thinks we shall then begin the poetical works in twelve volumes with illustrations by turner which he expects to rise as far as 12000 the size is to be that of the waverley novels  april 10i had a letter from mr cowan trustee for  constables creditors telling that the manuscripts of the waverley novels had been adjudged to him and offering them to me or rather asking my advice about the disposal of them answered that i considered myself as swindled out of my property and therefore will give no consent to any sale of the pillage448 cadell says he is determined to get the mss from cowan i told him i would give him the rest of the mss which are in my own hand for mr cadell has been very friendly to me in not suffering me to want money in difficult times we are not pushed by our creditors so can take our own time and as our plans prosper we can pay off debt about two oclock enter two gentlemen in an open carriage both from makerstoun and both captains in the navy captain blair a son of the member for ayrshire my old friend the laird of blair just as they retreat mr pontey is announced i was glad to see this great forester he is a little man and gets along with an air of talent something like gifford the famous editor of the quarterly as in his case mental acuteness gave animation to that species of countenance which attends personal deformity the whole of his face was bizarre and odd yet singularly impressive we walked round i with great pain by the hooded corbies seat and this great lord of the woodland gave the plantation great approbation he seems rather systematic in pruning yet he is in a great measure right he is tolerably obstinate in his opinions he dined leaving me flattered with his applause and pleased with having seen him  april 11this day i went with anne and miss jane erskine449 to see the laying of the stones of foundation of two bridges in my neighbourhood over tweed and the ettrick there was a great many people assembled the day was beautiful the scene romantic and the people in good spirits and goodhumour mr paterson450 of galashiels made a most excellent prayer mr smith451 gave a proper repast to the workmen and we subscribed sovereigns apiece to provide for any casualty i laid the foundationstone of the bridge over tweed and mr cb scott452 of woll that of ettrick the general spirit of goodhumour made the scene though without parade extremely interesting  april 12we breakfasted with the fergusons after which anne and miss erskine walked up the rhymers glen i could as easily have made a pilgrimage to rome with pease in my shoes unboiled i drove home and began to work about ten oclock at one oclock i rode and sent off what i had finished mr laidlaw dined with me in the afternoon we wrote five or six pages more i am i fear sinking a little from having too much space to fill and a want of the usual inspiration which makes me like the chariot wheels of pharaoh in the sands of the red sea drive heavily it is the less matter if this prove as i suspect the last of this fruitful family  april 13corrected a proof in the morning at ten oclock began where i had left off at my romance mr laidlaw agrees as to the portion of what we are presently busy with laidlaw begins to smite the rock for not giving forth the water in quantity sufficient i remarked to him that this would not profit much doing perhaps twelve pages a day will easily finish us and if it prove dull why dull it must be i shall perhaps have half a dozen to make up this night i have against me the disadvantage of being called the just and every one of course is willing to worry me but they have been long at it and even those works which have been worst received at their appearance now keep their ground fairly enough so well try our old luck another voyage  it is a close thick rain and i cannot ride and i am too dead lame to walk in the house so feeling really exhausted i will try to sleep a little  my nap was a very short one and was agreeably replaced by basil halls fragments of voyages everything about the inside of a vessel is interesting and my friend has the great sense to know this is the case i remember when my eldest brother took the humour of going to sea james watson453 used to be invited to george square to tell him such tales of hardships as might disgust him with the service such were my poor mothers instructions but captain watson could not render a sea life disgusting to the young midshipman or to his brother who looked on and listened the account of assistance given to the spaniards at cape finisterre and the absurd behaviour of the junta are highly interestinga more inefficient yet a more resolved class of men than the spaniards were never conceived  april 14advised by mr cadell that he has agreed with mr turner the first draughtsman of the period to furnish to the poetical works two decorations to each of the proposed twelve volumes to wit a frontispiece and vignette to each at the rate of £25 for each which is cheap enough considering these are the finest specimens of art going the difficulty is to make him come here to take drawings i have written to the man of art inviting him to my house though if i remember he is not very agreeable and offered to transport him to the places where he is to exercise his pencil his method is to take various drawings of remarkable places and towns and stick them all together he can therefore derive his subjects from good accurate drawings so with skenes assistance we can equip him we can put him at home on all the subjects lord meadowbank and his son skene and his son colonel russell and his sister dined with us454  april 15lord meadowbank etc went to newark with me and

though beginning only on monday with a very bad cold dr abercrombie was brought out by the friendly care of cadell but young clarkson had already done the needfulthat is had bled and blistered severely and placed me on a very restricted diet whether these precautions have been taken in time i cannot tell i think they have though severe in themselves beat the disease but i am alike prepared

27they have cut me off from animal food and fermented liquor of every kind and would press upon me such trash as panada and the like which affect my stomach  this i will none of but quietly wait till my ordinary diet is permitted and thank god i can fast with any one i walked out and found the day delightful the woods are looking charming just bursting forth to the tune of the birds i have been whistling on my wits like so many chickens and cannot miss any of them i feel on the whole better than i have yet done i believe i have fined and recovered and so may be thankful  april 28 and 29walter made his appearance well and stout and completely recovered of his stomach complaints by abstinence he has youth on his side and i in age must submit to be a lazarus the medical men persist

me his recollections of these days  on referring to my diary for the year 1831 i find the following entry this spring on 31st april i went with my father to abbotsford and left on sir walter scott being taken ill the date here given for my visit does not correspond with that in sir walters diary but as there are only thirty days in april it has evidently been written by mistake for the 13th i had just attained my twentyfirst year and as such a visit at that early age was a great event in my life i retain a very distinct recollection of the main features of it i recollect that lord meadowbank and his eldest son alan came at the same time and the dinner party at which mr pringle of the haining and his brother were present the day after our arrival sir walter asked me to drive with him we went in his open carriage to the yarrow where we got out and sir walter leaning on my arm walked up the side of the river pouring forth a continuous stream of anecdotes traditions and scraps of ballads i was in the seventh heaven of delight and thought i had never spent such a day on sunday sir walter did not come down to breakfast but sent a message to say that he had caught cold and had taken some medicine for it the night before which had made him ill and would remain in bed when we sat at either lunch or dinner i do not recollect which sir walter walked into the room and sat down near the table but ate nothing he seemed in a dazed state and took no notice of any one but after a few minutes silence during which his daughter anne who was at table and was watching him with some anxiety motioned to us to take no notice he began in a quiet voice to tell us a story of a pauper lunatic who fancying he was a rich man and was entertaining all sorts of high persons to the most splendid banquets communicated to his doctor in confidence that there was one thing that troubled him much and which he could not account for and that was that all these exquisite dishes seemed to him to taste of oatmeal porridge sir walter told this with much humour and after a few minutes silence began again and told the same story over a second time and then again a third timee his daughter who was watching him with increasing anxiety then motioned to us to rise from table and persuaded her father to return to his bedroom next day the doctor who had been sent for told us that he was seriously ill and advised that his guests should leave at once so that the house might be kept quiet and his daughter devote herself entirely to the care of her father we accordingly left at once and i never saw sir walter again i still however retain a memorial of my visit i had fallen into indifferent health in the previous year and been recommended highland air by sir walters advice i was sent to live with a friend of his the reverend doctor macintosh mackay then minister of laggan in the invernessshire highlands and had passed my time learning from him the gaelic language this excited

at such a time burn went on to richardsons place of kirklands where he is to meet the proprietor whom i too would wish to see but i can hardly make it out here is a world of arrangements i think we will soon hit upon something my son walter takes leave of me today to return to sheffield at his entreaty i have agreed to put in a seton which they seem all to recommend my own opinion is this

have a formal remonstrance from these critical persons ballantyne and cadell against the last volume of count robert which is within a sheet of being finished i suspect their opinion will be found to coincide with that of the public at least it is not very different from my own the blow is a stunning one i suppose for i scarcely feel it it is singular but it comes with as little surprise as if i had a remedy ready yet god knows i am at sea in the dark and the vessel leaky i think into the bargain i cannot conceive that i should have tied a knot with my tongue which my teeth cannot untie we will see i am determined to write a political pamphlet coûte que coûte ayshould it cost me my life  i will right and left at these unlucky proofsheets and alter at least what i cannot mend  may 8i have suffered terribly that is the truth rather in body than in mind and i often wish i could lie down and sleep without waking but i will fight it out if i can it would argue too great an attachment of consequence to my literary labours to sink under did i know how to begin i would begin this very day although i knew i should sink at the end after all this is but fear and faintness of heart though of another kind from that which trembleth at a loaded pistol my bodily strength is terribly gone perhaps my mental too  may 9the weather uncommonly beautiful and i am very eager to get on thinning woods while the peeling season lasts we made about £200 off wood last season and this is a sum worth looking at  may 10some repairs on the milldam still keep the people employed and we cannot get to the thinning yet i have been urging them for a month its a great fault of scottish servants that they cannot be taught to time their turns  may 11by old practice i should be going into town today the court sitting tomorrow am i happier that i am free from this charge perhaps i am that is certain time begins to make my literary labour more precious than usual very weak scarce able to crawl about without the ponylifted on and offand unable to walk half a mile save with great pain  may 12resolved to lay by robert of paris and take it up when i can work thinking on it really makes my head swim and that is not safe miss ferrier comes out to us this gifted personage besides having great talents has conversation the least exigeante of any author female at least whom i have ever seen among the long list i have encounteredsimple full of humour and exceedingly ready at repartee and all this without the least affectation of the blue stocking459  may 13mr or more properly dr macintosh mackay comes out to see me a simple learned man and a highlander who weighs his own nation justlya modest and estimable person  i was beat up at midnight to sign a warrant against some delinquents i afterwards heard that the officers were pursued by a mob from galashiels with purpose of deforcing them as far as st boswells green but the men were lodged in jedburgh castle  reports of mobs at all the elections which i fear will prove too true they have much to answer for who in gaiety of heart have brought a peaceful and virtuous population to such a pass  may 14rode with lockhart and mr mackay through the plantations and spent a pleasanter day than of late months story of a haunted glen in laggana chieftains daughter or cousin loved a man of low degree her kindred discovered the intrigue and punished the lovers presumption by binding the unhappy man and laying him naked in one of the large ants nests common in a highland forest he died in agony of course and his mistress became distracted roamed wildly in the glen till she died and her phantom finding no repose haunted it after her death to such a degree that the people shunned the road by day as well as night mrs grant of laggan tells the story with the addition that her husband then minister of laggan fixed a religious meeting in the place and by the exercise of public worship there overcame the popular terror of the red woman dr mackay seems to think that she was rather banished by a branch of the parliamentary road running up the glen than by the prayers of his predecessor dr mackay it being sunday favoured us with an excellent discourse on the socinian controversy which i wish my friend mr laidlaw had heard  may 15dr m left us early this morning and i rode and studied as usual working at the tales of my grandfather our good and learned doctor wishes to go down the tweed to berwick it is a laudable curiosity and i hope will be agreeably satisfied  may 16 and 17i wrote and rode as usual and had the pleasure of miss ferriers company in my family hours which was a great satisfaction she has certainly less affectation than any female i have known that has stood so highjoanna baillie hardly excepted by the way she mrs baillie has entered on the socinian controversy for which i am very sorry she has published a number of texts on which she conceives the controversy to rest but it escapes her that she can only quote them through a translation i am sorry this gifted woman is hardly doing herself justice and doing what is not required at her hands mr laidlaw of course thinks it the finest thing in the world460  may 18went to jedburgh to the election greatly against the wishes of my daughters the mob were exceedingly vociferous and brutish as they usually are nowadays but the sheriff had two troops of dragoons at ancrum bridge and all went off quietly the populace gathered in formidable numbersa thousand from hawick alone they were sad blackguards and the day passed with much clamour and no mischief henry scott was reelectedfor the last time i suppose troja fuit  i left the burgh in the midst of abuse and the gentle hint of burke sir walter much obliged to the brave lads of jeddart upwards of forty freeholders voted for henry scott and only fourteen for the puppy that opposed him even of this party he gained far the greater number by the very awkward coalition with sir william scott of ancrum i came home at seven at night  may 20this is the selkirk election which i supposed would be as tumultuous as the jedburgh one but the soutars of selkirk had got a new light and saw in the proposed reform bill nothing but a mode of disfranchising their ancient burgh although the crowd was great yet there was a sufficient body of special constables hearty in their useful office and the election passed as quietly as i ever witnessed one i came home before dinner very quiet i am afraid there is something serious in galashiels jeffrey is fairly funked about it and has written letters to the authorities of roxburghshire and selkirkshire to caution us against making the precognitions public which looks ill yet i think he would have made arrests when the soldiers were in the country the time at which i settled at abbotsford whitsunday 1811 i broke up a conspiracy of the weavers it will look like sympathising with any renewal if another takes place just now incendiary letters have been sent and the householders are in a general state of alarm the men at jedburgh castle are said to be disposed to make a clean breast if so we shall soon know more of the matter lord william graham has been nearly murdered at dumbarton why should he not have brought down 50 or 100 lads with the kilts each with a good kent461 in his hand fit to call the soul out of the body of these weavers they would have kept order i warrant you  may 21little more than my usual work and my usual exercise i rode out through the plantations and saw the woodmen getting down what was to be felled it seems there will be as much for sale as last year of bark i think about £40 worth a very nice additional pond to the sawmill has been executed as for my tales they go on well and are amusing to myself at least the history of france is very entertaining  may 22i have a letter from my friend john thomson of duddingston i had transmitted him an order for the duke of buccleuch for his best picture at his best price leaving the choice of the subject and everything else to himself he expresses the wish to do at an ordinary price a picture of common size the declining to put himself forward will i fear be thought like shrinking from his own reputation which nobody has less need to do the duke may wish a large picture for a large price for furnishing a large apartment and the artist should not shrink from it i have written him my opinion the feeling is no doubt an amiable though a false one he is modest in proportion to his talents but what brother of the finer arts ever approached excellence so as to please himself  may 23 24 and 25worked and exercised regularly i do not feel that i care twopence about the change of diet as to taste but i feel my strength much decayed on horseback my spine feels remarkably sore and i am tired with a few miles ride we expect walter coming down for the fife election                                            from may 25th to october 9th there are no dates in the journal      but the entry beginning i have been very ill must have been made      about the middle of september in the family circle says mr      lockhart he seldom spoke of his illness at all and when he did      it was always in a hopeful strain in private to laidlaw and      myself his language corresponded exactly with the tone of the      diary he expressed his belief that the chances of recovery were      fewvery fewbut always added that he considered it his duty to      exert what faculties remained to him for the sake of his creditors      to the very lasti am very anxious he repeatedly said to me      to be done one way or other with this count robert and a little      story about the castle dangerouswhich also i had long in my      headbut after that i will attempt nothing more at least not      until i have finished all the notes for the novels etc       on the 18th july he set out in company with mr lockhart to visit      douglas castle st brides church and its neighbourhood for the      purpose of verifying the scenery of castle dangerous then partly      printed returning on the 20th       he finished that book and count robert before the end of august       in september mr lockhart then staying at chiefswood and      proposing to make a run into lanarkshire for a day or two      mentioned overnight at abbotsford that he intended to take his      second son then a boy of five or six years of age and sir      walters namesake with him on the stagecoach       next morning the following affectionate billet was put into his      hands       to jg lockhart esq chiefswood       dear don or doctor giovanni       can you really be thinking of taking wawa by the coachand i      think you said outside think of johnny and be careful of this      little man are you par hazard something in the state of the poor      capitaine des dragons that comes in singing      comment parbleu quen pensez vous

eustace for his friends shall send     and thank their love in grayling hall462      ws463       on the 15th september he tells the duke of buccleuch i am going      to try whether the air of naples will make an old fellow of sixty      young again       on the 17th the old splendour of the house was revived col      glencairn burns son of the poet then in scotland came      to stir with joy the towers of abbotsford       the neighbours were assembled and having his son to help him sir      walter did the honours of the table once more as of yore       on the 19th the poet wordsworth arrived and left on the 22d       on the 20th mrs lockhart set out for london to prepare for her      fathers reception there and on the 23d sir walter left abbotsford      for london where he arrived on the 28th464   footnotes  456 falconers shipwreck p 162the storm 12mo ed london albion press 1810  457 scotch metrical version of the 90th psalm  458 on the 18th october sir walter sent mr burn the following inscription for the monument he had commissioned and which now stands in the churchyard of irongray  this stone was erected by the author of waverley to the memory of helen walker who died in the year of god 1791 this humble individual practised in real life the virtues with which fiction has invested the imaginary character of jeanie deans refusing the slightest departure from veracity even to save the life of a sister she nevertheless showed her kindness and fortitude in rescuing her from the severity of the law at the expense of personal exertions which the time rendered as difficult as the motive was laudable respect the grave of poverty when combined with the love of truth and dear affection  it is well known that on the publication of old mortality many people were offended by what was considered a caricature of the covenanters and that dr mcrie the biographer of knox wrote a series of papers in the edinburgh christian instructor which scott affected to despise and said he would not read he not only was obliged to read the articles but found it necessary to inspire or write an elaborate defence of the truth of his own picture of the covenanters in the number for january 1817 of the quarterly review  in june 1818 however he made ample amends and won the hearts of all classes of his countrymen by his beautiful pictures of national character in the heart of midlothian  it is worth noticing also that ten years later viz in december 1828 his friend richardson having written that in the tales of a grandfather you have paid a debt which you owed to the manes of the covenanters for the flattering picture which you drew of claverhouse in old mortality his character is inconceivable to me the atrocity of his murder of those peasants as undauntedly devoted to their own good cause as himself to his his personal almost hangmanlike superintendence of their executions are wholly irreconcilable with a chivalrous spirit which however scornful of the lowly could never in my mind be cruel scott in reply gave his matured opinion in the following words  as to covenanters and malignants they were both a set of cruel and bloody bigots and had notwithstanding those virtues with which bigotry is sometimes allied their characters were of a kind much more picturesque than beautiful neither had the least idea either of toleration or humanity so that it happens that so far as they can be distinguished from each other one is tempted to hate most the party which chances to be uppermost for the time  459 see miss ferriers account of this visit prefixed to mr bentleys choice edition of her works 6 vols cr 8vo london 1881  460 mr carruthers remarks in his abbotsford notandajoanna baillie published a thin volume of selections from the new testament regarding the nature and dignity of jesus christ the tendency of the work was socinian or at least arian and scott was indignant that his friend should have meddled with such a subject what had she to do with questions of that sort he refused to add the book to his library and gave it to laidlawp 179  461 a long staff  462 see crabbes sir eustace grey  463 life vol x pp 1001  464 see life vol x pp 76106     october  interval   i have been very ill and if not quite unable to write i have been unfit to do so i have wrought however at two waverley things but not well and what is worse past mending a total prostration of bodily strength is my chief complaint i cannot walk half a mile there is besides some mental confusion with the extent of which i am not perhaps fully acquainted i am perhaps setting i am myself inclined to think so and like a day that has been admired as a fine one the light of it sets down amid mists and storms i neither regret nor fear the approach of death if it is coming i would compound for a little pain instead of this heartless muddiness of mind which renders me incapable of anything rational the expense of my journey will be something considerable which i can provide against by borrowing £500 from mr gibson to mr cadell i owe already with the cancels on these apoplectic books about £200 and must run it up to £500 more at least yet this heavy burthen would be easily borne if i were to be the walter scott i once was but the change is great this would be nothing providing that i could count on these two books having a sale equal to their predecessors but as they do not deserve the same countenance they will not and cannot have such a share of favour and i have only to hope that they will not involve the waverley which are now selling 30000 volumes a month in their displeasure something of a journal and the reliquiae trotcosienses will probably be moving articles and i have in short no fears in pecuniary matters the ruin which i fear involves that of my king and country well says colin mackenzie      shall this desolation strike thy towers alone     no fair ellandonan such ruin twill bring     that the storm shall have power to unsettle the throne     and thy fate shall be mixed with the fate of thy king465  i fear that the great part of the memorialists are bartering away the dignity of their rank by seeking to advance themselves by a job which is a melancholy sight the ties between democrat and aristocrat are sullen discontent with each other the former are regarded as a housedog which has manifested incipient signs of canine madness and is not to be trusted walter came down today to join our party  september 20yesterday wordsworth his son nephew466 and daughter came to see us and we went up to yarrow the eldest son of lord ravensworth also came to see us with his accomplished lady we had a pleasant party and today were left by the liddells manent the three wordsworths cum cæteris a german or hungarian count erdödy or some such name  we arrived in london september 28 after a long and painful journey the weakness of my limbs palpably increasing and the physic prescribed making me weaker every day lockhart poor fellow is as attentive as possible and i have thank god no pain whatever could the end be as easy it would be too happy i fancy the instances of euthanasia are not very uncommon instances there certainly are among the learned and the unlearneddr  black tom purdie i should wish if it please god to sleep off in such a quiet way but we must take what fate sends i have not warm hopes of being myself again  wordsworth and his daughter a fine girl were with us on the last day i tried to write in her diary and made an illfavoured botchno help for it stitches will wear and ill ones will out as the tailor says467  october 8 londonthe king has located me on board the barham with my suite consisting of my eldest son youngest daughter and perhaps my daughterinlaw which with poor charles will make a goodly tail i fancy the head of this tail cuts a poor figure scarce able to stir about  the town is in a foam with politics the report is that the lords will throw out the bill and now morning of 8th october i learn it is quoited downstairs like a shovelboard shilling with a plague to it as the most uncalledfor attack upon a free constitution under which men lived happily which ever was ventured in my day well it would have been pleasing to have had some share in so great a victory yet even now i am glad i have been quiet i believe i should only have made a bad figure well i will have time enough to think of all this  october 9the report today is that the chancellor468 will unite with the duke of wellington and sir robert peel to bring in a bill of his own concocting modified to the taste of the other two with which some think they will be satisfied this is not very unlikely for lord brougham has been displeased with not having been admitted to lord john russells task of billdrawing he is a man of unbounded ambition as well as unbounded talent and uncertain temper there have been hosts of people here particularly the duke of buccleuch to ask me to the christening of his son and heir when the king stands godfather i am asked as an ally and friend of the family which makes the compliment greater singular that i should have stood godfather to this duke himself representing some great man  october 10yesterday we dined alone so i had an opportunity of speaking seriously to john but i fear procrastination it is the cry of friar bacons brazen head time istime was but the time may soon cometime shall be no more the whigs are not very bold not much above a hundred met to support lord grey to the last their resolutions are moderate probably because they could not have carried stronger i went to breakfast at sir robert henry inglis and coming home about twelve found the mob rising in the regents park and roaring for reform as rationally as a party of angusshire cattle would have done  sophia seemed to act as the jolly host in the play these are my windows and shutting the shutters let them batteri care not serving the good duke of norfolk after a time they passed out of our sight hurrying doubtless to seek a more active scene of reformation as the night closed the citizens who had hitherto contented themselves with shouting became more active and when it grew dark set forth to make work for the glaziers  october 11 tuesdaywe set out in the morning to breakfast with lady gifford we passed several glorious specimens of the last nights feats of the reformers the duke of newcastles and lord dudleys houses were sufficiently broken the maidens however had resisted and from the top of the house with coals which had greatly embarrassed the assembled mob surely if the people are determined on using a right so questionable and the government resolved to consider it as too sacred to be resisted some modes of resistance might be resorted to of a character more ludicrous than firearmscoals for example scalding oil boiling water or some other mode of defence against a sudden attack we breakfasted with a very pleasant party at lady giffords i was particularly happy to meet lord sidmouth at seventyfive he tells me as much in health and spirits as at sixty i also met captain basil hall to whom i owe so much for promoting my retreat in so easy a manner i found my appointment to the barham had been pointed out by captain henry duncan rn as being a measure which would be particularly agreeable to the officers of the service this is too high a compliment in returning i called to see the repairs at lambeth which are proceeding under the able direction of blore who met me there they are in the best gothic taste and executed at the expense of a large sum to be secured by way of mortgage payable in fifty years each incumbent within the time paying a proportion of about £4000 a year i was pleased to see this splendour of church architecture returning again  lord mahon a very amiable as well as a clever young man comes to dinner with mr croker lady louisa stuart in the afternoon or more properly at night  october 12misty morninglooks like a yellow fog which is the curse of london i would hardly take my share of it for a share of its wealth and its curiositya vile doubledistilled fog of the most intolerable kind children scarce stirring yet but baby and the macaw beginning their macaw notes among other feats of the mob on monday a gentleman who saw the onslaught told me two men got on lord londonderrys carriage and struck him the chief constable came to the rescue and belaboured the rascals who ran and roared i should have liked to have seen the onslaughtdry beating and plenty of it is a great operator of a reform among these gentry at the same time lord londonderry is a brainsick man very unlike his brother he horsewhipped a sentinel under arms at vienna for obeying his consigne which was madness on the other side all seems to be prepared heavy bodies of the police are stationed in all the squares and places supporting each other regularly the men themselves say that their numbers amount to 3000 and that they are supported by troops in still greater numbers so that the conservative force is sufficiently strong four oclocka letter from the duke saying the party is put off by command of the king and probably the day will be put off until the dukes return from scotland so our hopes of seeing the fine ceremony are all ended  october 13nocte pluit totaan excellent recipe for a mob so they have been quiet accordingly as we are informed two or three other wet nights would do much to weary them out with inactivity milman whom i remember a fine gentlemanlike young man dined here yesterday he says the fires have never ceased in his country but that the oppressions and sufferings occasioned by the poors rates are very great and there is no persuading the english farmer that an amended system is comfortable both for rich and poor the plan of ministers is to keep their places maugre peers and commons both while they have the countenance of the crown but if a prince shelters by authority of the prerogative ministers against the will of the other authority of the state does he not quit the defence which supposes he can do no wrong this doctrine would make a curious change of parties will they attempt to legitimize the fitz clarences god forbid yet it may end in thatit would be paris all over the family is said to have popular qualities then what would be the remedy marry seize on the person of the princess victoria carrying her north and setting up the banner of england with the duke of w as dictator well i am too old to fight and therefore should keep the windy side of the law besides i shall be buried before times come to a decision in the meantime the king dare not go to stand godfather to the son of one of his most powerful peers a party of his own making lest his loving subjects pull the house about the ears of his noble host and the company invited to meet him their loyalty has a pleasant way of displaying itself i will go to westminster after breakfast and see what people are saying and whether the barham is likely to sail or whether its course is not altered to the coast of the low countries instead of the mediterranean  october 14tried to walk to lady louisa stuarts but took a little vertigo and came back much disturbed by a letter from walter he is like to be sent on an obnoxious service with very inadequate force little prospect of thanks if he does his duty and much of blame if he is unable to accomplish it i have little doubt he will ware his mothers calfskin on them  the manufacturing districts are in great danger london seems pretty secure sent off the revise of introduction to mr cadell469  october 16a letter from walter with better news he has been at hardheads with the rogues and come off with advantage in short practised with success the art of drawing two souls out of one weaver470 all seems quiet now and i suppose the major will get his leave as proposed two ladiesone byrons mary chaworthhave been frightened to death while the mob tore the dying creatures from their beds and proposed to throw them into the flames drank the wine destroyed the furniture and committed other excesses of a jacquerie471 they have been put down however by a strong force of yeomanry and regulars walter says the soldiers fired over the peoples heads whereas if they had levelled low the bullets must have told more among the multitude i cannot approve of this for in such cases severity is ultimate mercy472 however if they have made a sufficient impression to be strikingwhy enough is as good as a feast  there is a strange story about town of ghostseeing vouched by lord prudhoe a near relation of the duke of northumberland and whom i know as an honourable man a colonel described as a coolheaded sensible man of worth and honour palgrave who dined with us yesterday told us twice over the story as vouched by lord prudhoe and lockhart gave us colonel felixs edition which coincided exactly i will endeavour to extract the essence of both while at grand cairo they were attracted by the report of a physician who could do the most singular magical feats and was in the habit not only of relieving the living but calling up the dead this sage was the member of a tribe in the interior part of africa they were some time two years in finding him out for he by no means pressed himself on the curious nor did he on the other hand avoid them but when he came to grand cairo readily agreed to gratify them by a sight of his wonders the scenes exhibited were not visible to the operator himself nor to the person for whose satisfaction they were called up but as in the case of dr dee and other adepts by means of a viewer an ignorant nubian boy whom to prevent imposition the english gentlemen selected for the purpose and as they thought without any risk of imposture by confederacy betwixt him and the physician the process was as followsa black square was drawn in the palm of the boys hand or rather a kind of pentacle with an arabic character inscribed at each angle the figures evoked were seen through this space as if the substance of the hand had been removed magic rites and particularly perfumes were liberally resorted to after some fumigation the magician declared that they could not proceed until the seven flags should become visible the boy declared he saw nothing then said he saw a flag then two often hesitated at the number for a certain time and on several occasions the spell did not work and the operation went no further but in general the boy saw the seven flags through the aperture in his hand the magician then said they must call the sultan and the boy said he saw a splendid tent fixed surrounded by immense hosts eblis no doubt and his angels the person evoked was then named and appeared accordingly the only indispensable requisite was that he was named speedily for the sultan did not like to be kept waiting accordingly william shakespeare being named the boy declared that he saw a frank in a dress which he described as that of the reign of elizabeth or her successor having a singular countenance a high forehead and a very little beard another time a brother of the colonel was named the boy said he saw a frank in his uniform dress and a black groom behind him leading a superb horse the dress was a red jacket and white pantaloons and the principal figure turning round the boy announced that he wanted his arm as was the case with felixs brother the ceremony was repeated fourteen times successfully in twelve instances and in two it failed from nonappearance of the seven banners in the first instance the apparent frankness of the operator was not the least surprising part of the affair he made no mystery said he possessed this power by inheritance as a family gift yet that he could teach it and was willing to do so for no enormous sumnay one which seemed very moderate i think two gentlemen embraced the offer one of them is dead and the other still abroad the sage also took a price for the exhibition of his skill but it was a moderate one being regulated by the extent of the perfumes consumed in the ceremony  there remains much more to ask i understood the witnesses do not like to bother about which is very natural one would like to know a little more of the sultan of the care taken to secure the fidelity of the boy who was the viewer and on whom so much depended whether another sage practising the same feat as it was said to be hereditary was ever known to practise in the city the truth of a story irreconcilable with the common course of nature must depend on crossexamination if we should find while at malta that we had an opportunity of expiscating this matter though at the expense of a voyage to alexandria it would hardly deter me473 the girls go to the chapel royal this morning at st jamess a visit from the honourable john forbes son of my old and early friend lord forbes who is our fellowpassenger the ship expects presently to go to sea i was very glad to see this young officer and to hear his news drummond and i have been mends from our infancy  october 17the morning beautiful today i go to look after the transcripts in the museum and have a card to see a set of chessmen474 thrown up by the sea on the coast of scotland which were offered to sale for £100 the king queen knights etc were in the costume of the 14th century the substance ivory or rather the tusk of the morse somewhat injured by the salt water in which they had been immersed for some time  sir john malcolm told us a story about garrick and his wife the lady admired her husband greatly but blamed him for a taste for low life and insisted that he loved better to play scrub to a lowlifed audience than one of his superior characters before an audience of taste on one particular occasion she was in her box in the theatre richard iii was the performance and garricks acting especially in the night scene drew down universal applause after the play was over mrs g proposed going home which garrick declined alleging he had some business in the greenroom which must detain him in short the lady was obliged to acquiesce and wait the beginning of a new entertainment in which was introduced a farmer giving his neighbours an account of the wonders seen on a visit to london this character was received with such peals of applause that mrs garrick began to think it rivalled those which had been so lately lavished on richard the third at last she observed her little spaniel dog was making efforts to get towards the balcony which separated him from the facetious farmer then she became aware of the truth how strange she said that a dog should know his master and a woman in the same circumstances should not recognise her husband  october 18sophia had a small but lively party last night as indeed she has had every night since we were hereladieslady stafford lady louisa stuart lady montagu miss montagu lady davy mrs macleod and two or three others gentlemenlord montagu macleod lord dudley rogers mackintosh a good deal of singing if sophia keeps to early hours she may beat london for small parties as poor miss white did and without much expense a little address is all that is necessary sir john475 insists on my meeting this rammohun roy476 i am no believer in his wandering knight so far the time is gone of sages who travelled to collect wisdom as well as heroes to reap honour men think and fight for money i wont see the man if i can help it flatterers are difficult enough to keep at a distance though they be no renegades i hate a fellow who begins with throwing away his own religion and then affects a prodigious respect for another  october 19captain h duncan called with captain pigot a smartlooking gentlemanlike man and announces his purpose of sailing on monday i have made my preparations for being on board on sunday which is the day appointed captain duncan told me jocularly never to take a naval captains word on shore and quoted sir william scott who used to say waggishly that there was nothing so accommodating as a naval captain on shore but when on board he became a peremptory lion henry duncan has behaved very kindly and says he only discharges the wishes of his service in making me as easy as possible which is very handsome no danger of feud except about politics which would be impolite on my part and though it bars out one great subject of discourse it leaves enough besides that i might have nothing doubtful walter arrives with his wife ready to sail so what little remains must be done without loss of time this is our last morning so i have money to draw for and pay away to see our dear lord montagu too the duchess came yesterday i suppose £50 will clear me with some balance for gibraltar  i leave this country uncertain if it has got a total pardon or only a reprieve i wont think of it as i can do no good it seems to be in one of those crises by which providence reduces nations to their original elements477 if i had my health i should take no worldly fee not to be in the bustle but i am as weak as water and i shall be glad when i have put the mediterranean between the island and me  october 21 and 22spent in taking of farewell and adieus which had been put off till now a melancholy ceremonial with some a useless one yet there are friends whom it sincerely touches one to part with it is the cement of life giving way in a moment another unpleasant circumstance isone is called upon to recollect those whom death or estrangement has severed after starting merrily together in the voyage of life  october 23portsmouth arrived here in the evening found the barham will not sail till 26th october that is wednesday next the girls break loose mad with the craze of seeing sights and run the risk of our losing some of our things and deranging the naval officers who offer their services with their natural gallantry captain pigot came to breakfast with several other officials the girls contrived to secure a sight of the block manufactory together with that of the biscuit also invented by brunel i think that i have seen the first of these wonderful sights in 1816 or about that time478 sir thomas foley gives an entertainment to the admiralty and sends to invite me but i pleaded health and remained at home neither will i go out sightseeing which madness seems to have seized my womankind this ancient town is one of the few in england which is fortified and which gives it a peculiar appearance it is much surrounded with heaths or thin poor muirs covered with heather very barren yet capable of being converted into rich arable and pasturage i would not desire a better estate than to have 2000 acres which would be worth 40 shillings an acre  october 24my womankind are gone out with walter and captain hall i wish they would be moderate in their demands on peoples complaisance they little know how inconvenient are such seizures a sailor is in particular a bad refuser and before he can turn three times round he is bound with a triple knot to all kinds of engagements the wind is west that is to say contrary so our sailing on the day after tomorrow is highly doubtful  october 25a gloomy october day the wind inflexibly constant in the west which is fatal sir james graham proposes to wait upon us after breakfast a trouble occurs about my taking an oath before a masterextraordinary in chancery but such cannot easily be found as they reside in chambers in town and rusticate after business so they are difficult to catch as an eel at ten my children set off to the dockyard which is a most prodigious effort of machinery and they are promised the sight of an anchor in the act of being forged a most cyclopean sight walter is to call upon the solicitor and appoint him to be with me by twelve  about the reign of henry viii the french took the pile as it was called of479 but were beat off about the end of the american war an individual named john aitken or john the painter undertook to set the dockyard on fire and in some degree accomplished his purpose he had no accomplice and to support himself committed solitary robberies being discovered he long hung in chains near the outward fortifications last night a deputation of the literary and philosophical society of portsmouth came to present me with the honorary freedom of their body which i accepted with becoming gratitude there is little credit in gathering the name of a disabled invalid here i am going a long and curious tour without ability to walk a quarter of a mile quere what hope of recovery i think and think in vain when attempting to trace the progress of this disease and so gradually has my health declined that i believe it has been acting upon me for ten years gradually diminishing my strength my mental faculties may perhaps recover my bodily strength cannot return unless climate has an effect on the human frame which i cannot possibly believe or comprehend the safe resolution is to try no foolish experiments but make myself as easy as i can without suffering myself to be vexed about what i cannot help if i sit on the deck and look at vesuvius it will be all i ought to think of  having mentioned john the painter i may add that it was in this town of portsmouth that the duke of buckingham was stabbed to death by felton a fanatic of the same kind with the incendiary though perpetrator of a more manly crime this monsterbreeding age can afford both feltons and john aitkens in abundance every village supplies them while in fact a deep feeling of the coarsest selfishness furnishes the ruling motive instead of an affectation of public spiritthat hackneyed affectation of patriotism as like the reality as a birmingham halfpenny to a guinea  the girls i regret to see have got a senseless custom of talking politics in all weathers and in all sorts of company this can do no good and may give much offence silence can offend no one and there are pleasanter or less irritating subjects to talk of i gave them both a hint of this and bid them both remember they were among ordinary strangers how little young people reflect what they may win or lose by a smart reflection imprudently fired off at a venture  mr barrow of the admiralty came and told us the whole fleet barham excepted were ordered to the north sea to help to bully the king of holland and that captain pigot whose motions are of more importance to us than those of the whole british navy sails as certainly as these things can be prophesied on thursday 27th october  october 26here we still are fixed by the inexorable wind yesterday we asked a few old friends mr and mrs osborne and two or three others to tea and talk i engaged in a new novel by mr smith480 called new forest it is written in an old style calculated to meet the popular ideassomewhat like man as he is not481 and that class the authors opinions seem rather to sit loose upon him and to be adopted for the nonce and not very well brought out his idea of a hero is an american philosopher with all the affected virtues of a republican which no man believes in  this is very tiresomenot to be able to walk abroad for an instant but to be kept in this old house which they call the fountain a mansion made of wood in imitation of a ship the timbers were well tried last night during the squall the barometer has sunk an inch very suddenly which seems to argue a change and probably a deliverance from port sir michael seymour mr harris captain lawrence came to greet us after breakfast also sir james graham they were all learned on this change of weather which seems to be generally expected i had a good mess of tory chat with mr harris we hope to see his daughters in the evening he keeps his courage amid the despair of too many of his party about one oclock our kofle as mungo park words it set out self excluded to witness the fleet sailing from the ramparts  october 27the weather is more moderate and there is a chance of our sailing we whiled away our time as we could relieved by several kind visits we realised the sense of hopeless expectation described by fielding in his voyage to lisbon which identical tract captain hall who in his eagerness to be kind seems in possession of the wishingcap of fortunatus was able to provide for us tomorrow is spoken of as certainly a day to move  october 28but the wind is as unfavourable as ever and i take a hobbling morning walk upon the rampart where i am edified by a goodnatured officer who shows me the place marked by a buoy where the royal george went down with twice four hundred men482 its hull forms a shoal which is still in existence a neglect scarcely reconcilable with the splendour of our proceedings where our navy is concerned saw a battle on the rampart between two sailor boys who fought like gamecocks returned to the fountain to a voluminous breakfast captain pigot calls with little hope of sailing today i made my civil affidavit yesterday to a master extraordinary in chancery which i gave to sophia last night  october 29 the barhamthe weather is changed and i think we shall sail captain forbes comes with offer of the admiral sir michael seymours barge but we must pause on our answer i have had a very disturbed night captain pigots summons is at length brought by his own announcement and the same time the admirals barge attends for our accommodation and puts us and our baggage on board the barham a beautiful ship a 74 cut down to a 50 and well deserving all the commendations bestowed on her the weather a calm which is almost equal to a favourable wind so we glide beautifully along by the isle of wight and the outside of the island we landsfolk feel these queerish sensations when without being in the least sick we are not quite well we dine enormously and take our cot at nine oclock when we sleep undisturbed till seven  october 30find the bill of portland in sight having run about forty miles during the night about the middle of the day turn seasick and retire to my berth for the rest of the evening  october 31a sleepless night and a bilious morning yet not so very uncomfortable as the phrase may imply the bolts clashed and made me dream of poor bran the wind being nearly completely contrary we have by ten oclock gained plymouth and of course will stand westward for cape finisterre terrible tossing and much seasickness beating our passage against the turn i may as well say we had a parting visit from lady graham who came off in a steamer saluted us in the distance and gave us by signal her bon voyage on sunday we had prayers and service from mr marshall our chaplain a trinity college youth who made a very respectable figure  footnotes  465 see ellandonan castle in the minstrelsy of the scottish border scotts poetical works vol iv p 361  466 now the bishop of st andrews as has been already

humanity hesitated to order the military to act  473 at malta accordingly we find sir walter making inquiry regarding this arabian conjurer and writing to mr lockhart on nov 1831 in the following terms  i have got a key to the conjuring story of alexandria and grand cairo i have seen very distinct letters of sir john stoddarts son who attended three of the formal exhibitions which broke down though they were repeated afterwards with success young stoddart is an excellent arabian scholaran advantage which i understand is more imperfectly enjoyed by lord prudhoe and colonel felix much remains to be explained but the boldness of the attempt exceeds anything since the days of the automaton chessplayer or the bottle conjurer the first time shakespeare was evoked he appeared in the complexion of an arab this seems to have been owing to the first syllable of his name which resembled the arabian word sheik and suggested the idea of an arabian chief to the conjurer a gentleman named galloway has bought the secret and talks of being frightened there can be little doubt that having so far interested himself it would become his interest to put the conjurer more up to the questions likely to be asked so he was more perfect when consulted by lord prudhoe than at first when he made various blunders and when we must needs say falsum in uno falsum in omnibus as all this will come out one day i have no wish to mingle in the controversy there are still many things to explain but i think the mystery is unearthed completely  see also lanes egyptians for an account of

course though with an unfavourable wind and make it is said about forty miles progress after all this sort of navigation recommends the steamer which forces its way whether the breeze will or no  november 2wind as cross as two sticks with nasty squalls of wind and rain we keep dodging about the lizard and lands end without ever getting out of sight of these interesting terminations of old england keep the deck the whole day though bitter cold betake myself to my berth at nine though it is liker to my coffin  november 3seasickness has pretty much left us but the nights are far from voluptuous as lord stowell says after breakfast i established myself in the aftercabin to read and write as well as i can whereof this is a bad specimen  november 4the current unfavourable and the ship pitching a great deal yet the vessel on the whole keeps her course and we get on our way with hope of reaching cape finisterre when it shall please god  november 5we still creep on this petty pace from day to day without being able to make way but also without losing any meanwhile fröhlich we become freed from the nausea and disgust of the seasickness and are chirruping merrily spend the daylight chiefly on deck where the sailors are trained in exercising the great guns on a new sort of carriage called from the inventor marshalls which seems ingenious  november 6no progress today the ship begins to lay her course but makes no great way appetite of the passengers excellent which we amuse at the expense of the sea stock cold beef and biscuit i feel myself very helpless on board but everybody is ready to assist me  november 7the wind still holds fair though far from blowing steadily but by fits and variably no object to look at      one wide water all around us     all above us one grey sky483  there are neither birds in the air fish in the sea nor objects on face of the waters it is odd that though once so great a smoker i now never think on a cigar so much the better  november 8as we begin to get southward we feel a milder and more pleasing temperature and the wind becomes decidedly favourable when we have nearly traversed the famous bay of biscay we now get into a sort of trade wind blowing from the east  november 9this morning run seventy miles from twelve at night this is something like going till now bating the rolling and pitching we lay       as idle as a painted ship     upon a painted ocean  november 10wind changes and is both mild and favourable we pass cape ortegal see a wild cluster of skerries or naked rocks called berlingas rising out of the sea like mleods maidens off the isle of skye  november 11wind still more moderate and fair yet it is about eleven knots an hour we pass oporto and lisbon in the night see the coast of portugal a bare wild country with here and there a church or convent if it keeps fair this evening we make gibraltar which would be very desirable our sailors have been exercised at a species of sword exercise which recalls many recollections  november 12the favourable wind gets back to its quarters in the southwest and becomes what the italians call the sirocco abominated for its debilitating qualities i cannot say i feel them but i dreamt dreary dreams all night which are probably to be imputed to the sirocco after all it is not an uncomfortable wind to a caledonian wild and stern ink wont serve  november 13the wind continues unaccommodating all night and we see nothing although we promised ourselves to have seen gibraltar or at least tangiers this morning but we are disappointed of both tangiers reminded me of my old antiquarian friend auriol hay drummond who is consul there484 certainly if a human voice could have made its hail heard through a league or two of contending wind and wave it must have been auriol drummonds i remember him at a dinner given by some of his friends when he left edinburgh where he discharged a noble part self pulling like captain crowe for dear life for dear life against the whole boats crew speaking that is against 30 members of a drunken company and maintaining the predominance mons meg was at that time his idol he had a sort of avarice of proper names and besides half a dozen which were his legitimately he had a claim to be called garvadh which uncouth appellation he claimed on no very good authority to be the ancient name of the haysa tale i loved him dearly he had high spirits a zealous faith goodhumour and enthusiasm and it grieves me that i must pass within ten miles of him and leave him unsaluted for mercyaged what a yell of gratitude would there be i would put up with a good rough gale which would force us into tangiers and keep us there for a week but the wind is only in gentle opposition like a welldrilled spouse gibraltar we shall see this evening tangiers becomes out of the question captain says we will lie by during the night sooner than darkness shall devour such an object of curiosity so we must look sharp for the old rock  november 14the horizon is this morning full of remembrances cape st vincent cape spartel tarifa trafalgarall spiritstirring sounds are within our ken and recognised with enthusiasm both by the old sailors whose memory can reinvest them with their terrors and by the naval neophytes who hope to emulate the deeds of their fathers even a noncombatant like myself feels his heart beat faster and fuller though it is only with the feeling of the unworthy boast of the substance in the fable nos poma natamus  i begin to ask myself do i feel any symptoms of getting better from the climatewhich is deliciousand i cannot reply with the least consciousness of certainty i cannot in reason expect it should be otherwise the failure of my limbs has been gradual and it cannot be expected that an infirmity which at least a years bad weather gradually brought on should diminish before a few mild and serene days but i think there is some change to the better i certainly write easier and my spirits are better the officers compliment me on this and i think justly the difficulty will be to abstain from working hard but we will try i wrote to mr cadell today and will send my letter ashore to be put into gibraltar with the officer who leaves us at that garrison in the evening we saw the celebrated fortress which we had heard of all our lives and which there is no possibility of describing well in words though the idea i had formed of it from prints panoramas and so forth proved not very inaccurate gibraltar then is a peninsula having a tremendous precipice on the spanish sidethat is upon the north where it is united to the mainland by a low slip of land called the neutral ground the fortifications which rise on the rock are innumerable and support each other in a manner accounted a model of modern art the northern face of the rock itself is hewn into tremendous subterranean batteries called the hall of saint george and so forth mounted with guns of a large calibre but i have heard it would be difficult to use them from the effect of the report on the artillerymen the west side of the fortress is not so precipitous as the north and it is on this it has been usually assailed it bristles with guns and batteries and has at its northern extremity the town of gibraltar which seems from the sea a thriving place and from thence declines gradually to cape europa where there is a great number of remains of old caverns and towers formerly the habitation or refuge of the moors at a distance and curving into a bay lie algeciras and the little spanish town of saint roque where the spanish lines were planted during the siege485 from europa point the eastern frontier of gibraltar runs pretty close to the sea and arises in a perpendicular face and it is called the back of the rock no thought could be entertained of attacking it although every means were used to make the assault as general as possible the efforts sustained by such extraordinary means as the floating batteries were entirely directed against the defences on the west side which if they could have been continued for a few days with the same fury with which they commenced must have worn out the force of the garrison the assault had continued for several hours without success on either side when a private man of the artillery his eye on the floating batteries suddenly called with ecstasy she burns by g486 and first that vessel and then others were visibly discovered to be on fire and the besiegers game was decidedly up  we stood into the bay of gibraltar and approached the harbour firing a gun and hoisting a signal for a boat one accordingly came offa manofwars boatbut refused to have any communication with us on account of the quarantine so we can send no letters ashore and after some pourparlers mr l instead of joining his regiment must remain on board we learned an unpleasant piece of news there has been a tumult at bristol and some rioters shot it is said fifty or sixty i would flatter myself that this is rather good news since it seems to be no part of a formed insurrection but an accidental scuffle in which the mob have had the worst and which like tranent manchester and bonnymoor have always had the effect of quieting the people and alarming men of property487 the whigs will find it impossible to permit men to be plundered by a few blackguards called by them the people and education and property probably will recover an ascendency which they have only lost by faintheartedness  we backed out of the bay by means of a current to the eastward which always runs thence admiring in our retreat the lighting up the windows in the town and the various barracks or country seats visible on the rock far as we are from home the general lighting up of the windows in the evening reminds us we are still in merry old england where in reverse of its ancient law of the curfew almost every individual however humble his station takes as of right a part of the evening for enlarging the scope of his industry or of his little pleasures he trims his lamp to finish at leisure some part of his task which seems in such circumstances almost voluntary while his wife prepares the little meal which is to be its legitimate reward but this happy privilege of english freemen has ceased one happiness it is they will soon learn their error  november 15i had so much to say about gibraltar that i omitted all mention of the strait and more distant shores of spain and barbary which form the extreme of our present horizon they are highly interesting a chain of distant mountains sweep round gibraltar bold peaked well defined and deeply indented the most distinguishable points occasionally garnished with an old watchtower to afford protection against a corsair the mountains seemed like those of the first formation liker in other words to the highlands than those of the south of scotland the chains of hills in barbary are of the same character but more lofty and much more distant being i conceive a part of the celebrated ridge of atlas  gibraltar is one of the pillars of hercules ceuta on the moorish side is well known to be the other to the westward of a small fortress garrisoned by the spaniards is the hill of apes the corresponding pillar to gibraltar there is an extravagant tradition that there was once a passage under the sea from the one fortress to the other and that an adventurous governor who puzzled his way to ceuta and back again left his gold watch as a prize to him who had the courage to go to seek it  we are soon carried by the joint influence of breeze and current to the african side of the straits and coast nearly along a wild shore formed of mountains like those of spain of varied form and outline no churches no villages no marks of human hand are seen the chain of hills show a mockery of cultivation but it is only wild heath intermingled with patches of barren sand i look in vain for cattle or flocks of sheep and anne as vainly entertains hopes of seeing lions and tigers on a walk to the seashore the land of this wild country seems to have hardly a name the cape which we are doubling has one howeverthe cape of the three points that we might not be totally disappointed we saw one or two men engaged apparently in ploughing distinguished by their turbans and the long pikes which they carried dr liddell says that on former occasions he has seen flocks and shepherds but the war with france has probably laid the country waste  november 16when i waked about seven found that we had the town of oran twelve or fourteen miles off astern it is a large place on the seabeach near the bottom of a bay built close and packed together as moorish towns from fez to timbuctoo usually are a considerable hill runs behind the town which seems capable of holding 10000 inhabitants the hill up to its eastern summit is secured by three distinct lines of fortification made probably by the spanish when oran was in their possession latterly it belonged to the state of algiers but whether it has yielded to the french or not we have no means of knowing a french schooner of eighteen guns seems to blockade the harbour we show our colours and she displays hers and then resumes her cruise looking as if she resumed her blockade this would infer that the place is not yet in french hands however we have in any event no business with oran whether african or french bristol is a more important subject of consideration but i cannot learn there are papers on board one or two other towns we saw on this dreary coast otherwise nothing but a hilly coast covered with shingle and gum cistus  november 17in the morning we are off algiers of which captain pigots complaisance afforded a very satisfactory sight it is built on a sloping hill running down to the sea and on the water side is extremely strong a very strong mole or causeway enlarges the harbour by enabling them to include a little rocky island and mount immense batteries with guns of great number and size it is a wonder in the opinion of all judges that lord exmouths fleet was not altogether cut to pieces the place is of little strength to the land a high turreted wall of the old fashion is its best defence when charles v attacked algiers he landed in the bay to the east of the town and marched behind it he afterwards reached what is still called the emperors fort a building more highly situated than any part of the town and commanding the wall which surrounds it the moors did not destroy this when bourmont landed with the french unlike charles v that general disembarked to the westward of algiers and at the mouth of a small river he then marched into the interior and fetching a circuit presented himself on the northern side of the town here the moors had laid a simple stratagem for the destruction of the invading army the natives had conceived they would rush at once to the fort of the emperor which they therefore mined and expected to destroy a number of the enemy by its explosion this obvious device of war was easily avoided and general bourmont in possession of the heights from which algiers is commanded had no difficulty in making himself master of the place the french are said now to hold their conquests with difficulty owing to a general commotion among the moorish chiefs of whom the bey was the nominal sovereign to make war on these wild tribes would be to incur the disaster of the emperor julian to neglect their aggressions is scarcely possible  algiers has at first an air of diminutiveness inferior to its fame in ancient and modern times it rises up from the shore like a wedge composed of a large mass of closepacked white houses piled as thick on each other as they can stand whiteterraced roofs and without windows so the number of its inhabitants must be immense in comparison to the ground the buildings occupynot less perhaps than 30000 men even from the distance we view it the place has a singular oriental look very dear to the imagination the country around algiers is of the same hilly description with the ground on which the town is situateda bold hilly tract the shores of the bay are studded with villas and exhibit enclosures some used for agriculture some for gardens one for a mosque with a cemetery around it it is said they are extremely fertile the first example we have seen of the exuberance of the african soil the villas we are told belong to the consular establishment we saw our own who if at home put no remembrance upon us like the cambridge professor and the elephant we were a paltry beast and he would not see us though we drew within cannon shot and our fifty 36pounders might have attracted some attention the moors showed their old cruelty on a late occasion the crews of two foreign vessels having fallen into their hands by shipwreck they murdered twothirds of them in cold blood there are reports of a large body of french cavalry having shown itself without the town it is also reported by lieutenant walker488 that the consul hoisted comme de raison a british flag at his country house so our vanity is safe  we leave algiers and run along the same kind of heathy cliffy barren reach of hills terminating in high lines of serrated ridges and scarce showing an atom of cultivation but where the mouth of a river or a sheltering bay has encouraged the moors to some species of fortification  november 18still we are gliding along the coast of africa with a steady and unruffled gale the weather delicious talk of an island of wild goats by name golita this species of deerpark is free to every one for shooting uponbelongs probably to the algerines or tunisians whom circumstances do not permit to be very scrupulous in asserting their right of dominion but dr liddell has himself been present at a grand chasse of the goats so the thing is true  the wild sinuosities of the land make us each moment look to see a body of arabian cavalry wheel at full gallop out of one of these valleys scour along the beach and disappear up some other recess of the hills in fact we see a few herds but a red cow is the most formidable monster we have seen  a general day of exercise on board as well great guns as small arms it was very entertaining to see the men take to their quarters with the unanimity of an individual the marines shot a target to pieces the boarders scoured away to take their position on the yards with cutlass and pistol the exhibition continued two hours and was loud enough to have alarmed the shores where the algerines might if they had thought fit have imputed the firing to an opportune quarrel between the french and british and have shouted allah kerimgod is merciful this was the deys remark when he heard that charles x was dethroned by the parisians  we are near an african cape called bugiaroni where in the last war the toulon fleet used to trade for cattle  november 19wind favourable during night dies away in the morning and blows in flurries rather contrary the steamboat packet which left portsmouth at the same time with us passes us about seven oclock and will reach a day or two before us we are now off the coast of tunis not so high and rocky as that of algiers and apparently much more richly cultivated a space of considerable length along shore between a conical hill called mount baluty and cape bon which we passed last night is occupied by the french as a coral fishery they drop heavy shot by lines on the coral rocks and break off fragments which they fish up with nets the algerines seizing about 200 neapolitans thus employed gave rise to the bombardment of their town by lord exmouth all this coast is picturesquely covered with enclosures and buildings and is now clothed with squally weather one hill has a smoky umbrella displayed over its peak which is very like a volcanomany islets and rocks bearing the italian names of sisters brothers dogs and suchlike epithets the view is very striking with varying rays of light and of shade mingling and changing as the wind rises and falls about one oclock we pass the situation of ancient carthage but saw no ruins though such are said to exist a good deal of talk about two ancient lakes called i knew the name but little more we passed in the evening two rocky islands or skerries rising straight out of the water called gli fratelli or the brothers  november 20a fair wind all night running at the merry rate of nine knots an hour in the morning we are in sight of the highest island pantellaria which the sicilians use as a state prison a species of botany bay we are about thirty miles from the burning islandi mean grahamsbut neither that nor etna make their terrors visible at noon grahams island appears greatly diminished since last accounts we got out the boats and surveyed this new production of the earth with great interest think i have got enough to make a letter to our royal society and friends at edinburgh489 lat 37° 10 31 n long 12° 40 15 e lying north and south by compass by mr bokely the captains clerks measurements returned on board at dinnertime  november 21indifferent night in the morning we are running off gozo a subordinate island to malta intersected with innumerable enclosures of drystone dykes similar to those used in selkirkshire and this likeness is increased by the appearance of sundry square towers of ancient days in former times this was believed to be calypsos island and the cave of the enchantress is still shown we saw the entrance from the deck as rude a cavern as ever opened out of a granite rock the place of st pauls shipwreck is also shown no doubt on similarly respectable authority  at last we opened malta an island or rather a city like no other in the world the seaport formerly the famous valetta comes down to the seashore on the one side lay the knights on the other side lay the turks who finally got entire possession of it while the other branch remained in the power of the christians mutual cruelties were exercised the turks seizing on the survivors of the knights who had so long defended st elmo cut the maltese cross on the bodies of the slain and tying them to planks let them drift with the receding tide into the other branch of the harbour still defended by the christians the grandmaster in resentment of this cruelty caused his turkish prisoners to be decapitated and their heads thrown from mortars into the camp of the infidels490  november 22today we entered malta harbour to quarantine which is here very strict we are condemned by the board of quarantine to ten days imprisonment or sequestration and go in the barhams boat to our place of confinement built by a grandmaster named manuel491 for a palace for himself and his retinue it is spacious and splendid but not comfortable the rooms connected one with another by an arcade into which they all open and which forms a delightful walk if i was to live here a sufficient time i think i could fit the apartments up so as to be handsome and even imposing but at present they are only kept as barracks for the infirmary or lazaretto a great number of friends come to see me who are not allowed to approach nearer than a yard this as the whole affair is a farce is ridiculous enough we are guarded by the officers of health in a peculiar sort of livery or uniform with yellow neck who stroll up and down with every man that stirsand so mend the matter492 my friends captain and mrs dawson the daughter and soninlaw of the late lord kinnedder occupying as military quarters one end of the manuel palace have chosen to remain though thereby subjected to quarantine and so become our fellows in captivity our good friend captain pigot hearing some exaggerated report of our being uncomfortably situated came himself in his barge with the purpose of reclaiming his passengers rather than we should be subjected to the least inconvenience we returned our cordial thanks but felt we had already troubled him sufficiently we dine with captain and mrs dawson sleep in our new quarters and notwithstanding mosquito curtains and iron bedsteads are sorely annoyed by vermin the only real hardship we have to complain of since the tossing on the bay of biscay and which nothing could save us from  les maltois ne se mariaient jamais dans le mois de mai ils espérèrent si mal des ouvrages de tout genre commencé durant son cours quils ne se faisaient pas couper dhabits pendant ce mois  the same superstition still prevails in scotland  november 23this is a splendid town the sea penetrates it in several places with creeks formed into harbours surrounded by buildings and these again covered with fortifications the streets are of very unequal height and as there has been no attempt at lowering them the greatest variety takes place between them and the singularity of the various buildings leaning on each other in such a bold picturesque and uncommon manner suggests to me ideas for finishing abbotsford by a screen on the west side of the old barn and with a fanciful wall decorated with towers to enclose the bleaching greenwatchtowers such as these of which i can get drawings while i am here employed the forenoon in writing to lockhart i am a little at a loss what account to give of myself better i am decidedly in spirit but rather hampered by my companions who are neither desirous to follow my amusements nor anxious that i should adopt theirs i am getting on with this siege of malta very well i think if i continue it will be ready in a very short time and i will get the opinion of others and if my charm hold i will be able to get home through italyand take up my own trade again  november 24we took the quarantine boat and visited the outer harbour or great port in which the ships repose when free from their captivity the british ships of war are therea formidable spectacle as they all carry guns of great weight if they go up the levant as reported they are a formidable weight in the bucket i was sensible while looking at them of the truth of coopers description of the beauty of their build their tapering rigging and masts and how magnificent it looks as      hulking and vast the gallant warship rides  we had some pride in looking at the barham once in a particular manner our own abode captain pigot and some of his officers dined with us at our house of captivity by a special grace our abode here is to be shortened one day so we leave on monday first which is an indulgence today we again visit draguts point the guardians who attend to take care that we quarantines do not kill the people whom we meet tell some stories of this famous corsair but i scarce can follow their arabic i must learn it though for the death of dragut493 would be a fine subject for a poem but in the meantime i will proceed with my knights  november 2530494by permission of the quarantine board we were set at liberty and lost no time in quitting the dreary fort of don manuel with all its mosquitoes and its thousands of lizards which stand shaking their heads at you like their brother in the new arabian tale of daft jock my son and daughter are already much tired of the imprisonment i myself cared less about it but it is unpleasant to be thought so very unclean and capable of poisoning a whole city we took our guardians boat and again made a round of the harbour were met by mrs bathursts495 carriage and carried to my very excellent apartment at beverleys hotel in passing i saw something of the city and very comical it was but more of that hereafter at or about four oclock we went to our old habitation the barham having promised again to dine in the ward room where we had a most handsome dinner and were dismissed at halfpast six after having the pleasure to receive and give a couple hours of satisfaction i took the boat from the chair and was a little afraid of the activity of my assistants but it all went off capitally went to beverleys and bed in quiet  at two oclock mrs col bathurst transported me to see the metropolitan church of st john by far the most magnificent place i ever saw in my life its huge and ample vaults are of the gothic order the floor is of marble each stone containing the inscription of some ancient knight adorned with a patent of mortality and an inscription recording his name and family for instance one knight i believe had died in the infidels prison to mark his fate one stone amid the manycoloured pavement represents a door composed of grates iron grates i mean displaying behind them an interior which a skeleton is in vain attempting to escape from by bursting the bars if you conceive he has pined in his fetters there for centuries till dried in the ghastly image of death himself it is a fearful imagination the roof which bends over this scene of death is splendidly adorned with carving and gilding while the varied colours and tinctures both above and beneath free from the tinselly effect which might have been apprehended acquire a solemnity in the dim religious light which they probably owe to the lapse of time besides the main aisle which occupies the centre there is added a chapterhouse in which the knights were wont to hold their meetings at the upper end of this chapterhouse is the fine martyrdom of st john the baptist by caravaggio though this has been disputed on the left hand of the body of the church lie a series of subordinate aisles or chapels built by the devotion of the different languages496 and where some of the worthies inhabit the vaults beneath the other side of the church is occupied in the same manner one chapel in which the communion was imparted is splendidly adorned by a row of silver pillars which divided the worshippers from the priest immense riches had been taken from this chapel of the holy sacrament by the french a golden lamp of great size and ornaments to the value of 50000 crowns are mentioned in particular the rich railing had not escaped the soldiers rapacity had it not been painted to resemble wood i must visit this magnificent church another time today i have done it at the imminent risk of a bad fall we drove out to see a maltese village highly ornamented in the usual taste mrs bathurst was so good as to take me in her carriage we dined with colonel bathurst  november 26i visited my old and much respected friend mr john hookham frere497 and was much gratified to see him the same man i had always known himperhaps a little indolent but thats not much a good tory as ever when the love of many is

furnished a fair proportion i mean viewed in either way i was introduced to a mad italian improvisatore who was with difficulty prevented from reciting a poem in praise of the king and imposing a crown upon my head nolens volens some of the officers easily conceiving how disagreeable this must have been to a quiet man got me out of the scrape and i got home about midnight but remain unpoetised and unspeeched  november 28i have made some minutes some observations and could do something at my siege but i do not find my health gaining ground i visited frere at sant antonio a beautiful place with a splendid garden which mr frere will never tire of unless some of his family come to carry him home by force  november 29lady hotham was kind enough to take me a drive and we dined with thema very pleasant party i picked up some anecdotes of the latter siege  make another pilgrimage escorted by captain pigot and several of his officers we took a more accurate view of this splendid structure church of st john i went down into the vaults and made a visiting acquaintance with la valette498 whom greatly to my joy i found most splendidly provided with a superb sepulchre of bronze on

despised though at the expense of protracting the news from scotland which i engage to provide for in case of the worst by offering mr cadell a new romance to be called the siege of malta which if times be as they were when i came off should be thankfully received at a round sum paying back not only what is overdrawn but supplying finances during the winter  december 10 naplesi ought to say that before leaving malta i went to wait on the archbishop a fine old gentleman very handsome and one of the priests who commanded the maltese in their insurrection against the french i took the freedom to hint that as he had possessed a journal of this blockade it was but due to his country and himself to give it to the public and offered my assistance he listened to my suggestion and seemed pleased with the proposal which i repeated more than once and apparently with success next day the bishop returned my visit in full state attended by his clergy and superbly dressed in costume the pearls being very fine the name of this fine old dignitary of the romish church is don francis caruana bishop of malta  the last night we were at malta we experienced a rude shock of an earthquake which alarmed me though i did not know what it was it was said to foretell that the ocean which had given birth to grahams island had like pelops devoured its own offspring and we are told it is not now visible and will be perhaps hid from those who risk the main but as we did not come near its latitude we cannot say from our own knowledge that the news is true i found my old friend frere as fond as ever of old ballads he took me out almost every day and favoured me with recitations of the cid and the continuation of whistlecraft he also acquainted me that he had made up to mr coleridge the pension of £200 from the board of literature499 out of his own fortune  december 13 napleswe left malta on this day and after a most picturesque voyage between the coast of sicily and malta arrived here on the 17th where we were detained for quarantine whence we were not dismissed till the day before christmas i saw charles to my great joy and agreed to dine with his master right hon mr hill500

quite understand the freedom his flag is treated with and could he find law for so doing would try his long thirtysix pounders on the town of naples and its castles not to mention a sloop of ten guns which has ostentatiously entered the bay to assist them lord knows we would make ducks and drakes of the whole party with the barhams terrible battery  there is a new year like to begin and no news

sightseeing have the pleasure to meet mr502 and mrs laingmeason of lindertis and have their advice and assistance and company in our wanderings almost every day mr meason has made some valuable remarks on the lava where the villas of the middle ages are founded the lava shows at least upon the ancient maritime villas of the romans so the boot of the moderns galls the kibe of the age preceding them the reason seems to be the very great durability with which the romans finished their domestic architecture of maritime arches by which they admitted the sea into their lower houses503                                       we were run away with into the grotto very nearly but luckily stopped before we entered and so saved our lives we have seen the strada nuovaa new access of extreme

and upwards is still a most interesting man a face formed to express an interest in whatever passes caressing manners and a total absence of that rigid stiffness which hardens the heart of the old and converts them into a sort of petrifaction apparently his foible was a fondness for cats one of them a superb brindled persian cat is a great beauty and seems a particular favourite i think we would have got on well together if he could have spoken english or i french or latin but hélas i once saw at lord yarmouths house a persian cat but not quite so fine as that of the bishop he gave me a latin

forenoon in this fine country sir william gell a very pleasant man one of my chief cicerones lord hertford comes to naples i am glad to keep up an old acquaintance made in the days of george iv  he has got a breed from maida of which i gave him a puppy there was a great crowd at the palazzo which all persons attended being the kings birthday the apartments are magnificent and the various kinds of persons who came to pay court were splendid i went with the boys as brigadiergeneral of the archers guard wore a very decent green uniform laced at the cuffs and pantaloons and looked as well as sixty could make it out when sworded and feathered comme il faut i passed well enough very much afraid of a fall on the slippery floor but escaped that disgrace the ceremony was very long i was introduced to many distinguished persons and but for the want of language got on well enough the king spoke to me about five minutes of which i hardly understood five words i answered him in a speech of the same length and ill be bound equally unintelligible we made the general keytone of the harangue la belle langue et le beau ciel of sa majesté very fine dresses very many diamonds  a pretty spanish ambassadress countess da costa and her husband saw the countess de lebzeltern who has made our acquaintance and seems to be very clever i will endeavour to see her again introduced to another russian countess of the diplomacy got from court about two oclock i should have mentioned that i had a letter from skene508 and one from cadell dated as far back as 2d december a monstrous time ago which yet puts a period to my anxiety i have written to cadell for particulars and supplies and besides have written a great many pages of the siege of malta which i think will succeed  january 1623i think £200 a month or thereby will do very well and it is no great advance  another piece of intelligence was certainly to be expected but now it has come afflicts us much poor johnny lockhart the boy is gone whom we have made so much of i could not have borne it better than i now do and i might have borne it much worse509                                       i went one evening to the opera to see that amusement in its birthplace which is now so widely received over europe the opera house is superb but can seldom be quite full on this night however it was the guards citizens and all persons dependent on the court or having anything to win or lose by it are expected to take places liberally and applaud with spirit the king bowed much on entrance and was received in a popular manner which he has no doubt deserved having relaxed many of his fathers violent persecutions against the liberals made in some degree an amnesty and employed many of this character he has made efforts to lessen his expenses but then he deals in military affairs and that swallows up his savings and heaven only knows whether he will bring neapolitans to fight which the martinet system alone will never do his health is undermined by epileptic fits which with his great corpulence make men throw their thoughts on his brother prince charles it is a pity the king is only twoandtwenty years old  the opera bustled off without any remarkable music and so far as i understand the language no poetry and except the coup dœil which was magnificent it was poor work it was on the subject of constantine and crispusmarvellous good matter i assure you i came home at halfpast nine without waiting the ballet but i was dogsick of the whole of it went to the studij today i had no answer to my memorial to the minister of the interior which it seems is necessary to make any copies from the old romances i find it is an affair of state and monsieur  can only hope it will be granted in two or three daysto a man that may leave naples tomorrow he offers me a loan of what books i need annals included but this is also a delay of two or three days i think really the italian men of letters do not know the use of time made by those of other places but i must have patience in the course of my return home i called by advice of my valet de place at a booksellers where he said all the great messieurs went for books it had very little the air of a place of such resort being kept in a garret above a coachhouse here some twenty or thirty odd volumes were produced by an old woman but nothing that was mercantile so i left them for lorenzos learned friends and yet i was sorry too for the lady who showed them to me was very civil and understanding that i was the famous chevalier carried her kindness as far as i could desire the italians understand nothing of being in a hurry but perhaps it is their way510  january 24the king grants the favour asked to be perfect i should have the books out of the room but this seems to hurt monsieur delicteriis as he kind and civil as he is would hardly allow me to take my labours out of the studij where there are hosts of idlers and echoes and askers and no understanders of askers i progress however as the americans say i have found that sir william gells amanuensis is at present disengaged and that he is quite the man for copying the romances which is a plain black letter of 1377 at the cheap and easy rate of 3 quattrons a day i am ashamed at the lowness of the remuneration but it will dine him capitally with a share of a bottle of wine or by r lady a whole one if he likes it and thrice the sum would hardly do that in england but we dawdle and that there is no avoiding i have found another object in the studijthe language of naples  jany 25one work in this dialect for such it is was described to me as a history of ancient neapolitan legendsquite in my way and it proves to be a dumpy fat 12mo edition of mother gooses tales511 with my old friends puss in boots bluebeard and almost the whole stock of this very collection if this be the original of this charming book it is very curious for it shows the right of naples to the authorship but there are french editions very early alsofor there are twowhether french or italian i am uncertainof different dates both having claims to the original edition each omitting some tales which the other has  to what common original we are to refer them the lord knows i will look into this very closely and if this same copiator is worth his ears he can help me my friend mr d will aid me but i doubt he hardly likes my familiarity with the department of letters in which he has such an extensive and valuable charge yet he is very kind and civil and promises me the loan of a neapolitan vocabulary which will set me up for the attack upon mother goose spirit of tom thumb assist me i could i think make a neat thing of this obnoxious to ridicule perhapswhat then the author of ma sœur anne was a clever man and his tale will remain popular in spite of all gibes and flouts soever so vamos caracci if it was not for the trifling and dawdling peculiar to this country i should have time enough but their trifling with time is the devil i will try to engage mr gell in two researches in his way and more in mine namely the andrea ferrara and the bonnet piece512 mr keppel craven says andrea de ferraras513 are frequent in italy plenty to do if we had alert assistance but gell and laing meason have both their own matters to puzzle out and why should they mind my affairs the weather is very cold and i am the reverse of the idiot boy      for as my bodys growing worse     my mind is growing better514  of this i am distinctly sensible and thank god that the mist attending this whoreson apoplexy is wearing off  i went to the studij and copied bevis of hampton about two pages for a pattern from thence to sir william gell and made an appointment at the studij with his writer tomorrow at ten when i trust i shall find delicteriis there but the gentleman with the classical name is rather kind and friendly in his neighbours behalf515  january 26this day arrived for the first

three good things on which i may advance with spirit and with palmy hopes on the part of cadell and myself he thinks he will soon cry victoria on the bet about his hat he was to get a new one when i had paid off all my debts i can hardly now that i am assured all is well again form an idea to myself that i could think it was otherwise  and yet i think it is the public that are mad for passing those two volumes but i will not be the first to cry them down in the market for i have others in hand which judged with equal favour will make fortunes of themselves let me see what i have on the

prolongation of that famous mountain another chain of mountains seems to intersect our course in an opposite direction and descends upon the town of castellamare different from the range of heights which is prolonged from vesuvius this second which runs to castellamare is entirely composed of granite and as is always the case with mountains of this formation betrays no trace of volcanic agency its range was indeed broken and split up into specimens of rocks of most romantic appearance and great variety displaying granite rock as the principal part of its composition the country on which these hills border is remarkable for its powers of vegetation and produces vast groves of vine elm chestnut and similar trees which grow when stuck in by cuttings the vines produce lacryma christi in great quantitiesnot a bad wine though the stranger requires to be used to it the seashore of the bay of naples forms the boundary on the right of the country through which our journey lies and we continue to approach to the granite chain of eminences which stretch before us as if to bar our passage  as we advanced to meet the great barrier of cliffs a feature becomes opposed to us of a very pronounced character which seems qualified to interrupt our progress a road leading straight across the branch of hills is carried up the steepest part of the mountain ascending by a succession of zigzags which the french laid by scale straight up the hill the tower is situated upon an artificial eminence worked to a point and placed in a defensible position between two hills about the same height the access to which the defenders of the pass could effectually prohibit  sir william gell whose knowledge of the antiquities of this country is extremely remarkable acquainted us with the history  in the middle ages the pasturages on the slope of these hills especially on the other side belonged to the rich republic of amain who built this tower as an exploratory gazeeboo from which they could watch the motions of the saracens who were wont to annoy them with plundering excursions but after this fastness was built the people of amalfi usually defeated and chastised them the ride over the opposite side of the mountain was described as so uncommonly pleasant as made me long to ride it with assistance of a pony that however was impossible we arrived at a country house near a large town situated in a ravine or hollow which was called la cava from some concavities which it exhibited  we were received by miss whyte an english lady who has settled at la cava and she afforded us the warmest hospitality that is consistent with a sadly cold chilling house they may say what they like of the fine climate of naplesunquestionably they cannot say too much in its favour but yet when a day or two of cold weather does come the inhabitants are without the means of parrying the temporary inclemency which even a scotsman would scorn to submit to however warm or cold to bed we went and rising next morning at seven we left la cava and making something like a sharp turn backwards but keeping nearer to the gulf of salerno than in yesterdays journey and nearer to its shore we had a good road towards paestum and in defiance of a cold drizzling day we went on at a round pace the country through which we travelled was wooded and stocked with wild animals towards the fall of the hills and we saw at a nearer distance a large swampy plain pastured by a singularly bizarre but fiercelooking buffalo though it might maintain a much preferable stock this palace of barranco was anciently kept up for the kings sport but any young man having a certain degree of interest is allowed to share in the chase which it is no longer an object to preserve the guest however if he shoots a deer or a buffalo or wild boar must pay the keeper at a certain fixed price not much above its price in the market which a sportsman would hardly think above its worth for game of his own killing the town of salerno is a beautiful seaport town and it is as it were wrapt in an italian cloak hanging round the limbs or to speak common sense the new streets which they are rebuilding we made no stop at salerno but continued to traverse the great plain of that name within sight of the sea which is chiefly pastured by that queerlooking brute the buffalo concerning which they have a notion that it returns its value sooner and with less expense of feeding than any other animal  at length we came to two streams which join their forces and would seem to flow across the plain to the bottom of the hills one however flows so flat as almost scarcely to move and sinking into a kind of stagnant pool is swallowed up by the earth without proceeding any further until after remaining buried for two or three miles underground it again bursts forth to the light and resumes its course when we crossed this stream by a bridge which they are now repairing we entered a spacious plain very like that which we had left and displaying a similar rough and savage cultivation here savage herds were under the guardianship of shepherds as wild as they were themselves clothed in a species of sheepskins and carrying a sharp spear with which they herd and sometimes kill their buffaloes their farmhouses are in very poor order and with every mark of poverty and they have the character of being moved to dishonesty by anything like opportunity of this there was a fatal instance but so well avenged that it is not like to be repeated till it has long faded out of memory the story i am assured happened exactly as followsa certain mr hunt lately married to a lady of his own age and seeming to have had what is too often the englishmans characteristic of more money than wit arrived at naples a year or two ago en famille and desirous of seeing all the sights in the vicinity of this celebrated place among others paestum was not forgot at one of the poor farmhouses where they stopped the inhabitant set her eyes on a toilet apparatus which was composed of silver and had the appearance of great value the woman who spread this report addressed herself to a youth who had been under arms and undoubtedly he and his companions showed no more hesitation than the person with whom the idea had originated five fellows not known before this time for any particular evil agreed to rob the english gentleman of the treasure of which he had made such an imprudent display they were attacked by the banditti in several parties but the principal attack was directed to mr hunts carriage a servant of that gentleman being as well as himself pulled out of the carriage and watched by those who had undertaken to conduct this bad deed the man who had been the soldier probably to keep up his courage began to bully talk violently and strike the valet de place who screamed out in a plaintive manner do not injure me his master hoping to make some impression said do not hurt my servant to which the principal brigand replied if he dares to resist shoot him the man who stood over mr hunt unfortunately took the captain at the word and his shot mortally wounded the unfortunate gentleman and his wife who both died next day at our landladys miss whyte who had the charity to receive them that they might hear their own language on their deathbed the neapolitan government made the most uncommon exertions the whole of the assassins were taken within a fortnight and executed within a week afterwards in this wild spot rendered unpleasing by the sad remembrance of so inhuman an accident and the cottages which served for refuge for so wretched and wild a people exist the celebrated ruins of paestum being without arms of any kind the situation was a dreary one and though i can scarce expect now to defend myself effectually yet the presence of illegible would have been an infinite cordial the ruins are of very great antiquity which for a very long time has not been suspected as it was never supposed that the sybarites a luxurious people were early possessed of a style of architecture simple chaste and inconceivably grand which was lost before the time of augustus who is said by suetonius to have undertaken a journey on purpose to visit these remains of an architecture the most simple and massive of which italy at least has any other specimen the greeks have specimens of the same kind but they are composed not of stone like paestum but of marble all this has been a discovery of recent date the ruins which exist without exhibiting much demolition are three in number the first is a temple of immense size having a portico of the largest columns of the most awful species of classic architecture the roof which was composed of immense stones was destroyed but there are remains of the cella contrived for the sacrifices to which the priests and persons of high office were alone admitted  a piece of architecture more massive without being cumbrous or heavy was never invented by a mason  a second temple in the same style was dedicated to ceres as the large one was to neptune on whose dominion they looked and who was the tutelar deity of paestum and so called from one of his greek names the fane of ceres is finished with the greatest accuracy and beauty of proportion and taste and in looking upon it i forgot all the unpleasant feelings which at first oppressed me the third was not a temple but a basilica or species of townhouse as it was called having a third row of pillars running up the middle between the two which surrounded the sides and were common to the basilica and temple both these surprising public edifices have therefore all a resemblance to each other though also points of distinction if sir william gell makes clear his theory he will throw a most precious light on the origin of civilisation proving that the sciences have not sprung at once into light and life but rose gradually with extreme purity and continued to be practised best by those who first invented them full of these reflections we returned to our hospitable miss whyte in a drizzling evening but unassassinated and our hearts completely filled with the magnificence of what we had seen miss whyte had in the meanwhile by her interest at la trinità with the abbot obtained us permission to pay a visit to him and an invitation indeed to dinner which only the weather and the health of sir william gell and myself prevented our accepting after breakfast therefore on the 18th of march we set out for the convent situated about two or three miles from the town in a very large ravine not unlike the bed of the rosslyn river and traversed by roads which from their steepness and precipitancy are not at all laudable but the views were beautiful and changing incessantly while the spring advancing was spreading her green mantle over rock and tree and making that beautiful which was lately a blighted and sterile thicket the convent of trinità itself holds a most superb situation on the projection of an ample rock it is a large edifice but not a handsome onethe monks reserving their magnificence for their churchesbut was surrounded by a circuit of fortifications which when there was need were manned by the vassals of the convent in the style of the feudal system this was in some degree the case at the present day the abbot a gentlemanlike and respectablelooking man attended by several of his monks received us with the greatest politeness and conducted us to the building where we saw two great sculptured vases or more properly sarcophagi of marble well carved in the antique style and adorned with the story of meleager they were in the shape of a large bath and found i think at paestum the old church had passed to decay about a hundred years ago when the present fabric was built it is very beautifully arranged and worthy of the place which is eminently beautiful and of the community who are benedictinesthe most gentlemanlike order in the roman church  we were conducted to the private repertory of the chapel which contains a number of interesting deeds granted by sovereigns of the grecian norman and even saracen descent one from roger king of sicily extended his majestys protection to some half dozen men of consequence whose names attested their saracenism  in all the society i have been since i commenced this tour i chiefly regretted on the present occasion the not having refreshed my italian for the purpose of conversation i should like to have conversed with the churchmen very much and they seem to have the same inclination but it is too late to be thought of though i could read italian well once the church might boast of a grand organ with fiftyseven stops all which we heard played by the ingenious organist we then returned to miss whytes for the evening ate a mighty dinner and battled cold weather as we might  in further remarks on paestum i may say there is a city wall in wonderful preservation one of the gates of which is partly entire and displays the figure of a syren under the architrave but the antiquity of the sculpture is doubted though not that of the inner part of the gateso at least thinks sir william our best authority on such matters many antiquities have been and many more probably will be discovered paestum is a place which adds dignity to the peddling trade of the ordinary antiquarian  march 19this morning we set off at seven for naples we observed remains of an aqueduct in a narrow apparently designed for the purpose of leading water to la cava but had no time to conjecture on the subject and took our road back to pompeii and passed through two towns of the same name nocera dei cristiani and nocera dei pagani521 in the latter village the saracens obtained a place of refuge from which it takes the name it is also said that the circumstance is kept in memory by the complexion and features of this second nocera which are peculiarly of the african caste and tincture after we passed pompeii where the continued severity of the weather did not permit us according to our purpose to take another survey we saw in the adjacent village between us and portici the scene of two assassinations still kept in remembrance the one i believe was from the motive of plunder the head of the assassin was set up after his execution upon a pillar which still exists and it remained till the skull rotted to pieces the other was a story less in the common style and of a more interesting charactera farmer of an easy fortune and who might be supposed to leave to his daughter a very pretty girl and an only child a fortune thought in the village very considerable she was under the hope of sharing such a prize made up to by a young man in the neighbourhood handsome active and of a very good general character he was of that sort of person who are generally successful among women and the girl was supposed to have encouraged his addresses but her father on being applied to gave him a direct and positive refusal the gallant resolved to continue his addresses in hopes of overcoming this obstacle by his perseverance but the fathers opposition seemed only to increase by the lovers pertinacity at length as the father walked one evening smoking his pipe upon the terrace before his door the lover unhappily passed by and struck with the instant thought that the obstacle to the happiness of his life was now entirely in his own power he rushed upon the father pierced him with three mortal stabs of his knife and killed him dead on the spot and made his escape to the mountains what was most remarkable was that he was protected against the police who went as was their duty in quest of him by the inhabitants of the neighbourhood who afforded him both shelter and such food as he required looking on him less as a wilful criminal than an unfortunate man who had been surprised by a strong and almost irresistible temptation so congenial at this moment is the love of vengeance to an italian bosom and though chastised in general by severe punishment so much are criminals sympathised with by the community  march 20i went with miss talbot and mr lushington and his sister to the great and celebrated church of san domenico maggiore which is the most august of the dominican churches they once possessed eighteen shrines in this part of naples it contains the tomb of st thomas aquinas and also the tombs of the royal family which remain in the vestry there are some large boxes covered with yellow velvet which contain their remains and which stand ranged on a species of shelf formed by the heads of a set of oaken presses which contain the vestments of the monks the pictures of the kings are hung above their respective boxes containing their bones without any other means of preserving them at the bottom of the lofty and narrow room is the celebrated marquis di pescara one of charles vs most renowned generals who commanded at the battle of pavia the church itself is very large and extremely handsome with many fine marble tombs in a very good style of architecture the time being now nearly the second week in lent the church was full of worshippers       while at naples sir walter wrote frequently to his daughter to      mr cadell mr laidlaw and mr lockhart the latter says some      of these letters were of a very melancholy cast for the dream      about his debts being all settled was occasionally broken one may      be given here it is undated but was written some time after      receiving the news of the death of his little grandson and shows      the tender relations which existed between sir walter and his      soninlaw       my dear lockharti have written with such regularity that  i      will not recur to this painful subject i hope also i have found      you both persuaded that the best thing you can do both of you is      to come out here where you would find an inestimable source of      amusement many pleasant people and living in very peaceful and      easy society i wrote you a full account of my own matters but i      have now more complete information i am ashamed for the first      time in my life of the two novels but since the pensive public      have taken them there is no more to be said but to eat my pudding      and to hold my tongue another thing of great interest requires to      be specially mentioned you may remember a work in which our dear      and accomplished friend lady louisa condescended to take an oar      and which she has handled most admirably it is a supposed set of      extracts relative to james vi from a collection in james vis      time the costume  admirably preserved and like the      fashionable wigs more natural than ones own hair this with the      lives of the novelists and some other fragments of my wreck went      ashore in constables and were sold off to the highest bidder      viz to cadell for himself and me i wrote one or two fragments      in the same style which i wish should according to original      intention appear without a name and were they fairly lightly let      off there is no fear of their making a blaze i sent the whole      packet either to yourself or cadell with the request the copy      which i conclude is in your hands by the time this reaches you      might be set up as speedily and quietly as possible taking some      little care to draw the public attention to you and consulting      lady louisa about the proofs the fun is that our excellent friend      had forgot the whole affair till i reminded her of her kindness      and was somewhat inclined like lady teazle to deny the butler and      the coachhorse i have no doubt however she will be disposed to      bring the matter to an end the mode of publication i fancy you      will agree should rest with cadell so providing that the copy      come to hand which it usually does though not very regularly you      will do me the kindness to get it out my story of malta will be      with you by the time you have finished the letters and if it      succeeds it will in a great measure enable me to attain the long      projected and very desirable object of clearing me from all old      encumbrances and expiring as rich a man as i could desire in my own      freehold and when you recollect that this has been wrought out in      six years the sum amounting to at least £120000 it is somewhat      of a novelty in literature i shall be as happy and rich as i      please for the last days of my life and play the good papa with      my family without thinking on pounds shillings and pence cadell      with so fair a prospect before him is in high spirits as you will      suppose but i had a most uneasy time from the interruption of our      correspondence however thank god it is all as well as i could      wish and a great deal better than i ventured to hope after the      siege of malta i intend to close the series of waverley with a      poem in the style of the lay or rather of the lady of the      lake to be a lenvoy or final postscript to these tales the      subject is a curious tale of chivalry belonging to rhodes sir      frederick adam will give me a cast of a steamboat to visit greece      and you will come and go with me we live in a palazzo which with      a coach and the supporters thereof does not table included cost      £120 or £130 a month so you will add nothing to our expenses but      give us the great pleasure of assisting you when i fear literary      things have a bad time we will return to europe through germany      and see what peradventure we shall behold i have written      repeatedly to you on this subject for you would really like this      country extremely you cannot tread on it but you set your foot      upon some ancient history and you cannot make scruple as it is      the same thing whether you or i are paymaster my health continues      good and bettering as the yankees say i have gotten a choice      manuscript of old english romances left here by richard and for      which i know i have got a lad can copy them at a shilling a day      the king has granted me liberty to carry it home with me which is      very goodnatured i expect to secure something for the roxburghe      club our posts begin to get more regular i hope dear baby is      getting better of its accident poor soullove to sophia and      walter       your affectionate father       walter scott  footnotes  520 of this visit to pompeii sir w gell sayssir walter viewed the whole with a poets eye not that of an antiquarian exclaiming frequently the city of the dead  he examined however with more interest the splendid mosaic representing a combat of the greeks and the persianslife vol x p 159  521 the places are now known as nocera superiore and nocera inferiore     april   april 15 naplesi am on the eve of leaving naples after a residence of three or four months my strength strongly returning though the weather has been very uncertain what with the interruption occasioned by the cholera and other inconveniences i have not done much i have sent home only the letters by ll stuart and three volumes of the siege of malta i sent them by lord cowpers sonmr cowper returning his leave being outand two chests of books by the messrs turner malta who are to put them on board a vessel to be forwarded to mr cadell through whittaker i have hopes they will come to hand safe i have bought a small closing carriage warranted new and english cost me £200 for the convenience of returning home it carries anne charles and the two servants and we start tomorrow morning for rome after which we shall be starting homeward for the greek scheme is blown up as sir frederick adam is said to be going to madras so he will be unable to send a frigate as promised i have spent on the expenses of medical persons and books etc a large sum yet not excessive  meantime we may have to add a curious journey of it the brigands of whom there are so many stories are afloat once more and many carriages stopped a curious and popular work would be a history of these ruffians washington irving has attempted something of the kind but the person attempting this should be an italian perfectly acquainted with his country character and manners mr r an apothecary told me a singular occurrence which happened in calabria about six years ago and which i may set down just now as coming from a respectable authority though i do not vouch it                                       death of il bizarro  this man was called from his wily but inexorable temper il bizarro ie the bizar he was captain of a gang of banditti whom he governed by his own authority till he increased them to 1000 men both on foot and horseback whom he maintained in the mountains of calabria between the french and neapolitans both of which he defied and pillaged the country high rewards were set upon his head to very little purpose as he took care to guard himself against being betrayed by his own gang the common fate of those banditti who become great in their vocation at length a french colonel whose name i have forgot occupied the country of bizarro with such success that he formed a cordon around him and his party and included him between the folds of a military column wellnigh driven to submit himself the robber with his wife a very handsome woman and a child of a few months old took a position beneath the arch of an old bridge and by an escape almost miraculous were not perceived by a strong party whom the french maintained on the top of the arch night at length came without a discovery which every moment might have made when it became quite dark the brigand enjoining strictest silence on the female and child resolved to steal from his place of shelter and as they issued forth kept his hand on the childs throat but as when they began to move the child naturally cried its father in a rage stiffened his grip so relentlessly that the poor infant never offended more in the same manner this horrid act led to the conclusion of the robbers life  his wife had never been very fond of him though he trusted her more than any who approached him she had been originally the wife of another man murdered by her second husband which second marriage she was compelled to undergo and to affect at least the conduct of an affectionate wife in their wanderings she alone knew where he slept for the night he left his men in a body upon the top of an open hill round which they set watches he then went apart into the woods with his wife and having chosen a glenan obscure and deep thicket of the woods there took up his residence for the night a large calabrian sheepdog his constant attendant was then tied to a tree at some distance to secure his slumbers and having placed his carabine within reach of his lair he consigned himself to such sleep as belongs to his calling by such precautions he had secured his rest for many years  but after the death of the child the measure of his offence towards the unhappy mother was full to the brim and her thoughts became determined on revenge one evening he took up his quarters for the night with these precautions but without the usual success he had laid his carabine near him and betaken himself to rest as usual when his partner arose from his side and ere he became sensible she had done so she seized his carabine and discharging it in his bosom ended at once his life and crimes she finished her work by cutting off the brigands head and carrying it to the principal town of the province where she delivered it to the police and claimed the reward attached to his head which was paid accordingly this female still lives a stately dangerouslooking woman yet scarce ill thought of considering the provocation  the dog struggled extremely to get loose on hearing the shot some say the female shot it others that in its rage it very nearly gnawed through the stout young tree to which it was tied he was worthy of a better master  the distant encampment of the band was disturbed by the firing of the bizarros carabine at midnight they ran through the woods to seek the captain but finding him lifeless and headless they became so much surprised that many of them surrendered to the government and relinquished their trade and the band of bizarro as it lived by his ingenuity broke up by his death  a story is told nearly as horrible as the above respecting the cruelty of this bandit which seems to entitle him to be called one of the most odious wretches of his name a french officer who had been active in the pursuit of him fell into his hands and was made to die the death of marsyas or saint polycarpthat is the period being the middle of summer he was flayed alive and being smeared with honey was exposed to all the intolerable insects of a southern sky the corps were also informed where they might find their officer if they thought proper to send for him as more than two days elapsed before the wretched man was found nothing save his miserable relics could be discovered  i do not warrant these stories but such are told currently  tour from naples to rome april 16having remained several months at naples we resolved to take a tour to rome during the holy week and view the ecclesiastical shows which take place although diminished in splendour by the popes poverty so on the 15th we set out from naples my children unwell we passed through the champ de mars522 and so on by the terra di lavoro a rich and fertile country and breakfasted at st agatha a wretched place but we had a disagreeable experience i had purchased a travelling carriage assured that it was englishbuilt and all that however when we were half a mile on our journey a bush started and a wheel came off but by dint of contrivances we fought our way back to agatha where we had a miserable lodging and wretched dinner the people were civil however and no bandits abroad being kept in awe by the escort of the king of westphalia523 who was on his road to naples the wheel was effectually repaired and at seven in the morning we started with some apprehension of suffering from crossing the very moist marshes called the pontine bogs which lie between naples and rome this is not the time when these exhalations are most dangerous though they seem to be safe at no time we remarked the celebrated capua which is distinguished into the new and old the new capua is on the banks of the river volturno which conducts its waters into the moats it is still a place of some strength in modern war the approach to the old capua is obstructed by an ancient bridge of a singular construction and consists of a number of massive towers half ruined we did not pass very near to them but the site seems very strong we passed sinuessa or sessa an ancient greek town situated not far from shore the road from naples to capua resembles an orchard on both sides but alas it runs through these infernal marshes which there is no shunning and which the example of many of my friends proves to be exceeding dangerous the road though it has the appearance of winding among hills is in fact on the left side limited by the seacoast running northward it comes into its more proper line at a celebrated seamarsh called cameria524 concerning which the oracle said ne moveas camarinam and the transgression of which precept brought on a pestilence the road here is a wild pass bounded by a rocky precipice on one hand covered with wild shrubs flowers and plants and on the other by the sea after this we came to a military position where murat used to quarter a body of troops and cannonade the english gunboats which were not slow in returning the compliment the english then garrisoned italy and sicily under sir john stuart we supped at this place half fitted up as a barrack half as an inn the place is now called terracina near this a round tower is shown termed the tomb of cicero which may be doubted i ought before quitting terracina to have mentioned the view of the town and castle of gaeta from the pass it is a castle of great strength i should have mentioned aversa remarkable for a house for insane persons on the humane plan of not agitating their passions after a long pilgrimage on this beastly road we fell asleep in spite of warnings to the contrary and before we beat the reveille were within twenty miles of the city of rome i think i felt the effects of the bad air and damp in a very bad headache  after a steep climb up a slippery illpaved road velletri received us and accommodated us in an ancient villa or château the original habitation of an old noble i would have liked much to have taken a look at it but i am tired by my ride i fear my time for such researches is now gone monte albano a pleasant place should also be mentioned especially a forest of grand oaks which leads you pretty directly into the vicinity of rome my son charles had requested the favour of our friend sir william gell to bespeak a lodging which considering his bad health was scarcely fair my daughter had imposed the same favour but they had omitted to give precise direction how to correspond with their friends concerning the execution of their commission so there we were as we had reason to think possessed of two apartments and not knowing the way to any of them we entered rome by a gate525 renovated by one of the old pontiffs but which i forget and so paraded the streets by moonlight to discover if possible some appearance of the learned sir william gell or the pretty mrs ashley at length we found our old servant who guided us to the lodgings taken by sir william gell where all was comfortable a good fire included which our fatigue and the chilliness of the night required we dispersed as soon as we had taken some food wine and water  we slept reasonably but on the next morning   finis  footnotes

unerwarteten      standpunkt versetzte mir zu erwägen gab was ich für abgeschlossen      hielt und besonders auch mich befähigte die gegner dieses      wichtigen werkes an denen es nicht fehlen kann zu beurtheilen und      die einwendungen die sie von ihrer seite vortragen zu würdigen       sie sehen hieraus dass zu ende des jahres keine höhere gabe hätte      zu mir gelangen können es ist dieses werk mir zu einem goldenen      netz geworden womit ich die schattenbilder meines vergangenen      lebens aus den lethesfluthen mit reichem zuge herauszuforschen      mich beschäftige       ungefähr dasselbige denke ich in dem nächsten stücke von kunst      und alterthum zu sagen  with regard to the medals which are as i expected the two wellknown likenesses of goethe himself it could be no hard matter to dispose of them safely here or transmit them to you if you required it without delay but being in this curious fashion appointed as it were ambassador between two kings of poetry i would willingly discharge my mission with the solemnity that beseems such a business and naturally it must flatter my vanity and love of the marvellous to think that by means of a foreigner whom i have never seen i might now have access to my native sovereign whom i have so often seen in public and so often wished that i had claim to see and know in private and near at handtill whitsunday i continue to reside here and shall hope that some time before that period i may have opportunity to wait on you and as my commission bore to hand you these memorials in person  meanwhile i abide your further orders in this matter and so with all the regard which belongs to one to whom i in common with other millions owe so muchi have the honour to be  sir most respectfully your servant thomas carlyle  besides the two medals specially intended for you there have come four more which i am requested generally to dispose of amongst wohlwollenden perhaps mr lockhart whose merits in respect of german literature and just appreciation of this its patriarch and guide are no secret will do me the honour to accept of one and direct me through your means how i am to have it conveyed   translation of the letter from goethe  should you see sir walter scott be so kind as return to him my most grateful thanks for his dear and cheerful lettera letter written in just that beautiful temper which makes one man feel himself to be worth something to another say too that i received his life of napoleon and have read it this winterin the evening and at nightwith attention from beginning to end to me it was full of meaning to observe how the first novelist of the century took upon himself a task and business so apparently foreign to him and passed under review with rapid stroke those important events of which it had been our fate to be eyewitnesses the division into chapters embracing masses of intimately connected events gives a clearness to the historical sequence that otherwise might have been only too easily confused while at the same time the individual events in each chapter are described with a clearness and a vividness quite invaluable  i read the work in the original and the impression it made upon me was thus free from the disturbing influence of a foreign medium i found myself listening to the words of a patriotic briton who finds it impossible to regard the actions of the enemy with a favourable eyean honest citizen this whose desire is that while political considerations shall always receive due weight the demands of morality shall never be overlooked one who while the enemy is borne along in his wanton course of good fortune cannot forbear to point with warning finger to the inevitable consequences and in his bitterest disaster can with difficulty find him worthy of a tear  the book was in yet another respect of the greatest importance to me in that it brought back to my remembrance events through which i had livednow showing me much that i had overlooked now transplanting me to some unexpected standpoint thus forcing me to reconsider a question which i had looked upon as settled and in a special manner putting me in a position to pass judgment upon the unfavourable critics of this bookfor these cannot failand to estimate at their true value the objections which are sure to be made from their side from all this you will understand how the end of last year could have brought with it no gift more welcome to me than this book the work has become to me as it were a golden net wherewith i can recover from out the waves of lethe the shadowy pictures of my past life and in that rich draught i am finding my present employment  i intend making a few remarks to the same purpose in the next number of kunst und alterthum527                                        footnotes  526 it is much to be regretted that scott and carlyle never met the probable explanation is that the admirable letter now printed in extenso coming into a house where there was sickness and amid the turmoil of london life was carefully laid aside for reply at a more convenient season this season unfortunately never came scott did not return to scotland until june 3d and by that time carlyle had left edinburgh and settled at craigenputtock he must however have seen scott subsequently as he depicts him in the memorable words alas his fine scottish face with its shaggy honesty and goodness when we saw it latterly in the edinburgh streets was all worn with carethe joy all fled from it and ploughed deep with labour and sorrow  mr lockhart once said to a friend that he regretted that they had never met and gave as a reason the state of scotts health  527 this purpose goethe seems to have carried out for in the chronologie which is printed in the

empire it was from this church that masaniello harangued the fickle populace in vain it was here that he was despatched by three bandits in the pay of the duke of maddaloni and here he found an honourable interment during a rapid reflux of popular favour in this church too lies conradin the last prince of the great house of suabia with his companion in arms and in death frederic son of the margrave of baden with pretensions through his mother to the dukedom of austria the features of the mediæval building have long since been obliterated by reconstructions of the 17th and 18th centuries while round the tomb of conradin a tissue of fictions has been woven by the piety and fondness of after times the sceptics of modern research do not however forbid us to believe that there may be an element of truth in the beautiful legend of the visit and benefactions of elizabeth margaret of bavaria the widowed mother of conradin erroneously dignified with the title of empress to the restingplace of her son her statue in the convent with a purse in her hand seems to attest the tale which was no doubt related to the scottish poet and may well have stirred his fancy what the epitaph was which he copied we cannot now determine it is not pretended that the unhappy lady was buried here but two inscriptions commemorate the ferocity of charles of anjou and the vicissitudes of fortune which befell his victims one believed to be of great antiquity is attached to a cross or pillar erected at the place of execution it breathes the insolence of the conqueror mingled with a barbarous humour embodied in a play on wordsfor asturis has a double reference to the kite and to the place astura at which the fugitive princes were captured      asturis ungue leo pullum rapiens aquilinum

authority on nursery tales will be read with interest   it is unfortunate that sir walter scott did not record in his diary the dates of the neapolitan collection of mother gooses tales and of the early french editions with which he was acquainted he may possibly have meant basiles lo cunto de li cunti naples 163744 and 1645 which contains some stories analogous to those which scott mentions there can be no doubt however that france not italy can claim the shapes of blue beard the sleeping beauty puss in boots and the other tales of mother goose which are known best in england other forms of these nursery traditions exist indeed not only in italian but in most european and some asiatic and african languages but their classical shape in literature is that which charles perrault gave them in his contes de ma mère loie of 1697 among the early french editions which sir walter knew probably none were older than dr douces copy of 1707 now in the bodleian the british museum has no early copy there was an example of the first edition sold in the hamilton sale another or the same in blue morocco belonged to charles nodier and is described in his mélanges the only specimen in the public libraries of paris is in the bibliothèque victor cousin it is probable that the dumpy duodecimo in the neapolitan dialect seen by scott was a translation of perraults famous little work the stories in it which are not in the early french editions may be ladroite princesse by a lady friend of perraults and peau dane in prose a tale which perrault told only in verse these found their way into french and flemish editions after 1707 our earliest english translation seems to be that of 1729 and the name of mother goose does not appear to occur in english literature before that date it is probably a translation of ma mère loie who gave her name to such old wives fables in france long before perraults time as the spider ananzi gives his name to the nancy stories of the negroes in the west indies among scotts century of inventions unfulfilled projects for literary work few are more to be regretted than his intended study of the origin of popular tales a topic no longer thought
