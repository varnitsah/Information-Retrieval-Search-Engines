11705675	literature and lifethe young contributor  by william dean howells    the editors relations with the young contributor   one of the trustiest jokes of the humorous paragrapher is that the editor is in great and constant dread of the young contributor but neither my experience nor my observation bears out his theory of the case  of course one must not say anything to encourage a young person to abandon an honest industry in the vain hope of early honor and profit from literature but there have been and there will be literary men and women always and these in the beginning have nearly always been young and i cannot see that there is risk of any serious harm in saying that it is to the young contributor the editor looks for rescue from the old contributor or from his failing force and charm  the chances naturally are against the young contributor and vastly against him but if any periodical is to live and to live long it is by the infusion of new blood and nobody knows this better than the editor who may seem so unfriendly and uncareful to the young contributor the strange voice the novel scene the odor of fresh woods and pastures new the breath of morning the dawn of tomorrowthese are what the editor is eager for if he is fit to be an editor at all and these are what the young contributor alone can give him  a man does not draw near the sixties without wishing people to believe that he is as young as ever and he has not written almost as many books as he has lived years without persuading himself that each new work of his has all the surprise of spring but possibly there are wonted traits and familiar airs and graces in it which forbid him to persuade others i do not say these characteristics are not charming i am very far from wishing to say that but i do say and must say that after the fiftieth time they do not charm for the first time and this is where the advantage of the new contributor lies if he happens to charm at all     i  the new contributor who does charm can have little notion how much he charms his first reader who is the editor that functionary may bide his pleasure in a short stiff note of acceptance or he may mask his joy in a check of slender figure but the contributor may be sure that he has missed no merit in his work and that he has felt perhaps far more than the public will feel such delight as it can give  the contributor may take the acceptance as a token that his efforts have not been neglected and that his achievements will always be warmly welcomed that even his failures will be leniently and reluctantly recognized as failures and that he must persist long in failure before the friend he has made will finally forsake him  i do not wish to paint the situation wholly rose color the editor will have his moods when he will not see so clearly or judge so justly as at other times when he will seem exacting and fastidious and will want this or that mistaken thing done to the story or poem or sketch which the author knows to be simply perfect as it stands but he is worth bearing with and he will be constant to the new contributor as long as there is the least hope of him  the contributor may be the man or the woman of one story one poem one sketch for there are such but the editor will wait the evidence of indefinite failure to this effect his hope always is that he or she is the man or the woman of many stories many poems many sketches all as good as the first  from my own long experience as a magazine editor i may say that the editor is more doubtful of failure in one who has once done well than of a second success after all the writer who can do but one good thing is rarer than people are apt to think in their love of the improbable but the real danger with a young contributor is that he may become his own rival  what would have been quite good enough from him in the first instance is not good enough in the second because he has himself fixed his standard so high his only hope is to surpass himself and not begin resting on his laurels too soon perhaps it is never well soon or late to rest upon ones laurels it is well for one to make ones self scarce and the best way to do this is to be more and more jealous of perfection in ones work  the editors conditions are that having found a good thing he must get as much of it as he can and the chances are that he will be less exacting than the contributor imagines it is for the contributor to be exacting and to let nothing go to the editor as long as there is the possibility of making it better he need not be afraid of being forgotten because he does not keep sending the editors memory is simply relentless he could not forget the writer who has pleased him if he would for such writers are few  i do not believe that in my editorial service on the atlantic monthly which lasted fifteen years in all i forgot the name or the characteristic quality or even the handwriting of a contributor who had pleased me and i forgot thousands who did not i never lost faith in a contributor who had done a good thing to the end i expected another good thing from him i think i was always at least as patient with him as he was with me though he may not have known it  at the time i was connected with that periodical it had almost a monopoly of the work of longfellow emerson holmes lowell whittier mrs stowe parkman higginson aldrich stedman and many others not so well known but still well known these distinguished writers were frequent contributors and they could be counted upon to respond to almost any appeal of the magazine yet the constant effort of the editors was to discover new talent and their wish was to welcome it  i know that so far as i was concerned the success of a young contributor was as precious as if i had myself written his paper or poem and i doubt if it gave him more pleasure the editor is in fact a sort of second self for the contributor equally eager that he should stand well with the public and able to promote his triumphs without egotism and share them without vanity     ii  in fact my curious experience was that if the public seemed not to feel my delight in a contribution i thought good my vexation and disappointment were as great as if the work hod been my own it was even greater for if i had really written it i might have had my misgivings of its merit but in the case of another i could not console myself with this doubt the sentiment was at the same time one which i could not cherish for the work of an old contributor such a one stood more upon his own feet and the young contributor may be sure that the editors pride selfinterest and sense of editorial infallibility will all prompt him to stand by the author whom he has introduced to the public and whom he has vouched for  i hope i am not giving the young contributor too high an estimate of his value to the editor after all he must remember that he is but one of a great many others and that the editors affections if constant are necessarily divided it is good for the literary aspirant to realize very early that he is but one of many for the vice of our comparatively virtuous craft is that it tends to make each of us imagine himself central if not sole  as a matter of fact however the universe does not revolve around any one of us we make our circuit of the sun along with the other inhabitants of the earth a planet of inferior magnitude the thing we strive for is recognition but when this comes it is apt to turn our heads i should say then that it was better it should not come in a great glare and aloud shout all at once but should steal slowly upon us ray by ray breath by breath  in the mean time if this happens we shall have several chances of reflection and can ask ourselves whether we are really so great as we seem to other people or seem to seem  the prime condition of good work is that we shall get ourselves out of our minds sympathy we need of course and encouragement but i am not sure that the lack of these is not a very good thing too praise enervates flattery poisons but a smart brisk snub is always rather wholesome  i should say that it was not at all a bad thing for a young contributor to get his manuscript back even after a first acceptance and even a general newspaper proclamation that he is one to make the immortals tremble for their wreaths of asphodelor is it amaranth i am never sure which  of course one must have ones hour or day or week of disabling the editors judgment of calling him to ones self fool and rogue and wretch but after that if one is worth while at all one puts the rejected thing by or sends it off to some other magazine and sets about the capture of the erring editor with something better or at least something else     iii  i think it a great pity that editors ever deal other than frankly with young contributors or put them off with smooth generalities of excuse instead of saying they do not like this thing or that offered them it is impossible to make a criticism of all rejected manuscripts but in the case of those which show promise i think it is quite possible and if i were to sin my sins over again i think i should sin a little more on the side of candid severity i am sure i should do more good in that way and i am sure that when i used to dissemble my real mind i did harm to those whose feelings i wished to spare there ought not in fact to be question of feeling in the editors mind  i know from much suffering of my own that it is terrible to get back a manuscript but it is not fatal or i should have been dead a great many times before i was thirty when the thing mostly ceased for me one survives it again and again and one ought to make the reflection that it is not the first business of a periodical to print contributions of this one or of that but that its first business is to amuse and instruct its readers  to do this it is necessary to print contributions but whose they are or how the writer will feel if they are not printed cannot be considered the editor can consider only what they are and the young contributor will do well to consider that although the editor may not be an infallible judge or quite a good judge it is his business to judge and to judge without mercy mercy ought no more to qualify judgment in an artistic result than in a mathematical result     iv  i suppose since i used to have it myself that there is a superstition with most young contributors concerning their geographical position i used to think that it was a disadvantage to send a thing from a small or unknown place and that it doubled my insignificance to do so i believed that if my envelope had borne the postmark of new york or boston or some other city of literary distinction it would have arrived on the editors table with a great deal more authority but i am sure this was a mistake from the first and when i came to be an editor myself i constantly verified the fact from my own dealings with contributors a contribution from a remote and obscure place at once piqued my curiosity and i soon learned that the fresh things the original things were apt to come from such places and not from the literary centres one of the most interesting facts concerning the arts of all kinds is that those who wish to give their lives to them do not appear where the appliances for instruction in them exist an artistic atmosphere does not create artists a literary atmosphere does not create literators poets and painters spring up where there was never a verse made or a picture seen  this suggests that god is no more idle now than he was at the beginning but that he is still and forever shaping the human chaos into the instruments and means of beauty it may also suggest to that scholar pride that vanity of technique which is so apt to vaunt itself in the teacher that the best he can do after all is to let the pupil teach himself if he comes with divine authority to the thing he attempts he will know how to use the appliances of which the teacher is only the first  the editor if he does not consciously perceive the truth will instinctively feel it and will expect the acceptable young contributor from the country the village the small town and he will look eagerly at anything that promises literature from montana or texas for he will know that it also promises novelty  if he is a wise editor he will wish to hold his hand as much as possible he will think twice before he asks the contributor to change this or correct that he will leave him as much to himself as he can the young contributor on his part will do well to realize this and to receive all the editorial suggestions which are veiled commands in most cases as meekly and as imaginatively as possible  the editor cannot always give his reasons however strongly he may feel them but the contributor if sufficiently docile can always divine them it behooves him to be docile at all times for this is merely the willingness to learn and whether he learns that he is wrong or that the editor is wrong still he gains knowledge  a great deal of knowledge comes simply from doing and a great deal more from doing over and this is what the editor generally means  i think that every author who is honest with himself must own that his work would be twice as good if it were done twice i was once so fortunately circumstanced that i was able entirely to rewrite one of my novels and i have always thought it the best written or at least indefinitely better than it would have been with a single writing as a matter of fact nearly all of them have been rewritten in a certain way they have not actually been rewritten throughout as in the case i speak of but they have been gone over so often in manuscript and in proof that the effect has been much the same  unless you are sensible of some strong frame within your work something vertebral it is best to renounce it and attempt something else in which you can feel it if you are secure of the frame you must observe the quality and character of everything you build about it you must touch you must almost taste you must certainly test every material you employ every bit of decoration must undergo the same scrutiny as the structure  it will be some vague perception of the want of this vigilance in the young contributors work which causes the editor to return it to him for revision with those suggestions which he will do well to make the most of for when the editor once finds a contributor he can trust he rejoices in him with a fondness which the contributor will never perhaps understand  it will not do to write for the editor alone the wise editor understands this and averts his countenance from the contributor who writes at him but if he feels that the contributor conceives the situation and will conform to the conditions which his periodical has invented for itself and will transgress none of its unwritten laws if he perceives that he has put artistic conscience in every general and detail and though he has not done the best has done the best that he can do he will begin to liberate him from every trammel except those he must wear himself and will be only too glad to leave him free he understands if he is at all fit for his place that a writer can do well only what he likes to do and his wish is to leave him to himself as soon as possible   v  in my own case i noticed that the contributors who could be best left to themselves were those who were most amenable to suggestion and even correction who took the blue pencil with a smile and bowed gladly to the rod of the proofreader those who were on the alert for offence who resented a marginal note as a slight and bumptiously demanded that their work should be printed just as they had written it were commonly not much more desired by the reader than by the editor  of course the contributor naturally feels that the public is the test of his excellence but he must not forget that the editor is the beginning of the public and i believe he is a faithfuller and kinder critic than the writer will ever find again  since my time there is a new tradition of editing which i do not think so favorable to the young contributor as the old formerly the magazines were made up of volunteer contributions in much greater measure than they are now at present most of the material is invited and even engaged it is arranged for a long while beforehand and the space that can be given to the aspirant the unknown good the potential excellence grows constantly less and less  a great deal can be said for either tradition perhaps some editor will yet imagine a return to the earlier method in the mean time we must deal with the thing that is and submit to it until it is changed the moral to the young contributor is to be better than ever to leave nothing undone that shall enhance his small chances of acceptance if he takes care to be so good that the editor must accept him in spite of all the pressure upon his pages he will not only be servinghimself best but may be helping the editor to a conception of his duty that shall be more hospitable to all other young contributors as it is however it must be owned that their hope of acceptance is very very small and they will do well to make sure that they love literature so much that they can suffer long and often repeated disappointment in its cause  the love of it is the great and only test of fitness for it it is really inconceivable how any one should attempt it without this but apparently a great many do it is evident to every editor that a vast number of those who write the things he looks at so faithfully and reads more or less have no artistic motive  people write because they wish to be known or because they have heard that money is easily made in that way or because they think they will chance that among a number of other things the ignorance of technique which they often show is not nearly so disheartening as the palpable factitiousness of their product it is something that they have made it is not anything that has grown out of their lives  i should think it would profit the young contributor before he puts pen to paper to ask himself why he does so and if he finds that he has no motive in the love of the thing to forbear  am i interested in what i am going to write about do i feel it strongly do i know it thoroughly do i imagine it clearly the young contributor had better ask himself all these questions and as many more like them as he can think of perhaps he will end by not being a young contributor  but if he is able to answer them satisfactorily to his own conscience by all means let him begin he may at once put aside all anxiety about style that is a thing that will take care of itself it will be added unto him if he really has something to say for style is only a mans way of saying a thing  if he has not much to say or if he has nothing to say perhaps he will try to say it in some other mans way or to hide his own vacuity with rags of rhetoric and tags and fringes of manner borrowed from this author and that he will fancy that in this disguise his work will be more literary and that there is somehow a quality a grace imparted to it which will charm in spite of the inward hollowness his vain hope would be pitiful if it were not so shameful but it is destined to suffer defeat at the first glance of the editorial eye  if he really has something to say however about something he knows and loves he is in the best possible case to say it well still from time to time he may advantageously call a halt and consider whether he is saying the thing clearly and simply  if he has a good ear he will say it gracefully and musically and i would by no means have him aim to say it barely or sparely it is not so that people talk who talk well and literature is only the thought of the writer flowing from the pen instead of the tongue  to aim at succinctness and brevity merely as some teach is to practice a kind of quackery almost as offensive as the charlatanry of rhetoric in either case the life goes out of the subject  to please ones self honestly and thoroughly is the only way to please others in matters of art i do not mean to say that if you please yourself you will always please others but that unless you please yourself you will please no one else it is the sweet and sacred privilege of work done artistically to delight the doer art is the highest joy but any work done in the love of it is art in a kind and it strikes the note of happiness as nothing else can  we hear much of drudgery but any sort of work that is slighted becomes drudgery poetry fiction painting sculpture acting architecture if you do not do your best by them turn to drudgery sore as digging ditches hewing wood or drawing water and these by the same blessings of god become arts if they are done with conscience and the sense of beauty  the young contributor may test his work before the editor assays it if he will and he may know by a rule that is pretty infallible whether it is good or not from his own experience in doing it did it give him pleasure did he love it as it grew under his hand was he glad and willing with it or did he force himself to it and did it hang heavy upon him  there is nothing mystical in all this it is a matter of plain everyday experience and i think nearly every artist will say the same thing about it if he examines himself faithfully  if the young contributor finds that he has no delight in the thing he has attempted he may very well give it up for no one else will delight in it but he need not give it up at once perhaps his mood is bad let him wait for a better and try it again he may not have learned how to do it well and therefore he cannot love it but perhaps he can learn to do it well  the wonder and glory of art is that it is without formulas or rather each new piece of work requires the invention of new formulas which will not serve again for another you must apprentice yourself afresh at every fresh undertaking and our mastery is always a victory over certain unexpected difficulties and not a dominion of difficulties overcome before  i believe in other words that mastery is merely the strength that comes of overcoming and is never a sovereign power that smooths the path of all obstacles the combinations in art are infinite and almost never the same you must make your key and fit it to each and the key that unlocks one combination will not unlock another     vi  there is no royal road to excellence in literature but the young contributor need not be dismayed at that royal roads are the ways that kings travel and kings are mostly dull fellows and rarely have a good time they do not go along singing the spring that trickles into the mossy log is not for them nor          the wildwood flower that simply blows  but the traveller on the country road may stop for each of these and it is not a bad condition of his progress that he must move so slowly that he can learn every detail of the landscape both earth and sky by heart  the trouble with success is that it is apt to leave life behind or apart the successful writer especially is in danger of becoming isolated from the realities that nurtured in him the strength to win success when he becomes famous he becomes precious to criticism to society to all the things that do not exist from themselves or have not the root of the matter in them  therefore i think that a young writers upward course should be slow and beset with many obstacles even hardships not that i believe in hardships as having inherent virtues i think it is stupid to regard them in that way but they oftener bring out the virtues inherent in the sufferer from them than what i may call the softships and at least they stop him and give him time to think  this is the great matter for if we prosper forward rapidly we have no time for anything but prospering forward rapidly we have no time for art even the art by which we prosper  i would have the young contributor above all things realize that success is not his concern good work true work beautiful work is his affair and nothing else if he does this success will take care of itself  he has no business to think of the thing that will take it is the editors business to think of that and it is the contributors business to think of the thing that he can do with pleasure the high pleasure that comes from the sense of worth in the thing done let him do the best he can and trust the editor to decide whether it will take  it will take far oftener than anything he attempts perfunctorily and even if the editor thinks it will not take and feels obliged to return it for that reason he will return it with a real regret with the honor and affection which we cannot help feeling for any one who has done a piece of good work and with the will and the hope to get something from him that will take the next time or the next or the next     pg editors bookmarks      an artistic atmosphere does not create artists     any sort of work that is slighted becomes drudgery     put aside all anxiety about style     should sin a little more on the side of candid severity     trouble with success is that it is apt to leave life behind     work would be twice as good if it were done twice
