43567641	twilight in italy   by d h lawrence  1916     contents   the crucifix across the mountains  on the lago di garda   1 the spinner and the monks   2 the lemon gardens   3 the theatre   4 san gaudenzio   5 the dance   6 il duro   7 john  italians in exile  the return journey     the crucifix across the mountains   the imperial road to italy goes from munich across the tyrol through innsbruck and bozen to verona over the mountains here the great processions passed as the emperors went south or came home again from rosy italy to their own germany  and how much has that old imperial vanity clung to the german soul did not the german kings inherit the empire of bygone rome it was not a very real empire perhaps but the sound was high and splendid  maybe a certain gr√∂ssenwahn is inherent in the german nature if only nations would realize that they have certain natural characteristics if only they could understand and agree to each others particular nature how much simpler it would all be  the imperial procession no longer crosses the mountains going south that is almost forgotten the road has almost passed out of mind but still it is there and its signs are standing  the crucifixes are there not mere attributes of the road yet still having something to do with it the imperial processions blessed by the pope and accompanied by the great bishops must have planted the holy idol like a new plant among the mountains there where it multiplied and grew according to the soil and the race that received it  as one goes among the bavarian uplands and foothills soon one realizes here is another land a strange religion it is a strange country remote out of contact perhaps it belongs to the forgotten imperial processions  coming along the clear open roads that lead to the mountains one scarcely notices the crucifixes and the shrines perhaps ones interest is dead the crucifix itself is nothing a factorymade piece of sentimentalism the soul ignores it  but gradually one after another looming shadowily under their hoods the crucifixes seem to create a new atmosphere over the whole of the countryside a darkness a weight in the air that is so unnaturally bright and rare with the reflection from the snows above a darkness hovering just over the earth so rare and unearthly the light is from the mountains full of strange radiance then every now and again recurs the crucifix at the turning of an open grassy road holding a shadow and a mystery under its pointed hood  i was startled into consciousness one evening going alone over a marshy place at the foot of the mountains when the sky was pale and unearthly invisible and the hills were nearly black at a meeting of the tracks was a crucifix and between the feet of the christ a handful of withered poppies it was the poppies i saw then the christ  it was an old shrine the woodsculpture of a bavarian peasant the christ was a peasant of the foot of the alps he had broad cheekbones and sturdy limbs his plain rudimentary face stared fixedly at the hills his neck was stiffened as if in resistance to the fact of the nails and the cross which he could not escape it was a man nailed down in spirit but set stubbornly against the bondage and the disgrace he was a man of middle age plain crude with some of the meanness of the peasant but also with a kind of dogged nobility that does not yield its soul to the circumstance plain almost blank in his soul the middleaged peasant of the crucifix resisted unmoving the misery of his position he did not yield his soul was set his will was fixed he was himself let his circumstances be what they would his life fixed down  across the marsh was a tiny square of orangecoloured light from the farmhouse with the low spreading roof i remembered how the man and his wife and the children worked on till dark silent and intent carrying the hay in their arms out of the streaming thunderrain into the shed working silent in the soaking rain  the body bent forward towards the earth closing round on itself the arms clasped full of hay clasped round the hay that presses soft and close to the breast and the body that pricks heat into the arms and the skin of the breast and fills the lungs with the sleepy scent of dried herbs the rain that falls heavily and wets the shoulders so that the shirt clings to the hot firm skin and the rain comes with heavy pleasant coldness on the active flesh running in a trickle down towards the loins secretly this is the peasant this hot welter of physical sensation and it is all intoxicating it is intoxicating almost like a soporific like a sensuous drug to gather the burden to ones body in the rain to stumble across the living grass to the shed to relieve ones arms of the weight to throw down the hay on to the heap to feel light and free in the dry shed then to return again into the chill hard rain to stoop again under the rain and rise to return again with the burden  it is this this endless heat and rousedness of physical sensation which keeps the body full and potent and flushes the mind with a blood heat a blood sleep and this sleep this heat of physical experience becomes at length a bondage at last a crucifixion it is the life and the fulfilment of the peasant this flow of sensuous experience but at last it drives him almost mad because he cannot escape  for overhead there is always the strange radiance of the mountains there is the mystery of the icy river rushing through its pink shoals into the darkness of the pinewoods there is always the faint tang of ice on the air and the rush of hoarsesounding water  and the ice and the upper radiance of snow are brilliant with timeless immunity from the flux and the warmth of life overhead they transcend all life all the soft moist fire of the blood so that a man must needs live under the radiance of his own negation  there is a strange clear beauty of form about the men of the bavarian highlands about both men and women they are large and clear and handsome in form with blue eyes very keen the pupil small tightened the iris keen like sharp light shining on blue ice their large fullmoulded limbs and erect bodies are distinct separate as if they were perfectly chiselled out of the stuff of life static cut off where they are everything is set back as in a clear frosty air  their beauty is almost this this strange cleancut isolation as if each one of them would isolate himself still further and for ever from the rest of his fellows  yet they are convivial they are almost the only race with the souls of artists still they act the mystery plays with instinctive fullness of interpretation they sing strangely in the mountain fields they love makebelief and mummery their processions and religious festivals are profoundly impressive solemn and rapt  it is a race that moves on the poles of mystic sensual delight every gesture is a gesture from the blood every expression is a symbolic utterance  for learning there is sensuous experience for thought there is myth and drama and dancing and singing everything is of the blood of the senses there is no mind the mind is a suffusion of physical heat it is not separated it is kept submerged  at the same time always overhead there is the eternal negative radiance of the snows beneath is life the hot jet of the blood playing elaborately but above is the radiance of changeless notbeing and life passes away into this changeless radiance summer and the prolific blueandwhite flowering of the earth goes by with the labour and the ecstasy of man disappears and is gone into brilliance that hovers overhead the radiant cold which waits to receive back again all that which has passed for the moment into being  the issue is too much revealed it leaves the peasant no choice the fate gleams transcendent above him the brightness of eternal unthinkable notbeing and this our life this admixture of labour and of warm experience in the flesh all the time it is steaming up to the changeless brilliance above the light of the everlasting snows this is the eternal issue  whether it is singing or dancing or playacting or physical transport of love or vengeance or cruelty or whether it is work or sorrow or religion the issue is always the same at last into the radiant negation of eternity hence the beauty and completeness the finality of the highland peasant his figure his limbs his face his motion it is all formed in beauty and it is all completed there is no flux nor hope nor becoming all is once and for all the issue is eternal timeless and changeless all being and all passing away is part of the issue which is eternal and changeless therefore there is no becoming and no passing away everything is now and for ever hence the strange beauty and finality and isolation of the bavarian peasant  it is plain in the crucifixes here is the essence rendered in sculpture of wood the face is blank and stiff almost expressionless one realizes with a start how unchanging and conventionalized is the face of the living man and woman of these parts handsome but motionless as pure form there is also an underlying meanness secretive cruel it is all part of the beauty the pure plastic beauty the body also of the christus is stiff and conventionalized yet curiously beautiful in proportion and in the static tension which makes it unified into one clear thing there is no movement no possible movement the being is fixed finally the whole body is locked in one knowledge beautiful complete it is one with the nails not that it is languishing or dead it is stubborn knowing its own undeniable being sure of the absolute reality of the sensuous experience though he is nailed down upon an irrevocable fate yet within that fate he has the power and the delight of all sensuous experience so he accepts the fate and the mystic delight of the senses with one will he is complete and final his sensuous experience is supreme a consummation of life and death at once  it is the same at all times whether it is moving with the scythe on the hillslopes or hewing the timber or steering the raft down the river which is all effervescent with ice whether it is drinking in the gasthaus or making love or playing some mummers part or hating steadily and cruelly or whether it is kneeling in spellbound subjection in the incensefilled church or walking in the strange dark subjectprocession to bless the fields or cutting the young birchtrees for the feast of frohenleichnam it is always the same the dark powerful mystic sensuous experience is the whole of him he is mindless and bound within the absoluteness of the issue the unchangeability of the great icy notbeing which holds good for ever and is supreme  passing further away towards austria travelling up the isar till the stream becomes smaller and whiter and the air is colder the full glamour of the northern hills which are so marvellously luminous and gleaming with flowers wanes and gives way to a darkness a sense of ominousness up there i saw another little christ who seemed the very soul of the place the road went beside the river that was seething with snowy icebubbles under the rocks and the high wolflike pinetrees between the pinkish shoals the air was cold and hard and high everything was cold and separate and in a little glass case beside the road sat a small hewn christ the head resting on the hand and he meditates halfwearily doggedly the eyebrows lifted in strange abstraction the elbow resting on the knee detached he sits and dreams and broods wearing his little golden crown of thorns and his little cloak of red flannel that some peasant woman has stitched for him  no doubt he still sits there the small blankfaced christ in the cloak of red flannel dreaming brooding enduring persisting there is a wistfulness about him as if he knew that the whole of things was too much for him there was no solution either in death death did not give the answer to the souls anxiety that which is is it does not cease to be when it is cut death cannot create nor destroy what is is  the little brooding christ knows this what is he brooding then his static patience and endurance is wistful what is it that he secretly yearns for amid all the placidity of fate to be or not to be this may be the question but is it not a question for death to answer it is not a question of living or notliving it is a question of beingto be or not to be to persist or not to persist that is not the question neither is it to endure or not to endure the issue is it eternal notbeing if not what then is being for overhead the eternal radiance of the snow gleams unfailing it receives the efflorescence of all life and is unchanged the issue is bright and immortal the snowy notbeing what then is being  as one draws nearer to the turningpoint of the alps towards the culmination and the southern slope the influence of the educated world is felt once more bavaria is remote in spirit as yet unattached its crucifixes are old and grey and abstract small like the kernel of the truth further into austria they become new they are painted white they are larger more obtrusive they are the expressions of a later newer phase more introspective and selfconscious but still they are genuine expressions of the peoples soul  often one can distinguish the work of a particular artist here and there in a district in the zemm valley in the heart of the tyrol behind innsbruck there are five or six crucifixes by one sculptor he is no longer a peasant working out an idea conveying a dogma he is an artist trained and conscious probably working in vienna he is consciously trying to convey a feeling he is no longer striving awkwardly to render a truth a religious fact  the chief of his crucifixes stands deep in the klamm in the dank gorge where it is always halfnight the road runs under the rock and the trees halfway up the one side of the pass below the stream rushes ceaselessly embroiled among great stones making an endless loud noise the rock face opposite rises high overhead with the sky far up so that one is walking in a halfnight an underworld and just below the path where the packhorses go climbing to the remote infolded villages in the cold gloom of the pass hangs the large pale christ he is larger than lifesize he has fallen forward just dead and the weight of the fullgrown mature body hangs on the nails of the hands so the dead heavy body drops forward sags as if it would tear away and fall under its own weight  it is the end the face is barren with a dead expression of weariness and brutalized with pain and bitterness the rather ugly passionate mouth is set for ever in the disillusionment of death death is the complete disillusionment set like a seal over the whole body and being over the suffering and weariness and the bodily passion  the pass is gloomy and damp the water roars unceasingly till it is almost like a constant pain the driver of the packhorses as he comes up the narrow path in the side of the gorge cringes his sturdy cheerfulness as if to obliterate himself drawing near to the large pale christ and he takes his hat off as he passes though he does not look up but keeps his face averted from the crucifix he hurries by in the gloom climbing the steep path after his horses and the large white christ hangs extended above  the driver of the packhorses is afraid the fear is always there in him in spite of his sturdy healthy robustness his soul is not sturdy it is blenched and whitened with fear the mountains are dark overhead the water roars in the gloom below his heart is ground between the millstones of dread when he passes the extended body of the dead christ he takes off his hat to the lord of death christ is the deathly one he is death incarnate  and the driver of the packhorses acknowledges this deathly christ as supreme lord the mountain peasant seems grounded upon fear the fear of death of physical death beyond this he knows nothing his supreme sensation is in physical pain and in its culmination his great climax his consummation is death therefore he worships it bows down before it and is fascinated by it all the while it is his fulfilment death and his approach to fulfilment is through physical pain  and so these monuments to physical death are found everywhere in the valleys by the same hand that carved the big christ a little further on at the end of a bridge was another crucifix a small one this christ had a fair beard and was thin and his body was hanging almost lightly whereas the other christ was large and dark and handsome but in this as well as in the other was the same neutral triumph of death complete negative death so complete as to be abstract beyond cynicism in its completeness of leaving off  everywhere is the same obsession with the fact of physical pain accident and sudden death wherever a misfortune has befallen a man there is nailed up a little memorial of the event in propitiation of the god of hurt and death a man is standing up to his waist in water drowning in full stream his arms in the air the little painting in its wooden frame is nailed to the tree the spot is sacred to the accident again another little crude picture fastened to a rock a tree falling on a mans leg smashes it like a stalk while the blood flies up always there is the strange ejaculation of anguish and fear perpetuated in the little paintings nailed up in the place of the disaster  this is the worship then the worship of death and the approaches to death physical violence and pain there is something crude and sinister about it almost like depravity a form of reverting turning back along the course of blood by which we have come  turning the ridge on the great road to the south the imperial road to rome a decisive change takes place the christs have been taking on various different characters all of them more or less realistically conveyed one christus is very elegant combed and brushed and foppish on his cross as gabriele dannunzios son posing as a martyred saint the martyrdom of this christ is according to the most polite convention the elegance is very important and very austrian one might almost imagine the young man had taken up this striking and original position to create a delightful sensation among the ladies it is quite in the viennese spirit there is something brave and keen in it too the individual pride of body triumphs over every difficulty in the situation the pride and satisfaction in the clean elegant form the perfectly trimmed hair the exquisite bearing are more important than the fact of death or pain this may be foolish it is at the same time admirable  but the tendency of the crucifix as it nears the ridge to the south is to become weak and sentimental the carved christs turn up their faces and roll back their eyes very piteously in the approved guido reni fashion they are overdoing the pathetic turn they are looking to heaven and thinking about themselves in selfcommiseration others again are beautiful as elegies it is dead hyacinth lifted and extended to view in all his beautiful dead youth the young male body droops forward on the cross like a dead flower it looks as if its only true nature were to be dead how lovely is death how poignant real satisfying it is the true elegiac spirit  then there are the ordinary factorymade christs which are not very significant they are as null as the christs we see represented in england just vulgar nothingness but these figures have gashes of red a red paint of blood which is sensational  beyond the brenner i have only seen vulgar or sensational crucifixes there are great gashes on the breast and the knees of the christfigure and the scarlet flows out and trickles down till the crucified body has become a ghastly striped thing of red and white just a sickly thing of striped red  they paint the rocks at the corners of the tracks among the mountains a blue and white ring for the road to ginzling a red smear for the way to st jakob so one follows the blue and white ring or the three stripes of blue and white or the red smear as the case may be and the red on the rocks the dabs of red paint are of just the same colour as the red upon the crucifixes so that the red upon the crucifixes is paint and the signs on the rocks are sensational like blood  i remember the little brooding christ of the isar in his little cloak of red flannel and his crown of gilded thorns and he remains real and dear to me among all this violence of representation  couvretoi de gloire tartarincouvretoi de flanelle why should it please me so that his cloak is of red flannel  in a valley near st jakob just over the ridge a long way from the railway there is a very big important shrine by the roadside it is a chapel built in the baroque manner florid pink and cream outside with opulent small arches and inside is the most startling sensational christus i have ever seen he is a big powerful man seated after the crucifixion perhaps after the resurrection sitting by the grave he sits sideways as if the extremity were over finished the agitation done with only the result of the experience remaining there is some blood on his powerful naked defeated body that sits rather hulked but it is the face which is so terrifying it is slightly turned over the hulked crucified shoulder to look and the look of this face of which the body has been killed is beyond all expectation horrible the eyes look at one yet have no seeing in them they seem to see only their own blood for they are bloodshot till the whites are scarlet the iris is purpled these red bloody eyes with their stained pupils glancing awfully at all who enter the shrine looking as if to see through the blood of the late brutal death are terrible the naked strong body has known death and sits in utter dejection finished hulked a weight of shame and what remains of life is in the face whose expression is sinister and gruesome like that of an unrelenting criminal violated by torture the criminal look of misery and hatred on the fixed violated face and in the bloodshot eyes is almost impossible he is conquered beaten broken his body is a mass of torture an unthinkable shame yet his will remains obstinate and ugly integral with utter hatred  it is a great shock to find this figure sitting in a handsome baroque pinkwashed shrine in one of those alpine valleys which to our thinking are all flowers and romance like the picture in the tate gallery spring in the austrian tyrol is to our minds a vision of pristine loveliness it contains also this christ of the heavy body defiled by torture and death the strong virile life overcome by physical violence the eyes still looking back bloodshot in consummate hate and misery  the shrine was well kept and evidently much used it was hung with exvoto limbs and with many gifts it was a centre of worship of a sort of almost obscene worship afterwards the black pinetrees and the river of that valley seemed unclean as if an unclean spirit lived there the very flowers seemed unnatural and the white gleam on the mountaintops was a glisten of supreme cynical horror  after this in the populous valleys all the crucifixes were more or less tainted and vulgar only high up where the crucifix becomes smaller and smaller is there left any of the old beauty and religion higher and higher the monument becomes smaller and smaller till in the snows it stands out like a post or a thick arrow stuck barb upwards the crucifix itself is a small thing under the pointed hood the barb of the arrow the snow blows under the tiny shed upon the little exposed christ all round is the solid whiteness of snow the awful curves and concaves of pure whiteness of the mountain top the hollow whiteness between the peaks where the path crosses the high extreme ridge of the pass and here stands the last crucifix half buried small and tufted with snow the guides tramp slowly heavily past not observing the presence of the symbol making no salute further down every mountain peasant lifted his hat but the guide tramps by without concern his is a professional importance now  on a small mountain track on the jaufen not far from meran was a fallen christus i was hurrying downhill to escape from an icy wind which almost took away my consciousness and i was looking up at the gleaming unchanging snowpeaks all round they seemed like blades immortal in the sky so i almost ran into a very old martertafel it leaned on the cold stony hillside surrounded by the white peaks in the upper air  the wooden hood was silvergrey with age and covered on the top with a thicket of lichen which stuck up in hoary tufts but on the rock at the foot of the post was the fallen christ armless who had tumbled down and lay in an unnatural posture the naked ancient wooden sculpture of the body on the naked living rock it was one of the old uncouth christs hewn out of bare wood having the long wedgeshaped limbs and thin flat legs that are significant of the true spirit the desire to convey a religious truth not a sensational experience  the arms of the fallen christ had broken off at the shoulders and they hung on their nails as exvoto limbs hang in the shrines but these arms dangled from the palms one at each end of the cross the muscles carved sparely in the old wood looking all wrong upside down and the icy wind blew them backwards and forwards so that they gave a painful impression there in the stark sterile place of rock and cold yet i dared not touch the fallen body of the christ that lay on its back in so grotesque a posture at the foot of the post i wondered who would come and take the broken thing away and for what purpose     on the lago di garda    1  the spinner and the monks   the holy spirit is a dove or an eagle in the old testament it was an eagle in the new testament it is a dove  and there are standing over the christian world the churches of the dove and the churches of the eagle there are moreover the churches which do not belong to the holy spirit at all but which are built to pure fancy and logic such as the wren churches in london  the churches of the dove are shy and hidden they nestle among trees and their bells sound in the mellowness of sunday or they are gathered into a silence of their own in the very midst of the town so that one passes them by without observing them they are as if invisible offering no resistance to the storming of the traffic  but the churches of the eagle stand high with their heads to the skies as if they challenged the world below they are the churches of the spirit of david and their bells ring passionately imperiously falling on the subservient world below  the church of san francesco was a church of the dove i passed it several times in the dark silent little square without knowing it was a church its pink walls were blind windowless unnoticeable it gave no sign unless one caught sight of the tan curtain hanging in the door and the slit of darkness beneath yet it was the chief church of the village  but the church of san tommaso perched over the village coming down the cobbled submerged street many a time i looked up between the houses and saw the thin old church standing above in the light as if it perched on the houseroofs its thin grey neck was held up stiffly beyond was a vision of dark foliage and the high hillside  i saw it often and yet for a long time it never occurred to me that it actually existed it was like a vision a thing one does not expect to come close to it was there standing away upon the housetops against a glamour of foliaged hillside i was submerged in the village on the uneven cobbled street between old high walls and cavernous shops and the houses with flights of steps  for a long time i knew how the day went by the imperious clangour of midday and evening bells striking down upon the houses and the edge of the lake yet it did not occur to me to ask where these bells rang till at last my everyday trance was broken in upon and i knew the ringing of the church of san tommaso the church became a living connexion with me  so i set out to find it i wanted to go to it it was very near i could see it from the piazza by the lake and the village itself had only a few hundreds of inhabitants the church must be within a stones throw  yet i could not find it i went out of the back door of the house into the narrow gully of the back street women glanced down at me from the top of the flights of steps old men stood halfturning halfcrouching under the dark shadow of the walls to stare it was as if the strange creatures of the undershadow were looking at me i was of another element  the italian people are called children of the sun they might better be called children of the shadow their souls are dark and nocturnal if they are to be easy they must be able to hide to be hidden in lairs and caves of darkness going through these tiny chaotic backways of the village was like venturing through the labyrinth made by furtive creatures who watched from out of another element and i was pale and clear and evanescent like the light and they were dark and close and constant like the shadow  so i was quite baffled by the tortuous tiny deep passages of the village i could not find my way i hurried towards the broken end of a street where the sunshine and the olive trees looked like a mirage before me and there above me i saw the thin stiff neck of old san tommaso grey and pale in the sun yet i could not get up to the church i found myself again on the piazza  another day however i found a broken staircase where weeds grew in the gaps the steps had made in falling and maidenhair hung on the darker side of the wall i went up unwillingly because the italians used this old staircase as a privy as they will any deep sidepassage  but i ran up the broken stairway and came out suddenly as by a miracle clean on the platform of my san tommaso in the tremendous sunshine  it was another world the world of the eagle the world of fierce abstraction it was all clear overwhelming sunshine a platform hung in the light just below were the confused tiled roofs of the village and beyond them the pale blue water down below and opposite opposite my face and breast the clear luminous snow of the mountain across the lake level with me apparently though really much above  i was in the skies now looking down from my square terrace of cobbled pavement that was worn like the threshold of the ancient church round the terrace ran a low broad wall the coping of the upper heaven where i had climbed  there was a bloodred sail like a butterfly breathing down on the blue water whilst the earth on the near side gave off a greensilver smoke of olive trees coming up and around the earthcoloured roofs  it always remains to me that san tommaso and its terrace hang suspended above the village like the lowest step of heaven of jacobs ladder behind the land rises in a high sweep but the terrace of san tommaso is let down from heaven and does not touch the earth  i went into the church it was very dark and impregnated with centuries of incense it affected me like the lair of some enormous creature my senses were roused they sprang awake in the hot spiced darkness my skin was expectant as if it expected some contact some embrace as if it were aware of the contiguity of the physical world the physical contact with the darkness and the heavy suggestive substance of the enclosure it was a thick fierce darkness of the senses but my soul shrank  i went out again the pavemented threshold was clear as a jewel the marvellous clarity of sunshine that becomes blue in the height seemed to distil me into itself  across the heavy mountain crouched along the side of the lake the upper half brilliantly white belonging to the sky the lower half dark and grim so then that is where heaven and earth are divided from behind me on the left the headland swept down out of a great palegrey arid height through a rush of russet and crimson to the olive smoke and the water of the level earth and between like a blade of the sky cleaving the earth asunder went the paleblue lake cleaving mountain from mountain with the triumph of the sky  then i noticed that a big bluechecked cloth was spread on the parapet before me over the parapet of heaven i wondered why it hung there  turning round on the other side of the terrace under a caperbush that hung like a bloodstain from the grey wall above her stood a little grey woman whose fingers were busy like the grey church she made me feel as if i were not in existence i was wandering by the parapet of heaven looking down but she stood back against the solid wall under the caperbush unobserved and unobserving she was like a fragment of earth she was a living stone of the terrace sunbleached she took no notice of me who was hesitating looking down at the earth beneath she stood back under the sunbleached solid wall like a stone rolled down and stayed in a crevice  her head was tied in a darkred kerchief but pieces of hair like dirty snow quite short stuck out over her ears and she was spinning i wondered so much that i could not cross towards her she was grey and her apron and her dress and her kerchief and her hands and her face were all sunbleached and sunstained greyey bluey browny like stones and halfcoloured leaves sunny in their colourlessness in my black coat i felt myself wrong false an outsider  she was spinning spontaneously like a little wind under her arm she held a distaff of dark ripe wood just a straight stick with a clutch at the end like a grasp of brown fingers full of a fluff of blackish rusty fleece held up near her shoulder and her fingers were plucking spontaneously at the strands of wool drawn down from it and hanging near her feet spinning round upon a black thread spinning busily like a thing in a gay wind was her shuttle her bobbin wound fat with the coarse blackish worsted she was making  all the time like motion without thought her fingers teased out the fleece drawing it down to a fairly uniform thickness brown old natural fingers that worked as in a sleep the thumb having a long grey nail and from moment to moment there was a quick downward rub between thumb and forefinger of the thread that hung in front of her apron the heavy bobbin spun more briskly and she felt again at the fleece as she drew it down and she gave a twist to the thread that issued and the bobbin spun swiftly  her eyes were clear as the sky blue empyrean transcendent they were dear but they had no looking in them her face was like a sunworn stone  you are spinning i said to her  her eyes glanced over me making no effort of attention  yes she said  she saw merely a mans figure a stranger standing near i was a bit of the outside negligible she remained as she was clear and sustained like an old stone upon the hillside she stood short and sturdy looking for the most part straight in front unseeing but glancing from time to time with a little unconscious attention at the thread she was slightly more animated than the sunshine and the stone and the motionless caperbush above her still her fingers went along the strand of fleece near her breast  that is an old way of spinning i said  what  she looked up at me with eyes clear and transcendent as the heavens but she was slightly roused there was the slight motion of the eagle in her turning to look at me a faint gleam of rapt light in her eyes it was my unaccustomed italian  that is an old way of spinning i repeated  yesan old way she repeated as if to say the words so that they should be natural to her and i became to her merely a transient circumstance a man part of the surroundings we divided the gift of speech that was all  she glanced at me again with her wonderful unchanging eyes that were like the visible heavens unthinking or like two flowers that are open in pure clear unconsciousness to her i was a piece of the environment that was all her world was clear and absolute without consciousness of self she was not selfconscious because she was not aware that there was anything in the universe except her universe in her universe i was a stranger a foreign signore that i had a world of my own other than her own was not conceived by her she did not care  so we conceive the stars we are told that they are other worlds but the stars are the clustered and single gleaming lights in the nightsky of our world when i come home at night there are the stars when i cease to exist as the microcosm when i begin to think of the cosmos then the stars are other worlds then the macrocosm absorbs me but the macrocosm is not me it is something which i the microcosm am not  so that there is something which is unknown to me and which nevertheless exists i am finite and my understanding has limits the universe is bigger than i shall ever see in mind or spirit there is that which is not me  if i say the planet mars is inhabited i do not know what i mean by inhabited with reference to the planet mars i can only mean that that world is not my world i can only know there is that which is not me i am the microcosm but the macrocosm is that also which i am not  the old woman on the terrace in the sun did not know this she was herself the core and centre to the world the sun and the single firmament she knew that i was an inhabitant of lands which she had never seen but what of that there were parts of her own body which she had never seen which physiologically she could never see they were none the less her own because she had never seen them the lands she had not seen were corporate parts of her own living body the knowledge she had not attained was only the hidden knowledge of her own self she was the substance of the knowledge whether she had the knowledge in her mind or not there was nothing which was not herself ultimately even the man the male was part of herself he was the mobile separate part but he was none the less herself because he was sometimes severed from her if every apple in the world were cut in two the apple would not be changed the reality is the apple which is just the same in the halfapple as in the whole  and she the old spinningwoman was the apple eternal unchangeable whole even in her partiality it was this which gave the wonderful clear unconsciousness to her eyes how could she be conscious of herself when all was herself  she was talking to me of a sheep that had died but i could not understand because of her dialect it never occurred to her that i could not understand she only thought me different stupid and she talked on the ewes had lived under the house and a part was divided off for the hegoat because the other people brought their shegoats to be covered by the hegoat but how the ewe came to die i could not make out  her fingers worked away all the time in a little halffretful movement yet spontaneous as butterflies leaping here and there she chattered rapidly on in her italian that i could not understand looking meanwhile into my face because the story roused her somewhat yet not a feature moved her eyes remained candid and open and unconscious as the skies only a sharp will in them now and then seemed to gleam at me as if to dominate me  her shuttle had caught in a dead chicory plant and spun no more she did not notice i stooped and broke off the twigs there was a glint of blue on them yet seeing what i was doing she merely withdrew a few inches from the plant her bobbin hung free  she went on with her tale looking at me wonderfully she seemed like the creation like the beginning of the world the first morning her eyes were like the first morning of the world so ageless  her thread broke she seemed to take no notice but mechanically picked up the shuttle wound up a length of worsted connected the ends from her wool strand set the bobbin spinning again and went on talking in her halfintimate halfunconscious fashion as if she were talking to her own world in me  so she stood in the sunshine on the little platform old and yet like the morning erect and solitary suncoloured sundiscoloured whilst i at her elbow like a piece of night and moonshine stood smiling into her eyes afraid lest she should deny me existence  which she did she had stopped talking did not look at me any more but went on with her spinning the brown shuttle twisting gaily so she stood belonging to the sunshine and the weather taking no more notice of me than of the darkstained caperbush which hung from the wall above her head whilst i waiting at her side was like the moon in the daytime sky overshone obliterated in spite of my black clothes  how long has it taken you to do that much i asked  she waited a minute glanced at her bobbin  this much i dont know a day or two  but you do it quickly  she looked at me as if suspiciously and derisively then quite suddenly she started forward and went across the terrace to the great blueandwhite checked cloth that was drying on the wall i hesitated she had cut off her consciousness from me so i turned and ran away taking the steps two at a time to get away from her in a moment i was between the walls climbing upwards hidden  the schoolmistress had told me i should find snowdrops behind san tommaso if she had not asserted such confident knowledge i should have doubted her translation of perceneige she meant christmas roses all the while  however i went looking for snowdrops the walls broke down suddenly and i was out in a grassy olive orchard following a track beside pieces of fallen overgrown masonry so i came to skirt the brink of a steep little gorge at the bottom of which a stream was rushing down its steep slant to the lake here i stood to look for my snowdrops the grassy rocky bank went down steep from my feet i heard water tittletattling away in deep shadow below there were pale flecks in the dimness but these i knew were primroses so i scrambled down  looking up out of the heavy shadow that lay in the cleft i could see right in the sky grey rocks shining transcendent in the pure empyrean are they so far up i thought i did not dare to say am i so far down but i was uneasy nevertheless it was a lovely place in the cold shadow complete when one forgot the shining rocks far above it was a complete shadowless world of shadow primroses were everywhere in nests of pale bloom upon the dark steep face of the cleft and tongues of fern hanging out and here and there under the rods and twigs of bushes were tufts of wrecked christmas roses nearly over but still in the coldest corners the lovely buds like handfuls of snow there had been such crowded sumptuous tufts of christmas roses everywhere in the streamgullies during the shadow of winter that these few remaining flowers were hardly noticeable  i gathered instead the primroses that smelled of earth and of the weather there were no snowdrops i had found the day before a bank of crocuses pale fragile lilaccoloured flowers with dark veins pricking up keenly like myriad little lilaccoloured flames among the grass under the olive trees and i wanted very much to find the snowdrops hanging in the gloom but there were not any  i gathered a handful of primroses then i climbed suddenly quickly out of the deep watercourse anxious to get back to the sunshine before the evening fell up above i saw the olive trees in the sunny golden grass and sunlit grey rocks immensely high up i was afraid lest the evening would fall whilst i was groping about like an otter in the damp and the darkness that the day of sunshine would be over  soon i was up in the sunshine again on the turf under the olive trees reassured it was the upper world of glowing light and i was safe again  all the olives were gathered and the mills were going night and day making a great acrid scent of olive oil in preparation by the lake the little stream rattled down a mule driver hued to his mules on the strada vecchia high up on the strada nuova the beautiful new military highroad which winds with beautiful curves up the mountainside crossing the same stream several times in clearleaping bridges travelling cut out of sheer slope high above the lake winding beautifully and gracefully forward to the austrian frontier where it ends high up on the lovely swinging road in the strong evening sunshine i saw a bullock wagon moving like a vision though the clanking of the wagon and the crack of the bullock whip responded close in my ears  everything was clear and suncoloured up there cleargrey rocks partaking of the sky tawny grass and scrub brownygreen spires of cypresses and then the mist of greygreen olives fuming down to the lakeside there was no shadow only clear sunsubstance built up to the sky a bullock wagon moving slowly in the high sunlight along the uppermost terrace of the military road it sat in the warm stillness of the transcendent afternoon  the four oclock steamer was creeping down the lake from the austrian end creeping under the cliffs far away the verona side beyond the island lay fused in dim gold the mountain opposite was so still that my heart seemed to fade in its beating as if it too would be still all was perfectly still pure substance the little steamer on the floor of the world below the mules down the road cast no shadow they too were pure sunsubstance travelling on the surface of the sunmade world  a cricket hopped near me then i remembered that it was saturday afternoon when a strange suspension comes over the world and then just below me i saw two monks walking in their garden between the naked bony vines walking in their wintry garden of bony vines and olive trees their brown cassocks passing between the brown vinestocks their heads bare to the sunshine sometimes a glint of light as their feet strode from under their skirts  it was so still everything so perfectly suspended that i felt them talking they marched with the peculiar march of monks a long loping stride their heads together their skirts swaying slowly two brown monks with hidden hands sliding under the bony vines and beside the cabbages their heads always together in hidden converse it was as if i were attending with my dark soul to their inaudible undertone all the time i sat still in silence i was one with them a partaker though i could hear no sound of their voices i went with the long stride of their skirted feet that slid springless and noiseless from end to end of the garden and back again their hands were kept down at their sides hidden in the long sleeves and the skirts of their robes they did not touch each other nor gesticulate as they walked there was no motion save the long furtive stride and the heads leaning together yet there was an eagerness in their conversation almost like shadowcreatures ventured out of their cold obscure element they went backwards and forwards in their wintry garden thinking nobody could see them  across above them was the faint rousing dazzle of snow they never looked up but the dazzle of snow began to glow as they walked the wonderful faint ethereal flush of the long range of snow in the heavens at evening began to kindle another world was coming to pass the cold rare night it was dawning in exquisite icy rose upon the long mountainsummit opposite the monks walked backwards and forwards talking in the first undershadow  and i noticed that up above the snow frail in the bluish sky a frail moon had put forth like a thin scalloped film of ice floated out on the slow current of the coming night and a bell sounded  and still the monks were pacing backwards and forwards backwards and forwards with a strange neutral regularity  the shadows were coming across everything because of the mountains in the west already the olive wood where i sat was extinguished this was the world of the monks the rim of pallor between night and day here they paced backwards and forwards backwards and forwards in the neutral shadowless light of shadow  neither the flare of day nor the completeness of night reached them they paced the narrow path of the twilight treading in the neutrality of the law neither the blood nor the spirit spoke in them only the law the abstraction of the average the infinite is positive and negative but the average is only neutral and the monks trod backward and forward down the line of neutrality  meanwhile on the length of mountainridge the snow grew rosyincandescent like heaven breaking into blossom after all eternal notbeing and eternal being are the same in the rosy snow that shone in heaven over a darkened earth was the ecstasy of consummation night and day are one light and dark are one both the same in the origin and in the issue both the same in the moment of ecstasy light fused in darkness and darkness fused in light as in the rosy snow above the twilight  but in the monks it was not ecstasy in them it was neutrality the under earth transcendent above the shadowed twilit earth was the rosy snow of ecstasy but spreading far over us down below was the neutrality of the twilight of the monks the flesh neutralizing the spirit the spirit neutralizing the flesh the law of the average asserted this was the monks as they paced backward and forward  the moon climbed higher away from the snowy fading ridge she became gradually herself between the roots of the olive tree was a rosytipped daisy just going to sleep i gathered it and put it among the frail moony little bunch of primroses so that its sleep should warm the rest also i put in some little periwinkles that were very blue reminding me of the eyes of the old woman  the day was gone the twilight was gone and the snow was invisible as i came down to the side of the lake only the moon white and shining was in the sky like a woman glorying in her own loveliness as she loiters superbly to the gaze of all the world looking sometimes through the fringe of dark olive leaves sometimes looking at her own superb quivering body wholly naked in the water of the lake  my little old woman was gone she all daysunshine would have none of the moon always she must live like a bird looking down on all the world at once so that it lay all subsidiary to herself herself the wakeful consciousness hovering over the world like a hawk like a sleep of wakefulness and like a bird she went to sleep as the shadows came  she did not know the yielding up of the senses and the possession of the unknown through the senses which happens under a superb moon the allglorious sun knows none of these yieldings up he takes his way and the daisies at once go to sleep and the soul of the old spinningwoman also closed up at sunset the rest was a sleep a cessation  it is all so strange and varied the darkskinned italians ecstatic in the night and the moon the blueeyed old woman ecstatic in the busy sunshine the monks in the garden below who are supposed to unite both passing only in the neutrality of the average where then is the meetingpoint where in mankind is the ecstasy of light and dark together the supreme transcendence of the afterglow day hovering in the embrace of the coming night like two angels embracing in the heavens like eurydice in the arms of orpheus or persephone embraced by pluto  where is the supreme ecstasy in mankind which makes day a delight and night a delight purpose an ecstasy and a concourse in ecstasy and single abandon of the single body and soul also an ecstasy under the moon where is the transcendent knowledge in our hearts uniting sun and darkness day and night spirit and senses why do we not know that the two in consummation are one that each is only part partial and alone for ever but that the two in consummation are perfect beyond the range of loneliness or solitude    2  the lemon gardens   the padrone came just as we were drinking coffee after dinner it was two oclock because the steamer going down the lake to desenzano had bustled through the sunshine and the rocking of the water still made lights that danced up and down upon the wall among the shadows by the piano  the signore was very apologetic i found him bowing in the hall cap in one hand a slip of paper in the other protesting eagerly in broken french against disturbing me  he is a little shrivelled man with closecropped grey hair on his skull and a protruding jaw which with his gesticulations always makes me think of an ancient aristocratic monkey the signore is a gentleman and the last shrivelled representative of his race his only outstanding quality according to the villagers is his avarice  maismais monsieurje crains quequeque je vous d√©range  he spreads wide his hands and bows looking up at me with implicit brown eyes so ageless in his wrinkled monkeys face like onyx he loves to speak french because then he feels grand he has a queer na√Øve ancient passion to be grand as the remains of an impoverished family he is not much better than a welltodo peasant but the old spirit is eager and pathetic in him  he loves to speak french to me he holds his chin and waits in his anxiety for the phrase to come then it stammers forth a little rush ending in italian but his pride is all on edge we must continue in french  the hall is cold yet he will not come into the large room this is not a courtesy visit he is not here in his quality of gentleman he is only an anxious villager  voyez monsieurcetcetquestce quequestce que veut dire cetcela  he shows me the paper it is an old scrap of print the picture of an american patent doorspring with directions fasten the spring either end up wind it up never unwind  it is laconic and american the signore watches me anxiously waiting holding his chin he is afraid he ought to understand my english i stutter off into french confounded by the laconic phrases of the directions nevertheless i make it clear what the paper says  he cannot believe me it must say something else as well he has not done anything contrary to these directions he is most distressed  mais monsieur la portela porteelle ferme paselle souvre  he skipped to the door and showed me the whole tragic mystery the door it is shutecco he releases the catch and poufshe flies open she flies open it is quite final  the brown expressionless ageless eyes that remind me of a monkeys or of onyx wait for me i feel the responsibility devolve upon me i am anxious  allow me i said to come and look at the door  i feel uncomfortably like sherlock holmes the padrone protestsnon monsieur non cela vous d√©rangethat he only wanted me to translate the words he does not want to disturb me nevertheless we go i feel i have the honour of mechanical england in my hands  the casa di paoli is quite a splendid place it is large pink and cream rising up to a square tower in the centre throwing off a painted loggia at either extreme of the fa√ßade it stands a little way back from the road just above the lake and grass grows on the bay of cobbled pavement in front when at night the moon shines full on this pale fa√ßade the theatre is far outdone in staginess  the hall is spacious and beautiful with great glass doors at either end through which shine the courtyards where bamboos fray the sunlight and geraniums glare red the floor is of soft red tiles oiled and polished like glass the walls are washed greywhite the ceiling is painted with pink roses and birds this is halfway between the outer world and the interior world it partakes of both  the other rooms are dark and ugly there is no mistake about their being interior they are like furnished vaults the redtiled polished floor in the drawingroom seems cold and clammy the carved cold furniture stands in its tomb the air has been darkened and starved to death it is perished  outside the sunshine runs like birds singing up above the grey rocks build the sunsubstance in heaven san tommaso guards the terrace but inside here is the immemorial shadow  again i had to think of the italian soul how it is dark cleaving to the eternal night it seems to have become so at the renaissance after the renaissance  in the middle ages christian europe seems to have been striving out of a strong primitive animal nature towards the selfabnegation and the abstraction of christ this brought about by itself a great sense of completeness the two halves were joined by the effort towards the one as yet unrealized there was a triumphant joy in the whole  but the movement all the time was in one direction towards the elimination of the flesh man wanted more and more to become purely free and abstract pure freedom was in pure abstraction the word was absolute when man became as the word a pure law then he was free  but when this conclusion was reached the movement broke already botticelli painted aphrodite queen of the senses supreme along with mary queen of heaven and michelangelo suddenly turned back on the whole christian movement back to the flesh the flesh was supreme and godlike in the oneness of the flesh in the oneness of our physical being we are one with god with the father god the father created man in the flesh in his own image michelangelo swung right back to the old mosaic position christ did not exist to michelangelo there was no salvation in the spirit there was god the father the begetter the author of all flesh and there was the inexorable law of the flesh the last judgement the fall of the immortal flesh into hell  this has been the italian position ever since the mind that is the light the senses they are the darkness aphrodite the queen of the senses she born of the seafoam is the luminousness of the gleaming senses the phosphorescence of the sea the senses become a conscious aim unto themselves she is the gleaming darkness she is the luminous night she is goddess of destruction her white cold fire consumes and does not create  this is the soul of the italian since the renaissance in the sunshine he basks asleep gathering up a vintage into his veins which in the nighttime he will distil into ecstatic sensual delight the intense whitecold ecstasy of darkness and moonlight the raucous catlike destructive enjoyment the senses conscious and crying out in their consciousness in the pangs of the enjoyment which has consumed the southern nation perhaps all the latin races since the renaissance  it is a lapse back back to the original position the mosaic position of the divinity of the flesh and the absoluteness of its laws but also there is the aphroditeworship the flesh the senses are now selfconscious they know their aim their aim is in supreme sensation they seek the maximum of sensation they seek the reduction of the flesh the flesh reacting upon itself to a crisis an ecstasy a phosphorescent transfiguration in ecstasy  the mind all the time subserves the senses as in a cat there is subtlety and beauty and the dignity of the darkness but the fire is cold as in the eyes of a cat it is a green fire it is fluid electric at its maximum it is the white ecstasy of phosphorescence in the darkness always amid the darkness as under the black fur of a cat like the feline fire it is destructive always consuming and reducing to the ecstasy of sensation which is the end in itself  there is the i always the i and the mind is submerged overcome but the senses are superbly arrogant the senses are the absolute the godlike for i can never have another mans senses these are me my senses absolutely me and all that is can only come to me through my senses so that all is me and is administered unto me the rest that is not me is nothing it is something which is nothing so the italian through centuries has avoided our northern purposive industry because it has seemed to him a form of nothingness  it is the spirit of the tiger the tiger is the supreme manifestation of the senses made absolute this is the      tiger tiger burning bright     in the forests of the night  of blake it does indeed burn within the darkness but the essential fate of the tiger is cold and white a white ecstasy it is seen in the white eyes of the blazing cat this is the supremacy of the flesh which devours all and becomes transfigured into a magnificent brindled flame a burning bush indeed  this is one way of transfiguration into the eternal flame the transfiguration through ecstasy in the flesh like the tiger in the night i devour all flesh i drink all blood until this fuel blazes up in me to the consummate fire of the infinite in the ecstacy i am infinite i become again the great whole i am a flame of the one white flame which is the infinite the eternal the originator the creator the everlasting god in the sensual ecstasy having drunk all blood and devoured all flesh i am become again the eternal fire i am infinite  this is the way of the tiger the tiger is supreme his head is flattened as if there were some great weight on the hard skull pressing pressing pressing the mind into a stone pressing it down under the blood to serve the blood it is the subjugate instrument of the blood the will lies above the loins as it were at the base of the spinal column there is the living will the living mind of the tiger there in the slender loins that is the node there in the spinal cord  so the italian so the soldier this is the spirit of the soldier he too walks with his consciousness concentrated at the base of the spine his mind subjugated submerged the will of the soldier is the will of the great cats the will to ecstasy in destruction in absorbing life into his own life always his own life supreme till the ecstasy burst into the white eternal flame the infinite the flame of the infinite then he is satisfied he has been consummated in the infinite  this is the true soldier this is the immortal climax of the senses this is the acme of the flesh the one superb tiger who has devoured all living flesh and now paces backwards and forwards in the cage of its own infinite glaring with blind fierce absorbed eyes at that which is nothingness to it  the eyes of the tiger cannot see except with the light from within itself by the light of its own desire its own white cold light is so fierce that the other warm light of day is outshone it is not it does not exist so the white eyes of the tiger gleam to a point of concentrated vision upon that which does not exist hence its terrifying sightlessness the something which i know i am is hollow space to its vision offers no resistance to the tigers looking it can only see of me that which it knows i am a scent a resistance a voluptuous solid a struggling warm violence that it holds overcome a running of hot blood between its jaws a delicious pang of live flesh in the mouth this it sees the rest is not  and what is the rest that which isnot the tiger that which the tiger isnot what is this  what is that which parted ways with the terrific eaglelike angel of the senses at the renaissance the italians said we are one in the father we will go back the northern races said we are one in christ we will go on  what is the consummation in christ man knows satisfaction when he surpasses all conditions and becomes to himself consummate in the infinite when he reaches a state of infinity in the supreme ecstasy of the flesh the dionysic ecstasy he reaches this state but how does it come to pass in christ  it is not the mystic ecstasy the mystic ecstasy is a special sensual ecstasy it is the senses satisfying themselves with a selfcreated object it is selfprojection into the self the sensuous self satisfied in a projected self      blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven      blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for     theirs is the kingdom of heaven  the kingdom of heaven is this infinite into which we may be consummated then if we are poor in spirit or persecuted for righteousness sake      whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other     also      love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that     hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and     persecute you      be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is     perfect  to be perfect to be one with god to be infinite and eternal what shall we do we must turn the other cheek and love our enemies  christ is the lamb which the eagle swoops down upon the dove taken by the hawk the deer which the tiger devours  what then if a man come to me with a sword to kill me and i do not resist him but suffer his sword and the death from his sword what am i am i greater than he am i stronger than he do i know a consummation in the infinite i the prey beyond the tiger who devours me by my nonresistance i have robbed him of his consummation for a tiger knows no consummation unless he kill a violated and struggling prey there is no consummation merely for the butcher nor for a hyena i can rob the tiger of his ecstasy his consummation his very my nonresistance in my nonresistance the tiger is infinitely destroyed  but i what am i be ye therefore perfect wherein am i perfect in this submission is there an affirmation behind my negation other than the tigers affirmation of his own glorious infinity  what is the oneness to which i subscribe i who offer no resistance in the flesh  have i only the negative ecstasy of being devoured of becoming thus part of the lord the great moloch the superb and terrible god i have this also this subject ecstasy of consummation but is there nothing else  the word of the tiger is my senses are supremely me and my senses are god in me but christ said god is in the others who are notme in all the multitude of the others is god and this is the great god greater than the god which is me god is that which is notme  and this is the christian truth a truth complementary to the pagan affirmation god is that which is me  god is that which is notme in realizing the notme i am consummated i become infinite in turning the other cheek i submit to god who is greater than i am other than i am who is in that which is not me this is the supreme consummation to achieve this consummation i love my neighbour as myself my neighbour is all that is not me and if i love all this have i not become one with the whole is not my consummation complete am i not one with god have i not achieved the infinite  after the renaissance the northern races continued forward to put into practice this religious belief in the god which is notme even the idea of the saving of the soul was really negative it was a question of escaping damnation the puritans made the last great attack on the god who is me when they beheaded charles the first the king by divine right they destroyed symbolically for ever the supremacy of the me who am the image of god the me of the flesh of the senses me the tiger burning bright me the king the lord the aristocrat me who am divine because i am the body of god  after the puritans we have been gathering data for the god who is notme when pope said know then thyself presume not god to scan the proper study of mankind is man he was stating the proposition a man is right he is consummated when he is seeking to know man the great abstract and the method of knowledge is by the analysis which is the destruction of the self the proposition up to that time was a man is the epitome of the universe he has only to express himself to fulfil his desires to satisfy his supreme senses  now the change has come to pass the individual man is a limited being finite in himself yet he is capable of apprehending that which is not himself the proper study of mankind is man this is another way of saying thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself which means a man is consummated in his knowledge of that which is not himself the abstract man therefore the consummation lies in seeking that other in knowing that other whereas the stuart proposition was a man is consummated in expressing his own self  the new spirit developed into the empirical and ideal systems of philosophy everything that is is consciousness and in every mans consciousness man is great and illimitable whilst the individual is small and fragmentary therefore the individual must sink himself in the great whole of mankind  this is the spirituality of shelley the perfectibility of man this is the way in which we fulfil the commandment be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect this is saint pauls now i know in part but then shall i know even as i am known  when a man knows everything and understands everything then he will be perfect and life will be blessed he is capable of knowing everything and understanding everything hence he is justified in his hope of infinite freedom and blessedness  the great inspiration of the new religion was the inspiration of freedom when i have submerged or distilled away my concrete body and my limited desires when i am like the skylark dissolved in the sky yet filling heaven and earth with song then i am perfect consummated in the infinite when i am all that is notme then i have perfect liberty i know no limitation only i must eliminate the self  it was this religious belief which expressed itself in science science was the analysis of the outer self the elementary substance of the self the outer world and the machine is the great reconstructed selfless power hence the active worship to which we were given at the end of the last century the worship of mechanized force  still we continue to worship that which is notme the selfless world though we would fain bring in the self to help us we are shouting the shakespearean advice to warriors then simulate the action of the tiger we are trying to become again the tiger the supreme imperial warlike self at the same time our ideal is the selfless world of equity  we continue to give service to the selfless god we worship the great selfless oneness in the spirit oneness in service of the great humanity that which is notme this selfless god is he who works for all alike without consideration and his image is the machine which dominates and cows us we cower before it we run to serve it for it works for all humanity alike  at the same time we want to be warlike tigers that is the horror the confusing of the two ends we warlike tigers fit ourselves out with machinery and our blazing tiger wrath is emitted through a machine it is a horrible thing to see machines hauled about by tigers at the mercy of tigers forced to express the tiger it is a still more horrible thing to see tigers caught up and entangled and torn in machinery it is horrible a chaos beyond chaos an unthinkable hell  the tiger is not wrong the machine is not wrong but we liars lipservers duplicate fools we are unforgivably wrong we say i will be a tiger because i love mankind out of love for other people out of selfless service to that which is not me i will even become a tiger which is absurd a tiger devours because it is consummated in devouring it achieves its absolute self in devouring it does not devour because its unselfish conscience bids it do so for the sake of the other deer and doves or the other tigers  having arrived at the one extreme of mechanical selflessness we immediately embrace the other extreme of the transcendent self but we try to be both at once we do not cease to be the one before we become the other we do not even play the roles in turn we want to be the tiger and the deer both in one which is just ghastly nothingness we try to say the tiger is the lamb and the lamb is the tiger which is nil nihil nought  the padrone took me into a small room almost contained in the thickness of the wall there the signoras dark eyes glared with surprise and agitation seeing me intrude she is younger than the signore a mere village tradesmans daughter and alas childless  it was quite true the door stood open madame put down the screwdriver and drew herself erect her eyes were a flame of excitement this question of a doorspring that made the door fly open when it should make it close roused a vivid spark in her soul it was she who was wrestling with the angel of mechanism  she was about forty years old and flamelike and fierily sad i think she did not know she was sad but her heart was eaten by some impotence in her life  she subdued her flame of life to the little padrone he was strange and static scarcely human ageless like a monkey she supported him with her flame supported his static ancient beautiful form kept it intact but she did not believe in him  now the signora gemma held her husband together whilst he undid the screw that fixed the spring if they had been alone she would have done it pretending to be under his direction but since i was there he did it himself a grey shaky highlybred little gentleman standing on a chair with a long screwdriver whilst his wife stood behind him her hands halfraised to catch him if he should fall yet he was strangely absolute with a strange intact force in his breeding  they had merely adjusted the strong spring to the shut door and stretched it slightly in fastening it to the doorjamb so that it drew together the moment the latch was released and the door flew open  we soon made it right there was a moment of anxiety the screw was fixed and the door swung to they were delighted the signora gemma who roused in me an electric kind of melancholy clasped her hands together in ecstasy as the door swiftly shut itself  ecco she cried in her vibrating almost warlike womans voice ecco  her eyes were aflame as they looked at the door she ran forward to try it herself she opened the door expectantly eagerly poufit shut with a bang  ecco she cried her voice quivering like bronze overwrought but triumphant  i must try also i opened the door pouf it shut with a bang we all exclaimed with joy  then the signor di paoli turned to me with a gracious bland formal grin he turned his back slightly on the woman and stood holding his chin his strange horsemouth grinning almost pompously at me it was an affair of gentlemen his wife disappeared as if dismissed then the padrone broke into cordial motion we must drink  he would show me the estate i had already seen the house we went out by the glass doors on the left into the domestic courtyard  it was lower than the gardens round it and the sunshine came through the trellised arches on to the flagstones where the grass grew fine and green in the cracks and all was deserted and spacious and still there were one or two orangetubs in the light  then i heard a noise and there in the corner among all the pink geraniums and the sunshine the signora gemma sat laughing with a baby it was a fair bonny thing of eighteen months the signora was concentrated upon the child as he sat stolid and handsome in his little white cap perched on a bench picking at the pink geraniums  she laughed bent forward her dark face out of the shadow swift into a glitter of sunshine near the sunny baby laughing again excitedly making mothernoises the child took no notice of her she caught him swiftly into the shadow and they were obscured her dark head was against the babys wool jacket she was kissing his neck avidly under the creeper leaves the pink geraniums still frilled joyously in the sunshine  i had forgotten the padrone suddenly i turned to him inquiringly  the signoras nephew he explained briefly curtly in a small voice it was as if he were ashamed or too deeply chagrined  the woman had seen us watching so she came across the sunshine with the child laughing talking to the baby not coming out of her own world to us not acknowledging us except formally  the signor pietro queer old horse began to laugh and neigh at the child with strange rancorous envy the child twisted its face to cry the signora caught it away dancing back a few yards from her old husband  i am a stranger i said to her across the distance he is afraid of a stranger  no no she cried back her eyes flaring up it is the man he always cries at the men  she advanced again laughing and roused with the child in her arms her husband stood as if overcast obliterated she and i and the baby in the sunshine laughed a moment then i heard the neighing forced laugh of the old man he would not be left out he seemed to force himself forward he was bitter acrid with chagrin and obliteration struggling as if to assert his own existence he was nullified  the woman also was uncomfortable i could see she wanted to go away with the child to enjoy him alone with palpitating pained enjoyment it was her brothers boy and the old padrone was as if nullified by her ecstasy over the baby he held his chin gloomy fretful unimportant  he was annulled i was startled when i realized it it was as though his reality were not attested till he had a child it was as if his raison d√™tre had been to have a son and he had no children therefore he had no raison d√™tre he was nothing a shadow that vanishes into nothing and he was ashamed consumed by his own nothingness  i was startled this then is the secret of italys attraction for us this phallic worship to the italian the phallus is the symbol of individual creative immortality to each man his own godhead the child is but the evidence of the godhead  and this is why the italian is attractive supple and beautiful because he worships the godhead in the flesh we envy him we feel pale and insignificant beside him yet at the same time we feel superior to him as if he were a child and we adult  wherein are we superior only because we went beyond the phallus in the search of the godhead the creative origin and we found the physical forces and the secrets of science  we have exalted man far above the man who is in each one of us our aim is a perfect humanity a perfect and equable human consciousness selfless and we obtain it in the subjection reduction analysis and destruction of the self so on we go active in science and mechanics and social reform  but we have exhausted ourselves in the process we have found great treasures and we are now impotent to use them so we have said what good are these treasures they are vulgar nothings we have said let us go back from this adventuring let us enjoy our own flesh like the italian but our habit of life our very constitution prevents our being quite like the italian the phallus will never serve us as a godhead because we do not believe in it no northern race does therefore either we set ourselves to serve our children calling them the future or else we turn perverse and destructive give ourselves joy in the destruction of the flesh  the children are not the future the living truth is the future time and people do not make the future retrogression is not the future fifty million children growing up purposeless with no purpose save the attainment of their own individual desires these are not the future they are only a disintegration of the past the future is in living growing truth in advancing fulfilment  but it is no good whatever we do it is within the greater will towards selfreduction and a perfect society analysis on the one hand and mechanical construction on the other this will dominates us as a whole and until the whole breaks down the will must persist so that now continuing in the old splendid will for a perfect selfless humanity we have become inhuman and unable to help ourselves we are but attributes of the great mechanized society we have created on our way to perfection and this great mechanized society being selfless is pitiless it works on mechanically and destroys us it is our master and our god  it is past the time to leave off to cease entirely from what we are doing and from what we have been doing for hundreds of years it is past the time to cease seeking one infinite ignoring striving to eliminate the other the infinite is twofold the father and the son the dark and the light the senses and the mind the soul and the spirit the self and the notself the eagle and the dove the tiger and the lamb the consummation of man is twofold in the self and in selflessness by great retrogression back to the source of darkness in me the self deep in the senses i arrive at the original creative infinite by projection forth from myself by the elimination of my absolute sensual self i arrive at the ultimate infinite oneness in the spirit they are two infinites twofold approach to god and man must know both  but he must never confuse them they are eternally separate the lion shall never lie down with the lamb the lion eternally shall devour the lamb the lamb eternally shall be devoured man knows the great consummation in the flesh the sensual ecstasy and that is eternal also the spiritual ecstasy of unanimity that is eternal but the two are separate and never to be confused to neutralize the one with the other is unthinkable an abomination confusion is horror and nothingness  the two infinites negative and positive they are always related but they are never identical they are always opposite but there exists a relation between them this is the holy ghost of the christian trinity and it is this the relation which is established between the two infinites the two natures of god which we have transgressed forgotten sinned against the father is the father and the son is the son i may know the son and deny the father or know the father and deny the son but that which i may never deny and which i have denied is the holy ghost which relates the dual infinites into one whole which relates and keeps distinct the dual natures of god to say that the two are one this is the inadmissible lie the two are related by the intervention of the third into a oneness  there are two ways there is not only one there are two opposite ways to consummation but that which relates them like the base of the triangle this is the constant the absolute this makes the ultimate whole and in the holy spirit i know the two ways the two infinites the two consummations and knowing the two i admit the whole but excluding one i exclude the whole and confusing the two i make nullity nihil  mais said the signore starting from his scene of ignominy where his wife played with another mans child maisvoulezvous vous promener dans mes petites terres  it came out fluently he was so much roused in selfdefence and selfassertion  we walked under the pergola of bony vinestocks secure in the sunshine within the walls only the long mountain parallel with us looking in  i said how i liked the big vinegarden i asked when it ended the pride of the padrone came back with a click he pointed me to the terrace to the great shut lemonhouses above they were all his buthe shrugged his italian shouldersit was nothing just a little garden vous savez monsieur i protested it was beautiful that i loved it and that it seemed to me very large indeed he admitted that today perhaps it was beautiful  perch√®parce queil fait un tempocos√¨tr√®s belltr√®s beau ecco  he alighted on the word beau hurriedly like a bird coming to ground with a little bounce  the terraces of the garden are held up to the sun the sun falls full upon them they are like a vessel slanted up to catch the superb heavy light within the walls we are remote perfect moving in heavy spring sunshine under the bony avenue of vines the padrone makes little exclamatory noises that mean nothing and teaches me the names of vegetables the land is rich and black  opposite us looking down on our security is the long arched mountain of snow we climbed one flight of steps and we could see the little villages on the opposite side of the lake we climbed again and could see the water rippling  we came to a great stone building that i had thought was a storehouse for openair storage because the walls are open halfway up showing the darkness inside and the corner pillar very white and square and distinct in front of it  entering carelessly into the dimness i started for at my feet was a great floor of water clear and green in its obscurity going down between the walls a reservoir in the gloom the signore laughed at my surprise it was for irrigating the land he said it stank slightly with a raw smell otherwise i said what a wonderful bath it would make the old signore gave his little neighing laugh at the idea  then we climbed into a great loft of leaves ruddy brown stored in a great bank under the roof seeming to give off a little red heat as they gave off the lovely perfume of the hills we passed through and stood at the foot of the lemonhouse the big blind building rose high in the sunshine before us  all summer long upon the mountain slopes steep by the lake stands the rows of naked pillars rising out of the green foliage like ruins of temples white square pillars of masonry standing forlorn in their colonnades and squares rising up the mountainsides here and there as if they remained from some great race that had once worshipped here and still in the winter some are seen standing away in lonely places where the sun streams full grey rows of pillars rising out of a broken wall tier above tier naked to the sky forsaken  they are the lemon plantations and the pillars are to support the heavy branches of the trees but finally to act as scaffolding of the great wooden houses that stand blind and ugly covering the lemon trees in the winter  in november when cold winds came down and snow had fallen on the mountains from out of the storehouses the men were carrying timber and we heard the clang of falling planks then as we walked along the military road on the mountainside we saw below on the top of the lemon gardens long thin poles laid from pillar to pillar and we heard the two men talking and singing as they walked across perilously placing the poles in their clumsy zoccoli they strode easily across though they had twenty or thirty feet to fall if they slipped but the mountainside rising steeply seemed near and above their heads the rocks glowed high into the sky so that the sense of elevation must have been taken away at any rate they went easily from pillarsummit to pillarsummit with a great cave of space below then again was the rattle and clang of planks being laid in order ringing from the mountainside over the blue lake till a platform of timber old and brown projected from the mountainside a floor when seen from above a hanging roof when seen from below and we on the road above saw the men sitting easily on this flimsy hanging platform hammering the planks and all day long the sound of hammering echoed among the rocks and olive woods and came a faint quick concussion to the men on the boats far out when the roofs were on they put in the fronts blocked in between the white pillars withhold dark wood in roughly made panels and here and there at irregular intervals was a panel of glass pane overlapping pane in the long strip of narrow window so that now these enormous unsightly buildings bulge out on the mountainsides rising in two or three receding tiers blind dark sordidlooking places  in the morning i often lie in bed and watch the sunrise the lake lies dim and milky the mountains are dark blue at the back while over them the sky gushes and glistens with light at a certain place on the mountain ridge the light burns gold seems to fuse a little groove on the hills rim it fuses and fuses at this point till of a sudden it comes the intense molten living light the mountains melt suddenly the light steps down there is a glitter a spangle a clutch of spangles a great unbearable suntrack flashing across the milky lake and the light falls on my face then looking aside i hear the little slotting noise which tells me they are opening the lemon gardens a long panel here and there a long slot of darkness at irregular intervals between the brown wood and the glass stripes  voulezvousthe signore bows me in with outstretched handvoulezvous entrer monsieur  i went into the lemonhouse where the poor threes seem to mope in the darkness it is an immense dark cold place tall lemon trees heavy with halfvisible fruit crowd together and rise in the gloom they look like ghosts in the darkness of the underworld stately and as if in life but only grand shadows of themselves and lurking here and there i see one of the pillars but he too seems a shadow not one of the dazzling white fellows i knew here we are trees men pillars the dark earth the sad black paths shut in in this enormous box it is true there are long strips of window and slots of space so that the front is striped and an occasional beam of light fingers the leaves of an enclosed tree and the sickly round lemons but it is nevertheless very gloomy  but it is much colder in here than outside i said  yes replied the signore now but at nighti think  i almost wished it were night to try i wanted to imagine the trees cosy they seemed now in the underworld between the lemon trees beside the path were little orange trees and dozens of oranges hanging like hot coals in the twilight when i warm my hands at them the signore breaks me off one twig after another till i have a bunch of burning oranges among dark leaves a heavy bouquet looking down the hades of the lemonhouse the many ruddyclustered oranges beside the path remind me of the lights of a village along the lake at night while the pale lemons above are the stars there is a subtle exquisite scent of lemon flowers then i notice a citron he hangs heavy and bloated upon so small a tree that he seems a dark green enormity there is a great host of lemons overhead halfvisible a swarm of ruddy oranges by the paths and here and there a fat citron it is almost like being under the sea  at the corners of the path were round little patches of ash and stumps of charred wood where fires had been kindled inside the house on cold nights for during the second and third weeks in january the snow came down so low on the mountains that after climbing for an hour i found myself in a snow lane and saw olive orchards on lawns of snow  the padrone says that all lemons and sweet oranges are grafted on a bitterorange stock the plants raised from seed lemon and sweet orange fell prey to disease so the cultivators found it safe only to raise the native bitter orange and then graft upon it  and the maestrashe is the schoolmistress who wears black gloves while she teaches us italiansays that the lemon was brought by st francis of assisi who came to the garda here and founded a church and a monastery certainly the church of san francesco is very old and dilapidated and its cloisters have some beautiful and original carvings of leaves and fruit upon the pillars which seem to connect san francesco with the lemon i imagine him wandering here with a lemon in his pocket perhaps he made lemonade in the hot summer but bacchus had been before him in the drink trade  looking at his lemons the signore sighed i think he hates them they are leaving him in the lurch they are sold retail at a halfpenny each all the year round but that is as dear or dearer than in england i say ah but says the maestra that is because your lemons are outdoor fruit from sicily per√≤one of our lemons is as good as two from elsewhere  it is true these lemons have an exquisite fragrance and perfume but whether their force as lemons is double that of an ordinary fruit is a question oranges are sold at fourpence halfpenny the kiloit comes about five for twopence small ones the citrons are sold also by weight in sal√≤ for the making of that liqueur known as cedro one citron fetches sometimes a shilling or more but then the demand is necessarily small so that it is evident from these figures the lago di garda cannot afford to grow its lemons much longer the gardens are already many of them in ruins and still more da vendere  we went out of the shadow of the lemonhouse on to the roof of the section below us when we came to the brink of the roof i sat down the padrone stood behind me a shabby shaky little figure on his roof in the sky a little figure of dilapidation dilapidated as the lemonhouses themselves  we were always level with the mountainsnow opposite a film of pure blue was on the hills to the right and the left there had been a wind but it was still now the water breathed an iridescent dust on the far shore where the villages were groups of specks  on the low level of the world on the lake an orangesailed boat leaned slim to the darkblue water which had flecks of foam a woman went downhill quickly with two goats and a sheep among the olives a man was whistling  voyez said the padrone with distant perfect melancholy there was once a lemon garden also thereyou see the short pillars cut off to make a pergola for the vine once there were twice as many lemons as now now we must have vine instead from that piece of land i had two hundred lire a year in lemons from the vine i have only eighty  but wine is a valuable crop i said  ahcos√¨cos√¨ for a man who grows much for mepoco pocopeu  suddenly his face broke into a smile of profound melancholy almost a grin like a gargoyle it was the real italian melancholy very deep static  vous voyez monsieurthe lemon it is all the year all the year but the vineone crop  he lifts his shoulders and spreads his hands with that gesture of finality and fatality while his face takes the blank ageless look of misery like a monkeys there is no hope there is the present either that is enough the present or there is nothing  i sat and looked at the lake it was beautiful as paradise as the first creation on the shores were the ruined lemonpillars standing out in melancholy the clumsy enclosed lemonhouses seemed ramshackle bulging among vine stocks and olive trees the villages too clustered upon their churches seemed to belong to the past they seemed to be lingering in bygone centuries  but it is very beautiful i protested in england  ah in england exclaimed the padrone the same ageless monkeylike grin of fatality tempered by cunning coming on his face in england you have the wealthles richessesyou have the mineral coal and the machines vous savez here we have the sun  he lifted his withered hand to the sky to the wonderful source of that blue day and he smiled in histrionic triumph but his triumph was only histrionic the machines were more to his soul than the sun he did not know these mechanisms their great humancontrived inhuman power and he wanted to know them as for the sun that is common property and no man is distinguished by it he wanted machines machine production money and human power he wanted to know the joy of man who has got the earth in his grip bound it up with railways burrowed it with iron fingers subdued it he wanted this last triumph of the ego this last reduction he wanted to go where the english have gone beyond the self into the great inhuman not self to create the great unliving creators the machines out of the active forces of nature that existed before flesh  but he is too old it remains for the young italian to embrace his mistress the machine  i sat on the roof of the lemonhouse with the lake below and the snowy mountain opposite and looked at the ruins on the old olivefuming shores at all the peace of the ancient world still covered in sunshine and the past seemed to me so lovely that one must look towards it backwards only backwards where there is peace and beauty and no more dissonance  i thought of england the great mass of london and the black fuming laborious midlands and northcountry it seemed horrible and yet it was better than the padrone this old monkeylike cunning of fatality it is better to go forward into error than to stay fixed inextricably in the past  yet what should become of the world there was london and the industrial counties spreading like a blackness over all the world horrible in the end destructive and the garda was so lovely under the sky of sunshine it was intolerable for away beyond beyond all the snowy alps with the iridescence of eternal ice above them was this england black and foul and dry with her soul worn down almost worn away and england was conquering the world with her machines and her horrible destruction of natural life she was conquering the whole world  and yet was she not herself finished in this work she had had enough she had conquered the natural life to the end she was replete with the conquest of the outer world satisfied with the destruction of the self she would cease she would turn round or else expire  if she still lived she would begin to build her knowledge into a great structure of truth there it lay vast masses of roughhewn knowledge vast masses of machines and appliances vast masses of ideas and methods and nothing done with it only teeming swarms of disintegrated human beings seething and perishing rapidly away amongst it till it seems as if a world will be left covered with huge ruins and scored by strange devices of industry and quite dead the people disappeared swallowed up in the last efforts towards a perfect selfless society    3  the theatre   during carnival a company is playing in the theatre on christmas day the padrone came in with the key of his box and would we care to see the drama the theatre was small a mere nothing in fact a mere affair of peasants you understand and the signor di paoli spread his hands and put his head on one side parrotwise but we might find a little diversionun peu de divertiment with this he handed me the key  i made suitable acknowledgements and was really impressed to be handed the key of a box at the theatre so simply and pleasantly in the large sittingroom looking over the grey lake of christmas day it seemed to me a very graceful event the key had a chain and a little shield of bronze on which was beaten out a large figure 8  so the next day we went to see i spettri expecting some good crude melodrama the theatre is an old church since that triumph of the deaf and dumb the cinematograph has come to give us the nervous excitement of speedgrimace agitation and speed as of flying atoms chaosmany an old church in italy has taken a new lease of life  this castoff church made a good theatre i realized how cleverly it had been constructed for the dramatic presentation of religious ceremonies the east end is round the walls are windowless sound is well distributed now everything is theatrical except the stone floor and two pillars at the back of the auditorium and the slightly ecclesiastical seats below  there are two tiers of little boxes in the theatre some forty in all with fringe and red velvet and lined with dark red paper quite like real boxes in a real theatre and the padrones is one of the best it just holds three people  we paid our threepence entrance fee in the stone hall and went upstairs i opened the door of number 8 and we were shut in our little cabin looking down on the world then i found the barber luigi bowing profusely in a box opposite it was necessary to make bows all round ah the chemist on the upper tier near the barber howdoyoudo to the padrona of the hotel who is our good friend and who sits wearing a little beaver shouldercape a few boxes off very cold salutation to the stout village magistrate with the long brown beard who leans forward in the box facing the stage while a grouping of faces look out from behind him a warm smile to the family of the signora gemma across next to the stage then we are settled  i cannot tell why i hate the village magistrate he looks like a family portrait by a flemish artist he himself weighing down the front of the picture with his portliness and his long brown beard whilst the faces of his family are arranged in two groups for the background i think he is angry at our intrusion he is very republican and selfimportant but we eclipse him easily with the aid of a large black velvet hat and black furs and our sunday clothes  downstairs the villagers are crowding drifting like a heavy current the women are seated by church instinct all together on the left with perhaps an odd man at the end of a row beside his wife on the right sprawling in the benches are several groups of bersaglieri in grey uniforms and slanting cocksfeather hats then peasants fishermen and an odd couple or so of brazen girls taking their places on the mens side  at the back lounging against the pillars or standing very dark and sombre are the more reckless spirits of the village their black felt hats are pulled down their cloaks are thrown over their mouths they stand very dark and isolated in their moments of stillness they shout and wave to each other when anything occurs  the men are clean their clothes are all clean washed the rags of the poorest porter are always well washed but it is sunday tomorrow and they are shaved only on a sunday so that they have a weeks black growth on their chins but they have dark soft eyes unconscious and vulnerable they move and balance with loose heedless motion upon their clattering zoccoli they lounge with wonderful ease against the wall at the back or against the two pillars unconscious of the patches on their clothes or of their bare throats that are knotted perhaps with a scarlet rag loose and abandoned they lounge and talk or they watch with wistful absorption the play that is going on  they are strangely isolated in their own atmosphere and as if revealed it is as if their vulnerable being was exposed and they have not the wit to cover it there is a pathos of physical sensibility and mental inadequacy their mind is not sufficiently alert to run with their quick warm senses  the men keep together as if to support each other the women also are together in a hard strong herd it is as if the power the hardness the triumph even in this italian village were with the women in their relentless vindictive unity  that which drives men and women together the indomitable necessity is like a bondage upon the people they submit as under compulsion under constraint they come together mostly in anger and in violence of destructive passion there is no comradeship between men and women none whatsoever but rather a condition of battle reserve hostility  on sundays the uncomfortable excited unwilling youth walks for an hour with his sweetheart at a little distance from her on the public highway in the afternoon this is a concession to the necessity for marriage there is no real courting no happiness of being together only the roused excitement which is based on a fundamental hostility there is very little flirting and what there is is of the subtle cruel kind like a sex duel on the whole the men and women avoid each other almost shun each other husband and wife are brought together in a child which they both worship but in each of them there is only the great reverence for the infant and the reverence for fatherhood or motherhood as the case may be there is no spiritual love  in marriage husband and wife wage the subtle satisfying war of sex upon each other it gives a profound satisfaction a profound intimacy but it destroys all joy all unanimity in action  on sunday afternoons the uncomfortable youth walks by the side of his maiden for an hour in the public highway then he escapes as from a bondage he goes back to his men companions on sunday afternoons and evenings the married woman accompanied by a friend or by a childshe dare not go alone afraid of the strange terrible sexwar between her and the drunken manis seen leading home the winedrunken liberated husband sometimes she is beaten when she gets home it is part of the process but there is no synthetic love between men and women there is only passion and passion is fundamental hatred the act of love is a fight  the child the outcome is divine here the union the oneness is manifest though spirit strove with spirit in mortal conflict during the sexpassion yet the flesh united with flesh in oneness the phallus is still divine but the spirit the mind of man this has become nothing  so the women triumph they sit down below in the theatre their perfectly dressed hair gleaming their backs very straight their heads carried tensely they are not very noticeable they seem held in reserve they are just as tense and stiff as the men are slack and abandoned some strange will holds the women taut they seem like weapons dangerous there is nothing charming nor winning about them at the best a full prolific maternity at the worst a yellow poisonous bitterness of the flesh that is like a narcotic but they are too strong for the men the male spirit which would subdue the immediate flesh to some conscious or social purpose is overthrown the woman in her maternity is the lawgiver the supreme authority the authority of the man in work in public affairs is something trivial in comparison the pathetic ignominy of the village male is complete on sunday afternoon on his great day of liberation when he is accompanied home drunk but sinister by the erect unswerving slightly cowed woman his drunken terrorizing is only pitiable she is so obviously the more constant power  and this is why the men must go away to america it is not the money it is the profound desire to rehabilitate themselves to recover some dignity as men as producers as workers as creators from the spirit not only from the flesh it is a profound desire to get away from women altogether the terrible subjugation to sex the phallic worship  the company of actors in the little theatre was from a small town away on the plain beyond brescia the curtain rose everybody was still with that profound na√Øve attention which children give and after a few minutes i realized that i spettri was ibsens ghosts the peasants and fishermen of the garda even the rows of ungovernable children sat absorbed in watching as the norwegian drama unfolded itself  the actors are peasants the leader is the son of a peasant proprietor he is qualified as a chemist but is unsettled vagrant prefers playacting the signer pietro di paoli shrugs his shoulders and apologizes for their vulgar accent it is all the same to me i am trying to get myself to rights with the play which i have just lately seen in munich perfectly produced and detestable  it was such a change from the hard ethical slightly mechanized characters in the german play which was as perfect an interpretation as i can imagine to the rather pathetic notion of the italian peasants that i had to wait to adjust myself  the mother was a pleasant comfortable woman harassed by something she did not quite know what the pastor was a gingerhaired caricature imitated from the northern stage quite a lay figure the peasants never laughed they watched solemnly and absorbedly like children the servant was just a slim pert forward hussy much too flagrant and then the son the actormanager he was a dark ruddy man broad and thickset evidently of peasant origin but with some education now he was the important figure the play was his  and he was strangely disturbing dark ruddy and powerful he could not be the blighted son of ghosts the hectic unsound northern issue of a diseased father his flashy italian passion for his halfsister was real enough to make one uncomfortable something he wanted and would have in spite of his own soul something which fundamentally he did not want  it was this contradiction within the man that made the play so interesting a robust vigorous man of thirtyeight flaunting and florid as a rather successful italian can be there was yet a secret sickness which oppressed him but it was no taint in the blood it was rather a kind of debility in the soul that which he wanted and would have the sensual excitement in his soul he did not want it no not at all and yet he must act from his physical desires his physical will  his true being his real self was impotent in his soul he was dependent forlorn he was childish and dependent on the mother to hear him say grazia mamma would have tormented the mothersoul in any woman living such a child crying in the night and for what  for he was hotblooded healthy almost in his prime and free as a man can be in his circumstances he had his own way he admitted no thwarting he governed his circumstances pretty much coming to our village with his little company playing the plays he chose himself and yet that which he would have he did not vitally want it was only a sort of inflamed obstinacy that made him so insistent in the masculine way he was not going to be governed by women he was not going to be dictated to in the least by any one and this because he was beaten by his own flesh  his real mans soul the soul that goes forth and builds up a new world out of the void was ineffectual it could only revert to the senses his divinity was the phallic divinity the other male divinity which is the spirit that fulfils in the world the new germ of an idea this was denied and obscured in him unused and it was this spirit which cried out helplessly in him through the insistent inflammable flesh even this playacting was a form of physical gratification for him it had in it neither real mind nor spirit  it was so different from ibsen and so much more moving ibsen is exciting nervously sensational but this was really moving a real crying in the night one loved the italian nation and wanted to help it with all ones soul but when one sees the perfect ibsen how one hates the norwegian and swedish nations they are detestable  they seem to be fingering with the mind the secret places and sources of the blood impertinent irreverent nasty there is a certain intolerable nastiness about the real ibsen the same thing is in strindberg and in most of the norwegian and swedish writings it is with them a sort of phallic worship also but now the worship is mental and perverted the phallus is the real fetish but it is the source of uncleanliness and corruption and death it is the moloch worshipped in obscenity  which is unbearable the phallus is a symbol of creative divinity but it represents only part of creative divinity the italian has made it represent the whole which is now his misery for he has to destroy his symbol in himself  which is why the italian men have the enthusiasm for war unashamed partly it is the true phallic worship for the phallic principle is to absorb and dominate all life but also it is a desire to expose themselves to death to know death that death may destroy in them this too strong dominion of the blood may once more liberate the spirit of outgoing of uniting of making order out of chaos in the outer world as the flesh makes a new order from chaos in begetting a new life set them free to know and serve a greater idea  the peasants below sat and listened intently like children who hear and do not understand yet who are spellbound the children themselves sit spellbound on the benches till the play is over they do not fidget or lose interest they watch with wide absorbed eyes at the mystery held in thrall by the sound of emotion  but the villagers do not really care for ibsen they let it go on the feast of epiphany as a special treat was given a poetic drama by dannunzio la fiaccola sotto il moggiothe light under the bushel  it is a foolish romantic play of no real significance there are several murders and a good deal of artificial horror but it is all a very nice and romantic piece of makebelieve like a charade  so the audience loved it after the performance of ghosts i saw the barber and he had the curious grey clayey look of an italian who is cold and depressed the sterile cold inertia which the socalled passionate nations know so well had settled on him and he went obliterating himself in the street as if he were cold dead  but after the dannunzio play he was like a man who has drunk sweet wine and is warm  ah bellissimo bellissimo he said in tones of intoxicated reverence when he saw me  better than i spettri i said  he halfraised his hands as if to imply the fatuity of the question  ah but he said it was dannunzio the other  that was ibsena great norwegian i said famous all over the world  but you knowdannunzio is a poetoh beautiful beautiful there was no going beyond this bellobellissimo  it was the language which did it it was the italian passion for rhetoric for the speech which appeals to the senses and makes no demand on the mind when an englishman listens to a speech he wants at least to imagine that he understands thoroughly and impersonally what is meant but an italian only cares about the emotion it is the movement the physical effect of the language upon the blood which gives him supreme satisfaction his mind is scarcely engaged at all he is like a child hearing and feeling without understanding it is the sensuous gratification he asks for which is why dannunzio is a god in italy he can control the current of the blood with his words and although much of what he says is bosh yet his hearer is satisfied fulfilled  carnival ends on the 5th of february so each thursday there is a serata d onore of one of the actors the first and the only one for which prices were raisedto a fourpence entrance fee instead of threepencewas for the leading lady the play was the wife of the doctor a modern piece sufficiently uninteresting the farce that followed made me laugh  since it was her evening of honour adelaida was the person to see she is very popular though she is no longer young in fact she is the mother of the young pert person of ghosts  nevertheless adelaida stout and blonde and soft and pathetic is the real heroine of the theatre the prima she is very good at sobbing and afterwards the men exclaim involuntarily out of their strong emotion bella bella the women say nothing they sit stiffly and dangerously as ever but no doubt they quite agree this is the true picture of illused tearstained woman the bearer of many wrongs therefore they take unto themselves the homage of the mens bella bella that follows the sobs it is due recognition of their hard wrongs the woman pays nevertheless they despise in their souls the plump soft adelaida  dear adelaida she is irreproachable in every age in every clime she is dear at any rate to the masculine soul this soft tearblenched blonde illused thing she must be illused and unfortunate dear gretchen dear desdemona dear iphigenia dear dame aux cam√©lias dear lucy of lammermoor dear mary magdalene dear pathetic unfortunate soul in all ages and lands how we love you in the theatre she blossoms forth she is the lily of the stage young and inexperienced as i am i have broken my heart over her several times i could write a sonnetsequence to her yes the fair pale tearstained thing whiterobed with her hair down her back i could call her by a hundred names in a hundred languages melisande elizabeth juliet butterfly ph√®dre minnehaha etc each new time i hear her voice with its faint clang of tears my heart grows big and hot and my bones melt i detest her but it is no good my heart begins to swell like a bud under the plangent rain  the last time i saw her was here on the garda at sal√≤ she was the chalked thinarmed daughter of rigoletto i detested her her voice had a chalky squeak in it and yet by the end my heart was overripe in my breast ready to burst with loving affection i was ready to walk on to the stage to wipe out the odious miscreant lover and to offer her all myself saying i can see it is real love you want and you shall have it i will give it to you  of course i know the secret of the gretchen magic it is all in the save me mr hercules phrase her shyness her timidity her trustfulness her tears foster my own strength and grandeur i am the positive half of the universe but so i am if it comes to that just as positive as the other half  adelaida is plump and her voice has just that moist plangent strength which gives one a real voluptuous thrill the moment she comes on the stage and looks rounda bit scaredshe is she electra isolde sieglinde margu√®rite she wears a dress of black voile like the lady who weeps at the trial in the policecourt this is her modern uniform her antique garment is of trailing white with a blonde pigtail and a flower realistically it is black voile and a handkerchief  adelaida always has a handkerchief and still i cannot resist it i say theres the hanky nevertheless in two minutes it has worked its way with me she squeezes it in her poor plump hand as the tears begin to rise fate or man is inexorable so cruel there is a sob a cry she presses the fist and the hanky to her eyes one eye then the other she weeps real tears tears shaken from the depths of her soft vulnerable victimized female self i cannot stand it there i sit in the padrones little red box and stifle my emotion whilst i repeat in my heart what a shame child what a shame she is twice my age but what is age in such circumstances your poor little hanky its sopping there then dont cry itll be all right ill see youre all right all men are not beasts you know so i cover her protectively in my arms and soon i shall be kissing her for comfort in the heat and prowess of my compassion kissing her soft plump cheek and neck closely bringing my comfort nearer and nearer  it is a pleasant and exciting role for me to play robert burns did the part to perfection      o wert thou in the cauld blast     on yonder lea on yonder lea  how many times does one recite that to all the ophelias and gretchens in the world      thy bield should be my bosom  how one admires ones bosom in that capacity looking down at ones shirtfront one is filled with strength and pride  why are the women so bad at playing this part in real life this opheliagretchen role why are they so unwilling to go mad and die for our sakes they do it regularly on the stage  but perhaps after all we write the plays what a villain i am what a blackbrowed passionate ruthless masculine villain i am to the leading lady on the stage and on the other hand dear heart what a hero what a fount of chivalrous generosity and faith i am anything but a dull and lawabiding citizen i am a galahad full of purity and spirituality i am the lancelot of valour and lust i fold my hands or i cock my hat in one side as the case may be i am myself only i am not a respectable citizen not that in this hour of my glory and my escape  dear heaven how adelaida wept her voice plashing like violin music at my ruthless masculine cruelty dear heart how she sighed to rest on my sheltering bosom and how i enjoyed my dual nature how i admired myself  adelaida chose la moglie del dottore for her evening of honour during the following week came a little storm of coloured bills great evening of honour of enrico persevalli  this is the leader the actormanager what should he choose for his great occasion this broad thickset ruddy descendant of the peasant proprietors of the plain no one knew the title of the play was not revealed  so we were staying at home it was cold and wet but the maestra came inflammably on that thursday evening and were we not going to the theatre to see amleto  poor maestra she is yellow and bitterskinned near fifty but her dark eyes are still corrosively inflammable she was engaged to a lieutenant in the cavalry who got drowned when she was twentyone since then she has hung on the tree unripe growing yellow and bitterskinned never developing  amleto i say non lo conosco  a certain fear comes into her eyes she is schoolmistress and has a mortal dread of being wrong  si she cries wavering appealing una dramma inglese  english i repeated  yes an english drama  how do you write it  anxiously she gets a pencil from her reticule and with blackgloved scrupulousness writes amleto  hamlet i exclaim wonderingly  ecco amleto cries the maestra her eyes aflame with thankful justification  then i knew that signore enrico persevalli was looking to me for an audience his evening of honour would be a bitter occasion to him if the english were not there to see his performance  i hurried to get ready i ran through the rain i knew he would take it badly that it rained on his evening of honour he counted himself a man who had fate against him  sono un disgraziato io  i was late the first act was nearly over the play was not yet alive neither in the bosoms of the actors nor in the audience i closed the door of the box softly and came forward the rolling italian eyes of hamlet glanced up at me there came a new impulse over the court of denmark  enrico looked a sad fool in his melancholy black the doublet sat close making him stout and vulgar the kneebreeches seemed to exaggerate the commonness of his thick rather short strutting legs and he carried a long black rag as a cloak for histrionic purposes and he had on his face a portentous grimace of melancholy and philosophic importance his was the caricature of hamlets melancholy selfabsorption  i stooped to arrange my footstool and compose my countenance i was trying not to grin for the first time attired in philosophic melancholy of black silk enrico looked a boor and a fool his closecropped rather animal head was common above the effeminate doublet his sturdy ordinary figure looked absurd in a melancholic droop  all the actors alike were out of their element their majesties of denmark were touching the queen burly little peasant woman was ill at ease in her pink satin enrico had had no mercy he knew she loved to be the scolding servant or housekeeper with her head tied up in a handkerchief shrill and vulgar yet here she was pranked out in an expanse of satin la regina regina indeed  she obediently did her best to be important indeed she rather fancied herself she looked sideways at the audience selfconsciously quite ready to be accepted as an imposing and noble person if they would esteem her such her voice sounded hoarse and common but whether it was the pink satin in contrast or a cold i do not know she was almost childishly afraid to move before she began a speech she looked down and kicked her skirt viciously so that she was sure it was under control then she let go she was a burly downright little body of sixty one rather expected her to box hamlet on the ears  only she liked being a queen when she sat on the throne there she perched with great satisfaction her train splendidly displayed down the steps she was as proud as a child and she looked like queen victoria of the jubilee period  the king her noble consort also had new honours thrust upon him as well as new garments his body was real enough but it had nothing at all to do with his clothes they established a separate identity by themselves but wherever he went they went with him to the confusion of everybody  he was a thin rather fraillooking peasant pathetic and very gentle there was something pure and fine about him he was so exceedingly gentle and by natural breeding courteous but he did not feel kingly he acted the part with beautiful simple resignation  enrico persevalli had overshot himself in every direction but worst of all in his own he had become a hulking fellow crawling about with his head ducked between his shoulders pecking and poking creeping about after other people sniffing at them setting traps for them absorbed by his own selfimportant selfconsciousness his legs in their black kneebreeches had a crawling slinking look he always carried the black rag of a cloak something for him to twist about as he twisted in his own soul overwhelmed by a sort of inverted perversity  i had always felt an aversion from hamlet a creeping unclean thing he seems on the stage whether he is forbes robertson or anybody else his nasty poking and sniffing at his mother his setting traps for the king his conceited perversion with ophelia make him always intolerable the character is repulsive in its conception based on selfdislike and a spirit of disintegration  there is i think this strain of cold dislike or selfdislike through much of the renaissance art and through all the later shakespeare in shakespeare it is a kind of corruption in the flesh and a conscious revolt from this a sense of corruption in the flesh makes hamlet frenzied for he will never admit that it is his own flesh leonardo da vinci is the same but leonardo loves the corruption maliciously michelangelo rejects any feeling of corruption he stands by the flesh the flesh only it is the corresponding reaction but in the opposite direction but that is all four hundred years ago enrico persevalli has just reached the position he is hamlet and evidently he has great satisfaction in the part he is the modern italian suspicious isolated selfnauseated labouring in a sense of physical corruption but he will not admit it is in himself he creeps about in selfconceit transforming his own selfloathing with what satisfaction did he reveal corruptioncorruption in his neighbours he gloated inletting his mother know he had discovered her incest her uncleanness gloated in torturing the incestuous king of all the unclean ones hamlet was the uncleanest but he accused only the others  except in the great speeches and there enrico was betrayed hamlet suffered the extremity of physical selfloathing loathing of his own flesh the play is the statement of the most significant philosophic position of the renaissance hamlet is far more even than orestes his prototype a mental creature antiphysical antisensual the whole drama is the tragedy of the convulsed reaction of the mind from the flesh of the spirit from the self the reaction from the great aristocratic to the great democratic principle  an ordinary instinctive man in hamlets position would either have set about murdering his uncle by reflex action or else would have gone right away there would have been no need for hamlet to murder his mother it would have been sufficient bloodvengeance if he had killed his uncle but that is the statement according to the aristocratic principle  orestes was in the same position but the same position two thousand years earlier with two thousand years of experience wanting so that the question was not so intricate in him as in hamlet he was not nearly so conscious the whole greek life was based on the idea of the supremacy of the self and the self was always male orestes was his fathers child he would be the same whatever mother he had the mother was but the vehicle the soil in which the paternal seed was planted when clytemnestra murdered agamemnon it was as if a common individual murdered god to the greek  but agamemnon king and lord was not infallible he was fallible he had sacrificed iphigenia for the sake of glory in war for the fulfilment of the superb idea of self but on the other hand he had made cruel dissension for the sake of the concubines captured in war the paternal flesh was fallible ungodlike it lusted after meaner pursuits than glory war and slaying it was not faithful to the highest idea of the self orestes was driven mad by the furies of his mother because of the justice that they represented nevertheless he was in the end exculpated the third play of the trilogy is almost foolish with its prating gods but it means that according to the greek conviction orestes was right and clytemnestra entirely wrong but for all that the infallible king the infallible male self is dead in orestes killed by the furies of clytemnestra he gains his peace of mind after the revulsion from his own physical fallibility but he will never be an unquestioned lord as agamemnon was orestes is left at peace neutralized he is the beginning of nonaristocratic christianity  hamlets father the king is like agamemnon a warriorking but unlike agamemnon he is blameless with regard to gertrude yet gertrude like clytemnestra is the potential murderer of her husband as lady macbeth is murderess as the daughters of lear the women murder the supreme male the ideal self the king and father  this is the tragic position shakespeare must dwell upon the woman rejects repudiates the ideal self which the male represents to her the supreme representative king and father is murdered by the wife and the daughters  what is the reason hamlet goes mad in a revulsion of rage and nausea yet the womenmurderers only represent some ultimate judgement in his own soul at the bottom of his own soul hamlet has decided that the self in its supremacy father and king must die it is a suicidal decision for his involuntary soul to have arrived at yet it is inevitable the great religious philosophic tide which has been swelling all through the middle ages had brought him there  the question to be or not to be which hamlet puts himself does not mean to live or not to live it is not the simple human being who puts himself the question it is the supreme i king and father to be or not to be king father in the self supreme and the decision is not to be  it is the inevitable philosophic conclusion of all the renaissance the deepest impulse in man the religious impulse is the desire to be immortal or infinite consummated and this impulse is satisfied in fulfilment of an idea a steady progression in this progression man is satisfied he seems to have reached his goal this infinity this immortality this eternal being with every step nearer which he takes  and so according to his idea of fulfilment man establishes the whole order of life if my fulfilment is the fulfilment and establishment of the unknown divine self which i am then i shall proceed in the realizing of the greatest idea of the self the highest conception of the i my order of life will be kingly imperial aristocratic the body politic also will culminate in this divinity of the flesh this body imbued with glory invested with divine power and might the king the emperor in the body politic also i shall desire a king an emperor a tyrant glorious mighty in whom i see myself consummated and fulfilled this is inevitable  but during the middle ages struggling within this pagan original transport the transport of the ego was a small dissatisfaction a small contrary desire amid the pomp of kings and popes was the child jesus and the madonna jesus the king gradually dwindled down there was jesus the child helpless at the mercy of all the world and there was jesus crucified  the old transport the old fulfilment of the ego the davidian ecstasy the assuming of all power and glory unto the self the becoming infinite through the absorption of all into the ego this gradually became unsatisfactory this was not the infinite this was not immortality this was eternal death this was damnation  the monk rose up with his opposite ecstasy the christian ecstasy there was a death to die the flesh the self must die so that the spirit should rise again immortal eternal infinite i am dead unto myself but i live in the infinite the finite me is no more only the infinite the eternal is  at the renaissance this great halftruth overcame the other great halftruth the christian infinite reached by a process of abnegation a process of being absorbed dissolved diffused into the great notself supplanted the old pagan infinite wherein the self like a root threw out branches and radicles which embraced the whole universe became the whole  there is only one infinite the world now cried there is the great christian infinite of renunciation and consummation in the notself the other that old pride is damnation the sin of sins is pride it is the way to total damnation whereas the pagans based their life on pride  and according to this new infinite reached through renunciation and dissolving into the others the neighbour man must build up his actual form of life with savonarola and martin luther the living church actually transformed itself for the roman church was still pagan henry viii simply said there is no church there is only the state but with shakespeare the transformation had reached the state also the king the father the representative of the consummate self the maximum of all life the symbol of the consummate being the becoming supreme godlike infinite he must perish and pass away this infinite was not infinite this consummation was not consummated all this was fallible false it was rotten corrupt it must go but shakespeare was also the thing itself hence his horror his frenzy his selfloathing  the king the emperor is killed in the soul of man the old order of life is over the old tree is dead at the root so said shakespeare it was finally enacted in cromwell charles i took up the old position of kingship by divine right like hamlets father he was blameless otherwise but as representative of the old form of life which mankind now hated with frenzy he must be cut down removed it was a symbolic act  the world our world of europe had now really turned swung round to a new goal a new idea the infinite reached through the omission of self god is all that which is notme i am consummate when my self the resistant solid is reduced and diffused into all that which is notme my neighbour my enemy the great otherness then i am perfect  and from this belief the world began gradually to form a new state a new body politic in which the self should be removed there should be no king no lords no aristocrats the world continued in its religious belief beyond the french revolution beyond the great movement of shelley and godwin there should be no self that which was supreme was that which was notme the other the governing factor in the state was the idea of the good of others that is the common good and the vital governing idea in the state has been this idea since cromwell  before cromwell the idea was for the king because every man saw himself consummated in the king after cromwell the idea was for the good of my neighbour or for the good of the people or for the good of the whole this has been our ruling idea by which we have more or less lived  now this has failed now we say that the christian infinite is not infinite we are tempted like nietzsche to return back to the old pagan infinite to say that is supreme or we are inclined like the english and the pragmatist to say there is no infinite there is no absolute the only absolute is expediency the only reality is sensation and momentariness but we may say this even act on it √† la sanine but we never believe it  what is really absolute is the mystic reason which connects both infinites the holy ghost that relates both natures of god if we now wish to make a living state we must build it up to the idea of the holy spirit the supreme relationship we must say the pagan infinite is infinite the christian infinite is infinite these are our two consummations in both of these we are consummated but that which relates them alone is absolute  this absolute of the holy ghost we may call truth or justice or right these are partial names indefinite and unsatisfactory unless there be kept the knowledge of the two infinites pagan and christian which they go between when both are there they are like a superb bridge on which one can stand and know the whole world my world the two halves of the universe  essere o non essere √® qui il punto  to be or not to be was the question for hamlet to settle it is no longer our question at least not in the same sense when it is a question of death the fashionable young suicide declares that his selfdestruction is the final proof of his own incontrovertible being and as for notbeing in our public life we have achieved it as much as ever we want to as much as is necessary whilst in private life there is a swing back to paltry selfishness as a creed and in the war there is the position of neutralization and nothingness it is a question of knowing how to be and how not to be for we must fulfil both enrico persevalli was detestable with his essere o non essere he whispered it in a hoarse whisper as if it were some melodramatic murder he was about to commit as a matter of fact he knows quite well and has known all his life that his pagan infinite his transport of the flesh and the supremacy of the male in fatherhood is all unsatisfactory all his life he has really cringed before the northern infinite of the notself although he has continued in the italian habit of self but it is mere habit sham  how can he know anything about being and notbeing when he is only a maudlin compromise between them and all he wants is to be a maudlin compromise he is neither one nor the other he has neither being nor riotbeing he is as equivocal as the monks he was detestable mouthing hamlets sincere words he has still to let go to know what notbeing is before he can be till he has gone through the christian negation of himself and has known the christian consummation he is a mere amorphous heap  for the soliloquies of hamlet are as deep as the soul of man can go in one direction and as sincere as the holy spirit itself in their essence but thank heaven the bog into which hamlet struggled is almost surpassed  it is a strange thing if a man covers his face and speaks with his eyes blinded how significant and poignant he becomes the ghost of this hamlet was very simple he was wrapped down to the knees in a great white cloth and over his face was an openwork woollen shawl but the na√Øve blind helplessness and verity of his voice was strangely convincing he seemed the most real thing in the play from the knees downward he was laertes because he had on laertes white trousers and patent leather slippers yet he was strangely real a voice out of the dark  the ghost is really one of the plays failures it is so trivial and unspiritual and vulgar and it was spoilt for me from the first when i was a child i went to the twopenny travelling theatre to see hamlet the ghost had on a helmet and a breastplate i sat in pale transport  amblet amblet i am thy fathers ghost  then came a voice from the dark silent audience like a cynical knife to my fond soul  why tha arena i can tell thy voice  the peasants loved ophelia she was in white with her hair down her back poor thing she was pathetic demented and no wonder after hamlets o that this too too solid flesh would melt what then of her young breasts and her womb hamlet with her was a very disagreeable sight the peasants loved her there was a hoarse roar half of indignation half of roused passion at the end of her scene  the graveyard scene too was a great success but i could not bear hamlet and the gravedigger in italian was a mere buffoon the whole scene was farcical to me because of the italian questo cranio signoreand enrico dainty fellow took the skull in a corner of his black cloak as an italian he would not willingly touch it it was unclean but he looked a fool hulking himself in his lugubriousness he was as selfimportant as dannunzio  the close fell flat the peasants had applauded the whole graveyard scene wildly but at the end of all they got up and crowded to the doors as if to hurry away this in spite of enricos final feat he fell backwards smack down three steps of the throne platform on to the stage but planks and braced muscle will bounce and signer amleto bounced quite high again  it was the end of amleto and i was glad but i loved the theatre i loved to look down on the peasants who were so absorbed at the end of the scenes the men pushed back their black hats and rubbed their hair across their brows with a pleased excited movement and the women stirred in their seats  just one man was with his wife and child and he was of the same race as my old woman at san tommaso he was fair thin and clear abstract of the mountains he seemed to have gathered his wife and child together into another finer atmosphere like the air of the mountains and to guard them in it this is the real joseph father of the child he has a fierce abstract look wild and untamed as a hawk but like a hawk at its own nest fierce with love he goes out and buys a tiny bottle of lemonade for a penny and the mother and child sip it in tiny sips whilst he bends over like a hawk arching its wings  it is the fierce spirit of the ego come out of the primal infinite but detached isolated an aristocrat he is not an italian darkblooded he is fair keen as steel with the blood of the mountaineer in him he is like my old spinning woman it is curious how with his wife and child he makes a little separate world down there in the theatre like a hawks nest high and arid under the gleaming sky  the bersaglieri sit close together in groups so that there is a strange corporal connexion between them they have closecropped dark slightly bestial heads and thick shoulders and thick brown hands on each others shoulders when an act is over they pick up their cherished hats and fling on their cloaks and go into the hall they are rather rich the bersaglieri  they are like young halfwild oxen such strong sturdy dark lads thickly built and with strange hard heads like young male caryatides they keep close together as if there were some physical instinct connecting them and they are quite womanless there is a curious interabsorption among themselves a sort of physical trance that holds them all and puts their minds to sleep there is a strange hypnotic unanimity among them as they put on their plumed hats and go out together always very close as if their bodies must touch then they feel safe and content in this heavy physical trance they are in love with one another the young men love the young men they shrink from the world beyond from the outsiders from all who are not bersaglieri of their barracks  one man is a sort of leader he is very straight and solid solid like a wall with a dark unblemished will his cockfeathers slither in a profuse heavy stream from his black oilcloth hat almost to his shoulder he swings round his feathers slip into a cascade then he goes out to the hall his feather tossing and falling richly he must be well off the bersaglieri buy their own black cocksplumes and some pay twenty or thirty francs for the bunch so the maestra said the poor ones have only poor scraggy plumes  there is something very primitive about these men they remind me really of agamemnons soldiers clustered oil the seashore men all men a living vigorous physical host of men but there is a pressure on these italian soldiers as if they were men caryatides with a great weight on their heads making their brain hard asleep stunned they all look is if their real brain were stunned as if there were another centre of physical consciousness from which they lived  separate from them all is pietro the young man who lounges on the wharf to carry things from the steamer he starts up from sleep like a wildcat as somebody claps him on the shoulder it is the start of a man who has many enemies he is almost an outlaw will he ever find himself in prison he is the gamin of the village well detested  he is twentyfour years old thin dark handsome with a catlike lightness and grace and a certain repulsive gamin evil in his face where everybody is so clean and tidy he is almost ragged his weeks beard shows very black in his slightly hollow cheeks he hates the man who has waked him by clapping him on the shoulder  pietro is already married yet he behaves as if he were not he has been carrying on with a loose woman the wife of the citroncoloured barber the siciliano then he seats himself on the womens side of the theatre behind a young person from bogliaco who also has no reputation and makes her talk to him he leans forward resting his arms on the seat before him stretching his slender catlike flexible loins the padrona of the hotel hates himein frecher kerl she says with contempt and she looks away her eyes hate to see him  in the village there is the clerical party which is the majority there is the anticlerical party and there are the neerdowells the clerical people are dark and pious and cold there is a curious stonecold ponderous darkness over them moral and gloomy then the anticlerical party with the syndaco at the head is bourgeois and respectable as far as the middleaged people are concerned banal respectable shut off as by a wall from the clerical people the young anticlericals are the young bloods of the place the men who gather every night in the more expensive and lessrespectable cafe these young men are all freethinkers great dancers singers players of the guitar they are immoral and slightly cynical their leader is the young shopkeeper who has lived in vienna who is a bit of a bounder with a veneer of sneering irony on an original good nature he is welltodo and gives dances to which only the looser women go with these reckless young men he also gets up parties of pleasure and is chiefly responsible for the coming of the players to the theatre this carnival these young men are disliked but they belong to the important class they are welltodo and they have the life of the village in their hands the clerical peasants are priestridden and good because they are poor and afraid and superstitious there is lastly a sprinkling of loose women one who keeps the inn where the soldiers drink these women are a definite set they know what they are they pretend nothing else they are not prostitutes but just loose women they keep to their own clique among men and women never wanting to compromise anybody else  and beyond all these there are the franciscan friars in their brown robes so shy so silent so obliterated as they stand back in the shop waiting to buy the bread for the monastery waiting obscure and neutral till no one shall be in the shop wanting to be served the village women speak to them in a curious neutral official slightly contemptuous voice they answer neutral and humble though distinctly  at the theatre now the play is over the peasants in their black hats and cloaks crowd the hall only pietro the wharflounger has no cloak and a bit of a cap on the side of his head instead of a black felt hat his clothes are thin and loose on his thin vigorous catlike body and he is cold but he takes no notice his hands are always in his pockets his shoulders slightly raised  the few women slip away home in the little theatre bar the welltodo young atheists are having another drink not that they spend much a tumbler of wine or a glass of vermouth costs a penny and the wine is horrible new stuff yet the little baker agostino sits on a bench with his pale baby on his knee putting the wine to its lips and the baby drinks like a blind fledgeling  upstairs the quality has paid its visits and shaken hands the syndaco and the welltodo halfaustrian owners of the woodyard the bertolini have ostentatiously shown their mutual friendship our padrone the signer pietro di paoli has visited his relatives the graziani in the box next the stage and has spent two intervals with us in our box meanwhile his two peasants standing down below pathetic thin contadini of the old school like worn stones have looked up at us as if we are the angels in heaven with a reverential devotional eye they themselves far away below standing in the bay at the back below all  the chemist and the grocer and the schoolmistress pay calls they have all sat selfconsciously posed in the front of their boxes like framed photographs of themselves the second grocer and the baker visit each other the barber looks in on the carpenter then drops downstairs among the crowd class distinctions are cut very fine as we pass with the padrona of the hotel who is a bavarian we stop to speak to our own padroni the di paoli they have a warm handshake and effusive polite conversation for us for maria samuelli a distant bow we realize our mistake  the barbernot the siciliano but flashy little luigi with the big tiering and the curlsknows all about the theatre he says that enrico persevalli has for his mistress carina the servant in ghosts that the thin gentle oldlooking king in hamlet is the husband of adelaida and carina is their daughter that the old sharp fat little body of a queen is adelaidas mother that they all like enrico persevalli because he is a very clever man but that the comic il brillante francesco is unsatisfied  in three performances in epiphany week the company took two hundred and sixtyfive francs which was phenomenal the manager enrico persevalli and adelaida pay twentyfour francs for every performance or every evening on which a performance is given as rent for the theatre including light the company is completely satisfied with its reception on the lago di garda  so it is all over the bersaglieri go running all the way home because it is already past half past ten the night is very dark about four miles up the lake the searchlights of the austrian border are swinging looking for smugglers otherwise the darkness is complete    4  san gaudenzio   in the autumn the little rosy cyclamens blossom in the shade of this west side of the lake they are very cold and fragrant and their scent seems to belong to greece to the bacchae they are real flowers of the past they seem to be blossoming in the landscape of phaedra and helen they bend down they brood like little chill fires they are little living myths that i cannot understand  after the cyclamens the christmas roses are in bud it is at this season that the cacchi are ripe on the trees in the garden whole naked trees full of lustrous orangeyellow paradisal fruit gleaming against the wintry blue sky the monthly roses still blossom frail and pink there are still crimson and yellow roses but the vines are bare and the lemonhouses shut and then midwinter the lowest buds of the christmas roses appear under the hedges and rocks and by the streams they are very lovely these first large cold pure buds like violets like magnolias but cold lit up with the light from the snow  the days go by through the brief silence of winter when the sunshine is so still and pure like iced wine and the dead leaves gleam brown and water sounds hoarse in the ravines it is so still and transcendent the cypress trees poise like flames of forgotten darkness that should have been blown out at the end of the summer for as we have candles to light the darkness of night so the cypresses are candles to keep the darkness aflame in the full sunshine  meanwhile the christmas roses become many they rise from their budded intact humbleness near the ground they rise up they throw up their crystal they become handsome they are heaps of confident mysterious whiteness in the shadow of a rocky stream it is almost uncanny to see them they are the flowers of darkness white and wonderful beyond belief  then their radiance becomes soiled and brown they thaw break and scatter and vanish away already the primroses are coming out and the almond is in bud the winter is passing away on the mountains the fierce snow gleams apricot gold as evening approaches golden apricot but so bright that it is almost frightening what can be so fiercely gleaming when all is shadowy it is something inhuman and unmitigated between heaven and earth  the heavens are strange and proud all the winter their progress goes on without reference to the dim earth the dawns come white and translucent the lake is a moonstone in the dark hills then across the lake there stretches a vein of fire then a whole orange flashing track over the whiteness there is the exquisite silent passage of the day and then at evening the afterglow a huge incandescence of rose hanging above and gleaming as if it were the presence of a host of angels in rapture it gleams like a rapturous chorus then passes away and the stars appear large and flashing  meanwhile the primroses are dawning on the ground their light is growing stronger spreading over the banks and under the bushes between the olive roots the violets are out large white grave violets and less serious blue ones and looking down the bill among the grey smoke of olive leaves pink puffs of smoke are rising up it is the almond and the apricot trees it is the spring  soon the primroses are strong on the ground there is a bank of small frail crocuses shooting the lavender into this spring and then the tussocks and tussocks of primroses are fully out there is full morning everywhere on the banks and roadsides and streamsides and around the olive roots a morning of primroses underfoot with an invisible threading of many violets and then the lovely blue clusters of hepatica really like pieces of blue sky showing through a clarity of primrose the few birds are piping thinly and shyly the streams sing again there is a strange flowering shrub full of incense overturned flowers of crimson and gold like bohemian glass between the olive roots new grass is coming day is leaping all clear and coloured from the earth it is full spring full first rapture  does it pass away or does it only lose its pristine quality it deepens and intensifies like experience the days seem to be darker and richer there is a sense of power in the strong air on the banks by the lake the orchids are out many many pale beeorchids standing clear from the short grass over the lake and in the hollows are the grape hyacinths purple as noon with the heavy sensual fragrance of noon they are manybreasted and full of milk and ripe and sundarkened like manybreasted diana  we could not bear to live down in the village any more now that the days opened large and spacious and the evenings drew out in sunshine we could not bear the indoors when above us the mountains shone in clear air it was time to go up to climb with the sun  so after easter we went to san gaudenzio it was three miles away up the winding muletrack that climbed higher and higher along the lake leaving the last house of the village the path wound on the steep clifflike side of the lake curving into the hollow where the landslip had tumbled the rocks in chaos then out again on to the bluff of a headland that hung over the lake  thus we came to the tall barred gate of san gaudenzio on which was the usual little fireinsurance tablet and then the advertisements for beer birra verona which is becoming a more and more popular drink  through the gate inside the high wall is the little garden of eden a property of three or four acres fairly level upon a headland over the lake the high wall girds it on the land side and makes it perfectly secluded on the lakeside it is bounded by the sudden drops of the land in sharp banks and terraces overgrown with ilex and with laurel bushes down to the brink of the cliff so that the thicket of the first declivities seems to safeguard the property  the pink farmhouse stands almost in the centre of the little territory among the olive trees it is a solid sixroomed place about fifty years old having been rebuilt by paolos uncle here we came to live for a time with the fiori maria and paolo and their three children giovanni and marco and felicina  paolo had inherited or partly inherited san gaudenzio which had been in his family for generations he was a peasant of fiftythree very grey and wrinkled and wornlooking but at the same time robust with full strong limbs and a powerful chest his face was old but his body was solid and powerful his eyes were blue like upper ice beautiful he had been a fairhaired man now he was almost white  he was strangely like the pictures of peasants in the northern italian pictures with the same curious nobility the same aristocratic eternal look of motionlessness something statuesque his head was hard and fine the bone finely constructed though the skin of his face was loose and furrowed with work his temples had that fine hard clarity which is seen in mantegna an almost jewellike quality  we all loved paolo he was so finished in his being detached with an almost classic simplicity and gentleness an eternal kind of sureness there was also something concluded and unalterable about him something inaccessible  maria fiori was different she was from the plain like enrico persevalli and the bersaglier from the venetian district she reminded me again of oxen broadboned and massive in physique darkskinned slow in her soul but like the oxen of the plain she knew her work she knew the other people engaged in the work her intelligence was attentive and purposive she had been a housekeeper a servant in venice and verona before her marriage she had got the hang of this world of commerce and activity she wanted to master it but she was weighted down by her heavy animal blood  paolo and she were the opposite sides of the universe the light and the dark yet they lived together now without friction detached each subordinated in their common relationship with regard to maria paolo omitted himself maria omitted herself with regard to paolo their souls were silent and detached completely apart and silent quite silent they shared the physical relationship of marriage as if it were something beyond them a third thing  they had suffered very much in the earlier stages of their connexion now the storm had gone by leaving them as it were spent they were both by nature passionate vehement but the lines of their passion were opposite hers was the primitive crude violent flux of the blood emotional and undiscriminating but wanting to mix and mingle his was the hard clear invulnerable passion of the bones finely tempered and unchangeable she was the flint and he the steel but in continual striking together they only destroyed each other the fire was a third thing belonging to neither of them  she was still heavy and full of desire she was much younger than he  how long did you know your signora before you were married she asked me  six weeks i said  il paolo e me venti giorni tre settimane she cried vehemently three weeks they had known each other when they married she still triumphed in the fact so did paolo but it was past strangely and rather terribly past  what did they want when they came together paolo and she he was a man over thirty she was a woman of twentythree they were both violent in desire and of strong will they came together at once like two wrestlers almost matched in strength their meetings must have been splendid giovanni the eldest child was a tall lad of sixteen with soft brown hair and grey eyes and a clarity of brow and the same calm simplicity of bearing which made paolo so complete but the son had at the same time a certain brownness of skin a heaviness of blood which he had from his mother paolo was so clear and translucent  in giovanni the fusion of the parents was perfect he was a perfect spark from the flint and steel there was in paolo a subtle intelligence in feeling a delicate appreciation of the other person but the mind was unintelligent he could not grasp a new order maria fiori was much sharper and more adaptable to the ways of the world paolo had an almost glasslike quality fine and clear and perfectly tempered but he was also finished and brittle maria was much coarser more vulgar but also she was more human more fertile with crude potentiality his passion was too fixed in its motion hers too loose and overwhelming  but giovanni was beautiful gentle and courtly like paolo but warm like maria ready to flush like a girl with anger or confusion he stood straight and tall and seemed to look into the far distance with his clear grey eyes yet also he could look at one and touch one with his look he could meet one paolos blue eyes were like the eyes of the old spinningwoman clear and blue and belonging to the mountains their vision seemed to end in space abstract they reminded me of the eyes of the eagle which looks into the sun and which teaches its young to do the same although they are unwilling  marco the second son was thirteen years old he was his mothers favourite giovanni loved his father best but marco was his mothers son with the same browngold and red complexion like a pomegranate and coarse black hair and brown eyes like pebble like agate like an animals eyes he had the same broad bovine figure though he was only a boy but there was some discrepancy in him he was not unified he had no identity  he was strong and full of animal life but always aimless as though his wits scarcely controlled him but he loved his mother with a fundamental generous undistinguishing love only he always forgot what he was going to do he was much more sensitive than maria more shy and reluctant but his shyness his sensitiveness only made him more aimless and awkward a tiresome clown slack and uncontrolled witless all day long his mother shouted and shrilled and scolded at him or hit him angrily he did not mind he came up like a cork warm and roguish and curiously appealing she loved him with a fierce protective love grounded on pain there was such a split a contrariety in his soul one part reacting against the other which landed him always into trouble  it was when marco was a baby that paolo had gone to america they were poor on san gaudenzio there were the few olive trees the grapes and the fruit there was the one cow but these scarcely made a living neither was maria content with the real peasants lot any more polenta at midday and vegetable soup in the evening and no way out nothing to look forward to no future only this eternal present she had been in service and had eaten bread and drunk coffee and known the flux and variable chance of life she had departed from the old static conception she knew what one might be given a certain chance the fixture was the thing she militated against so paolo went to america to california into the gold mines  maria wanted the future the endless possibility of life on earth she wanted her sons to be freer to achieve a new plane of living the peasants life was a slaves life she said railing against the poverty and the drudgery and it was quite true paolo and giovanni worked twelve and fourteen hours a day at heavy laborious work that would have broken an englishman and there was nothing at the end of it yet paolo was even happy so this was the truth to him  it was the mother who wanted things different it was she who railed and railed against the miserable life of the peasants when we were going to throw to the fowls a dry broken penny roll of white bread maria said with anger and shame and resentment in her voice give it to marco he will eat it it isnt too dry for him  white bread was a treat for them even now when everybody eats bread and maria fiori hated it that bread should be a treat to her children when it was the meanest food of all the rest of the world she was in opposition to this order she did not want her sons to be peasants fixed and static as posts driven in the earth she wanted them to be in the great flux of life in the midst of all possibilities so she at length sent paolo to america to the goldmines meanwhile she covered the wall of her parlour with picture postcards to bring the outer world of cities and industries into her house  paolo was entirely remote from marias world he had not yet even grasped the fact of money not thoroughly he reckoned in land and olive trees so he had the old fatalistic attitude to his circumstances even to his food the earth was the lords and the fulness thereof also the leanness thereof paolo could only do his part and leave the rest if he ate in plenty having oil and wine and sausage in the house and plenty of maizemeal he was glad with the lord if he ate meagrely of poor polenta that was fate it was the skies that ruled these things and no man ruled the skies he took his fate as it fell from the skies  maria was exorbitant about money she would charge us all she could for what we had and for what was done for us  yet she was not mean in her soul in her soul she was in a state of anger because of her own closeness it was a violation to her strong animal nature yet her mind had wakened to the value of money she knew she could alter her position the position of her children by virtue of money she knew it was only money that made the difference between master and servant and this was all the difference she would acknowledge so she ruled her life according to money her supreme passion was to be mistress rather than servant her supreme aspiration for her children was that in the end they might be masters and not servants  paolo was untouched by all this for him there was some divinity about a master which even america had not destroyed if we came in for supper whilst the family was still at table he would have the children at once take their plates to the wall he would have maria at once set the table for us though their own meal were never finished and this was not servility it was the dignity of a religious conception paolo regarded us as belonging to the signoria those who are elect near to god and this was part of his religious service his life was a ritual it was very beautiful but it made me unhappy the purity of his spirit was so sacred and the actual facts seemed such a sacrilege to it maria was nearer to the actual truth when she said that money was the only distinction but paolo had hold of an eternal truth where hers was temporal only paolo misapplied this eternal truth he should not have given giovanni the inferior status and a fat mean italian tradesman the superior that was false a real falsity maria knew it and hated it but paolo could not distinguish between the accident of riches and the aristocracy of the spirit so maria rejected him altogether and went to the other extreme we were all human beings like herself naked there was no distinction between us no higher nor lower but we were possessed of more money than she and she had to steer her course between these two conceptions the money alone made the real distinction the separation the being the life made the common level  paolo had the curious peasants avarice also but it was not meanness it was a sort of religious conservation of his own power his own self fortunately he could leave all business transactions on our account to maria so that his relation with us was purely ritualistic he would have given me anything trusting implicitly that i would fulfil my own nature as signore one of those more godlike nearer the light of perfection than himself a peasant it was pure bliss to him to bring us the firstfruit of the garden it was like laying it on an altar  and his fulfilment was in a fine subtle exquisite relationship not of manners but subtle interappreciation he worshipped a finer understanding and a subtler tact a further fineness and dignity and freedom in bearing was to him an approach towards the divine so he loved men best of all they fulfilled his soul a woman was always a woman and sex was a low level whereon he did not esteem himself but a man a doer the instrument of god he was really godlike  paolo was a conservative for him the world was established and divine in its establishment his vision grasped a small circle a finer nature a higher understanding took in a greater circle comprehended the whole so that when paolo was in relation to a man of further vision he himself was extended towards the whole thus he was fulfilled and his initial assumption was that every signore every gentleman was a man of further purer vision than himself this assumption was false but marias assumption that no one had a further vision no one was more elect than herself that we are all one flesh and blood and being was even more false paolo was mistaken in actual life but maria was ultimately mistaken  paolo conservative as he was believing that a priest must be a priest of god yet very rarely went to church and he used the religious oaths that maria hated even porcamaria he always used oaths either bacchus or god or mary or the sacrament maria was always offended yet it was she who in her soul jeered at the church and at religion she wanted the human society as the absolute without religious abstractions so paolos oaths enraged her because of their profanity she said but it was really because of their subscribing to another superhuman order she jeered at the clerical people she made a loud clamour of derision when the parish priest of the village above went down to the big village on the lake and across the piazza the quay with two pigs in a sack on his shoulder this was a real picture of the sacred minister to her  one day when a storm had blown down an olive tree in front of the house and paolo and giovanni were beginning to cut it up this same priest of mugiano came to san gaudenzio he was an irongrey thin disreputablelooking priest very talkative and loud and queer he seemed like an old neerdowell in priests black and he talked loudly almost to himself as drunken people do at once he must show the fiori how to cut up the tree he must have the axe from paolo he shouted to maria for a glass of wine she brought it out to him with a sort of insolent deference insolent contempt of the man and traditional deference to the cloth the priest drained the tumblerful of wine at one drink his thin throat with its adams apple working and he did not pay the penny  then he stripped off his cassock and put away his hat and a ludicrous figure in illfitting black kneebreeches and a not very clean shirt a red handkerchief round his neck he proceeded to give great extravagant blows at the tree he was like a caricature in the doorway maria was encouraging him rather jeeringly whilst she winked at me marco was stifling his hysterical amusement in his mothers apron and prancing with glee paolo and giovanni stood by the fallen tree very grave and unmoved inscrutable abstract then the youth came away to the doorway with a flush mounting on his face and a grimace distorting its youngness only paolo unmoved and detached stood by the tree with unchanging abstract face very strange his eyes fixed in the ageless stare which is so characteristic  meanwhile the priest swung drunken blows at the tree his thin buttocks bending in the greenblack broadcloth supported on thin shanks and thin throat growing dull purple in the redknotted kerchief nevertheless he was doing the job his face was wet with sweat he wanted another glass of wine  he took no notice of us he was strangely a local even a mountebank figure but entirely local an appurtenance of the district  it was maria who jeeringly told us the story of the priest who shrugged her shoulders to imply that he was a contemptible figure paolo sat with the abstract look on his face as of one who hears and does not hear is not really concerned he never opposed or contradicted her but stayed apart it was she who was violent and brutal in her ways but sometimes paolo went into a rage and then maria everybody was afraid it was a white heavy rage when his blue eyes shone unearthly and his mouth opened with a curious drawn blindness of the old furies there was something of the cruelty of a falling mass of snow heavy horrible maria drew away there was a silence then the avalanche was finished  they must have had some cruel fights before they learned to withdraw from each other so completely they must have begotten marco in hatred terrible disintegrated opposition and otherness and it was after this after the child of their opposition was born that paolo went away to california leaving his san gaudenzio travelling with several companions like blind beasts to havre and thence to new york then to california he stayed five years in the goldmines in a wild valley living with a gang of italians in a town of corrugated iron  all the while he had never really left san gaudenzio i asked him used you to think of it the lake the monte baldo the laurel trees down the slope he tried to see what i wanted to know yes he saidbut uncertainly i could see that he had never been really homesick it had been very wretched on the ship going from havre to new york that he told me about and he told me about the goldmines the galleries the valley the huts in the valley but he had never really fretted for san gaudenzio whilst he was in california  in real truth he was at san gaudenzio all the time his fate was riveted there his going away was an excursion from reality a kind of sleepwalking he left his own reality there in the soil above the lake of garda that his body was in california what did it matter it was merely for a time and for the sake of his own earth his land he would pay off the mortgage but the gate at home was his gate all the time his hand was on the latch  as for maria he had felt his duty towards her she was part of his little territory the rooted centre of the world he sent her home the money but it did not occur to him in his soul to miss her he wanted her to be safe with the children that was all in his flesh perhaps he missed the woman but his spirit was even more completely isolated since marriage instead of having united with each other they had made each other more terribly distinct and separate he could live alone eternally it was his condition his sex was functional like eating and drinking to take a woman a prostitute at the camp or not to take her was no more vitally important than to get drunk or not to get drunk of a sunday and fairly often on sunday paolo got drunk his world remained unaltered  but maria suffered more bitterly she was a young powerful passionate woman and she was unsatisfied body and soul her souls satisfaction became a bodily unsatisfaction her blood was heavy violent anarchic insisting on the equality of the blood in all and therefore on her own absolute right to satisfaction  she took a wine licence for san gaudenzio and she sold wine there were many scandals about her somehow it did not matter very much outwardly the authorities were too divided among themselves to enforce public opinion between the clerical party and the radicals and the socialists what canons were left that were absolute besides these wild villages had always been ungoverned  yet maria suffered even she according to her conviction belonged to paolo and she felt betrayed betrayed and deserted the iron had gone deep into her soul paolo had deserted her she had been betrayed to other men for five years there was something cruel and implacable in life she sat sullen and heavy for all her quick activity her soul was sullen and heavy  i could never believe felicina was paolos child she was an unprepossessing little girl affected cold selfish foolish maria and paolo with real italian greatness were warm and natural towards the child in her but they did not love her in their very souls she was the fruit of ash to them and this must have been the reason that she was so selfconscious and foolish and affected small child that she was  paolo had come back from america a year before she was borna year before she was born maria insisted the husband and wife lived together in a relationship of complete negation in his soul he was sad for her and in her soul she felt annulled he sat at evening in the chimneyseat smoking always pleasant and cheerful not for a moment thinking he was unhappy it had all taken place in his subconsciousness but his eyebrows and eyelids were lifted in a kind of vacancy his blue eyes were round and somehow finished though he was so gentle and vigorous in body but the very quick of him was killed he was like a ghost in the house with his loose throat and powerful limbs his open blue extinct eyes and his musical slightly husky voice that seemed to sound out of the past  and maria stout and strong and handsome like a peasant woman went about as if there were a weight on her and her voice was high and strident she too was finished in her life but she remained unbroken her will was like a hammer that destroys the old form  giovanni was patiently labouring to learn a little english paolo knew only four or five words the chief of which were aright boss bread and day the youth had these by heart and was studying a little more he was very graceful and lovable but he found it difficult to learn a confused light like hot tears would come into his eyes when he had again forgotten the phrase but he carried the paper about with him and he made steady progress  he would go to america he also not for anything would he stay in san gaudenzio his dream was to be gone he would come back the world was not san gaudenzio to giovanni  the old order the order of paolo and of pietro di paoli the aristocratic order of the supreme god god the father the lord was passing away from the beautiful little territory the household no longer receives its food oil and wine and maize from out of the earth in the motion of fate the earth is annulled and money takes its place the landowner who is the lieutenant of god and of fate like abraham he too is annulled there is now the order of the rich which supersedes the order of the signoria  it is passing away from italy as it has passed from england the peasant is passing away the workman is taking his place the stability is gone paolo is a ghost maria is the living body and the new order means sorrow for the italian more even than it has meant for us but he will have the new order  san gaudenzio is already becoming a thing of the past below the house where the land drops in sharp slips to the sheer cliffs edge over which it is marias constant fear that felicina will tumble there are the deserted lemon gardens of the little territory snug down below they are invisible till one descends by tiny paths sheer down into them and there they stand the pillars and walls erect but a dead emptiness prevailing lemon trees all dead gone a few vines in their place it is only twenty years since the lemon trees finally perished of a disease and were not renewed but the deserted terrace shut between great walls descending in their openness full to the south to the lake and the mountain opposite seem more terrible than pompeii in their silence and utter seclusion the grape hyacinths flower in the cracks the lizards run this strange place hangs suspended and forgotten forgotten for ever its erect pillars utterly meaningless  i used to sit and write in the great loft of the lemonhouse high up far far from the ground the open front giving across the lake and the mountain snow opposite flush with twilight the old matting and boards the old disused implements of lemon culture made shadows in the deserted place then there would come the call from the back away above venga venga mangiare  we ate in the kitchen where the olive and laurel wood burned in the open fireplace it was always soup in the evening then we played games or cards all playing or there was singing with the accordion and sometimes a rough mountain peasant with a guitar  but it is all passing away giovanni is in america unless he has come back to the war he will not want to live in san gaudenzio when he is a man he says he and marco will not spend their lives wringing a little oil and wine out of the rocky soil even if they are not killed in the fighting which is going on at the end of the lake in my loft by the lemonhouses now i should hear the guns and giovanni kissed me with a kind of supplication when i went on to the steamer as if he were beseeching for a soul his eyes were bright and clear and lit up with courage he will make a good fight for the new soul he wantsthat is if they do not kill him in this war    5  the dance   maria had no real licence for san gaudenzio yet the peasants always called for wine it is easy to arrange in italy the penny is paid another time  the wild old road that skirts the lakeside scrambling always higher as the precipice becomes steeper climbing and winding to the villages perched high up passes under the high boundarywall of san gaudenzio between that and the ruined church but the road went just as much between the vines and past the house as outside under the wall for the high gates were always open and men or women and mules come into the property to call at the door of the homestead there was a loud shout ahaaahmaria oooh pao from outside another wild inarticulate cry from within and one of the fiori appeared in the doorway to hail the newcomer  it was usually a man sometimes a peasant from mugiano high up sometimes a peasant from the wilds of the mountain a woodcutter or a charcoalburner he came in and sat in the houseplace his glass of wine in his hand between his knees or on the floor between his feet and he talked in a few wild phrases very shy like a hawk indoors and unintelligible in his dialect  sometimes we had a dance then for the wine to drink three men came with mandolines and guitars and sat in a corner playing their rapid tunes while all danced on the dusty brick floor of the little parlour no strange women were invited only men the young bloods from the big village on the lake the wild men from above they danced the slow trailing lilting polkawaltz round and round the small room the guitars and mandolines twanging rapidly the dust rising from the soft bricks there were only the two english women so men danced with men as the italians love to do they love even better to dance with men with a dear bloodfriend than with women  its better like this two men giovanni says to me his blue eyes hot his face curiously tender  the woodcutters and peasants take off their coats their throats are bare they dance with strange intentness particularly if they have for partner an english signora their feet in thick boots are curiously swift and significant and it is strange to see the englishwomen as they dance with the peasants transfigured with a kind of brilliant surprise all the while the peasants are very courteous but quiet they see the women dilate and flash they think they have found a footing they are certain so the male dancers are quiet but even grandiloquent their feet nimble their bodies wild and confident  they are at a loss when the two english signoras move together and laugh excitedly at the end of the dance  isnt it fine  fine their arms are like iron carrying you round  yes yes and the muscles on their shoulders i never knew there were such muscles im almost frightened  but its fine isnt it im getting into the dance  yesyesyouve only to let them take you  then the glasses are put down the guitars give their strange vibrant almost painful summons and the dance begins again  it is a strange dance strange and lilting and changing as the music changed but it had always a kind of leisurely dignity a trailing kind of polkawaltz intimate passionate yet never hurried never violent in its passion always becoming more intense the womens faces changed to a kind of transported wonder they were in the very rhythm of delight from the soft bricks of the floor the red ochre rose in a thin cloud of dust making hazy the shadowy dancers the three musicians in their black hats and their cloaks sat obscurely in the corner making a music that came quicker and quicker making a dance that grew swifter and more intense more subtle the men seeming to fly and to implicate other strange interrhythmic dance into the women the women drifting and palpitating as if their souls shook and resounded to a breeze that was subtly rushing upon them through them the men worked their feet their thighs swifter more vividly the music came to an almost intolerable climax there was a moment when the dance passed into a possession the men caught up the women and swung them from the earth leapt with them for a second and then the next phase of the dance had begun slower again more subtly interwoven taking perfect oh exquisite delight in every interrelated movement a rhythm within a rhythm a subtle approaching and drawing nearer to a climax nearer till oh there was the surpassing lift and swing of the women when the womans body seemed like a boat lifted over the powerful exquisite wave of the mans body perfect for a moment and then once more the slow intense nearer movement of the dance began always nearer nearer always to a more perfect climax  and the women waited as if in transport for the climax when they would be flung into a movement surpassing all movement they were flung borne away lifted like a boat on a supreme wave into the zenith and nave of the heavens consummate  then suddenly the dance crashed to an end and the dancers stood stranded lost bewildered on a strange shore the air was full of red dust halflit by the lamp on the wall the players in the corner were putting down their instruments to take up their glasses  and the dancers sat round the wall crowding in the little room faint with the transport of repeated ecstasy there was a subtle smile on the face of the men subtle knowing so finely sensual that the conscious eyes could scarcely look at it and the women were dazed like creatures dazzled by too much light the light was still on their faces like a blindness a reeling like a transfiguration the men were bringing wine on a little tin tray leaning with their proud vivid loins their faces flickering with the same subtle smile meanwhile maria fiori was splashing water much water on the red floor there was the smell of water among the glowing transfigured men and women who sat gleaming in another world round the walls  the peasants have chosen their women for the dark handsome englishwoman who looks like a slightly malignant madonna comes il duro for the bella bionda the woodcutter but the peasants have always to take their turn after the young welltodo men from the village below  nevertheless they are confident they cannot understand the middleclass diffidence of the young men who wear collars and ties and fingerrings  the woodcutter from the mountain is of medium height dark thin and hard as a hatchet with eyes that are black like the very flaming thrust of night he is quite a savage there is something strange about his dancing the violent way he works one shoulder he has a wooden leg from the kneejoint yet he dances well and is inordinately proud he is fierce as a bird and hard with energy as a thunderbolt he will dance with the blonde signora but he never speaks he is like some violent natural phenomenon rather than a person the woman begins to wilt a little in his possession  √à belloil ballo he asked at length one direct flashing question  simolto bello cries the woman glad to have speech again  the eyes of the woodcutter flash like actual possession he seems now to have come into his own with all his senses he is dominant sure  he is inconceivably vigorous in body and his dancing is almost perfect with a little catch in it owing to his lameness which brings almost a pure intoxication every muscle in his body is supple as steel supple as strong as thunder and yet so quick so delicately swift it is almost unbearable as he draws near to the swing the climax the ecstasy he seems to lie in wait there is a sense of a great strength crouching ready then it rushes forth liquid perfect transcendent the woman swoons over in the dance and it goes on enjoyment infinite incalculable enjoyment he is like a god a strange natural phenomenon most intimate and compelling wonderful  but he is not a human being the woman somewhere shocked in her independent soul begins to fall away from him she has another being which he has not touched and which she will fall back upon the dance is over she will fall back on herself it is perfect too perfect  during the next dance while she is in the power of the educated ettore a perfect and calculated voluptuary who knows how much he can get out of this northern woman and only how much the woodcutter stands on the edge of the darkness in the open doorway and watches he is fixed upon her established perfect and all the while she is aware of the insistent hawklike poising of the face of the woodcutter poised on the edge of the darkness in the doorway in possession unrelinquishing  and she is angry there is something stupid absurd in the hard talonlike eyes watching so fiercely and so confidently in the doorway sure unmitigated has the creature no sense  the woman reacts from him for some time she will take no notice of him but he waits fixed then she comes near to him and his will seems to take hold of her he looks at her with a strange proud inhuman confidence as if his influence with her was already accomplished  vengavenga un po he says jerking his head strangely to the darkness  what she replies and passes shaken and dilated and brilliant consciously ignoring him passes away among the others among those who are safe  there is food in the kitchen great hunks of bread sliced sausage that maria has made wine and a little coffee but only the quality come to eat the peasants may not come in there is eating and drinking in the little house the guitars are silent it is eleven oclock  then there is singing the strange bestial singing of these hills sometimes the guitars can play an accompaniment but usually not then the men lift up their heads and send out the high halfhowling music astounding the words are in dialect they argue among themselves for a moment will the signoria understand they sing the signoria does not understand in the least so with a strange slightly malignant triumph the men sing all the verses of their song sitting round the walls of the little parlour their throats move their faces have a slight mocking smile the boy capers in the doorway like a faun with glee his straight black hair falling over his forehead the elder brother sits straight and flushed but even his eyes glitter with a kind of yellow light of laughter paolo also sits quiet with the invisible smile on his face only maria large and active prospering now keeps collected ready to order a shrill silence in the same way as she orders the peasants violently to keep their places  the boy comes to me and says  do you know signore what they are singing  no i say  so he capers with furious glee the men with the watchful eyes all roused sit round the wall and sing more distinctly      si verr√† la primavera     fiorann le mandoline     vienn di basso le trentine     coi taliani far lamor  but the next verses are so improper that i pretend not to understand the women with wakened dilated faces are listening listening hard their two faces beautiful in their attention as if listening to something magical a long way off and the men sitting round the wall sing more plainly coming nearer to the correct italian the song comes loud and vibrating and maliciously from their reedy throats it penetrates everybody the foreign women can understand the sound they can feel the malicious suggestive mockery but they cannot catch the words the smile becomes more dangerous on the faces of the men  then maria fiori sees that i have understood and she cries in her loud overriding voice  bastabasta  the men get up straighten their bodies with a curious offering movement the guitars and mandolines strike the vibrating strings but the vague northern reserve has come over the englishwomen they dance again but without the fusion in the dance they have had enough  the musicians are thanked they rise and go into the night the men pass off in pairs but the woodcutter whose name and whose nickname i could never hear still hovered on the edge of the darkness  then maria sent him also away complaining that he was too wild proprio selvatico and only the quality remained the welltodo youths from below there was a little more coffee and a talking a story of a man who had fallen over a declivity in a lonely part going home drunk in the evening and had lain unfound for eighteen hours then a story of a donkey who had kicked a youth in the chest and killed him  but the women were tired they would go to bed still the two young men would not go away we all went out to look at the night  the stars were very bright overhead the mountain opposite and the mountains behind us faintly outlined themselves on the sky below the lake was a black gulf a little wind blew cold from the adige  in the morning the visitors had gone they had insisted on staying the night they had eaten eight eggs each and much bread at one oclock in the morning then they had gone to sleep lying on the floor in the sittingroom  in the early sunshine they had drunk coffee and gone down to the village on the lake maria was very pleased she would have made a good deal of money the young men were rich her cupidity seemed like her very blossom    6  il duro   the first time i saw il duro was on a sunny day when there came up a party of pleasuremakers to san gaudenzio they were three women and three men the women were in cotton frocks one a large dark florid woman in pink the other two rather insignificant the men i scarcely noticed at first except that two were young and one elderly  they were a queer party even on a feast day coming up purely for pleasure in the morning strange and slightly uncertain advancing between the vines they greeted maria and paolo in loud coarse voices there was something blowsy and uncertain and hesitating about the women in particular which made one at once notice them  then a picnic was arranged for them out of doors on the grass they sat just in front of the house under the olive tree beyond the well it should have been pretty the women in their cotton frocks and their friends sitting with wine and food in the spring sunshine but somehow it was not it was hard and slightly ugly  but since they were picnicking out of doors we must do so too we were at once envious but maria was a little unwilling and then she set a table for us  the strange party did not speak to us they seemed slightly uneasy and angry at our presence i asked maria who they were she lifted her shoulders and after a seconds cold pause said they were people from down below and then in her rather strident shrill slightly bitter slightly derogatory voice she added  they are not people for you signore you dont know them  she spoke slightly angrily and contemptuously of them rather protectively of me so that vaguely i gathered that they were not quite respectable  only one man came into the house he was very handsome beautiful rather a man of thirtytwo orthree with a clear golden skin and perfectly turned face something godlike but the expression was strange his hair was jet black and fine and smooth glossy as a birds wing his brows were beautifully drawn calm above his grey eyes that had long dark lashes  his eyes however had a sinister light in them a pale slightly repelling gleam very much like a gods palegleaming eyes with the same vivid pallor and all his face had the slightly malignant suffering look of a satyr yet he was very beautiful  he walked quickly and surely with his head rather down passing from his desire to his object absorbed yet curiously indifferent as if the transit were in a strange world as if none of what he was doing were worth the while yet he did it for his own pleasure and the light on his face a pale strange gleam through his clear skin remained like a translucent smile unchanging as time  he seemed familiar with the household he came and fetched wine at his will maria was angry with him she railed loudly and violently he was unchanged he went out with the wine to the party on the grass maria regarded them all with some hostility  they drank a good deal out there in the sunshine the women and the older man talked floridly il duro crouched at the feast in his curious fashionhe had strangely flexible loins upon which he seemed to crouch forward but he was separate like an animal that remains quite single no matter where it is  the party remained until about two oclock then slightly flushed it moved on in a ragged group up to the village beyond i do not know if they went to one of the inns of the stony village or to the large strange house which belonged to the rich young grocer of the village below a house kept only for feasts and riots uninhabited for the most part maria would tell me nothing about them only the young welltodo grocer who had lived in vienna the bertolotti came later in the afternoon inquiring for the party  and towards sunset i saw the elderly man of the group stumbling home very drunk down the path after the two women who had gone on in front then paolo sent giovanni to see the drunken one safely past the landslip which was dangerous altogether it was an unsatisfactory business very much like any other such party in any other country  then in the evening il duro came in his name is faustino but everybody in the village has a nickname which is almost invariably used he came in and asked for supper we had all eaten so he ate a little food alone at the table whilst we sat round the fire  afterwards we played up jenkins that was the one game we played with the peasants except that exciting one of theirs which consists in shouting in rapid succession your guesses at the number of fingers rapidly spread out and shut into the hands again upon the table  il duro joined in the game and that was because he had been in america and now was rich he felt he could come near to the strange signori but he was always inscrutable  it was queer to look at the hands spread on the table the englishwomen having rings on their soft fingers the large fresh hands of the elder boy the brown paws of the younger paolos distorted great hard hands of a peasant and the big dark brown animal shapely hands of faustino  he had been in america first for two years and then for five yearsseven years altogetherbut he only spoke a very little english he was always with italians he had served chiefly in a flag factory and had had very little to do save to push a trolley with flags from the dyeingroom to the dryingroom i believe it was this  then he had come home from america with a fair amount of money he had taken his uncles garden had inherited his uncles little house and he lived quite alone  he was rich maria said shouting in her strident voice he at once disclaimed it peasantwise but before the signori he was glad also to appear rich he was mean that was more maria cried halfteasing half getting at him  he attended to his garden grew vegetables all the year round lived in his little house and in spring made good money as a vinegrafter he was an expert vinegrafter  after the boys had gone to bed he sat and talked to me he was curiously attractive and curiously beautiful but somehow like stone in his clear colouring and his clearcut face his temples with the black hair were distinct and fine as a work of art  but always his eyes had this strange halfdiabolic halftortured pale gleam like a goats and his mouth was shut almost uglily his cheeks stern his moustache was brown his teeth strong and spaced the women said it was a pity his moustache was brown  peccatosa per bellezza i baffi neriahh  then a longdrawn exclamation of voluptuous appreciation  you live quite alone i said to him  he did and even when he had been ill he was alone he had been ill two years before his cheeks seemed to harden like marble and to become pale at the thought he was afraid like marble with fear  but why i said why do you live alone you are sad√® triste  he looked at me with his queer pale eyes i felt a great static misery in him something very strange  triste he repeated stiffening up hostile i could not understand  vuol dire che hai laria dolorosa cried maria like a chorus interpreting and there was always a sort of loud ring of challenge somewhere in her voice  sad i said in english  sad i he repeated also in english and he did not smile or change only his face seemed to become more stonelike and he only looked at me into my eyes with the long pale steady inscrutable look of a goat i can only repeat something stonelike  why i said dont you marry man doesnt live alone  i dont marry he said to me in his emphatic deliberate cold fashion because ive seen too much ho visto troppo  i dont understand i said  yet i could feel that paolo sitting silent like a monolith also in the chimney opening he understood maria also understood  il duro looked again steadily into my eyes  ho visto troppo he repeated and the words seemed engraved on stone ive seen too much  but you can marry i said however much you have seen if you have seen all the world  he watched me steadily like a strange creature looking at me  what woman he said to me  you can find a womanthere are plenty of women i said  not for me he said i have known too many ive known too much i can marry nobody  do you dislike women i said  noquite otherwise i dont think ill of them  then why cant you marry why must you live alone  why live with a woman he said to me and he looked mockingly which woman is it to be  you can find her i said there are many women  again he shook his head in the stony final fashion  not for me i have known too much  but does that prevent you from marrying  he looked at me steadily finally and i could see it was impossible for us to understand each other or for me to understand him i could not understand the strange white gleam of his eyes where it came from  also i knew he liked me very much almost loved me which again was strange and puzzling it was as if he were a fairy a faun and had no soul but he gave me a feeling of vivid sadness a sadness that gleamed like phosphorescence he himself was not sad there was a completeness about him about the pallid otherworld he inhabited which excluded sadness it was too complete too final too defined there was no yearning no vague merging off into mistiness he was clear and fine as semitransparent rock as a substance in moonlight he seemed like a crystal that has achieved its final shape and has nothing more to achieve  that night he slept on the floor of the sittingroom in the morning he was gone but a week after he came again to graft the vines  all the morning and the afternoon he was among the vines crouching before them cutting them back with his sharp bright knife amazingly swift and sure like a god it filled me with a sort of panic to see him crouched flexibly like some strange animal god doubled on his haunches before the young vines and swiftly vividly without thought cut cut cut at the young budding shoots which fell unheeded on to the earth then again he strode with his curious halfgoatlike movement across the garden to prepare the lime  he mixed the messy stuff cowdung and lime and water and earth carefully with his hands as if he understood that too he was not a worker he was a creature in intimate communion with the sensible world knowing purely by touch the limey mess he mixed amongst knowing as if by relation between that soft matter and the matter of himself  then again he strode over the earth a gleaming piece of earth himself moving to the young vines quickly with a few clean cuts of the knife he prepared the new shoot which he had picked out of a handful which lay beside him on the ground he went finely to the quick of the plant inserted the graft then bound it up fast hard  it was like god grafting the life of man upon the body of the earth intimately conjuring with his own flesh  all the while paolo stood by somehow excluded from the mystery talking to me to faustino and il duro answered easily as if his mind were disengaged it was his senses that were absorbed in the sensible life of the plant and the lime and the cowdung he handled  watching him watching his absorbed bestial and yet godlike crouching before the plant as if he were the god of lower life i somehow understood his isolation why he did not marry pan and the ministers of pan do not marry the sylvan gods they are single and isolated in their being  it is in the spirit that marriage takes place in the flesh there is connexion but only in the spirit is there a new thing created out of two different antithetic things in the body i am conjoined with the woman but in the spirit my conjunction with her creates a third thing an absolute a word which is neither me nor her nor of me nor of her but which is absolute  and faustino had none of this spirit in him sensation itself was absolutenot spiritual consummation but physical sensation so he could not marry it was not for him he belonged to the god pan to the absolute of the senses  all the while his beauty so perfect and so defined fascinated me a strange static perfection about him but his movements whilst they fascinated also repelled i can always see him crouched before the vines on his haunches his haunches doubled together in a complete animal unconsciousness his face seeming in its strange golden pallor and its hardness of line with the gleaming black of the fine hair on the brow and temples like something reflective like the reflecting surface of a stone that gleams out of the depths of night it was like darkness revealed in its steady unchanging pallor  again he stayed through the evening having quarrelled once more with the maria about money he quarrelled violently yet coldly there was something terrifying in it and as soon as the matter of dispute was settled all trace of interest or feeling vanished from him  yet he liked above all things to be near the english signori they seemed to exercise a sort of magnetic attraction over him it was something of the purely physical world as a magnetized needle swings towards soft iron he was quite helpless in the relation only by mechanical attraction he gravitated into line with us  but there was nothing between us except our complete difference it was like night and day flowing together    7  john   besides il duro we found another italian who could speak english this time quite well we had walked about four or five miles up the lake getting higher and higher then quite suddenly on the shoulder of a bluff far up we came on a village icy cold and as if forgotten  we went into the inn to drink something hot the fire of olive sticks was burning in the open chimney one or two men were talking at a table a young woman with a baby stood by the fire watching something boil in a large pot another woman was seen in the houseplace beyond  in the chimneyseats sat a young muledriver who had left his two mules at the door of the inn and opposite him an elderly stout man they got down and offered us the seats of honour which we accepted with due courtesy  the chimneys are like the wide open chimneyplaces of old english cottages but the hearth is raised about a foot and a half or two feet from the floor so that the fire is almost level with the hands and those who sit in the chimneyseats are raised above the audience in the room something like two gods flanking the fire looking out of the cave of ruddy darkness into the open lower world of the room  we asked for coffee with milk and rum the stout landlord took a seat near us below the comely young woman with the baby took the tin coffeepot that stood among the grey ashes put in fresh coffee among the old bottoms filled it with water then pushed it more into the fire  the landlord turned to us with the usual na√Øve curious deference and the usual question  you are germans  english  ahinglesi  then there is a new note of cordialityor so i always imagineand the rather rough cattlelike men who are sitting with their wine round the table look up more amicably they do not like being intruded upon only the landlord is always affable  i have a son who speaks english he says he is a handsome courtly old man of the falstaff sort  oh  he has been in america  and where is he now  he is at home onicoletta where is the giovann  the comely young woman with the baby came in  he is with the band she said  the old landlord looked at her with pride  this is my daughterinlaw he said  she smiled readily to the signora  and the baby we asked  mio figlio cried the young woman in the strong penetrating voice of these women and she came forward to show the child to the signora  it was a bonny baby the whole company was united in adoration and service of the bambino there was a moment of suspension when religious submission seemed to come over the innroom  then the signora began to talk and it broke upon the italian childreverence  what is he called  oscare came the ringing note of pride and the mother talked to the baby in dialect all men and women alike felt themselves glorified by the presence of the child  at last the coffee in the tin coffeepot was boiling and frothing out of spout and lid the milk in the little copper pan was also hot among the ashes so we had our drink at last  the landlord was anxious for us to see giovanni his son there was a village band performing up the street in front of the house of a colonel who had come home wounded from tripoli everybody in the village was wildly proud about the colonel and about the brass band the music of which was execrable  we just looked into the street the band of uncouth fellows was playing the same tune over and over again before a desolate newish house a crowd of desolate forgotten villagers stood round in the cold upper air it seemed altogether that the place was forgotten by god and man  but the landlord burly courteous handsome pointed out with a flourish the giovanni standing in the band playing a cornet the band itself consisted only of five men rather like beggars in the street but giovanni was the strangest he was tall and thin and somewhat germanlooking wearing shabby american clothes and a very high double collar and a small american crush hat he looked entirely like a neerdowell who plays a violin in the street dressed in the most downatheel sordid respectability  that is heyou see signorethe young one under the balcony  the father spoke with love and pride and the father was a gentleman like falstaff a pure gentleman the daughterinlaw also peered out to look at il giovann who was evidently a figure of repute in his sordid degenerate american respectability meanwhile this figure of repute blew himself red in the face producing staccato strains on his cornet and the crowd stood desolate and forsaken in the cold upper afternoon  then there was a sudden rugged evviva evviva from the people the band stopped playing somebody valiantly broke into a line of the song      tripoli sar√† italiana     sar√† italiana al rombo del cannon  the colonel had appeared on the balcony a smallish man very yellow in the face with grizzled black hair and very shabby legs they all seemed so sordidly hopelessly shabby  he suddenly began to speak leaning forward hot and feverish and yellow upon the iron rail of the balcony there was something hot and marshy and sick about him slightly repulsive less than human he told his fellowvillagers how he loved them how when he lay uncovered on the sands of tripoli week after week he had known they were watching him from the alpine height of the village he could feel that where he was they were all looking when the arabs came rushing like things gone mad and he had received his wound he had known that in his own village among his own dear ones there was recovery love would heal the wounds the home country was a lover who would heal all her sons wounds with love  among the grey desolate crowd were sharp rending bravosthe people were in tearsthe landlord at my side was repeating softly abstractedly carocaroettore caro colonello and when it was finished and the little colonel with shabby humiliated legs was gone in he turned to me and said with challenge that almost frightened me  un brav uomo  bravissimo i said  then we too went indoors  it was all somehow grey and hopeless and acrid unendurable  the colonel poor devilwe knew him afterwardsis now dead it is strange that he is dead there is something repulsive to me in the thought of his lying dead such a humiliating somehow degraded corpse death has no beauty in italy unless it be violent the death of man or woman through sickness is an occasion of horror repulsive they belong entirely to life they are so limited to life these people  soon the giovanni came home and took his cornet upstairs then he came to see us he was an ingenuous youth sordidly shabby and dirty his fair hair was long and uneven his very high starched collar made one aware that his neck and his ears were not clean his american crimson tie was ugly his clothes looked as if they had been kicking about on the floor for a year  yet his blue eyes were warm and his manner and speech very gentle  you will speak english with us i said  oh he said smiling and shaking his head i could speak english very well but it is two years that i dont speak it now over two years now so i dont speak it  but you speak it very well  no it is two years that i have not spoke not a wordso you see i have  you have forgotten it no you havent it will quickly come back  if i hear itwhen i go to americathen i shalli shall  you will soon pick it up  yesi shall pick it up  the landlord who had been watching with pride now went away the wife also went away and we were left with the shy gentle dirty and frowsilydressed giovanni  he laughed in his sensitive quick fashion  the women in america when they came into the store they said where is john where is john yes they liked me  and he laughed again glancing with vague warm blue eyes very shy very coiled upon himself with sensitiveness  he had managed a store in america in a smallish town i glanced at his reddish smooth rather knuckly hands and thin wrists in the frayed cuff they were real shopmans hands  the landlord brought some special feastday cake so overjoyed he was to have his giovanni speaking english with the signoria  when we went away we asked john to come down to our villa to see us we scarcely expected him to turn up  yet one morning he appeared at about half past nine just as we were finishing breakfast it was sunny and warm and beautiful so we asked him please to come with us picnicking  he was a queer shoot again in his unkempt longish hair and slovenly clothes a sort of very vulgar downatheel american in appearance and he was transported with shyness yet ours was the world he had chosen as his own so he took his place bravely and simply a hangeron  we climbed up the watercourse in the mountainside up to a smooth little lawn under the olive trees where daisies were flowering and gladioli were in bud it was a tiny little lawn of grass in a level crevice and sitting there we had the world below usthe lake the distant island the faroff low verona shore  then john began to talk and he talked continuously like a foreigner not saying the things he would have said in italian but following the suggestion and scope of his limited english  in the first place he loved his fatherit was my father my father always his father had a little shop as well as the inn in the village above so john had had some education he had been sent to brescia and then to verona to school and there had taken his examinations to become a civil engineer he was clever and could pass his examinations but he never finished his course his mother died and his father disconsolate had wanted him at home then he had gone back when he was sixteen or seventeen to the village beyond the lake to be with his father and to look after the shop  but didnt you mind giving up all your work i said  he did not quite understand  my father wanted me to come back he said  it was evident that giovanni had had no definite conception of what he was doing or what he wanted to do his father wishing to make a gentleman of him had sent him to school in verona by accident he had been moved on into the engineering course when it all fizzled to an end and he returned halfbaked to the remote desolate village of the mountainside he was not disappointed or chagrined he had never conceived of a coherent purposive life either one stayed in the village like a lodged stone or one made random excursions into the world across the world it was all aimless and purposeless  so he had stayed a while with his father then he had gone just as aimlessly with a party of men who were emigrating to america he had taken some money had drifted about living in the most comfortless wretched fashion then he had found a place somewhere in pennsylvania in a dry goods store this was when he was seventeen or eighteen years old  all this seemed to have happened to him without his being very much affected at least consciously his nature was simple and selfcomplete yet not so selfcomplete as that of il duro or paolo they had passed through the foreign world and been quite untouched their souls were static it was the world that had flowed unstable by  but john was more sensitive he had come more into contact with his new surroundings he had attended night classes almost every evening and had been taught english like a child he had loved the american free school the teachers the work  but he had suffered very much in america with his curious oversensitive wincing laugh he told us how the boys had followed him and jeered at him calling after him you damn dago you damn dago they had stopped him and his friend in the street and taken away their hats and spat into them so that at last he had gone mad they were youths and men who always tortured him using bad language which startled us very much as he repeated it there on the little lawn under the olive trees above the perfect lake english obscenities and abuse so coarse and startling that we bit our lips shocked almost into laughter whilst john simple and natural and somehow for all his long hair and dirty appearance flowerlike in soul repeated to us these things which may never be repeated in decent company  oh he said at last i get mad when they come one day shouting you damn dago dirty dog and will take my hat again oh i get mad and i would kill them i would kill them i am so mad i run to them and throw one to the floor and i tread on him while i go upon another the biggest though they hit me and kick me all over i feel nothing i am mad i throw the biggest to the floor a man he is older than i am and i hit him so hard i would kill him when the others see it they are afraid they throw stones and hit me on the face but i dont feel iti dont know nothing i hit the man on the floor i almost kill him i forget everything except i will kill him  but you didnt  noi dont know and he laughed his queer shaken laugh the other man that was with me my friend he came to me and we went away oh i was mad i was completely mad i would have killed them  he was trembling slightly and his eyes were dilated with a strange greyishblue fire that was very painful and elemental he looked beside himself but he was by no means mad  we were shaken by the vivid lambent excitement of the youth we wished him to forget we were shocked too in our souls to see the pure elemental flame shaken out of his gentle sensitive nature by his slight crinkled laugh we could see how much he had suffered he had gone out and faced the world and he had kept his place stranger and dago though he was  they never came after me no more not all the while i was there  then he said he became the foreman in the storeat first he was only assistant it was the best store in the town and many english ladies came and some germans he liked the english ladies very much they always wanted him to be in the store he wore white clothes there and they would say  you look very nice in the white coat john or else  let john come he can find it or else they said  john speaks like a born american  this pleased him very much  in the end he said he earned a hundred dollars a month he lived with the extraordinary frugality of the italians and had quite a lot of money  he was not like il duro faustino had lived in a state of miserliness almost in america but then he had had his debauches of shows and wine and carousals john went chiefly to the schools in one of which he was even asked to teach italian his knowledge of his own language was remarkable and most unusual  but what i asked brought you back  it was my father you see if i did not come to have my military service i must stay till i am forty so i think perhaps my father will be dead i shall never see him so i came  he had come home when he was twenty to fulfil his military duties at home he had married he was very fond of his wife but he had no conception of love in the old sense his wife was like the past to which he was wedded out of her he begot his child as out of the past but the future was all beyond her apart from her he was going away again now to america he had been some nine months at home after his military service was over he had no more to do now he was leaving his wife and child and his father to go to america  but why i said why you are not poor you can manage the shop in your village  yes he said but i will go to america perhaps i shall go into the store again the same  but is it not just the same as managing the shop at home  nonoit is quite different  then he told us how he bought goods in brescia and in said for the shop at home how he had rigged up a funicular with the assistance of the village an overhead wire by which you could haul the goods up the face of the cliffs right high up to within a mile of the village he was very proud of this and sometimes he himself went down the funicular to the waters edge to the boat when he was in a hurry this also pleased him  but he was going to brescia this day to see about going again to america perhaps in another month he would be gone  it was a great puzzle to me why he would go he could not say himself he would stay four or five years then he would come home again to see his fatherand his wife and child  there was a strange almost frightening destiny upon him which seemed to take him away always away from home from the past to that great raw america he seemed scarcely like a person with individual choice more like a creature under the influence of fate which was disintegrating the old life and precipitating him a fragment inconclusive into the new chaos  he submitted to it all with a perfect unquestioning simplicity never even knowing that he suffered that he must suffer disintegration from the old life he was moved entirely from within he never questioned his inevitable impulse  they say to me dont godont go he shook his head but i say i will go  and at that it was finished  so we saw him off at the little quay going down the lake he would return at evening and be pulled up in his funicular basket and in a months time he would be standing on the same lake steamer going to america  nothing was more painful than to see him standing there in his degraded sordid american clothes on the deck of the steamer waving us goodbye belonging in his final desire to our world the world of consciousness and deliberate action with his candid open unquestioning face he seemed like a prisoner being conveyed from one form of life to another or like a soul in trajectory that has not yet found a restingplace  what were wife and child to himthey were the last steps of the past his father was the continent behind him his wife and child the foreshore of the past but his face was set outwards away from it allwhither neither he nor anybody knew but he called it america     italians in exile   when i was in constance the weather was misty and enervating and depressing it was no pleasure to travel on the big flat desolate lake  when i went from constance it was on a small steamer down the rhine to schaffhausen that was beautiful still the mist hung over the waters over the wide shallows of the river and the sun coming through the morning made lovely yellow lights beneath the bluish haze so that it seemed like the beginning of the world and there was a hawk in the upper air fighting with two crows or two rooks ever they rose higher and higher the crow flickering above the attacking hawk the fight going on like some strange symbol in the sky the germans on deck watching with pleasure  then we passed out of sight between wooded banks and under bridges where quaint villages of old romance piled their red and coloured pointed roofs beside the water very still remote lost in the vagueness of the past it could not be that they were real even when the boat put in to shore and the customs officials came to look the village remained remote in the romantic past of high germany the germany of fairy tales and minstrels and craftsmen the poignancy of the past was almost unbearable floating there in colour upon the haze of the river  we went by some swimmers whose white shadowy bodies trembled near the side of the steamer under water one man with a round fair head lifted his face and one arm from the water and shouted a greeting to us as if he were a niebelung saluting with bright arm lifted from the water his face laughing the fair moustache hanging over his mouth then his white body swirled in the water and he was gone swimming with the side stroke  schaffhausen the town half old and bygone half modern with breweries and industries that is not very real schaffhausen falls with their factory in the midst and their hotel at the bottom and the general cinematograph effect they are ugly  it was afternoon when i set out to walk from the falls to italy across switzerland i remember the big fat rather gloomy fields of this part of baden damp and unliving i remember i found some apples under a tree in a field near a railway embankment then some mushrooms and i ate both then i came on to a long desolate highroad with dreary withered trees on either side and flanked by great fields where groups of men and women were working they looked at me as i went by down the long long road alone and exposed and out of the world  i remember nobody came at the border village to examine my pack i passed through unchallenged all was quiet and lifeless and hopeless with big stretches of heavy land  till sunset came very red and purple and suddenly from the heavy spacious open land i dropped sharply into the rhine valley again suddenly as if into another glamorous world  there was the river rushing along between its high mysterious romantic banks which were high as hills and covered with vine and there was the village of tall quaint houses flickering its lights on to the deepflowing river and quite silent save for the rushing of water  there was a fine covered bridge very dark i went to the middle and looked through the opening at the dark water below at the fa√ßade of square lights the tall villagefront towering remote and silent above the river the hill rose on either side the flood down here was a small forgotten wonderful world that belonged to the date of isolated village communities and wandering minstrels  so i went back to the inn of the golden stag and climbing some steps i made a loud noise a woman came and i asked for food she led me through a room where were enormous barrels ten feet in diameter lying fatly on their sides then through a large stoneclean kitchen with bright pans ancient as the meistersinger then up some steps and into the long guestroom where a few tables were laid for supper  a few people were eating i asked for abendessen and sat by the window looking at the darkness of the river below the covered bridge the dark hill opposite crested with its few lights  then i ate a very large quantity of knoedel soup and bread and drank beer and was very sleepy only one or two village men came in and these soon went again the place was dead still only at a long table on the opposite side of the room were seated seven or eight men ragged disreputable some impudentanother came in late the landlady gave them all thick soup with dumplings and bread and meat serving them in a sort of brief disapprobation they sat at the long table eight or nine tramps and beggars and wanderers out of work and they ate with a sort of cheerful callousness and brutality for the most part and as if ravenously looking round and grinning sometimes subdued cowed like prisoners and yet impudent at the end one shouted to know where he was to sleep the landlady called to the young servingwoman and in a classic german severity of disapprobation they were led up the stone stairs to their room they tramped off in threes and twos making a bad mean humiliated exit it was not yet eight oclock the landlady sat talking to one bearded man staid and severe whilst with her work on the table she sewed steadily  as the beggars and wanderers went slinking out of the room some called impudently cheerfully  nacht frau wirtingnacht wirtinte nacht frau to all of which the hostess answered a stereotyped gute nacht never turning her head from her sewing or indicating by the faintest movement that she was addressing the men who were filing raggedly to the doorway  so the room was empty save for the landlady and her sewing the staid elderly villager to whom she was talking in the unbeautiful dialect and the young servingwoman who was clearing away the plates and basins of the tramps and beggars  then the villager also went  gute nacht frau seidl to the landlady gute nacht at random to me  so i looked at the newspaper then i asked the landlady for a cigarette not knowing how else to begin so she came to my table and we talked  it pleased me to take upon myself a sort of romantic wandering character she said my german was sch√∂n a little goes a long way  so i asked her who were the men who had sat at the long table she became rather stiff and curt  they are the men looking for work she said as if the subject were disagreeable  but why do they come here so many i asked  then she told me that they were going out of the country this was almost the last village of the border that the relieving officer in each village was empowered to give to every vagrant a ticket entitling the holder to an evening meal bed and bread in the morning at a certain inn this was the inn for the vagrants coming to this village the landlady received fourpence per head i believe it was for each of these wanderers  little enough i said  nothing she replied  she did not like the subject at all only her respect for me made her answer  bettler lumpen und taugenichtse i said cheerfully  and men who are out of work and are going back to their own parish she said stiffly  so we talked a little and i too went to bed  gute nacht frau wirtin  gute nacht mein herr  so i went up more and more stone stairs attended by the young woman it was a great lofty old deserted house with many drab doors  at last in the distant topmost floor i had my bedroom with two beds and bare floor and scant furniture i looked down at the river far below at the covered bridge at the far lights on the hill above opposite strange to be here in this lost forgotten place sleeping under the roof with tramps and beggars i debated whether they would steal my boots if i put them out but i risked it the doorlatch made a loud noise on the deserted landing everywhere felt abandoned forgotten i wondered where the eight tramps and beggars were asleep there was no way of securing the door but somehow i felt that if i were destined to be robbed or murdered it would not be by tramps and beggars so i blew out the candle and lay under the big feather bed listening to the running and whispering of the medieval rhine  and when i waked up again it was sunny it was morning on the hill opposite though the river deep below ran in shadow  the tramps and beggars were all gone they must be cleared out by seven oclock in the morning so i had the inn to myself i and the landlady and the servingwoman everywhere was very clean full of the german morning energy and brightness which is so different from the latin morning the italians are dead and torpid first thing the germans are energetic and cheerful  it was cheerful in the sunny morning looking down on the swift river the covered picturesque bridge the bank and the hill opposite then down the curving road of the facing hill the swiss cavalry came riding men in blue uniforms i went out to watch them they came thundering romantically through the dark cavern of the roofedin bridge and they dismounted at the entrance to the village there was a fresh morningcheerful newness everywhere in the arrival of the troops in the welcome of the villagers  the swiss do not look very military neither in accoutrement nor bearing this little squad of cavalry seemed more like a party of common men riding out in some business of their own than like an army they were very republican and very free the officer who commanded them was one of themselves his authority was by consent  it was all very pleasant and genuine there was a sense of ease and peacefulness quite different from the mechanical slightly sullen manoeuvring of the germans  the village baker and his assistant came hot and floury from the bakehouse bearing between them a great basket of fresh bread the cavalry were all dismounted by the bridgehead eating and drinking like business men villagers came to greet their friends one soldier kissed his father who came wearing a leathern apron the school bell tangtangtanged from above school children merged timidly through the grouped horses up the narrow street passing unwillingly with their books the river ran swiftly the soldiers very haphazard and slack in uniform real shackbags chewed their bread in large mouthfuls the young lieutenant who seemed to be an officer only by consent of the men stood apart by the bridgehead gravely they were all serious and selfcontented very unglamorous it was like a business excursion on horseback harmless and uninspiring the uniforms were almost ludicrous so illfitting and casual  so i shouldered my own pack and set off through the bridge over the rhine and up the hill opposite  there is something very dead about this country i remember i picked apples from the grass by the roadside and some were very sweet but for the rest there was mile after mile of dead uninspired countryuninspired so neutral and ordinary that it was almost destructive  one gets this feeling always in switzerland except high up this feeling of average of utter soulless ordinariness something intolerable mile after mile to zurich it was just the same it was just the same in the tramcar going into zurich it was just the same in the town in the shops in the restaurant all was the utmost level of ordinariness and wellbeing but so ordinary that it was like a blight all the picturesqueness of the town is nothing it is like a most ordinary average usual person in an old costume the place was soulkilling  so after two hours rest eating in a restaurant wandering by the quay and through the market and sitting on a seat by the lake i found a steamer that would take me away that is how i always feel in switzerland the only possible living sensation is the sensation of relief in going away always going away the horrible average ordinariness of it all something utterly without flower or soul or transcendence the horrible vigorous ordinariness is too much  so i went on a steamer down the long lake surrounded by low grey hills it was saturday afternoon a thin rain came on i thought i would rather be in fiery hell than in this dead level of average life  i landed somewhere on the right bank about threequarters of the way down the lake it was almost dark yet i must walk away i climbed a long hill from the lake came to the crest looked down the darkness of the valley and descended into the deep gloom down into a soulless village  but it was eight oclock and i had had enough one might as well sleep i found the gasthaus zur post  it was a small very rough inn having only one common room with bare tables and a short stout grim rather surly landlady and a landlord whose hair stood up on end and who was trembling on the edge of delirium tremens  they could only give me boiled ham so i ate boiled ham and drank beer and tried to digest the utter cold materialism of switzerland  as i sat with my back to the wall staring blankly at the trembling landlord who was ready at any moment to foam at the mouth and at the dour landlady who was quite capable of keeping him in order there came in one of those dark showy italian girls with a man she wore a blouse and skirt and no hat her hair was perfectly dressed it was really italy the man was soft dark he would get stout later trapu he would have somewhat the figure of caruso but as yet he was soft sensuous young handsome  they sat at the long sidetable with their beer and created another country at once within the room another italian came fair and fat and slow one from the venetian province then another a little thin young man who might have been a swiss save for his vivid movement  this last was the first to speak to the germans the others had just said bier but the little newcomer entered into a conversation with the landlady  at last there were six italians sitting talking loudly and warmly at the sidetable the slow cold germanswiss at the other tables looked at them occasionally the landlord with his crazed stretched eyes glared at them with hatred but they fetched their beer from the bar with easy familiarity and sat at their table creating a bonfire of life in the callousness of the inn  at last they finished their beer and trooped off down the passage the room was painfully empty i did not know what to do  then i heard the landlord yelling and screeching and snarling from the kitchen at the back for all the world like a mad dog but the swiss saturday evening customers at the other tables smoked on and talked in their ugly dialect without trouble then the landlady came in and soon after the landlord he collarless with his waistcoat unbuttoned showing his loose throat and accentuating his round potbelly his limbs were thin and feverish the skin of his face hung loose his eyes glaring his hands trembled then he sat down to talk to a crony his terrible appearance was a fiasco nobody heeded him at all only the landlady was surly  from the back came loud noises of pleasure and excitement and banging about when the room door was opened i could see down the dark passage opposite another lighted door then the fat fair italian came in for more beer  what is all the noise i asked the landlady at last  it is the italians she said  what are they doing  they are doing a play  where  she jerked her head in the room at the back  can i go and look at them  i should think so  the landlord glaringly watched me go out i went down the stone passage and found a great halflighted room that might be used to hold meetings with forms piled at the side at one end was raised platform or stage and on this stage was a table and a lamp and the italians grouped round the light gesticulating and laughing their beer mugs were on the table and on the floor of the stage the little sharp youth was intently looking over some papers the others were bending over the table with him  they looked up as i entered from the distance looked at me in the distant twilight of the dusky room as if i were an intruder as if i should go away when i had seen them but i said in german  may i look  they were still unwilling to see or to hear me  what do you say the small one asked in reply  the others stood and watched slightly at bay like suspicious animals  if i might come and look i said in german then feeling very uncomfortable in italian you are doing a drama the landlady told me  the big empty room was behind me dark the little company of italians stood above me in the light of the lamp which was on the table they all watched with unseeing unwilling looks i was merely an intrusion  we are only learning it said the small youth  they wanted me to go away but i wanted to stay  may i listen i said i dont want to stay in there and i indicated with a movement of the head the innroom beyond  yes said the young intelligent man but we are only reading our parts  they had all become more friendly to me they accepted me  you are a german asked one youth  noenglish  english but do you live in switzerland  noi am walking to italy  on foot  they looked with wakened eyes  yes  so i told them about my journey they were puzzled they did not quite understand why i wanted to walk but they were delighted with the idea of going to lugano and como and then to milan  where do you come from i asked them  they were all from the villages between verona and venice they had seen the garda i told them of my living there  those peasants of the mountains they said at once they are people of little education rather wild folk  and they spoke with goodhumoured contempt  i thought of paolo and il duro and the signor pietro our padrone and i resented these factoryhands for criticizing them  so i sat on the edge of the stage whilst they rehearsed their parts the little thin intelligent fellow giuseppino was the leader the others read their parts in the laborious disjointed fashion of the peasant who can only see one word at a time and has then to put the words together afterwards to make sense the play was an amateur melodrama printed in little penny booklets for carnival production this was only the second reading they had given it and the handsome dark fellow who was roused and displaying himself before the girl a hard erect piece of callousness laughed and flushed and stumbled and understood nothing till it was transferred into him direct through giuseppino the fat fair slow man was more conscientious he laboured through his part the other two men were in the background more or less  the most confidential was the fat fair slow man who was called alberto his part was not very important so he could sit by me and talk to me  he said they were all workers in the factorysilk i think it wasin the village they were a whole colony of italians thirty or more families they had all come at different times  giuseppino had been longest in the village he had come when he was eleven with his parents and had attended the swiss school so he spoke perfect german he was a clever man was married and had two children  he himself alberto had been seven years in the valley the girl la maddelena had been here ten years the dark man alfredo who was flushed with excitement of her had been in the village about nine yearshe alone of all men was not married  the others had all married italian wives and they lived in the great dwelling whose windows shone yellow by the rattling factory they lived entirely among themselves none of them could speak german more than a few words except the giuseppino who was like a native here  it was very strange being among these italians exiled in switzerland alfredo the dark one the unmarried was in the old tradition yet even he was curiously subject to a new purpose as if there were some greater new will that included him sensuous mindless as he was he seemed to give his consent to something beyond himself in this he was different from il duro in that he had put himself under the control of the outside conception  it was strange to watch them on the stage the italians all lambent soft warm sensuous yet moving subject round giuseppino who was always quiet always ready always impersonal there was a look of purpose almost of devotion on his face that singled him out and made him seem the one stable eternal being among them they quarrelled and he let them quarrel up to a certain point then he called them back he let them do as they liked so long as they adhered more or less to the central purpose so long as they got on in some measure with the play  all the while they were drinking beer and smoking cigarettes the alberto was barman he went out continually with the glasses the maddelena had a small glass in the lamplight of the stage the little party read and smoked and practised exposed to the empty darkness of the big room queer and isolated it seemed a tiny pathetic magicland far away from the barrenness of switzerland i could believe in the old fairytales where when the rock was opened a magic underworld was revealed  the alfredo flushed roused handsome but very soft and enveloping in his heat laughed and threw himself into his pose laughed foolishly and then gave himself up to his part the alberto slow and laborious yet with a spark of vividness and natural intensity flashing through replied and gesticulated the maddelena laid her head on the bosom of alfredo the other men started into action and the play proceeded intently for half an hour  quick vivid and sharp the little giuseppino was always central but he seemed almost invisible when i think back i can scarcely see him i can only see the others the lamplight on their faces and on their full gesticulating limbs i can seethe maddelena rather coarse and hard and repellent declaiming her words in a loud halfcynical voice falling on the breast of the alfredo who was soft and sensuous more like a female flushing with his mouth getting wet his eyes moist as he was roused i can see the alberto slow laboured yet with a kind of pristine simplicity in all his movements that touched his fat commonplaceness with beauty then there were the two other men shy inflammable unintelligent with their sudden italian rushes of hot feeling all their faces are distinct in the lamplight all their bodies ate palpable and dramatic  but the face of the giuseppino is like a pale luminousness a sort of gleam among all the ruddy glow his body is evanescent like a shadow and his being seemed to cast its influence over all the others except perhaps the woman who was hard and resistant the other men seemed all overcast mitigated in part transfigured by the will of the little leader but they were very soft stuff if inflammable  the young woman of the inn niece of the landlady came down and called out across the room  we will go away from here now said the giuseppino to me they close at eleven but we have another inn in the next parish that is open all night come with us and drink some wine  but i said you would rather be alone  no they pressed me to go they wanted me to go with them they were eager they wanted to entertain me alfredo flushed wetmouthed warm protested i must drink wine the real italian red wine from their own village at home they would have no nay  so i told the landlady she said i must be back by twelve oclock  the night was very dark below the road the stream was rushing there was a great factory on the other side of the water making faint quivering lights of reflection and one could see the working of machinery shadowy through the lighted windows near by was the tall tenement where the italians lived  we went on through the straggling raw village deep beside the stream then over the small bridge and up the steep hill down which i had come earlier in the evening  so we arrived at the caf√© it was so different inside from the german inn yet it was not like an italian caf√© either it was brilliantly lighted clean new and there were redandwhite cloths on the tables the host was in the room and his daughter a beautiful redhaired girl  greetings were exchanged with the quick intimate directness of italy but there was another note also a faint echo of reserve as though they reserved themselves from the outer world making a special inner community  alfredo was hot he took off his coat we all sat freely at a long table whilst the redhaired girl brought a quart of red wine at other tables men were playing cards with the odd neapolitan cards they too were talking italian it was a warm ruddy bit of italy within the cold darkness of switzerland  when you come to italy they said to me salute it from us salute the sun and the earth litalia  so we drank in salute of italy they sent their greeting by me  you know in italy there is the sun the sun said alfredo to me profoundly moved wetmouthed tipsy  i was reminded of enrico persevalli and his terrifying cry at the end of ghosts  il sole il sole  so we talked for a while of italy they had a pained tenderness for it sad reserved  dont you want to go back i said pressing them to tell me definitely wont you go back some time  yes they said we will go back  but they spoke reservedly without freedom we talked about italy about songs and carnival about the food polenta and salt they laughed at my pretending to cut the slabs of polenta with a string that rejoiced them all it took them back to the italian mezzogiorno the bells jangling in the campanile the eating after the heavy work on the land  but they laughed with the slight pain and contempt and fondness which every man feels towards his past when he has struggled away from that past from the conditions which made it  they loved italy passionately but they would not go back all their blood all their senses were italian needed the italian sky the speech the sensuous life they could hardly live except through the senses their minds were not developed mentally they were children lovable na√Øve almost fragile children but sensually they were men sensually they were accomplished  yet a new tiny flower was struggling to open in them the flower of a new spirit the substratum of italy has always been pagan sensuous the most potent symbol the sexual symbol the child is really a nonchristian symbol it is the symbol of manss triumph of eternal life in procreation the worship of the cross never really held good in italy the christianity of northern europe has never had any place there  and now when northern europe is turning back on its own christianity denying it all the italians are struggling with might and main against the sensuous spirit which still dominates them when northern europe whether it hates nietzsche or not is crying out for the dionysic ecstasy practising on itself the dionysic ecstasy southern europe is breaking free from dionysus from the triumphal affirmation of life over death immortality through procreation  i could see these sons of italy would never go back men like paolo and il duro broke away only to return the dominance of the old form was too strong for them call it love of country or love of the village campanilismo or what not it was the dominance of the old pagan form the old affirmation of immortality through procreation as opposed to the christian affirmation of immortality through selfdeath and social love  but john and these italians in switzerland were a generation younger and they would not go back at least not to the old italy suffer as they might and they did suffer wincing in every nerve and fibre from the cold material insentience of the northern countries and of america still they would endure this for the sake of something else they wanted they would suffer a death in the flesh as john had suffered in fighting the street crowd as these men suffered year after year cramped in their black gloomy cold swiss valley working in the factory but there would come a new spirit out of it  even alfredo was submitted to the new process though he belonged entirely by nature to the sort of il duro he was purely sensuous and mindless but under the influence of giuseppino he was thrown down as fallow to the new spirit that would come  and then when the others were all partially tipsy the giuseppino began to talk to me in him was a steady flame burning burning burning a flame of the mind of the spirit something new and clear something that held even the soft sensuous alfredo in submission besides all the others who had some little development of mind  sa signore said the giuseppino to me quiet almost invisible or inaudible as it seemed like a spirit addressing me luomo non ha patriaa man has no country what has the italian government to do with us what does a government mean it makes us work it takes part of our wages away from us it makes us soldiersand what for what is government for  have you been a soldier i interrupted him  he had not none of them had that was why they could not really go back to italy now this was out this explained partly their curious reservation in speaking about their beloved country they had forfeited parents as well as homeland  what does the government do it takes taxes it has an army and police and it makes roads but we could do without an army and we could be our own police and we could make our own roads what is this government who wants it only those who are unjust and want to have advantage over somebody else it is an instrument of injustice and of wrong  why should we have a government here in this village there are thirty families of italians there is no government for them no italian government and we live together better than in italy we are richer and freer we have no policemen no poor laws we help each other and there are no poor  why are these governments always doing what we dont want them to do we should not be fighting in the cirenaica if we were all italians it is the government that does it they talk and talk and do things with us but we dont want them  the others tipsy sat round the table with the terrified gravity of children who are somehow responsible for things they do not understand they stirred in their seats turning aside with gestures almost of pain of imprisonment only alfredo laying his hand on mine was laughing loosely floridly he would upset all the government with a jerk of his wellbuilt shoulder and then he would have a spreesuch a spree he laughed wetly to me  the giuseppino waited patiently during this tipsy confidence but his pale clarity and beauty was something constant starlike in comparison with the flushed soft handsomeness of the other he waited patiently looking at me  but i did not want him to go on i did not want to answer i could feel a new spirit in him something strange and pure and slightly frightening he wanted something which was beyond me and my soul was somewhere in tears crying helplessly like an infant in the night i could not respond i could not answer he seemed to look at me me an englishman an educated man for corroboration but i could not corroborate him i knew the purity and new struggling towards birth of a true starlike spirit but i could not confirm him in his utterance my soul could not respond i did not believe in the perfectibility of man i did not believe in infinite harmony among men and this was his star this belief  it was nearly midnight a swiss came in and asked for beer the italians gathered round them a curious darkness of reserve and then i must go  they shook hands with me warmly truthfully putting a sort of implicit belief in me as representative of some further knowledge but there was a fixed calm resolve over the face of the giuseppino a sort of steady faith even in disappointment he gave me a copy of a little anarchist paper published in geneva lanarchista i believe it was called i glanced at it it was in italian na√Øve simple rather rhetorical so they were all anarchists these italians  i ran down the hill in the thick swiss darkness to the little bridge and along the uneven cobbled street i did not want to think i did not want to know i wanted to arrest my activity to keep it confined to the moment to the adventure  when i came to the flight of stone steps which led up to the door of the inn at the side i saw in the darkness two figures they said a low good night and parted the girl began to knock at the door the man disappeared it was the niece of the landlady parting from her lover  we waited outside the locked door at the top of the stone steps in the darkness of midnight the stream rustled below then came a shouting and an insane snarling within the passage the bolts were not withdrawn  it is the gentleman it is the strange gentleman called the girl  then came again the furious shouting snarls and the landlords mad voice  stop out stop out there the door wont be opened again  the strange gentleman is here repeated the girl  then more movement was heard and the door was suddenly opened and the landlord rushed out upon us wielding a broom it was a strange sight in the halflighted passage i stared blankly in the doorway the landlord dropped the broom he was waving and collapsed as if by magic looking at me though he continued to mutter madly unintelligibly the girl slipped past me and the landlord snarled then he picked up the brush at the same time crying  you are late the door was shut it will not be opened we shall have the police in the house we said twelve oclock at twelve oclock the door must be shut and must not be opened again if you are late you stay out  so he went snarling his voice rising higher and higher away into the kitchen  you are coming to your room the landlady said to me coldly and she led me upstairs  the room was over the road clean but rather ugly with a large tin that had once contained lard or swissmilk to wash in but the bed was good enough which was all that mattered  i heard the landlord yelling and there was a long and systematic thumping somewhere thump thump thump and banging i wondered where it was i could not locate it at all because my room lay beyond another large room i had to go through a large room by the foot of two beds to get to my door so i could not quite tell where anything was  but i went to sleep whilst i was wondering  i woke in the morning and washed in the tin i could see a few people in the street walking in the sunday morning leisure it felt like sunday in england and i shrank from it i could see none of the italians the factory stood there raw and large and sombre by the stream and the drabcoloured stone tenements were close by otherwise the village was a straggling swiss street almost untouched  the landlord was quiet and reasonable even friendly in the morning he wanted to talk to me where had i bought my boots was his first question i told him in munich and how much had they cost i told him twentyeight marks he was much impressed by them such good boots of such soft strong beautiful leather he had not seen such boots for a long time  then i knew it was he who had cleaned my boots i could see him fingering them and wondering over them i rather liked him i could see he had had imagination once and a certain fineness of nature now he was corrupted with drink too far gone to be even a human being i hated the village  they set bread and butter and a piece of cheese weighing about five pounds and large fresh sweet cakes for breakfast i ate and was thankful the food was good  a couple of village youths came in in their sunday clothes they had the sunday stiffness it reminded me of the stiffness and curious selfconsciousness that comes over life in england on a sunday but the landlord sat with his waistcoat hanging open over his shirt potbellied his ruined face leaning forward talking always talking wanting to know  so in a few minutes i was out on the road again thanking god for the blessing of a road that belongs to no man and travels away from all men  i did not want to see the italians something had got tied up in me and i could not bear to see them again i liked them so much but for some reason or other my mind stopped like clockwork if i wanted to think of them and of what their lives would be their future it was as if some curious negative magnetism arrested my mind prevented it from working the moment i turned it towards these italians  i do not know why it was but i could never write to them or think of them or even read the paper they gave me though it lay in my drawer for months in italy and i often glanced over six lines of it and often often my mind went back to the group the play they were rehearsing the wine in the pleasant caf√© and the night but the moment my memory touched them my whole soul stopped and was null i could not go on even now i cannot really consider them in thought  i shrink involuntarily away i do not know why this is     the return journey   when one walks one must travel west or south if one turns northward or eastward it is like walking down a culdesac to the blind end  so it has been since the crusaders came home satiated and the renaissance saw the western sky as an archway into the future so it is still we must go westwards and southwards  it is a sad and gloomy thing to travel even from italy into france but it is a joyful thing to walk south to italy south and west it is so and there is a certain exaltation in the thought of going west even to cornwall to ireland it is as if the magnetic poles were southwest and northeast for our spirits with the southwest under the sunset as the positive pole so whilst i walk through switzerland though it is a valley of gloom and depression a light seems to flash out under every footstep with the joy of progression  it was sunday morning when i left the valley where the italians lived i went quickly over the stream heading for lucerne it was a good thing to be out of doors with ones pack on ones back climbing uphill but the trees were thick by the roadside i was not yet free it was sunday morning very still  in two hours i was at the top of the hill looking out over the intervening valley at the long lake of zurich spread there beyond with its girdle of low hills like a reliefmap i could not bear to look at it it was so small and unreal i had a feeling as if it were false a large reliefmap that i was looking down upon and which i wanted to smash it seemed to intervene between me and some reality i could not believe that that was the real world it was a figment a fabrication like a dull landscape painted on a wall to hide the real landscape  so i went on over to the other side of the hill and i looked out again again there were the smokylooking hills and the lake like a piece of lookingglass but the hills were higher that big one was the rigi i set off down the hill  there was fat agricultural land and several villages and church was over the churchgoers were all coming home men in black broadcloth and old chimneypot silk hats carrying their umbrellas women in ugly dresses carrying books and umbrellas the streets were dotted with these blackclothed men and stiff women all reduced to a sunday nullity i hated it it reminded me of that which i knew in my boyhood that stiff null propriety which used to come over us like a sort of deliberate and selfinflicted cramp on sundays i hated these elders in black broadcloth with their neutral faces going home piously to their sunday dinners i hated the feeling of these villages comfortable welltodo clean and proper  and my boot was chafing two of my toes that always happens i had come down to a wide shallow valleybed marshy so about a mile out of the village i sat down by a stone bridge by a stream and tore up my handkerchief and bound up the toes and as i sat binding my toes two of the elders in black with umbrellas under their arms approached from the direction of the village  they made me so furious i had to hasten to fasten my boot to hurry on again before they should come near me i could not bear the way they walked and talked so crambling and material and mealymouthed  then it did actually begin to rain i was just going down a short hill so i sat under a bush and watched the trees drip i was so glad to be there homeless without place or belonging crouching under the leaves in the copse by the road that i felt i had like the meek inherited the earth some men went by with their coatcollars turned up and the rain making still blacker their black broadcloth shoulders they did not see me i was as safe and separate as a ghost so i ate the remains of my food that i had bought in zurich and waited for the rain  later in the wet sunday afternoon i went on to the little lake past many inert neutral material people down an ugly road where trams ran the blight of sunday was almost intolerable near the town  so on i went by the side of the steamy reedy lake walking the length of it then suddenly i went in to a little villa by the water for tea in switzerland every house is a villa  but this villa was kept by two old ladies and a delicate dog who must not get his feet wet i was very happy there i had good jam and strange honeycakes for tea that i liked and the little old ladies pattered round in a great stir always whirling like two dry leaves after the restless dog  why must he not go out i said  because it is wet they answered and he coughs and sneezes  without a handkerchief that is not angenehm i said  so we became bosom friends  you are austrian they said to me  i said i was from graz that my father was a doctor in graz and that i was walking for my pleasure through the countries of europe  i said this because i knew a doctor from graz who was always wandering about and because i did not want to be myself an englishman to these two old ladies i wanted to be something else so we exchanged confidences  they told me in their queer old toothless fashion about their visitors a man who used to fish all day every day for three weeks fish every hour of the day though many a day he caught nothingnothing at allstill he fished from the boat and so on such trivialities then they told me of a third sister who had died a third little old lady one could feel the gap in the house they cried and i being an austrian from graz to my astonishment felt my tears slip over on to the table i also was sorry and i would have kissed the little old ladies to comfort them  only in heaven it is warm and it doesnt rain and no one dies i said looking at the wet leaves  then i went away i would have stayed the night at this house i wanted to but i had developed my austrian character too far  so i went on to a detestable brutal inn in the town and the next day i climbed over the back of the detestable rigi with its vile hotel to come to lucerne there on the rigi i met a lost young frenchman who could speak no german and who said he could not find people to speak french so we sat on a stone and became close friends and i promised faithfully to go and visit him in his barracks in algiers i was to sail from naples to algiers he wrote me the address on his card and told me he had friends in the regiment to whom i should be introduced and we could have a good time if i would stay a week or two down there in algiers  how much more real algiers was than the rock on the rigi where we sat or the lake beneath or the mountains beyond algiers is very real though i have never seen it and my friend is my friend for ever though i have lost his card and forgotten his name he was a government clerk from lyons making this his first foreign tour before he began his military service he showed me his circular excursion ticket then at last we parted for he must get to the top of the rigi and i must get to the bottom  lucerne and its lake were as irritating as everlike the wrapper round milk chocolate i could not sleep even one night there i took the steamer down the lake to the very last station there i found a good german inn and was happy  there was a tall thin young man whose face was red and inflamed from the sun i thought he was a german tourist he had just come in and he was eating bread and milk he and i were alone in the eatingroom he was looking at an illustrated paper  does the steamer stop here all night i asked him in german hearing the boat bustling and blowing her steam on the water outside and glancing round at her lights red and white in the pitch darkness  he only shook his head over his bread and milk and did not lift his face  are you english then i said  no one but an englishman would have hidden his face in a bowl of milk and have shaken his red ears in such painful confusion  yes he said i am  and i started almost out of my skin at the unexpected london accent it was as if one suddenly found oneself in the tube  so am i i said where have you come from  then he began like a general explaining his plans to tell me he had walked round over the furka pass had been on foot four or five days he had walked tremendously knowing no german and nothing of the mountains he had set off alone on this tour he had a fortnights holiday so he had come over the rh√¥ne glacier across the furka and down from andermatt to the lake on this last day he had walked about thirty mountain miles  but werent you tired i said aghast  he was under the inflamed redness of his sun and wind and snowburned face he was sick with fatigue he had done over a hundred miles in the last four days  did you enjoy it i asked  oh yes i wanted to do it all he wanted to do it and he had done it but god knows what he wanted to do it for he had now one day at lucerne one day at interlaken and berne then london  i was sorry for him in my soul he was so cruelly tired so perishingly victorious  why did you do so much i said why did you come on foot all down the valley when you could have taken the train was it worth it  i think so he said  yet he was sick with fatigue and overexhaustion his eyes were quite dark sightless he seemed to have lost the power of seeing to be virtually blind he hung his head forward when he had to write a post card as if he felt his way but he turned his post card so that i should not see to whom it was addressed not that i was interested only i noticed his little cautious english movement of privacy  what time will you be going on i asked  when is the first steamer he said and he turned out a guidebook with a timetable he would leave at about seven  but why so early i said to him  he must be in lucerne at a certain hour and at interlaken in the evening  i suppose you will rest when you get to london i said  he looked at me quickly reservedly  i was drinking beer i asked him wouldnt he have something he thought a moment then said he would have another glass of hot milk the landlord cameand bread he asked  the englishman refused he could not eat really also he was poor he had to husband his money the landlord brought the milk and asked me when would the gentleman want to go away so i made arrangements between the landlord and the stranger but the englishman was slightly uncomfortable at my intervention he did not like me to know what he would have for breakfast  i could feel so well the machine that had him in its grip he slaved for a year mechanically in london riding in the tube working in the office then for a fortnight he was let free so he rushed to switzerland with a tour planned out and with just enough money to see him through and to buy presents at interlaken bits of the edelweiss pottery i could see him going home with them  so he arrived and with amazing pathetic courage set forth on foot in a strange land to face strange landlords with no language but english at his command and his purse definitely limited yet he wanted to go among the mountains to cross a glacier so he had walked on and on like one possessed ever forward his name might have been excelsior indeed  but then when he reached his furka only to walk along the ridge and to descend on the same side my god it was killing to the soul and here he was down again from the mountains beginning his journey home again steamer and train and steamer and train and tube till he was back in the machine  it hadnt let him go and he knew it hence his cruel selftorture of fatigue his cruel exercise of courage he who hung his head in his milk in torment when i asked him a question in german what courage had he not needed to take this his very first trip out of england alone on foot  his eyes were dark and deep with unfathomable courage yet he was going back in the morning he was going back all he had courage for was to go back he would go back though he died by inches why not it was killing him it was like living loaded with irons but he had the courage to submit to die that way since it was the way allotted to him  the way he sank on the table in exhaustion drinking his milk his will nevertheless so perfect and unblemished triumphant though his body was broken and in anguish was almost too much to bear my heart was wrung for my countryman wrung till it bled  i could not bear to understand my countryman a man who worked for his living as i had worked as nearly all my countrymen work he would not give in on his holiday he would walk to fulfil his purpose walk on no matter how cruel the effort were he would not rest he would not relinquish his purpose nor abate his will not by one jot or tittle his body must pay whatever his will demanded though it were torture  it all seemed to me so foolish i was almost in tears he went to bed i walked by the dark lake and talked to the girl in the inn she was a pleasant girl it was a pleasant inn a homely place one could be happy there  in the morning it was sunny the lake was blue by night i should be nearly at the crest of my journey i was glad  the englishman had gone i looked for his name in the book it was written in a fair clerkly hand he lived at streatham suddenly i hated him the dogged fool to keep his nose on the grindstone like that what was all his courage but the very tiptop of cowardice what a vile naturealmost sadish proud like the infamous red indians of being able to stand torture  the landlord came to talk to me he was fat and comfortable and too respectful but i had to tell him all the englishman had done in the way of a holiday just to shame his own fat ponderous innkeepers luxuriousness that was too gross then all i got out of his enormous comfortableness was  yes thats a very long step to take  so i set off myself up the valley between the close snowtopped mountains whose white gleamed above me as i crawled small as an insect along the dark cold valley below  there had been a cattle fair earlier in the morning so troops of cattle were roving down the road some with bells tangtanging all with soft faces and startled eyes and a sudden swerving of horns the grass was very green by the roads and by the streams the shadows of the mountain slopes were very dark on either hand overhead and the sky with snowy flanks and tips was high up  here away from the world the villages were quiet and obscureleft behind they had the same fascinating atmosphere of being forgotten left out of the world that old english villages have and buying apples and cheese and bread in a little shop that sold everything and smelled of everything i felt at home again  but climbing gradually higher mile after mile always between the shadows of the high mountains i was glad i did not live in the alps the villages on the slopes the people there seemed as if they must gradually bit by bit slide down and tumble to the watercourse and be rolled on away away to the sea straggling haphazard little villages ledged on the slope high up beside their wet green hanging meadows with pine trees behind and the valley bottom far below and rocks right above on both sides seemed like little temporary squattings of outcast people it seemed impossible that they should persist there with great shadows wielded over them like a menace and gleams of brief sunshine like a window there was a sense of momentariness and expectation it seemed as though some dramatic upheaval must take place the mountains fall down into their own shadows the valley beds were like deep graves the sides of the mountains like the collapsing walls of a grave the very mountaintops above bright with transcendent snow seemed like death eternal death  there it seemed in the glamorous snow was the source of death which fell down in great waves of shadow and rock rushing to the level earth and all the people of the mountains on the slopes in the valleys seemed to live upon this great rushing wave of death of breakingdown of destruction  the very pure source of breakingdown decomposition the very quick of cold death is the snowy mountainpeak above there eternally goes on the white foregathering of the crystals out of the deathly cold of the heavens this is the static nucleus where death meets life in its elementality and thence from their white radiant nucleus of death in life flows the great flux downwards towards life and warmth and we below we cannot think of the flux upwards that flows from the needlepoint of snow to the unutterable cold and death  the people under the mountains they seem to live in the flux of death the last strange overshadowed units of life big shadows wave over them there is the eternal noise of water falling icily downwards from the source of death overhead  and the people under the shadows dwelling in the tang of snow and the noise of icy water seem dark almost sordid brutal there is no flowering or coming to flower only this persistence in the icetouched air of reproductive life  but it is difficult to get a sense of a native population everywhere are the hotels and the foreigners the parasitism yet there is unseen this overshadowed overhung sordid mountain population ledged on the slopes and in the crevices in the wider valleys there is still a sense of cowering among the people but they catch a new tone from their contact with the foreigners and in the towns are nothing but tradespeople  so i climbed slowly up for a whole day first along the highroad sometimes above and sometimes below the twisting serpentine railway then afterwards along a path on the side of the hilla path that went through the crewyards of isolated farms and even through the garden of a village priest the priest was decorating an archway he stood on a chair in the sunshine reaching up with a garland whilst the servingwoman stood below talking loudly  the valley here seemed wider the great flanks of the mountains gave place the peaks above were further back so one was happier i was pleased as i sat by the thin track of single flat stones that dropped swiftly downhill  at the bottom was a little town with a factory or quarry or a foundry some place with long smoking chimneys which made me feel quite at home among the mountains  it is the hideous rawness of the world of men the horrible desolating harshness of the advance of the industrial world upon the world of nature that is so painful it looks as though the industrial spread of mankind were a sort of dry disintegration advancing and advancing a process of dry disintegration if only we could learn to take thought for the whole world instead of for merely tiny bits of it  i went through the little hideous crude factorysettlement in the high valley where the eternal snows gleamed past the enormous advertisements for chocolate and hotels up the last steep slope of the pass to where the tunnel begins g√∂schenen the village at the mouth of the tunnel is all railway sidings and haphazard villas for tourists post cards and touts and weedy carriages disorder and sterile chaos high up how should any one stay there  i went on up the pass itself there were various parties of visitors on the roads and tracks people from towns incongruously walking and driving it was drawing on to evening i climbed slowly between the great cleft in the rock where are the big iron gates through which the road winds winds halfway down the narrow gulley of solid living rock the very throat of the path where hangs a tablet in memory of many russians killed  emerging through the dark rocky throat of the pass i came to the upper world the level upper world it was evening livid cold on either side spread the sort of moorland of the wide passhead i drew near along the highroad to andermatt  everywhere were soldiers moving about the livid desolate waste of this upper world i passed the barracks and the first villas for visitors darkness was coming on the straggling inconclusive street of andermatt looked as if it were some accidenthouses hotels barracks lodgingplaces tumbled at random as the caravan of civilization crossed this high cold arid bridge of the european world  i bought two post cards and wrote them out of doors in the cold livid twilight then i asked a soldier where was the postoffice he directed me it was something like sending post cards from skegness or bognor there in the postoffice  i was trying to make myself agree to stay in andermatt for the night but i could not the whole place was so terribly raw and flat and accidental as if great pieces of furniture had tumbled out of a pantechnicon and lay discarded by the road i hovered in the street in the twilight trying to make myself stay i looked at the announcements of lodgings and boarding for visitors it was no good i could not go into one of these houses  so i passed on through the old low broadeaved houses that cringe down to the very street out into the open again the air was fierce and savage on one side was a moorland level on the other a sweep of naked hill curved concave and sprinkled with snow i could see how wonderful it would all be under five or six feet of winter snow skiing and tobogganing at christmas but it needed the snow in the summer there is to be seen nothing but the winters broken detritus  the twilight deepened though there was still the strange glassy translucency of the snowlit air a fragment of moon was in the sky a carriageload of french tourists passed me there was the loud noise of water as ever something eternal and maddening in its sound like the sound of time itself rustling and rushing and wavering but never for a second ceasing the rushing of time that continues throughout eternity this is the sound of the icy streams of switzerland something that mocks and destroys our warm being  so i came in the early darkness to the little village with the broken castle that stands for ever frozen at the point where the track parts one way continuing along the ridge to the furka pass the other swerving over the hill to the left over the gotthardt  in this village i must stay i saw a woman looking hastily furtively from a doorway i knew she was looking for visitors i went on up the hilly street there were only a few wooden houses and a gaily lighted wooden inn where men were laughing and strangers men standing talking loudly in the doorway  it was very difficult to go to a house this night i did not want to approach any of them i turned back to the house of the peering woman she had looked henlike and anxious she would be glad of a visitor to help her pay her rent  it was a clean pleasant wooden house made to keep out the cold that seemed its one function to defend the inmates from the cold it was furnished like a hut just tables and chairs and bare wooden walls one felt very close and secure in the room as in a hut shut away from the outer world  the henlike woman came  can i have a bed i said for the night  abendessen ja she replied will you have soup and boiled beef and vegetables  i said i would so i sat down to wait in the utter silence i could scarcely hear the icestream the silence seemed frozen the house empty the woman seemed to be flitting aimlessly scurriedly in reflex against the silence one could almost touch the stillness as one could touch the walls or the stove or the table with white american oilcloth  suddenly she appeared again  what will you drink  she watched my face anxiously and her voice was pathetic slightly pleading in its quickness  wine or beer she said  i would not trust the coldness of beer  a half of red wine i said  i knew she was going to keep me an indefinite time  she appeared with the wine and bread  would you like omelette after the beef she asked omelette with cognaci can make it very good  i knew i should be spending too much but i said yes after all why should i not eat after the long walk  so she left me again whilst i sat in the utter isolation and stillness eating bread and drinking the wine which was good and i listened for any sound only the faint noise of the stream and i wondered why am i here on this ridge of the alps in the lamplit wooden closeshut room alone why am i here  yet somehow i was glad i was happy even such splendid silence and coldness and clean isolation it was something eternal unbroachable i was free in this heavy icecold air this upper world alone london far away below beyond england germany francethey were all so unreal in the night it was a sort of grief that this continent all beneath was so unreal false nonexistent in its activity out of the silence one looked down on it and it seemed to have lost all importance all significance it was so big yet it had no significance the kingdom of the world had no significance what could one do but wander about  the woman came with my soup i asked her did not many people come in the summer but she was scared away she did not answer she went like a leaf in the wind however the soup was good and plentiful  she was a long time before she came with the next course then she put the tray on the table and looking at me then looking away shrinking she said  you must excuse me if i dont answer youi dont hear welli am rather deaf  i looked at her and i winced also she shrank in such simple pain from the fact of her defect i wondered if she were bullied because of it or only afraid lest visitors would dislike it  she put the dishes in order set me my plate quickly nervously and was gone again like a scared chicken being tired i wanted to weep over her the nervous timid hen so frightened by her own deafness the house was silent of her empty it was perhaps her deafness which created this empty soundlessness  when she came with the omelette i said to her loudly  that was very good the soup and meat so she quivered nervously and said thank you and i managed to talk to her she was like most deaf people in that her terror of not hearing made her six times worse than she actually was  she spoke with a soft strange accent so i thought she was perhaps a foreigner but when i asked her she misunderstood and i had not the heart to correct her i can only remember she said her house was always full in the winter about christmastime people came for the winter sport there were two young english ladies who always came to her  she spoke of them warmly then suddenly afraid she drifted off again i ate the omelette with cognac which was very good then i looked in the street it was very dark with bright stars and smelled of snow two village men went by i was tired i did not want to go to the inn  so i went to bed in the silent wooden house i had a small bedroom clean and wooden and very cold outside the stream was rushing i covered myself with a great depth of featherbed and looked at the stars and the shadowy upper world and went to sleep  in the morning i washed in the icecold water and was glad to set out an icy mist was over the noisy stream there were a few meagre shredded pinetrees i had breakfast and paid my bill it was seven francsmore than i could afford but that did not matter once i was out in the air  the sky was blue and perfect it was a ringing morning the village was very still i went up the hill till i came to the signpost i looked down the direction of the furka and thought of my tired englishman from streatham who would be on his way home thank god i need not go home never perhaps i turned up the track to the left to the gothard  standing looking round at the mountaintops at the village and the broken castle below me at the scattered debris of andermatt on the moor in the distance i was jumping in my soul with delight should one ever go down to the lower world  then i saw another figure striding along a youth with kneebreeches and alpine hat and braces over his shirt walking manfully his coat slung in his rucksack behind i laughed and waited he came my way  are you going over the gothard i said  yes he replied are you also  yes i said we will go together  so we set off climbing a track up the heathy rocks  he was a pale freckled town youth from basel seventeen years old he was a clerk in a baggagetransport firmgondrand fr√®res i believe he had a weeks holiday in which time he was going to make a big circular walk something like the englishmans but he was accustomed to this mountain walking he belonged to a sportverein manfully he marched in his thick hobnailed boots earnestly he scrambled up the rocks  we were in the crest of the pass broad snowpatched slopes came down from the pure sky the defile was full of stones all bare stones enormous ones as big as a house and small ones pebbles through these the road wound in silence through this upper transcendent desolation wherein was only the sound of the stream sky and snowpatched slopes then the stony rocky bed of the defile full of morning sunshine this was all we were crossing in silence from the northern world to the southern  but he emil was going to take the train back through the tunnel in the evening to resume his circular walk at g√∂schenen  i however was going on over the ridge of the world from the north into the south so i was glad  we climbed up the gradual incline for a long time the slopes above became lower they began to recede the sky was very near we were walking under the sky  then the defile widened out there was an open place before us the very top of the pass also there were low barracks and soldiers we heard firing standing still we saw on the slopes of snow under the radiant blue heaven tiny puffs of smoke then some small black figures crossing the snow patch then another rattle of riflefire rattling dry and unnatural in the upper skyey air between the rocks  das ist sch√∂n said my companion in his simple admiration  h√ºbsch i said  but that would be splendid to be firing up there manoeuvring up in the snow  and he began to tell me how hard a soldiers life was how hard the soldier was drilled  you dont look forward to it i said  oh yes i do i want to be a soldier i want to serve my time  whyi said  for the exercise the life the drilling one becomes strong  do all the swiss want to serve their time in the army i asked  yesthey all want to it is good for every man and it keeps us all together besides it is only for a year for a year it is very good the germans have three yearsthat is too long that is bad  i told him how the soldiers in bavaria hated the military service  yes he said that is true of germans the system is different ours is much better in switzerland a man enjoys his time as a soldier i want to go  so we watched the black dots of soldiers crawling over the high snow listened to the unnatural dry rattle of guns up there  then we were aware of somebody whistling of soldiers yelling down the road we were to come on along the level over the bridge so we marched quickly forward away from the slopes towards the hotel once a monastery that stood in the distance the light was blue and clear on the reedy lakes of this upper place it was a strange desolation of water and bog and rocks and road hedged by the snowy slopes round the rim under the very sky  the soldier was yelling again i could not tell what he said  he says if we dont run we cant come at all said emil  i wont run i said  so we hurried forwards over the bridge where the soldier on guard was standing  do you want to be shot he said angrily as we came up  no thanks i said  emil was very serious  how long should we have had to wait if we hadnt got through now he asked the soldier when we were safely out of danger  till one oclock was the reply  two hours said emil strangely elated we should have had to wait two hours before we could come on he was riled that we didnt run and he laughed with glee  so we marched over the level to the hotel we called in for a glass of hot milk i asked in german but the maid a pert hussy elegant and superior was french she served us with great contempt as two worthless creatures povertystricken it abashed poor emil but we managed to laugh at her this made her very angry in the smokingroom she raised up her voice in french  du lait chaud pour les chameaux  some hot milk for the camels she says i translated for emil he was covered with confusion and youthful anger  but i called to her tapped the table and called  mademoiselle  she appeared flouncingly in the doorway  encore du lait pour les chameaux i said  and she whisked our glasses off the table and flounced out without a word  but she would not come in again with the milk a german girl brought it we laughed and she smiled primly  when we set forth again emil rolled up his sleeves and turned back his shirt from his neck and breast to do the thing thoroughly besides it was midday and the sun was hot and with his bulky pack on his back he suggested the camel of the french maid more than ever  we were on the downward slope only a short way from the hotel and there was the drop the great cleft in the mountains running down from this shallow pot among the peaks  the descent on the south side is much more precipitous and wonderful than the ascent from the north on the south the rocks are craggy and stupendous the little river falls headlong down it is not a stream it is one broken panting cascade far away in the gulley below in the darkness  but on the slopes the sun pours in the road winds down with its tail in its mouth always in endless loops returning on itself the mules that travel upward seem to be treading in a mill  emil took the narrow tracks and like the water we cascaded down leaping from level to level leaping running leaping descending headlong only resting now and again when we came down on to another level of the highroad  having begun we could not help ourselves we were like two stones bouncing down emil was highly elated he waved his thin bare white arms as he leapt his chest grew pink with the exercise now he felt he was doing something that became a member of his sportverein down we went jumping running britching  it was wonderful on this south side so sunny with feathery trees and deep black shadows it reminded me of goethe of the romantic period      kennst du das land wo die citronen bl√ºhen  so we went tumbling down into the south very swiftly along with the tumbling stream but it was very tiring we went at a great pace down the gully between the sheer rocks trees grew in the ledges high over our heads trees grew down below and ever we descended  till gradually the gully opened then opened into a wide valleyhead and we saw airolo away below us the railway emerging from its hole the whole valley like a cornucopia full of sunshine  poor emil was tired more tired than i was and his big boots had hurt his feet in the descent so having come to the open valleyhead we went more gently he had become rather quiet  the head of the valley had that halftamed ancient aspect that reminded me of the romans i could only expect the roman legions to be encamped down there and the white goats feeding on the bushes belonged to a roman camp  but no we saw again the barracks of the swiss soldiery and again we were in the midst of riflefire and manoeuvres but we went evenly tired now and hungry we had nothing to eat  it is strange how different the sundried ancient southern slopes of the world are from the northern slopes it is as if the god pan really had his home among these sunbleached stones and tough sundark trees and one knows it all in ones blood it is pure sundried memory so i was content coming down into airolo  we found the streets were italian the houses sunny outside and dark within like italy there were laurels in the road poor emil was a foreigner all at once he rolled down his shirt sleeves and fastened his shirtneck put on his coat and collar and became a foreigner in his soul pale and strange  i saw a shop with vegetables and grapes a real italian shop a dark cave  quanto costa luva were my first words in the south  sessanta al chilo said the girl  and it was as pleasant as a drink of wine the italian  so emil and i ate the sweet black grapes as we went to the station  he was very poor we went into the thirdclass restaurant at the station he ordered beer and bread and sausage i ordered soup and boiled beef and vegetables  they brought me a great quantity so whilst the girl was serving coffeewithrum to the men at the bar i took another spoon and knife and fork and plates for emil and we had two dinners from my one when the girlshe was a woman of thirtyfivecame back she looked at us sharply i smiled at her coaxingly so she gave a small kindly smile in reply  ja dies ist reizend said emil sotto voce exulting he was very shy but we were curiously happy in that railway restaurant  then we sat very still on the platform and waited for the train it was like italy pleasant and social to wait in the railway station all the world easy and warm in its activity with the sun shining  i decided to take a francs worth of trainjourney so i chose my station it was one franc twenty third class then my train came and emil and i parted he waving to me till i was out of sight i was sorry he had to go back he did so want to venture forth  so i slid for a dozen miles or more sleepily down the ticino valley sitting opposite two fat priests in their feminine black  when i got out at my station i felt for the first time ill at ease why was i getting out at this wayside place on to the great raw highroad i did not know but i set off walking it was nearly teatime  nothing in the world is more ghastly than these italian roads new mechanical belonging to a machine life the old roads are wonderful skilfully aiming their way but these new great roads are desolating more desolating than all the ruins in the world  i walked on and on down the ticino valley towards bellinzona the valley was perhaps beautiful i dont know i can only remember the road it was broad and new and it ran very often beside the railway it ran also by quarries and by occasional factories also through villages and the quality of its sordidness is something that does not bear thinking of a quality that has entered italian life now if it was not there before  here and there where there were quarries or industries great lodginghouses stood naked by the road great grey desolate places and squalid children were playing round the steps and dirty men slouched in everything seemed under a weight  down the road of the ticino valley i felt again my terror of this new world which is coming into being on top of us one always feels it in a suburb on the edge of a town where the land is being broken under the advance of houses but this is nothing in england to the terror one feels on the new italian roads where these great blind cubes of dwellings rise stark from the destroyed earth swarming with a sort of verminous life really verminous purely destructive  it seems to happen when the peasant suddenly leaves his home and becomes a workman then an entire change comes over everywhere life is now a matter of selling oneself to slavework building roads or labouring in quarries or mines or on the railways purposeless meaningless really slavework each integer doing his mere labour and all for no purpose except to have money and to get away from the old system  these italian navvies work all day long their whole life is engaged in the mere brute labour and they are the navvies of the world and whilst they are navvying they are almost shockingly indifferent to their circumstances merely callous to the dirt and foulness  it is as if the whole social form were breaking down and the human element swarmed within the disintegration like maggots in cheese the roads the railways are built the mines and quarries are excavated but the whole organism of life the social organism is slowly crumbling and caving in in a kind of process of dry rot most terrifying to see so that it seems as though we should be left at last with a great system of roads and railways and industries and a world of utter chaos seething upon these fabrications as if we had created a steel framework and the whole body of society were crumbling and rotting in between it is most terrifying to realize and i have always felt this terror upon a new italian highroadmore there than anywhere  the remembrance of the ticino valley is a sort of nightmare to me but it was better when at last in the darkness of night i got into bellinzona in the midst of the town one felt the old organism still living it is only at its extremities that it is falling to pieces as in dry rot  in the morning leaving bellinzona again i went in terror of the new evil highroad with its skirting of huge cubical houses and its seething navvy population only the peasants driving in with fruit were consoling but i was afraid of them the same spirit had set in in them  i was no longer happy in switzerland not even when i was eating great blackberries and looking down at the lago maggiore at locarno lying by the lake the terror of the callous disintegrating process was too strong in me  at a little inn a man was very good to me he went into his garden and fetched me the first grapes and apples and peaches bringing them in amongst leaves and heaping them before me he was italianswiss he had been in a bank in bern now he had retired had bought his paternal home and was a free man he was about fifty years old he spent all his time in his garden his daughter attended to the inn  he talked to me as long as i stayed about italy and switzerland and work and life he was retired he was free but he was only nominally free he had only achieved freedom from labour he knew that the system he had escaped at last persisted and would consume his sons and his grandchildren he himself had more or less escaped back to the old form but as he came with me on to the hillside looking down the highroad at lugano in the distance he knew that his old order was collapsing by a slow process of disintegration  why did he talk to me as if i had any hope as if i represented any positive truth as against this great negative truth that was advancing up the hillside again i was afraid i hastened down the highroad past the houses the grey raw crystals of corruption  i saw a girl with handsome bare legs ankles shining like brass in the sun she was working in a field on the edge of a vineyard i stopped to look at her suddenly fascinated by her handsome naked flesh that shone like brass  then she called out to me in a jargon i could not understand something mocking and challenging and her voice was raucous and challenging i went on afraid  in lugano i stayed at a german hotel i remember sitting on a seat in the darkness by the lake watching the stream of promenaders patrolling the edge of the water under the trees and the lamps i can still see many of their faces english german italian french and it seemed here here in this holidayplace was the quick of the disintegration the dryrot in this dry friable flux of people backwards and forwards on the edge of the lake men and women from the big hotels in evening dress curiously sinister and ordinary visitors and tourists and workmen youths men of the town laughing jeering it was curiously and painfully sinister almost obscene  i sat a long time among them thinking of the girl with her limbs of glowing brass then at last i went up to the hotel and sat in the lounge looking at the papers it was the same here as down below though not so intense the feeling of horror  so i went to bed the hotel was on the edge of a steep declivity i wondered why the whole hills did not slide down in some great natural catastrophe  in the morning i walked along the side of the lake of lugano to where i could take a steamer to ferry me down to the end the lake is not beautiful only picturesque i liked most to think of the romans coming to it  so i steamed down to the lower end of the water when i landed and went along by a sort of railway i saw a group of men suddenly they began to whoop and shout they were hanging on to an immense pale bullock which was slung up to be shod and it was lunging and kicking with terrible energy it was strange to see that mass of pale softlooking flesh working with such violent frenzy convulsed with violent active frenzy whilst men and women hung on to it with ropes hung on and weighed it down but again it scattered some of them in its terrible convulsion human beings scattered into the road the whole place was covered with hot dung and when the bullock began to lunge again the men set up a howl half of triumph half of derision  i went on not wanting to see i went along a very dusty road but it was not so terrifying this road perhaps it was older  in dreary little chiasso i drank coffee and watched the come and go through the customs the swiss and the italian customs officials had their offices within a few yards of each other and everybody must stop i went in and showed my rucksack to the italian then i mounted a tram and went to the lake of como  in the tram were dressedup women fashionable but businesslike they had come by train to chiasso or else had been shopping in the town  when we came to the terminus a young miss dismounting before me left behind her parasol i had been conscious of my dusty grimy appearance as i sat in the tram i knew they thought me a workman on the roads however i forgot that when it was time to dismount  pardon mademoiselle i said to the young miss she turned and withered me with a rather overdone contemptbourgeoise i said to myself as i looked at hervous avez laiss√© votre parasol  she turned and with a rapacious movement darted upon her parasol how her soul was in her possessions i stood and watched her then she went into the road and under the trees haughty a demoiselle she had on white kid boots  i thought of the lake of como what i had thought of lugano it must have been wonderful when the romans came there now it is all villas i think only the sunrise is still wonderful sometimes  i took the steamer down to como and slept in a vast old stone cavern of an inn a remarkable place with rather nice people in the morning i went out the peace and the bygone beauty of the cathedral created the glow of the great past and in the marketplace they were selling chestnuts wholesale great heaps of bright brown chestnuts and sacks of chestnuts and peasants very eager selling and buying i thought of como it must have been wonderful even a hundred years ago now it is cosmopolitan the cathedral is like a relic a museum object everywhere stinks of mechanical moneypleasure i dared not risk walking to milan i took a train and there in milan sitting in the cathedral square on saturday afternoon drinking bitter campari and watching the swarm of italian citymen drink and talk vivaciously i saw that here the life was still vivid here the process of disintegration was vigorous and centred in a multiplicity of mechanical activities that engage the human mind as well as the body but always there was the same purpose stinking in it all the mechanizing the perfect mechanizing of human life
