all that i have written  w b y     preface   sometimes when i remember a relative that i have been fond of or a strange incident of the past i wander here and there till i have somebody to talk to presently i notice that my listener is bored but now that i have written it out i may even begin to forget it all in any case because one can always close a book my friend need not be bored  i have changed nothing to my knowledge and yet it must be that i have changed many things without my knowledge for i am writing after so many years and have consulted neither friend nor letter nor old newspaper and describe what comes oftenest into my memory  i say this fearing that some surviving friend of my youth may remember something in a different shape and be offended with my book  christmas day 1914     reveries over childhood and youth   my first memories are fragmentary and isolated and contemporaneous as though one remembered vaguely some early day of the seven days it seems as if time had not yet been created for all are connected with emotion and place and without sequence  i remember sitting upon somebodys knee looking out of a window at a wall covered with cracked and falling plaster but what wall i do not remember and being told that some relation once lived there i am looking out of another window in london it is at fitzroy road some boys are playing in the road and among them a boy in uniform a telegraph boy perhaps when i ask who the boy is a servant tells me that he is going to blow the town up and i go to sleep in terror  after that come memories of sligo where i live with my grandparents i am sitting on the ground looking at a mastless toy boat with the paint rubbed and scratched and i say to myself in great melancholy it is further away than it used to be and while i am saying it i am looking at a long scratch in the stern for it is especially the scratch which is further away then one day at dinner my greatuncle william middleton says we should not make light of the troubles of children they are worse than ours because we can see the end of our trouble and they can never see any end and i feel grateful for i know that i am very unhappy and have often said to myself when you grow up never talk as grownup people do of the happiness of childhood i may have already had the night of misery when having prayed for several days that i might die i had begun to be afraid that i was dying and prayed that i might live there was no reason for my unhappiness nobody was unkind and my grandmother has still after so many years my gratitude and my reverence the house was so big that there was always a room to hide in and i had a red pony and a garden where i could wander and there were two dogs to follow at my heels one white with some black spots on his head and the other with long black hair all over him i used to think about god and fancy that i was very wicked and one day when i threw a stone and hit a duck in the yard by mischance and broke its wing i was full of wonder when i was told that the duck would be cooked for dinner and that i should not be punished  some of my misery was loneliness and some of it fear of old william pollexfen my grandfather he was never unkind and i cannot remember that he ever spoke harshly to me but it was the custom to fear and admire him he had won the freedom of some spanish city for saving life but was so silent that his wife never knew it till he was near eighty and then from the chance visit of some old sailor she asked him if it was true and he said it was true but she knew him too well to question and his old shipmate had left the town she too had the habit of fear we knew that he had been in many parts of the world for there was a great scar on his hand made by a whalinghook and in the diningroom was a cabinet with bits of coral in it and a jar of water from the jordan for the baptising of his children and chinese pictures upon ricepaper and an ivory walkingstick from india that came to me after his death he had great physical strength and had the reputation of never ordering a man to do anything he would not do himself he owned many sailing ships and once when a captain just come to anchor at rosses point reported something wrong with the rudder had sent a messenger to say send a man down to find out whats wrong the crew all refuse was the answer go down yourself was my grandfathers order and when that was not obeyed he dived from the main deck all the neighbourhood lined along the pebbles of the shore he came up with his skin torn but well informed about the rudder he had a violent temper and kept a hatchet at his bedside for burglars and would knock a man down instead of going to law and i once saw him hunt a group of men with a horsewhip he had no relation for he was an only child and being solitary and silent he had few friends he corresponded with campbell of islay who had befriended him and his crew after a shipwreck and captain webb the first man who had swum the channel and who was drowned swimming the niagara rapids had been a mate in his employ and became a close friend that is all the friends i can remember and yet he was so looked up to and admired that when he returned from taking the waters at bath his men would light bonfires along the railway line for miles while his partner william middleton whose father after the great famine had attended the sick for weeks and taken cholera from a man he carried in his arms into his own house and died of it and was himself civil to everybody and a cleverer man than my grandfather came and went without notice i think i confused my grandfather with god for i remember in one of my attacks of melancholy praying that he might punish me for my sins and i was shocked and astonished when a daring little girla cousin i thinkhaving waited under a group of trees in the avenue where she knew he would pass near four oclock on the way to his dinner said to him if i were you and you were a little girl i would give you a doll  yet for all my admiration and alarm neither i nor anyone else thought it wrong to outwit his violence or his rigour and his lack of suspicion and a certain helplessness made that easy while it stirred our affection when i must have been still a very little boy seven or eight years old perhaps an uncle called me out of bed one night to ride the five or six miles to rosses point to borrow a railwaypass from a cousin my grandfather had one but thought it dishonest to let another use it but the cousin was not so particular i was let out through a gate that opened upon a little lane beside the garden away from earshot of the house and rode delighted through the moonlight and awoke my cousin in the small hours by tapping on his window with a whip i was home again by two or three in the morning and found the coachman waiting in the little lane my grandfather would not have thought such an adventure possible for every night at eight he believed that the stableyard was locked and he knew that he was brought the key some servant had once got into trouble at night and so he had arranged that they should all be locked in he never knew what everybody else in the house knew that for all the ceremonious bringing of the key the gate was never locked  even today when i read king lear his image is always before me and i often wonder if the delight in passionate men in my plays and in my poetry is more than his memory he must have been ignorant though i could not judge him in my childhood for he had run away to sea when a boy gone to sea through the hawsehole as he phrased it and i can but remember him with two bookshis bible and falconers shipwreck a little greencovered book that lay always upon his table he belonged to some younger branch of an old cornish family his father had been in the army had retired to become an owner of sailing ships and an engraving of some old family place my grandfather thought should have been his hung next a painted coat of arms in the little back parlour his mother had been a wexford woman and there was a tradition that his family had been linked with ireland for generations and once had their share in the old spanish trade with galway he had a good deal of pride and disliked his neighbours whereas his wife a middleton was gentle and patient and did many charities in the little back parlour among frieze coats and shawled heads and every night when she saw him asleep went the round of the house alone with a candle to make certain there was no burglar in danger of the hatchet she was a true lover of her garden and before the care of her house had grown upon her would choose some favourite among her flowers and copy it upon ricepaper i saw some of her handiwork the other day and i wondered at the delicacy of form and colour and at a handling that may have needed a magnifying glass it was so minute i can remember no other pictures but the chinese paintings and some coloured prints of battles in the crimea upon the wall of a passage and the painting of a ship at the passage end darkened by time  my grownup uncles and aunts my grandfathers many sons and daughters came and went and almost all they said or did has faded from my memory except a few harsh words that convince me by a vividness out of proportion to their harshness that all were habitually kind and considerate the youngest of my uncles was stout and humorous and had a tongue of leather over the keyhole of his door to keep the draught out and another whose bedroom was at the end of a long stone passage had a model turret ship in a glass case he was a clever man and had designed the sligo quays but was now going mad and inventing a vessel of war that could not be sunk his pamphlet explained because of a hull of solid wood only six months ago my sister awoke dreaming that she held a wingless seabird in her arms and presently she heard that he had died in his madhouse for a seabird is the omen that announces the death or danger of a pollexfen an uncle george pollexfen afterwards astrologer and mystic and my dear friend came but seldom from ballina once to a race meeting with two postillions dressed in green and there was that younger uncle who had sent me for the railwaypass he was my grandmothers favourite and had the servants told me been sent away from school for taking a crowbar to a bully  i can only remember my grandmother punishing me once i was playing in the kitchen and a servant in horseplay pulled my shirt out of my trousers in front just as my grandmother came in and i accused of i knew not what childish indecency was given my dinner in a room by myself but i was always afraid of my uncles and aunts and once the uncle who had taken the crowbar to the bully found me eating lunch which my grandmother had given me and reproved me for it and made me ashamed we breakfasted at nine and dined at four and it was considered selfindulgent to eat anything between meals and once an aunt told me that i had reined in my pony and struck it at the same moment that i might show it off as i rode through the town and i because i had been accused of what i thought a very dark crime had a night of misery indeed i remember little of childhood but its pain i have grown happier with every year of life as though gradually conquering something in myself for certainly my miseries were not made by others but were a part of my own mind   ii  one day someone spoke to me of the voice of the conscience and as i brooded over the phrase i came to think that my soul because i did not hear an articulate voice was lost i had some wretched days until being alone with one of my aunts i heard a whisper in my ear what a tease you are at first i thought my aunt must have spoken but when i found she had not i concluded it was the voice of my conscience and was happy again from that day the voice has come to me at moments of crisis but now it is a voice in my head that is sudden and startling it does not tell me what to do but often reproves me it will say perhaps that is unjust of some thought and once when i complained that a prayer had not been heard it said you have been helped i had a little flagstaff in front of the house and a red flag with the union jack in the corner every night i pulled my flag down and folded it up and laid it on a shelf in my bedroom and one morning before breakfast i found it though i knew i had folded it up the night before knotted round the bottom of the flagstaff so that it was touching the grass i must have heard the servants talking of the faeries for i concluded at once that a faery had tied those four knots and from that on believed that one had whispered in my ear i have been told though i do not remember it myself that i saw whether once or many times i do not know a supernatural bird in the corner of the room once too i was driving with my grandmother a little after dark close to the channel that runs for some five miles from sligo to the sea and my grandmother showed me the red light of an outwardbound steamer and told me that my grandfather was on board and that night in my sleep i screamed out and described the steamers wreck the next morning my grandfather arrived on a blind horse found for him by grateful passengers he had as i remember the story been asleep when the captain aroused him to say they were going on the rocks he said have you tried sail on her and judging from some answer that the captain was demoralised took over the command and when the ship could not be saved got the crew and passengers into the boats his own boat was upset and he saved himself and some others by swimming some women had drifted ashore buoyed up by their crinolines i was not so much afraid of the sea as of that terrible man with his oar was the comment of a schoolmaster who was among the survivors eight men were however drowned and my grandfather suffered from that memory at intervals all his life and if asked to read family prayers never read anything but the shipwreck of st paul  i remember the dogs more clearly than anyone except my grandfather and grandmother the black hairy one had no tail because it had been sliced off if i was told the truth by a railway train i think i followed at their heels more than they did at mine and that their journeys ended at a rabbitwarren behind the garden and sometimes they had savage fights the black hairy dog being well protected by its hair suffering least i can remember one so savage that the white dog would not take his teeth out of the black dogs hair till the coachman hung them over the side of a waterbutt one outside and one in the water my grandmother once told the coachman to cut the hair like a lions hair and after a long consultation with the stableboy he cut it all over the head and shoulders and left it on the lower part of the body the dog disappeared for a few days and i did not doubt that its heart was broken there was a large garden behind the house full of appletrees with flowerbeds and grassplots in the centre and two figureheads of ships one among the strawberry plants under a wall covered with fruit trees and one among the flowers the one among the flowers was a white lady in flowing robes while the other a stalwart man in uniform had been taken from a threemasted ship of my grandfathers called the russia and there was a belief among the servants that the stalwart man represented the tsar and had been presented by the tsar himself the avenue or as they say in england the drive that went from the hall door through a clump of big trees to an insignificant gate and a road bordered by broken and dirty cottages was but two or three hundred yards and i often thought it should have been made to wind more for i judged peoples social importance mainly by the length of their avenues this idea may have come from the stableboy for he was my principal friend he had a book of orange rhymes and the days when we read them together in the hayloft gave me the pleasure of rhyme for the first time later on i can remember being told when there was a rumour of a fenian rising that rifles had been served out to the orangemen and presently when i had begun to dream of my future life i thought i would like to die fighting the fenians i was to build a very fast and beautiful ship and to have under my command a company of young men who were always to be in training like athletes and so become as brave and handsome as the young men in the storybooks and there was to be a big battle on the seashore near rosses and i was to be killed i collected little pieces of wood and piled them up in a corner of the yard and there was an old rotten log in a distant field i often went to look at because i thought it would go a long way in the making of the ship all my dreams were of ships and one day a sea captain who had come to dine with my grandfather put a hand on each side of my head and lifted me up to show me africa and another day a sea captain pointed to the smoke from the pern mill on the quays rising up beyond the trees of the lawn as though it came from the mountain and asked me if ben bulben was a burning mountain  once every few months i used to go to rosses point or ballisodare to see another little boy who had a piebald pony that had once been in a circus and sometimes forgot where it was and went round and round he was george middleton son of my greatuncle william middleton old middleton had bought land then believed a safe investment at ballisodare and at rosses and spent the winter at ballisodare and the summer at rosses the middleton and pollexfen flour mills were at ballisodare and a great salmon weir rapids and a waterfall but it was more often at rosses that i saw my cousin we rowed in the river mouth or were taken sailing in a heavy slow schooner yacht or in a big ships boat that had been rigged and decked there were great cellars under the house for it had been a smugglers house a hundred years before and sometimes three loud raps would come upon the drawing room window at sundown setting all the dogs barking some dead smuggler giving his accustomed signal one night i heard them very distinctly and my cousins often heard them and later on my sister a pilot had told me that after dreaming three times of a treasure buried in my uncles garden he had climbed the wall in the middle of the night and begun to dig but grew disheartened because there was so much earth i told somebody what he had said and was told that it was well he did not find it for it was guarded by a spirit that looked like a flat iron at ballisodare there was a cleft among the rocks that i passed with terror because i believed that a murderous monster lived there that made a buzzing sound like a bee  it was through the middletons perhaps that i got my interest in country stories and certainly the first faery stories that i heard were in the cottages about their houses the middletons took the nearest for friends and were always in and out of the cottages of pilots and of tenants they were practical always doing something with their hands making boats feeding chickens and without ambition one of them had designed a steamer many years before my birth and long after i had grown to manhood one could hear itit had some sort of obsolete enginemany miles off wheezing in the channel like an asthmatic person it had been built on the lake and dragged through the town by many horses stopping before the windows where my mother was learning her lessons and plunging the whole school into candlelight for five days and was still patched and repatched mainly because it was believed to be a bringer of good luck it had been called after the betrothed of its builder janet long corrupted into the more familiar jennet and the betrothed died in my youth having passed her eightieth year and been her husbands plague because of the violence of her temper another who was but a year or two older than myself used to shock me by running after hens to know by their feel if they were on the point of dropping an egg they let their houses decay and the glass fall from the windows of their greenhouses but one among them at any rate had the second sight they were liked but had not the pride and reserve the sense of decorum and order the instinctive playing before themselves that belongs to those who strike the popular imagination  sometimes my grandmother would bring me to see some old sligo gentlewoman whose garden ran down to the river ending there in a low wall full of wallflowers and i would sit up upon my chair very bored while my elders ate their seedcake and drank their sherry my walks with the servants were more interesting sometimes we would pass a little fat girl and a servant persuaded me to write her a loveletter and the next time she passed she put her tongue out but it was the servants stories that interested me at such and such a corner a man had got a shilling from a drill sergeant by standing in a barrel and had then rolled out of it and shown his crippled legs and in such and such a house an old woman had hid herself under the bed of her guests an officer and his wife and on hearing them abuse her beaten them with a broomstick all the wellknown families had their grotesque or tragic or romantic legends and i often said to myself how terrible it would be to go away and die where nobody would know my story years afterwards when i was ten or twelve years old and in london i would remember sligo with tears and when i began to write it was there i hoped to find my audience next to merville where i lived was another treesurrounded house where i sometimes went to see a little boy who stayed there occasionally with his grandmother whose name i forget and who seemed to me kind and friendly though when i went to see her in my thirteenth or fourteenth year i discovered that she only cared for very little boys when the visitors called i hid in the hayloft and lay hidden behind the great heap of hay while a servant was calling my name in the yard  i do not know how old i was for all these events seem at the same distance when i was made drunk i had been out yachting with an uncle and my cousins and it had come on very rough i had lain on deck between the mast and the bowsprit and a wave had burst over me and i had seen green water over my head i was very proud and very wet when we got into rosses again i was dressed up in an older boys clothes so that the trousers came down below my boots and a pilot gave me a little raw whiskey i drove home with the uncle on an outside car and was so pleased with the strange state in which i found myself that for all my uncle could do i cried to every passerby that i was drunk and went on crying it through the town and everywhere until i was put to bed by my grandmother and given something to drink that tasted of black currants and so fell asleep   iii  some six miles off towards ben bulben and beyond the channel as we call the tidal river between sligo and the rosses and on top of a hill there was a little square twostoreyed house covered with creepers and looking out upon a garden where the box borders were larger than any i had ever seen and where i saw for the first time the crimson streak of the gladiolus and awaited its blossom with excitement under one gable a dark thicket of small trees made a shutin mysterious place where one played and believed that something was going to happen my greataunt micky lived there micky was not her right name for she was mary yeats and her father had been my greatgrandfather john yeats who had been rector of drumcliffe a few miles further off and died in 1847 she was a spare highcoloured elderly woman and had the oldest looking cat i had ever seen for its hair had grown into matted locks of yellowy white she farmed and had one old manservant but could not have farmed at all had not neighbouring farmers helped to gather in the crops in return for the loan of her farm implements and out of respect for the family for as johnny macgurk the sligo barber said to me the yeatss were always very respectable she was full of family history all her dinner knives were pointed like daggers through much cleaning and there was a little james the first creamjug with the yeats motto and crest and on her diningroom mantlepiece a beautiful silver cup that had belonged to my greatgreatgrandfather who had married a certain mary butler it had upon it the butler crest and had been already old at the date 1534 when the initials of some bride and bridegroom were engraved under the lip all its history for generations was rolled up inside it upon a piece of paper yellow with age until some caller took the paper to light his pipe another family of yeats a widow and her two children on whom i called sometimes with my grandmother lived near in a long low cottage and owned a very fierce turkeycock that did battle with their visitors and some miles away lived the secretary to the grand jury and land agent my greatuncle mat yeats and his big family of boys and girls but i think it was only in later years that i came to know them well i do not think any of these liked the pollexfens who were well off and seemed to them purseproud whereas they themselves had come down in the world i remember them as very wellbred and very religious in the evangelical way and thinking a good deal of aunt mickys old histories there had been among our ancestors a kings county soldier one of marlboroughs generals and when his nephew came to dine he gave him boiled pork and when the nephew said he disliked boiled pork he had asked him to dine again and promised him something he would like better however he gave him boiled pork again and the nephew took the hint in silence the other day as i was coming home from america i met one of his descendants whose family has not another discoverable link with ours and he too knew the boiled pork story and nothing else we have the generals portrait and he looks very fine in his armour and his long curly wig and underneath it after his name are many honours that have left no tradition among us were we country people we could have summarised his life in a legend  another ancestor or greatuncle had chased the united irishmen for a fortnight fallen into their hands and been hanged and the notorious major sirr who betrayed the brothers shears taking their children upon his knees to question them if the tale does not lie had been godfather to several of my greatgreatgrandfathers children while to make a balance my greatgrandfather had been robert emmetts friend and been suspected and imprisoned though but for a few hours a greatuncle had been governor of penang and led the forlorn hope at the taking of rangoon and an uncle of a still older generation had fallen at new orleans in 1813 and even in the last generation there had been lives of some power and pleasure an old man who had entertained many famous people in his 18th century house where battlement and tower showed the influence of horace walpole had but lately after losing all his money drowned himself first taking off his rings and chain and watch as became a collector of many beautiful things and once to remind us of more passionate life a gunboat put into rosses commanded by the illegitimate son of some greatuncle or other now that i can look at their miniatures turning them over to find the name of soldier or lawyer or castle official and wondering if they cared for good books or good music i am delighted with all that joins my life to those who had power in ireland or with those anywhere that were good servants and poor bargainers but i cared nothing as a child for mickys tales i could see my grandfathers ships come up the bay or the river and his sailors treated me with deference and a ships carpenter made and mended my toy boats and i thought that nobody could be so important as my grandfather perhaps too it is only now that i can value those more gentle natures so unlike his passion and violence an old sligo priest has told me how my greatgrandfather john yeats always went into his kitchen rattling the keys so much did he fear finding some one doing wrong and how when the agent of the great landowner of his parish brought him from cottage to cottage to bid the women send their children to the protestant school and all had promised till they came to one who cried child of mine will never darken your door he had said thank you my woman you are the first honest woman i have met today my uncle mat yeats the land agent had once waited up every night for a week to catch some boys who stole his apples and when he caught them had given them sixpence and told them not to do it again perhaps it is only fancy or the softening touch of the miniaturist that makes me discover in their faces some courtesy and much gentleness two 18th century faces interest me the most one that of a greatgreatgrandfather for both have under their powdered curling wigs a halffeminine charm and as i look at them i discover a something clumsy and heavy in myself yet it was a yeats who spoke the only eulogy that turns my head we have ideas and no passions but by marriage with a pollexfen we have given a tongue to the sea cliffs  among the miniatures there is a larger picture an admirable drawing by i know not what master that is too harsh and merry for its company he was a connection and close friend of my greatgrandmother corbet and though we spoke of him as uncle beattie in our childhood no blood relation my greatgrandmother who died at ninetythree had many memories of him he was the friend of goldsmith  was accustomed to boast clergyman though he was that he belonged to a huntclub of which every member but himself had been hanged or transported for treason and that it was not possible to ask him a question he could not reply to with a perfectly appropriate blasphemy or indecency   iv  because i had found it hard to attend to anything less interesting than my thoughts i was difficult to teach several of my uncles and aunts had tried to teach me to read and because they could not and because i was much older than children who read easily had come to think as i have learnt since that i had not all my faculties but for an accident they might have thought it for a long time my father was staying in the house and never went to church and that gave me the courage to refuse to set out one sunday morning i was often devout my eyes filling with tears at the thought of god and of my own sins but i hated church my grandmother tried to teach me to put my toes first to the ground because i suppose i stumped on my heels and that took my pleasure out of the way there later on when i had learnt to read i took pleasure in the words of the hymn but never understood why the choir took three times as long as i did in getting to the end and the part of the service i liked the sermon and passages of the apocalypse and ecclesiastes were no compensation for all the repetitions and for the fatigue of so much standing my father said if i would not go to church he would teach me to read i think now that he wanted to make me go for my grandmothers sake and could think of no other way he was an angry and impatient teacher and flung the reading book at my head and next sunday i decided to go to church my father had however got interested in teaching me and only shifted the lesson to a weekday till he had conquered my wandering mind my first clear image of him was fixed on my imagination i believe but a few days before the first lesson he had just arrived from london and was walking up and down the nursery floor he had a very black beard and hair and one cheek bulged out with a fig that was there to draw the pain out of a bad tooth one of the nurses a nurse had come from london with my brothers and sisters said to the other that a live frog she had heard was best of all then i was sent to a dame school kept by an old woman who stood us in rows and had a long stick like a billiard cue to get at the back rows my father was still at sligo when i came back from my first lesson and asked me what i had been taught i said i had been taught to sing and he said sing then and i sang    little drops of water   little grains of sand   make the mighty ocean   and the pleasant land  high up in my head so my father wrote to the old woman that i was never to be taught to sing again and afterwards other teachers were told the same thing presently my eldest sister came on a long visit and she and i went to a little twostoreyed house in a poor street where an old gentlewoman taught us spelling and grammar when we had learned our lesson well we were allowed to look at a sword presented to her father who had led troops in india or china and to spell out a long complimentary inscription on the silver scabbard as we walked to her house or home again we held a large umbrella before us both gripping the handle and guiding ourselves by looking out of a round hole gnawed in the cover by a mouse when i had got beyond books of one syllable i began to spend my time in a room called the library though there were no books in it that i can remember except some old novels i never opened and a many volumed encyclopaedia published towards the end of the 18th century i read this encyclopaedia a great deal and can remember a long passage considering whether fossil wood despite its appearance might not be only a curiously shaped stone  my fathers unbelief had set me thinking about the evidences of religion and i weighed the matter perpetually with great anxiety for i did not think i could live without religion all my religious emotions were i think connected with clouds and cloudy glimpses of luminous sky perhaps because of some bible picture of gods speaking to abraham or the like at least i can remember the sight moving me to tears one day i got a decisive argument for belief a cow was about to calve and i went to the field where the cow was with some farmhands who carried a lantern and next day i heard that the cow had calved in the early morning i asked everybody how calves were born and because nobody would tell me made up my mind that nobody knew they were the gift of god that much was certain but it was plain that nobody had ever dared to see them come and children must come in the same way i made up my mind that when i was a man i would wait up till calf or child had come i was certain there would be a cloud and a burst of light and god would bring the calf in the cloud out of the light that thought made me content until a boy of twelve or thirteen who had come on a visit for the day sat beside me in a hayloft and explained all the mechanism of sex he had learnt all about it from an elder boy whose pathic he was to use a term he would not have understood and his description given as i can see now as if he were telling of any other fact of physical life made me miserable for weeks after the first impression wore off i began to doubt if he had spoken truth but one day i discovered a passage in the encyclopaedia though i only partly understood its long words that confirmed what he had said i did not know enough to be shocked at his relation to the elder boy but it was the first breaking of the dream of childhood  my realization of death came when my father and mother and my two brothers and my two sisters were on a visit i was in the library when i heard feet running past and heard somebody say in the passage that my younger brother robert had died he had been ill for some days a little later my sister and i sat at the table very happy drawing ships with their flags halfmast high we must have heard or seen that the ships in the harbour had their flags at halfmast next day at breakfast i heard people telling how my mother and the servant had heard the banshee crying the night before he died it must have been after this that i told my grandmother i did not want to go with her when she went to see old bedridden people because they would soon die   v  at length when i was eight or nine an aunt said to me you are going to london here you are somebody there you will be nobody at all i knew at the time that her words were a blow at my father not at me but it was some years before i knew her reason she thought so able a man as my father could have found out some way of painting more popular pictures if he had set his mind to it and that it was wrong of him to spend every evening at his club she had mistaken for what she would have considered a place of wantonness heatherleys art school  my mother and brother and sister were at sligo perhaps when i was sent to england for my father and i and a group of landscape painters lodged at burnham beeches with an old mr and mrs earle my father was painting the first big pond you come to if you have driven from slough through farnham royal he began it in spring and painted all through the year the picture changing with the seasons and gave it up unfinished when he had painted the snow upon the heathcovered banks he is never satisfied and can never make himself say that any picture is finished in the evening he heard me my lessons or read me some novel of fenimore coopers i found delightful adventures in the woodsone day a blind worm and an adder fighting in a green hollow and sometimes mrs earle would be afraid to tidy the room because i had put a bottle full of newts on the mantlepiece now and then a boy from a farm on the other side of the road threw a pebble at my window at daybreak and he and i went fishing in the big second pond now and then another farmers boy and i shot sparrows with an old pepper box revolver and the boy would roast them on a string there was an old horse one of the painters called the scaffolding and sometimes a son of old earles drove with me to slough and once to windsor and at windsor we made our lunch of cold sausages bought from a public house i did not know what it was to be alone for i could wander in pleasant alarm through the enclosed parts then very large or round some pond imagining ships going in and out among the reeds and thinking of sligo or of strange seafaring adventures in the fine ship i should launch when i grew up i had always a lesson to learn before night and that was a continual misery for i could very rarely with so much to remember set my thoughts upon it and then only in fear one day my father told me that a painter had said i was very thickskinned and did not mind what was said to me and i could not understand how anybody could be so unjust it made me wretched to be idle but one could not help it i was once surprised and shocked all but my father and myself had been to london and kennedy and farrar and page i remember the names vaguely arrived laughing and talking one of them had carried off a card of texts from the waiting room of the station and hung it up on the wall i thought he has stolen it but my father and all made it a theme of merry conversation  then i returned to sligo for a few weeks as i was to do once or twice in every year for years and after that we settled in london perhaps my mother and the other children had been there all the time for i remember my father now and again going to london the first house we lived in was close to burne joness house at north end but we moved after a year or two to bedford park at north end we had a pear tree in the garden and plenty of pears but the pears used to be full of maggots and almost opposite lived a schoolmaster called oneill and when a little boy told me that the schoolmasters greatgrandfather had been a king i did not doubt it i was sitting against the hedge and iron railing of some villagarden there when i heard one boy say to another it was something wrong with my liver that gave me such a dark complexion and that i could not live more than a year i said to myself a year is a very long time one can do such a lot of things in a year and put it out of my head when my father gave me a holiday and later when i had a holiday from school i took my schooner boat to the round pond sailing it very commonly against the two cutter yachts of an old naval officer he would sometimes look at the ducks and say i would like to take that fellow home for my dinner and he sang me a sailors song about a coffin ship which left sligo after the great famine that made me feel very important the servants at sligo had told me the story when she was moved from the berth she had lain in an unknown dead mans body had floated up a very evil omen and my grandfather who was lloyds agent had condemned her but she slipped out in the night the pond had its own legends and a boy who had seen a certain model steamer burned to the waters edge was greatly valued as a friend there was a little boy i was kind to because i knew his father had done something disgraceful though i did not know what it was years before i discovered that his father was but the maker of certain popular statues many of which are now in public places i had heard my fathers friends speak of him sometimes my sister came with me and we would look into all the sweet shops  toy shops on our way home especially into one opposite holland house because there was a cutter yacht made of sugar in the window and we drank at all the fountains once a stranger spoke to us and bought us sweets and came with us almost to our door we asked him to come in and told him our fathers name he would not come in but laughed and said oh that is the painter who scrapes out every day what he painted the day before a poignant memory came upon me the other day while i was passing the drinkingfountain near holland park for there i and my sister had spoken together of our longing for sligo and our hatred of london i know we were both very close to tears and remember with wonder for i had never known anyone that cared for such momentoes that i longed for a sod of earth from some field i knew something of sligo to hold in my hand it was some old race instinct like that of a savage for we had been brought up to laugh at all display of emotion yet it was our mother who would have thought its display a vulgarity who kept alive that love she would spend hours listening to stories or telling stories of the pilots and fishing people of rosses point or of her own sligo girlhood and it was always assumed between her and us that sligo was more beautiful than other places i can see now that she had great depth of feeling that she was her fathers daughter my memory of what she was like in those days has grown very dim but i think her sense of personality her desire of any life of her own had disappeared in her care for us and in much anxiety about money i always see her sewing or knitting in spectacles and wearing some plain dress yet ten years ago when i was in san francisco an old cripple came to see me who had left sligo before her marriage he came to tell me he said that my mother had been the most beautiful girl in sligo   illustration mrs yeats from a drawing by j b yeats made in 1867   the only lessons i had ever learned were those my father taught me for he terrified me by descriptions of my moral degradation and he humiliated me by my likeness to disagreeable people but presently i was sent to school at hammersmith it was a gothic building of yellow brick a large hall full of desks some small classrooms and a separate house for boarders all built perhaps in 1840 or 1850 i thought it an ancient building and that it had belonged to the founder of the school lord godolphin who was romantic to me because there was a novel about him i never read the novel but i thought only romantic people were put in books on one side there was a piano factory of yellow brick upon two sides half finished rows of little shops and villas all yellow brick and on the fourth side outside the wall of our playing field a brickfield of cinders and piles of halfburned yellow bricks all the names and faces of my schoolfellows have faded from me except one name without a face and the face and name of one friend mainly no doubt because it was all so long ago but partly because i only seem to remember things that have mixed themselves up with scenes that have some quality to bring them again and again before the memory for some days as i walked homeward along the hammersmith road i told myself that whatever i most cared for had been taken away i had found a small greencovered book given to my father by a dublin man of science it gave an account of the strange sea creatures the man of science had discovered among the rocks at howth or dredged out of dublin bay it had long been my favourite book and when i read it i believed that i was growing very wise but now i should have no time for it nor for my own thoughts every moment would be taken up learning or saying lessons or walking between school and home four times a day for i came home in the middle of the day for dinner but presently i forgot my trouble absorbed in two things i had never known companionship and enmity after my first days lesson a circle of boys had got around me in a playing field and asked me questions whos your father what does he do how much money has he presently a boy said something insulting i had never struck anybody or been struck and now all in a minute without any intention upon my side but as if i had been a doll moved by a string i was hitting at the boys within reach and being hit after that i was called names for being irish and had many fights and never for years got the better of any one of them for i was delicate and had no muscles sometimes however i found means of retaliation even of aggression there was a boy with a big stride much feared by little boys and finding him alone in the playing field i went up to him and said rise upon sugaun and sink upon gad what does that mean he said rise upon hayleg and sink upon straw i answered and told him that in ireland the sergeant tied straw and hay to the ankles of a stupid recruit to show him the difference between his legs my ears were boxed and when i complained to my friends they said i had brought it upon myself and that i deserved all i got i probably dared myself to other feats of a like sort for i did not think english people intelligent or wellbehaved unless they were artists everyone i knew well in sligo despised nationalists and catholics but all disliked england with a prejudice that had come down perhaps from the days of the irish parliament i knew stories to the discredit of england and took them all seriously my mother had met some english woman who did not like dublin because the legs of the men were too straight and at sligo as everybody knew an englishman had once said to a cardriver if you people were not so lazy you would pull down the mountain and spread it out over the sand and that would give you acres of good fields at sligo there is a wide river mouth and at ebb tide most of it is dry sand but all sligo knew that in some way i cannot remember it was the spreading of the tide over the sand that left the narrow channel fit for shipping at any rate the carman had gone chuckling all over sligo with his tale people would tell it to prove that englishmen were always grumbling they grumble about their dinners and everythingthere was an englishman who wanted to pull down knocknarea and so on my mother had shown them to me kissing at railway stations and taught me to feel disgust at their lack of reserve and my father told how my grandfather william yeats who had died before i was born when he came home to his rectory in county down from an english visit spoke of some man he had met on a coach road who englishmanlike told him all his affairs my father explained that an englishman generally believed that his private affairs did him credit while an irishman being poor and probably in debt had no such confidence i however did not believe in this explanation my sligo nurses who had in all likelihood the irish catholic political hatred had never spoken well of any englishman  once when walking in the town of sligo i had turned to look after an english man and woman whose clothes attracted me the man i remember had gray clothes and kneebreeches and the woman a gray dress and my nurse had said contemptuously towrows perhaps before my time there had been some english song with the burden tow row row and everybody had told me that english people ate skates and even dogfish and i myself had only just arrived in england when i saw an old man put marmalade in his porridge i was divided from all those boys not merely by the anecdotes that are everywhere perhaps a chief expression of the distrust of races but because our mental images were different i read their boys books and they excited me but if i read of some english victory i did not believe that i read of my own people they thought of cressy and agincourt and the union jack and were all very patriotic and i without those memories of limerick and the yellow ford that would have strengthened an irish catholic thought of mountain and lake of my grandfather and of ships antiirish feeling was running high for the land league had been founded and landlords had been shot and i who had no politics was yet full of pride for it is romantic to live in a dangerous country  i daresay i thought the rough manners of a cheap school as my grandfather yeats had those of a chance companion typical of all england at any rate i had a harassed life  got many a black eye and had many outbursts of grief and rage once a boy the son of a great bohemian glassmaker and who was older than the rest of us and had been sent out of his country because of a love affair beat a boy for me because we were both foreigners and a boy who grew to be the school athlete and my chief friend beat a great many his are the face and name that i rememberhis name was of huguenot origin and his face like his gaunt and lithe body had something of the american indian in colour and lineament  i was very much afraid of the other boys and that made me doubt myself for the first time when i had gathered pieces of wood in the corner for my great ship i was confident that i could keep calm among the storms and die fighting when the great battle came but now i was ashamed of my lack of courage for i wanted to be like my grandfather who thought so little of danger that he had jumped overboard in the bay of biscay after an old hat i was very much afraid of physical pain and one day when i had made some noise in class my friend the athlete was accused and i allowed him to get two strokes of the cane before i gave myself up he had held out his hands without flinching and had not rubbed them on his sides afterwards i was not caned but was made to stand up for the rest of the lesson i suffered very much afterwards when the thought came to me but he did not reproach me  i had been some years at school before i had my last fight my friend the athlete had given me many months of peace but at last refused to beat any more and said i must learn to box and not go near the other boys till i knew how i went home with him every day and boxed in his room and the bouts had always the same ending my excitability gave me an advantage at first and i would drive him across the room and then he would drive me across and it would end very commonly with my nose bleeding one day his father an elderly banker brought us out into the garden and tried to make us box in a coldblooded courteous way but it was no use at last he said i might go near the boys again and i was no sooner inside the gate of the playing field than a boy flung a handful of mud and cried out mad irishman i hit him several times on the face without being hit till the boys round said we should make friends i held out my hand in fear for i knew if we went on i should be beaten and he took it sullenly i had so poor a reputation as a fighter that it was a great disgrace to him and even the masters made fun of his swollen face and though some little boys came in a deputation to ask me to lick a boy they named i had never another fight with a schoolfellow we had a great many fights with the street boys and the boys of a neighbouring charity school we had always the better because we were not allowed to fling stones and that compelled us to close or do our best to close the monitors had been told to report any boy who fought in the street but they only reported those who flung stones i always ran at the athletes heels but i never hit anyone my father considered these fights absurd and even that they were an english absurdity and so i could not get angry enough to like hitting and being hit and then too my friend drove the enemy before him he had no doubts or speculations to lighten his fist upon an enemy that being of low behaviour should be beaten as often as possible and there were real wrongs to avenge one of our boys had been killed by the blow of a stone hid in a snowball sometimes we on our side got into trouble with the parents of boys there was a quarrel between the athlete and an old german who had a barbers shop we passed every day on our way home and one day he spat through the window and hit the german on his bald headthe monitors had not forbidden spitting the german ran after us but when the athlete squared up he went away now though i knew it was not right to spit at people my admiration for my friend arose to a great height i spread his fame over the school and next day there was a fine stir when somebody saw the old german going up the gravel walk to the headmasters room presently there was such a noise in the passage that even the master had to listen it was the headmasters redhaired brother turning the old german out and shouting to the manservant see that he doesnt steal the topcoats we heard afterwards that he had asked the names of the two boys who passed his window every day and been told the names of the two head boys who passed also but were notoriously gentlemanly in their manners yet my friend was timid also and that restored my confidence in myself he would often ask me to buy the sweets or the gingerbeer because he was afraid sometimes when speaking to a stranger  i had one reputation that i valued at first when i went to the hammersmith swimmingbaths with the other boys i was afraid to plunge in until i had gone so far down the ladder that the water came up to my thighs but one day when i was alone i fell from the springboard which was five or six feet above the water after that i would dive from a greater height than the others and i practised swimming under water and pretending not to be out of breath when i came up and then if i ran a race i took care not to pant or show any sign of strain and in this i had an advantage even over the athlete for though he could run faster and was harder to tire than anybody else he grew very pale and i was often paid compliments i used to run with my friend when he was training to keep him in company he would give me a long start and soon overtake me  i followed the career of a certain professional runner for months buying papers that would tell me if he had won or lost i had seen him described as the bright particular star of american athletics and the wonderful phrase had thrown enchantment over him had he been called the particular bright star i should have cared nothing for him i did not understand the symptom for years after i was nursing my own dream my form of the common schoolboy dream though i was no longer gathering the little pieces of broken and rotting wood often instead of learning my lesson i covered the white squares of the chessboard on my little table with pen and ink pictures of myself doing all kinds of courageous things one day my father said there was a man in nelsons ship at the battle of trafalgar a ships purser whose hair turned white what a sensitive temperament that man should have achieved something i was vexed and bewildered and am still bewildered and still vexed finding it a poor and crazy thing that we who have imagined so many noble persons cannot bring our flesh to heel   vi  the headmaster was a clergyman a goodhumoured easygoing man as temperate one had no doubt in his religious life as in all else and if he ever lost sleep on our account it was from a very proper anxiety as to our gentility i was in disgrace once because i went to school in some brilliant blue homespun serge my mother had bought in devonshire and i was told i must never wear it again he had tried several times though he must have known it was hopeless to persuade our parents to put us into eton clothes and on certain days we were compelled to wear gloves after my first year we were forbidden to play marbles because it was a form of gambling and was played by nasty little boys and a few months later told not to cross our legs in class it was a school for the sons of professional men who had failed or were at the outset of their career and the boys held an indignation meeting when they discovered that a new boy was an apothecarys son i think at first i was his only friend and we all pretended that our parents were richer than they were i told a little boy who had often seen my mother knitting or mending my clothes that she only mended or knitted because she liked it though i knew it was necessity  it was like i suppose most schools of its type an obscene bullying place where a big boy would hit a small boy in the wind to see him double up and where certain boys too young for any emotion of sex would sing the dirty songs of the street but i daresay it suited me better than a better school i have heard the headmaster say how has soandso done in his greek and the classmaster reply very badly but he is doing well in his cricket and the headmaster has gone away saying oh leave him alone i was unfitted for school work and though i would often work well for weeks together i had to give the whole evening to one lesson if i was to know it my thoughts were a great excitement but when i tried to do anything with them it was like trying to pack a balloon into a shed in a high wind i was always near the bottom of my class and always making excuses that but added to my timidity but no master was rough with me i was known to collect moths and butterflies and to get into no worse mischief than hiding now and again an old tailless white rat in my coatpocket or my desk there was but one interruption of our quiet habits the brief engagement of an irish master a fine greek scholar and vehement teacher but of fantastic speech he would open the class by saying there he goes there he goes or some like words as the headmaster passed by at the end of the hall of course this school is no good how could it be with a clergyman for headmaster and then perhaps his eye would light on me and he would make me stand up and tell me it was a scandal i was so idle when all the world knew that any irish boy was cleverer than a whole classroom of english boys a description i had to pay for afterwards sometimes he would call up a little boy who had a girls face and kiss him upon both cheeks and talk of taking him to greece in the holidays and presently we heard he had written to the boys parents about it but long before the holidays he was dismissed   vii  two pictures come into my memory i have climbed to the top of a tree by the edge of the playing field and am looking at my schoolfellows and am as proud of myself as a march cock when it crows to its first sunrise i am saying to myself if when i grow up i am as clever among grownup men as i am among these boys i shall be a famous man i remind myself how they think all the same things and cover the school walls at election times with the opinions their fathers find in the newspapers i remind myself that i am an artists son and must take some work as the whole end of life and not think as the others do of becoming well off and living pleasantly the other picture is of a hotel sittingroom in the strand where a man is hunched up over the fire he is a cousin who has speculated with another cousins money and has fled from ireland in danger of arrest my father has brought us to spend the evening with him to distract him from the remorse my father knows that he must be suffering   viii  for years bedford park was a romantic excitement at north end my father had announced at breakfast that our glass chandelier was absurd and was to be taken down and a little later he described the village norman shaw was building i had thought he said there is to be a wall round and no newspapers to be allowed in and when i had told him how put out i was at finding neither wall nor gate he explained that he had merely described what ought to be we were to see de morgan tiles peacockblue doors and the pomegranate pattern and the tulip pattern of morris and to discover that we had always hated doors painted with imitation grain and the roses of midvictoria and tiles covered with geometrical patterns that seemed to have been shaken out of a muddy kaleidoscope we went to live in a house like those we had seen in pictures and even met people dressed like people in the storybooks the streets were not straight and dull as at north end but wound about where there was a big tree or for the mere pleasure of winding and there were wood palings instead of iron railings the newness of everything the empty houses where we played at hideandseek and the strangeness of it all made us feel that we were living among toys we could imagine people living happy lives as we thought people did long ago when the poor were picturesque and the master of a house would tell of strange adventures over the sea only the better houses had been built the commercial builder had not begun to copy and to cheapen and besides we only knew the most beautiful houses the houses of artists my two sisters and my brother and myself had dancing lessons in a low redbrick and tiled house that drove away dreams long cherished of some day living in a house made exactly like a ships cabin the diningroom table where sinbad the sailor might have sat was painted peacockblue and the woodwork was all peacockblue and upstairs there was a window niche so big and high up there was a flight of steps to go up and down by and a table in the niche the two sisters of the master of the house a wellknown preraphaelite painter were our teachers and they and their old mother were dressed in peacockblue and in dresses so simply cut that they seemed a part of every story once when i had been looking with delight at the old woman my father who had begun to be influenced by french art muttered imagine dressing up your old mother like that   illustration john butler yeats from a watercolour drawing by himself   my fathers friends were painters who had been influenced by the preraphaelite movement but had lost their confidence wilson page nettleship potter are the names i remember and at north end i remember them most clearly i often heard one and another say that rossetti had never mastered his materials and though nettleship had already turned lionpainter my father talked constantly of the designs of his youth especially of god creating evil which browning praised in a letter my father had seen as the most sublime conception in ancient or modern art in those early days that he might not be tempted from his work by society he had made a rent in the tail of his coat and i have heard my mother tell how she had once sewn it up but before he came again he had pulled out all the stitches potters exquisite dormouse now in the tate gallery hung in our house for years his dearest friend was a pretty model who was when my memory begins working for some position in a boardschool i can remember her sitting at the side of the throne in the north end studio a book in her hand and my father hearing her say a latin lesson her face was the typical mild oval face of the painting of that time and may indeed have helped in the moulding of an ideal of beauty i found it the other day drawn in pencil on a blank leaf of a volume of the earthly paradise it was at bedford park that i had heard farrar whom i had first known at burnham beeches tell of potters death and burial potter had been very poor and had died from the effects of semistarvation he had lived so long on bread and tea that his stomach witheredi am sure that was the word used and when his relations found out and gave him good food it was too late farrar had been at the funeral and had stood behind some welltodo people who were close about the grave and saw one point to the model who had followed the hearse on foot and was now crying at a distance and say that is the woman who had all his money she had often begged him to allow her to pay his debts but he would not have it probably his rich friends blamed his poor friends and they the rich and i daresay nobody had known enough to help him besides he had a strange form of dissipation i had heard someone say he was devoted to children and would become interested in some childhis dormouse is a portrait of a childand spend his money on its education my sister remembers seeing him paint with a dark glove on his right hand and his saying that he had used so much varnish the reflection of the hand would have teased him but for the glove i will soon have to paint my face some dark colour he added i have no memory however but of noticing that he sat at the easel whereas my father always stands and walks up and down and that there was dark blue a colour that always affects me in the background of his picture there is a public gallery of wilsons work in his native aberdeen and my sisters have a number of his landscapeswoodscenes for the most partpainted with phlegm and melancholy the romantic movement drawing to its latest phase   ix  my father read out to me for the first time when i was eight or nine years old between sligo and rosses point there is a tongue of land covered with coarse grass that runs out into the sea or the mud according to the state of the tide it is the place where dead horses are buried sitting there my father read me the lays of ancient rome it was the first poetry that had moved me after the stableboys orange rhymes later on he read me ivanhoe and the lay of the last minstrel and they are still vivid in the memory i reread ivanhoe the other day but it has all vanished except gurth the swineherd at the outset and friar tuck and his venison pasty the two scenes that laid hold of me in childhood the lay of the last minstrel gave me a wish to turn magician that competed for years with the dream of being killed upon the seashore when i first went to school he tried to keep me from reading boys papers because a paper by its very nature as he explained to me had to be made for the average boy or man and so could not but thwart ones growth he took away my paper and i had not courage to say that i was but reading and delighting in a prose retelling of the iliad but after a few months my father said he had been too anxious and became less urgent about my lessons and less violent if i had learnt them badly and he ceased to notice what i read from that on i shared the excitement which ran through all my fellows on wednesday afternoons when the boys papers were published and i read endless stories i have forgotten as completely as grimms fairy tales that i read at sligo and all of hans andersen except the ugly duckling which my mother had read to me and to my sisters i remember vaguely that i liked hans andersen better than grimm because he was less homely but even he never gave me the knights and dragons and beautiful ladies that i longed for i have remembered nothing that i read but only those things that i heard or saw when i was ten or twelve my father took me to see irving play hamlet and did not understand why i preferred irving to ellen terry who was i can now see the idol of himself and his friends i could not think of her as i could of irvings hamlet as but myself and i was not old enough to care for feminine charm and beauty for many years hamlet was an image of heroic selfpossession for the poses of youth and childhood to copy a combatant of the battle within myself my father had read me the story of the little boy murdered by the jews in chaucer and the tale of sir topaz explaining the hard words and though both excited me i had liked sir topaz best and been disappointed that it left off in the middle as i grew older he would tell me plots of balzacs novels using incident or character as an illustration for some profound criticism of life now that i have read all the comédie humaine certain pages have an unnatural emphasis straining and overbalancing the outline and i remember how in some suburban street he told me of lucien de rubempré or of the duel after the betrayal of his master and how the wounded lucien had muttered so much the worse when he heard someone say that he was not dead  i now can but share with a friend my thoughts and my emotions and there is a continual discovery of difference but in those days before i had found myself we could share adventures when friends plan and do together their minds become one mind and the last secret disappears i was useless at games i cannot remember that i ever kicked a goal or made a run but i was a mine of knowledge when i and the athlete and those two notoriously gentlemanly boystheirs was the name that i remember without a faceset out for richmond park for coomb wood or twyford abbey to look for butterflies and moths and beetles sometimes today i meet people at lunch or dinner whose address will sound familiar and i remember of a sudden how a gamekeeper chased me from the plantation behind their house and how i have turned over the cowdung in their paddock in the search for some rare beetle believed to haunt the spot the athlete was our watchman and our safety he would suggest should we meet a carriage on the drive that we take off our hats and walk on as though about to pay a call and once when we were sighted by a gamekeeper at coomb wood he persuaded the eldest of the brothers to pretend to be a schoolmaster taking his boys for a walk and the keeper instead of swearing and threatening the law was sad and argumentative no matter how charming the place and there is a little stream in a hollow where wimbledon common flows into coomb wood that is pleasant in the memory i knew that those other boys saw something i did not see i was a stranger there there was something in their way of saying the names of places that made me feel this   x  when i arrived at the clarence basin liverpool the dock clarence mangan had his first name from on my way to sligo for my holidays i was among sligo people when i was a little boy an old woman who had come to liverpool with crates of fowl made me miserable by throwing her arms around me the moment i had alighted from my cab and telling the sailor who carried my luggage that she had held me in her arms when i was a baby the sailor may have known me almost as well for i was often at sligo quay to sail my boat and i came and went once or twice in every year upon the ss sligo or the ss liverpool which belonged to a company that had for directors my grandfather and his partner william middleton i was always pleased if it was the liverpool for she had been built to run the blockade during the war of north and south  i waited for this voyage always with excitement and boasted to other boys about it and when i was a little boy had walked with my feet apart as i had seen sailors walk i used to be seasick but i must have hidden this from the other boys and partly even from myself for as i look back i remember very little about it while i remember stories i was told by the captain or by his first mate and the look of the great cliffs of donegal  tory island men coming alongside with lobsters talking irish and if it was night blowing on a burning sod to draw our attention the captain an old man with square shoulders and a fringe of grey hair round his face would tell his first mate a very admiring man of fights he had had on shore at liverpool and perhaps it was of him i was thinking when i was very small and asked my grandmother if god was as strong as sailors once at any rate he had been nearly wrecked the liverpool had been all but blown upon the mull of galloway with her shaft broken and the captain had said to his mate mind and jump when she strikes for we dont want to be killed by the falling spars and when the mate answered my god i cannot swim he had said who could keep afloat for five minutes in a sea like that he would often say his mate was the most timid of men and that a girl along the quays could laugh him out of anything my grandfather had more than once given the mate a ship of his own but he had always thrown up his berth to sail with his old captain where he felt safe once he had been put in charge of a ship in a dry dock in liverpool but a boy was drowned in sligo and before the news could reach him he wired to his wife ghost come at once or i will throw up berth he had been wrecked a number of times and maybe that had broken his nerve or maybe he had a sensitiveness that would in another class have given him taste  culture i once forgot a copy of count robert of paris on a deckseat and when i found it again it was all covered with the prints of his dirty thumb he had once seen the coachabaur or death coach it came along the road he said till it was hidden by a cottage and it never came out on the other side of the cottage once i smelled newmown hay when we were quite a long way from land and once when i was watching the seaparrots as the sailors call the puffin i noticed they had different ways of tucking their heads under their wings or i fancied it and said to the captain they have different characters sometimes my father came too and the sailors when they saw him coming would say there is john yeats and we shall have a storm for he was considered unlucky  i no longer cared for little shutinplaces for a coppice against the stableyard at merville where my grandfather lived or against the gable at seaview where aunt micky lived and i began to climb the mountains sometimes with the stableboy for companion and to look up their stories in the county history i fished for trout with a worm in the mountain streams and went out herringfishing at night and because my grandfather had said the english were in the right to eat skates i carried a large skate all the six miles or so from rosses point but my grandfather did not eat it  one night just as the equinoctial gales were coming when i was sailing home in the coastguards boat a boy told me a beetle of solid gold strayed maybe from poes gold bug had been seen by somebody in scotland and i do not think that either of us doubted his news indeed so many stories did i hear from sailors along the wharf or round the focastle fire of the little steamer that ran between sligo and rosses or from boys out fishing that the world was full of monsters and marvels the foreign sailors wearing earrings did not tell me stories but like the fishing boys i gazed at them in wonder and admiration when i look at my brothers picture memory harbour houses and anchored ship and distant lighthouse all set close together as in some old map i recognize in the bluecoated man with the mass of white shirt the pilot i went fishing with and i am full of disquiet and of excitement and i am melancholy because i have not made more and better verses i have walked on sinbads yellow shore and never shall another hit my fancy  i had still my red pony and once my father came with me riding too and was very exacting he was indignant and threatening because he did not think i rode well you must do everything well he said that the pollexfens respect though you must do other things also he used to say the same about my lessons and tell me to be good at mathematics i can see now that he had a sense of inferiority among those energetic successful people he himself some pollexfen told me though he rode very badly would go hunting upon anything and take any ditch his father the county down rector though a courtly man and a scholar had been so dandified a horseman that i had heard of his splitting three riding breeches before he had settled into his saddle for a days hunting and of his first rector exclaiming i had hoped for a curate but they have sent me a jockey  left to myself i rode without ambition though getting many falls and more often to rathbroughan where my greatuncle mat lived than to any place else his children and i used to sail our toyboats in the river before his house arming them with toycannon touchpaper at all the touchholes always hoping but always in vain that they would not twist about in the eddies but fire their cannon at one another i must have gone to sligo sometimes in the christmas holidays for i can remember riding my red pony to a hunt he balked at the first jump to my relief and when a crowd of boys began to beat him i would not allow it they all jeered at me for being afraid i found a gap and when i was alone in a field tried another ditch but the pony would not jump that either so i tied him to a tree and lay down among the ferns and looked up into the sky on my way home i met the hunt again and noticed that everybody avoided the dogs and because i wanted to find out why they did so i rode to where the dogs had gathered in the middle of the lane and stood my pony amongst them and everybody began to shout at me  sometimes i would ride to castle dargan where lived a brawling squireen married to one of my middleton cousins and once i went thither on a visit with my cousin george middleton it was i dare say the last household where i could have found the reckless ireland of a hundred years ago in final degradation but i liked the place for the romance of its two ruined castles facing one another across a little lake castle dargan and castle fury the squireen lived in a small house whither his family had moved from their castle some time in the 18th century and two old miss furys who let lodgings in sligo were the last remnants of the breed of the other ruin once in every year he drove to sligo for the two old women that they might look upon the ancestral stones and remember their gentility and he would put his wildest horses into the shafts to enjoy their terror  he himself with a reeling imagination knew not what he could be at to find a spur for the heavy hours the first day i came there he gave my cousin a revolver we were upon the high road and to show it off or his own shooting he shot a passing chicken and half an hour later when he had brought us to the lakes edge under his castle now but the broken corner of a tower with a winding stair he fired at or over an old countryman who was walking on the far edge of the lake the next day i heard him settling the matter with the old countryman over a bottle of whiskey and both were in good humour once he had asked a timid aunt of mine if she would like to see his last new pet and thereupon had marched a racehorse in through the hall door and round the diningroom table and once she came down to a bare table because he had thought it a good joke to open the window and let his harriers eat the breakfast there was a current story too of his shooting in the pride of his marksmanship at his own door with a martinihenry rifle till he had shot the knocker off at last he quarrelled with my greatuncle william middleton and to avenge himself gathered a rabble of wild countrylads and mounted them and himself upon the most brokendown rascally horses he could lay hands on and marched them through sligo under a landleague banner after that having neither friends nor money he made off to australia or to canada i fished for pike at castle dargan and shot at birds with a muzzleloading pistol until somebody shot a rabbit and i heard it squeal from that on i would kill nothing but the dumb fish   xi  we left bedford park for a long thatched house at howth co dublin the land war was now at its height and our kildare land that had been in the family for many generations was slipping from us rents had fallen more and more we had to sell to pay some charge or mortgage but my father and his tenants parted without illwill during the worst times an old tenant had under his roof my fathers shootingdog and gave it better care than the annual payment earned he had set apart for its comfort the best place at the fire and if some man were in the place when the dog walked into the house the man must needs make room for the dog and a good while after the sale i can remember my father being called upon to settle some dispute between this old man and his sons  i was now fifteen and as he did not want to leave his painting my father told me to go to harcourt street and put myself to school i found a bleak 18th century house and a small playingfield full of mud and pebbles fenced by an iron railing from a wide 18th century street but opposite a long hoarding and a squalid ornamental railway station here as i soon found nobody gave a thought to decorum we worked in a din of voices we began the morning with prayers but when class began the headmaster if he was in the humour would laugh at church and clergy let them say what they like he would say but the earth does go round the sun on the other hand there was no bullying and i had not thought it possible that boys could work so hard cricket and football the collection of moths and butterflies though not forbidden were discouraged they were for idle boys i did not know as i used to the mass of my schoolfellows for we had little life in common outside the classrooms i had begun to think of my schoolwork as an interruption of my natural history studies but even had i never opened a book not in the school course i could not have learned a quarter of my nights work i had always done euclid easily making the problems out while the other boys were blundering at the blackboard and it had often carried me from the bottom to the top of my class but these boys had the same natural gift and instead of being in the fourth or fifth book were in the modern books at the end of the primer and in place of a dozen lines of virgil with a dictionary i was expected to learn with the help of a crib a hundred and fifty lines the other boys were able to learn the translation off and to remember what words of latin and english corresponded with one another but i who it may be had tried to find out what happened in the parts we had not read made ridiculous mistakes and what could i who never worked when i was not interested do with a history lesson that was but a column of seventy dates i was worst of all at literature for we read shakespeare for his grammar exclusively  one day i had a lucky thought a great many lessons were run through in the last hour of the day things we had learnt or should have learnt by heart over night and after not having known one of them for weeks i cut off that hour without anybodys leave i asked the mathematical master to give me a sum to work and nobody said a word my father often interfered and always with disaster to teach me my latin lesson but i have also my geography i would say geography he would reply should never be taught it is not a training for the mind you will pick up all that you need in your general reading and if it was a history lesson he would say just the same and euclid he would say is too easy it comes naturally to the literary imagination the old idea that it is a good training for the mind was long ago refuted i would know my latin lesson so that it was a nine days wonder and for weeks after would be told it was scandalous to be so clever and so idle no one knew that i had learnt it in the terror that alone could check my wandering mind i must have told on him at some time or other for i remember the headmaster saying i am going to give you an imposition because i cannot get at your father to give him one sometimes we had essays to write  though i never got a prize for the essays were judged by handwriting and spelling i caused a measure of scandal i would be called up before some master and asked if i really believed such things and that would make me angry for i had written what i had believed all my life what my father had told me or a memory of the conversation of his friends there were other beliefs but they were held by people one did not know people who were vulgar or stupid i was asked to write an essay on men may rise on steppingstones of their dead selves to higher things my father read the subject to my mother who had no interest in such matters that is the way he said boys are made insincere and false to themselves ideals make the blood thin and take the human nature out of people he walked up and down the room in eloquent indignation and told me not to write on such a subject at all but upon shakespeares lines to thine own self be true and it must follow as the night the day thou canst not then be false to any man at another time he would denounce the idea of duty and imagine he would say how the right sort of woman would despise a dutiful husband and he would tell us how much my mother would scorn such a thing maybe there were people among whom such ideas were natural but they were the people with whom one does not dine all he said was i now believe right but he should have taken me away from school he would have taught me nothing but greek and latin and i would now be a properly educated man and would not have to look in useless longing at books that have been through the poor mechanism of translation the builders of my soul nor faced authority with the timidity born of excuse and evasion evasion and excuse were in the event as wise as the housebuilding instinct of the beaver   xii  my london schoolfellow the athlete spent a summer with us but the friendship of boyhood founded upon action and adventure was drawing to an end he was still my superior in all physical activity and climbed to places among the rocks that even now are uncomfortable memories but i had begun to criticize him one morning i proposed a journey to lambay island and was contemptuous because he said we should miss our midday meal we hoisted a sail on our small boat and ran quickly over the nine miles and saw on the shore a tame seagull while a couple of boys the sons of a coastguard ran into the water in their clothes to pull us to land as we had read of savage people doing we spent an hour upon the sunny shore and i said i would like to live here always and perhaps some day i will i was always discovering places where i would like to spend my whole life we started to row home and when dinnertime had passed for about an hour the athlete lay down on the bottom of the boat doubled up with the gripes i mocked at him and at his fellowcountrymen whose stomachs struck the hour as if they were clocks  our natural history too began to pull us apart i planned some day to write a book about the changes through a twelvemonth among the creatures of some hole in the rock and had some theory of my own which i cannot remember as to the colour of seaanemones and after much hesitation trouble and bewilderment was hot for argument in refutation of adam and noah and the seven days i had read darwin and wallace huxley and haeckel and would spend hours on a holiday plaguing a pious geologist who when not at some job in guinnesss brewery came with a hammer to look for fossils in the howth cliffs you know i would say that such and such human remains cannot be less because of the strata they were found in than fifty thousand years old oh he would answer they are an isolated instance and once when i pressed hard my case against usshers chronology he begged me not to speak of the subject again if i believed what you do he said i could not live a moral life but i could not even argue with the athlete who still collected his butterflies for the adventures sake and with no curiosity but for their names i began to judge his intelligence and to tell him that his natural history had as little to do with science as his collection of postage stamps even during my school days in london influenced perhaps by my father i had looked down upon the postage stamps   xiii  our house for the first year or so was on the top of a cliff so that in stormy weather the spray would sometimes soak my bed at night for i had taken the glass out of the window sash and all a literary passion for the open air was to last me for a few years then for another year or two we had a house overlooking the harbour where the one great sight was the going and coming of the fishing fleet we had one regular servant a fishermans wife and the occasional help of a big redfaced girl who ate a whole pot of jam while my mother was at church and accused me of it some such arrangement lasted until long after the time i write of and until my father going into the kitchen by chance found a girl who had been engaged during a passing need in tears at the thought of leaving our other servant and promised that they should never be parted i have no doubt that we lived at the harbour for my mothers sake she had when we were children refused to take us to a seaside place because she heard it possessed a bathing box but she loved the activities of a fishing village when i think of her i almost always see her talking over a cup of tea in the kitchen with our servant the fishermans wife on the only themes outside our house that seemed of interestthe fishing people of howth or the pilots and fishing people of rosses point she read no books but she and the fishermans wife would tell each other stories that homer might have told pleased with any moment of sudden intensity and laughing together over any point of satire there is an essay called village ghosts in my celtic twilight which is but a record of one such afternoon and many a fine tale has been lost because it had not occurred to me soon enough to keep notes my father was always praising her to my sisters and to me because she pretended to nothing she did not feel she would write him letters telling of her delight in the tumbling clouds but she did not care for pictures and never went to an exhibition even to see a picture of his nor to his studio to see the days work neither now nor when they were first married i remember all this very clearly and little after until her mind had gone in a stroke of paralysis and she had found liberated at last from financial worry perfect happiness feeding the birds at a london window she had always my father would say intensity and that was his chief word of praise and once he added to the praise no spendthrift ever had a poet for a son though a miser might   xiv  the great event of a boys life is the awakening of sex he will bathe many times a day or get up at dawn and having stripped leap to and fro over a stick laid upon two chairs and hardly know and never admit that he had begun to take pleasure in his own nakedness nor will he understand the change until some dream discovers it he may never understand at all the greater change in his mind  it all came upon me when i was close upon seventeen like the bursting of a shell somnambulistic countrygirls when it is upon them throw plates about or pull them with long hairs in simulation of the poltergeist or become mediums for some genuine spiritmischief surrendering to their desire of the marvellous as i look backward i seem to discover that my passions my loves and my despairs instead of being my enemies a disturbance and an attack became so beautiful that i must be constantly alone to give them my whole attention i notice that for the first time as i run through my memory what i saw when alone is more vivid than what i did or saw in company  a herd had shown me a cave some hundred and fifty feet below the cliff path and a couple of hundred above the sea and told me how an evicted tenant called macrom dead some fifteen years had lived there many years and shown me a rusty nail in the rock which had served perhaps to hold up some wooden protection from wind and weather here i stored a tin of cocoa and some biscuits and instead of going to my bed would slip out on warm nights and sleep in the cave on the excuse of catching moths one had to pass over a rocky ledge safe enough for anyone with a fair head yet seeming if looked at from above narrow and sloping and a remonstrance from a stranger who had seen me climbing along it doubled my delight in the adventure when however upon a bank holiday i found lovers in my cave i was not content with it again till i heard of alarm among the fishing boats because the ghost of macrom had been seen a little before the dawn stooping over his fire in the cavemouth i had been trying to cook eggs as i had read in some book by burying them in the earth under a fire of sticks  at other times i would sleep among the rhododendrons and rocks in the wilder part of the grounds of howth castle after a while my father said i must stay indoors half the night meaning that i should get some sleep in my bed but i knowing that i would be too sleepy and comfortable to get up again used to sit over the kitchen fire till half the night was gone exaggerated accounts spread through the school and sometimes when i did not know a lesson some master would banter me my interest in science began to fade away and presently i said to myself it has all been a misunderstanding i remembered how soon i tired of my specimens and how little i knew after all my years of collecting and i came to believe that i had gone through so much labour because of a text heard for the first time in st johns church in sligo i wanted to be certain of my own wisdom by copying solomon who had knowledge of hyssop and of tree i still carried my green net but i began to play at being a sage a magician or a poet i had many idols and now as i climbed along the narrow ledge i was manfred on his glacier and now i thought of prince athanase and his solitary lamp but i soon chose alastor for my chief of men and longed to share his melancholy and maybe at last to disappear from everybodys sight as he disappeared drifting in a boat along some slowmoving river between great trees when i thought of women they were modelled on those in my favourite poets and loved in brief tragedy or like the girl in the revolt of islam accompanied their lovers through all manner of wild places lawless women without homes and without children   xv  my fathers influence upon my thoughts was at its height we went to dublin by train every morning breakfasting in his studio he had taken a large room with a beautiful 18th century mantlepiece in a york street tenement house and at breakfast he read passages from the poets and always from the play or poem at its most passionate moment he never read me a passage because of its speculative interest and indeed did not care at all for poetry where there was generalisation or abstraction however impassioned he would read out the first speeches of the prometheus unbound but never the ecstatic lyricism of that famous fourth act and another day the scene where coriolanus comes to the house of aufidius and tells the impudent servants that his home is under the canopy i have seen coriolanus played a number of times since then and read it more than once but that scene is more vivid than the rest and it is my fathers voice that i hear and not irvings or bensons he did not care even for a fine lyric passage unless one felt some actual man behind its elaboration of beauty and he was always looking for the lineaments of some desirable familiar life when the spirits sang their scorn of manfred i was to judge by manfreds answer o sweet and melancholy voices that they could not even in anger put off their spiritual sweetness he thought keats a greater poet than shelley because less abstract but did not read him caring little i think for any of that most beautiful poetry which has come in modern times from the influence of painting all must be an idealisation of speech and at some moment of passionate action or somnambulistic reverie i remember his saying that all contemplative men were in a conspiracy to overrate their state of life and that all writers were of them excepting the great poets looking backwards it seems to me that i saw his mind in fragments which had always hidden connections i only now begin to discover he disliked the victorian poetry of ideas and wordsworth but for certain passages or whole poems he described one morning over his breakfast how in the shape of the head of a wordsworthian scholar an old and greatly respected clergyman whose portrait he was painting he had discovered all the animal instincts of a prizefighter he despised the formal beauty of raphael that calm which is not an ordered passion but an hypocrisy and attacked raphaels life for its love of pleasure and its selfindulgence in literature he was always preraphaelite and carried into literature principles that while the academy was still unbroken had made the first attack upon academic form he no longer read me anything for its story and all our discussion was of style   xvi  i began to make blunders when i paid calls or visits and a woman i had known and liked as a child told me i had changed for the worse i had wanted to be wise and eloquent an essay on the younger ampère had helped me to this ambition and when i was alone i exaggerated my blunders and was miserable i had begun to write poetry in imitation of shelley and of edmund spenser play after playfor my father exalted dramatic poetry above all other kindsand i invented fantastic and incoherent plots my lines but seldom scanned for i could not understand the prosody in the books although there were many lines that taken by themselves had music i spoke them slowly as i wrote and only discovered when i read them to somebody else that there was no common music no prosody there were however moments of observation for even when i caught moths no longer i still noticed all that passed how the little moths came out at sunset and how after that there were only a few big moths till dawn brought little moths again and what birds cried out at night as if in their sleep   xvii  at sligo where i still went for my holidays i stayed with my uncle george pollexfen who had come from ballina to fill the place of my grandfather who had retired my grandfather had no longer his big house his partner william middleton was dead and there had been legal trouble he was no longer the rich man he had been and his sons and daughters were married and scattered he had a tall bare house overlooking the harbour and had nothing to do but work himself into a rage if he saw a mudlighter mismanaged or judged from the smoke of a steamer that she was burning cheap coal and to superintend the making of his tomb there was a middleton tomb and a long list of middletons on the wall and an almost empty place for pollexfen names but he had said because there was a middleton there he did not like i am not going to lie with those old bones and already one saw his name in large gilt letters on the stone fence of the new tomb he ended his walk at st johns churchyard almost daily for he liked everything neat and compendious as upon shipboard and if he had not looked after the tomb himself the builder might have added some useless ornament he had however all his old skill and nerve i was going to rosses point on the little trading steamer and saw him take the wheel from the helmsman and steer her through a gap in the channel wall and across the sand an unheardofcourse and at the journeys end bring her alongside her wharf at rosses without the accustomed zigzagging or pulling on a rope but in a single movement he took snuff when he had a cold but had never smoked or taken alcohol and when in his eightieth year his doctor advised a stimulant he replied no no i am not going to form a bad habit  my brother had partly taken my place in my grandmothers affections he had lived permanently in her house for some years now and went to a sligo school where he was always bottom of his class my grandmother did not mind that for she said he is too kindhearted to pass the other boys he spent his free hours going here and there with crowds of little boys sons of pilots and sailors as their wellliked leader arranging donkey races or driving donkeys tandem an occupation which requires all ones intellect because of their obstinacy besides he had begun to amuse everybody with his drawings and in half the pictures he paints today i recognise faces that i have met at rosses or the sligo quays it is long since he has lived there but his memory seems as accurate as the sight of the eye  george pollexfen was as patient as his father was impetuous and did all by habit a welltodo elderly man he lived with no more comfort than when he had set out as a young man he had a little house and one old general servant and a man to look after his horse and every year he gave up some activity and found that there was one more food that disagreed with him a hypochondriac he passed from winter to summer through a series of woollens that had always to be weighed for in april or may or whatever the date was he had to be sure he carried the exact number of ounces he had carried upon that date since boyhood he lived in despondency finding in the most cheerful news reasons of discouragement and sighing every twentysecond of june over the shortening of the days once in later years when i met him in dublin sweating in a midsummer noon i brought him into the hall of the kildare street library a cool and shady place without lightening his spirits for he but said in a melancholy voice how very cold this place must be in winter time sometimes when i had pitted my cheerfulness against his gloom over the breakfast table maintaining that neither his talent nor his memory nor his health were running to the dregs he would rout me with the sentence how very old i shall be in twenty years yet this inactive man in whom the sap of life seemed to be dried away had a mind full of pictures nothing had ever happened to him except a love affair not i think very passionate that had gone wrong and a voyage when a young man my grandfather had sent him in a schooner to a port in spain where the shipping agents were two spaniards called oneill descendants of hugh oneill earl of tyrone who had fled from ireland in the reign of james i and their irish trade was a last remnant of the spanish trade that had once made galway wealthy for some years he and they had corresponded for they cherished the memory of their origin in some connaught burying ground he had chanced upon the funeral of a child with but one mourner a distinguished foreignlooking man it was an austrian count burying the last of an irish family long nobles of austria who were always carried to that halfruined burying ground  my uncle had almost given up hunting and was soon to give it up altogether and he had once ridden steeplechases and been his horsetrainer said the best rider in connaught he had certainly great knowledge of horses for i have been told several counties away that at ballina he cured horses by conjuring he had however merely great skill in diagnosis for the day was still far off when he was to give his nights to astrology and ceremonial magic his servant mary battle who had been with him since he was a young man had the second sight and that maybe inclined him to strange studies he would tell how more than once when he had brought home a guest without giving her notice he had found the dinnertable set for two and one morning she was about to bring him a clean shirt but stopped saying there was blood on the shirtfront and that she must bring him another on his way to his office he fell crossing over a little wall and cut himself and bled on to the linen where she had seen the blood in the evening she told how surprised she had been to find when she looked again that the shirt she had thought bloody was quite clean she could neither read nor write and her mind which answered his gloom with its merriment was rammed with every sort of old history and strange belief much of my celtic twilight is but her daily speech  my uncle had the respect of the common people as few sligo men have had it he would have thought a stronger emotion an intrusion on his privacy he gave to all men the respect due to their station or their worth with an added measure of ceremony and kept among his workmen a discipline that had about it something of a regiment or a ship knowing nothing of any but personal authority if a carter let us say was in fault he would not dismiss him but send for him and take his whip away and hang it upon the wall and having reduced the offender as it were to the ranks for certain months would restore him to his post and his whip this man of diligence and of method who had no enterprise but in contemplation and claimed that his wealth considerable for ireland came from a brothers or partners talent was the confidant of my boyish freaks and reveries when i said to him echoing some book i had read that one never knew a countryside till one knew it at night though nothing would have kept him from his bed a moment beyond the hour he was pleased for he loved natural things and had learnt two cries of the lapwing one that drew them to where he stood and one that made them fly away and he approved and arranged my meals conveniently when i told him i was going to walk round lough gill and sleep in a wood i did not tell him all my object for i was nursing a new ambition my father had read to me some passage out of walden and i planned to live some day in a cottage on a little island called innisfree and innisfree was opposite slish wood where i meant to sleep  i thought that having conquered bodily desire and the inclination of my mind towards women and love i should live as thoreau lived seeking wisdom there was a story in the county history of a tree that had once grown upon that island guarded by some terrible monster and borne the food of the gods a young girl pined for the fruit and told her lover to kill the monster and carry the fruit away he did as he had been told but tasted the fruit and when he reached the mainland where she had waited for him was dying of its powerful virtue and from sorrow and from remorse she too ate of it and died i do not remember whether i chose the island because of its beauty or for the storys sake but i was twentytwo or three before i gave up the dream  i set out from sligo about six in the evening walking slowly for it was an evening of great beauty but though i was well into slish wood by bedtime i could not sleep not from the discomfort of the dry rock i had chosen for my bed but from my fear of the woodranger somebody had told me though i do not think it could have been true that he went his round at some unknown hour i kept going over what i should say if i was found and could not think of anything he would believe however i could watch my island in the early dawn and notice the order of the cries of the birds  i came home next day unimaginably tired  sleepy having walked some thirty miles partly over rough and boggy ground for months afterwards if i alluded to my walk my uncles general servant not mary battle who was slowly recovering from an illness and would not have taken the liberty would go into fits of laughter she believed i had spend the night in a different fashion and had invented the excuse to deceive my uncle and would say to my great embarrassment for i was as prudish as an old maid and you had good right to be fatigued  once when staying with my uncle at rosses point where he went for certain months of the year i called upon a cousin towards midnight and asked him to get his yacht out for i wanted to find what sea birds began to stir before dawn he was indignant and refused but his elder sister had overheard me and came to the head of the stairs and forbade him to stir and that so vexed him that he shouted to the kitchen for his seaboots he came with me in great gloom for he had peoples respect he declared and nobody so far had said that he was mad as they said i was and we got a very sleepy boy out of his bed in the village and set up sail we put a trawl out as he thought it would restore his character if he caught some fish but the wind fell and we were becalmed i rolled myself in the mainsail and went to sleep for i could sleep anywhere in those days i was awakened towards dawn to see my cousin and the boy turning out their pockets for money and to rummage in my own pockets a boat was rowing in from roughley with fish and they wanted to buy some and would pretend they had caught it but all our pockets were empty it was for the poem that became fifteen years afterwards the shadowy waters that i had wanted the birds cries and it had been full of observation had i been able to write it when i first planned it i had found again the windy light that moved me when a child i persuaded myself that i had a passion for the dawn and this passion though mainly histrionic like a childs play an ambitious game had moments of sincerity years afterwards when i had finished the wanderings of oisin dissatisfied with its yellow and its dull green with all that overcharged colour inherited from the romantic movement i deliberately reshaped my style deliberately sought out an impression as of cold light and tumbling clouds i cast off traditional metaphors and loosened my rhythm and recognizing that all the criticism of life known to me was alien and english became as emotional as possible but with an emotion which i described to myself as cold it is a natural conviction for a painters son to believe that there may be a landscape symbolical of some spiritual condition that awakens a hunger such as cats feel for valerian   xviii  i was writing a long play on a fable suggested by one of my fathers early designs a kings daughter loves a god seen in the luminous sky above her garden in childhood and to be worthy of him and put away mortality becomes without pity  commits crimes and at last having made her way to the throne by murder awaits the hour among her courtiers one by one they become chilly and drop dead for unseen by all but her her god is walking through the hall at last he is at her thrones foot and she her mind in the garden once again dies babbling like a child   xix  once when i was sailing with my cousin the boy who was our crew talked of a musichall at a neighbouring seaport and how the girls there gave themselves to men and his language was as extravagant as though he praised that courtezan after whom they named a city or the queen of sheba herself another day he wanted my cousin to sail some fifty miles along the coast and put in near some cottages where he had heard there were girls and we would have a great welcome before us he pleaded with excitement i imagine that his eyes shone but hardly hoped to persuade us and perhaps but played with fabulous images of life and of sex a young jockey and horsetrainer who had trained some horses for my uncle once talked to me of wicked england while we cooked a turkey for our christmas dinner making it twist about on a string in front of his harnessroom fire he had met two lords in england where he had gone racing who always exchanged wives when they went to the continent for a holiday he himself had once been led into temptation and was going home with a woman but having touched his scapular by chance saw in a moment an angel waving white wings in the air presently i was to meet him no more and my uncle said he had done something disgraceful about a horse   xx  i was climbing up a hill at howth when i heard wheels behind me and a ponycarriage drew up beside me a pretty girl was driving alone and without a hat she told me her name and said we had friends in common and asked me to ride beside her after that i saw a great deal of her and was soon in love i did not tell her i was in love however because she was engaged she had chosen me for her confidant and i learned all about her quarrels with her lover several times he broke the engagement off and she would fall ill and friends would make peace sometimes she would write to him three times a day but she could not do without a confidant she was a wild creature a fine mimic and given to bursts of religion i have known her to weep at a sermon call herself a sinful woman and mimic it after i wrote her some bad poems and had more than one sleepless night through anger with her betrothed   xxi  at ballisodare an event happened that brought me back to the superstitions of my childhood i do not know when it was for the events of this period have as little sequence as those of childhood i was staying with cousins at avena house a young man a few years older and a girl of my own age and perhaps her sister who was a good deal older my girl cousin had often told me of strange sights she had seen at ballisodare or rosses an old woman three or four feet in height and leaning on a stick had once come to the window and looked in at her and sometimes she would meet people on the road who would say how is soandso naming some member of her family and she would know though she could not explain how that they were not people of this world once she had lost her way in a familiar field and when she found it again the silver mounting on a walkingstick belonging to her brother which she carried had vanished an old woman in the village said afterwards you have good friends amongst them and the silver was taken instead of you  though it was all years ago what i am going to tell now must be accurate for no great while ago she wrote out her unprompted memory of it all and it was the same as mine she was sitting under an oldfashioned mirror reading and i was reading in another part of the room suddenly i heard a sound as if somebody was throwing a shower of peas at the mirror i got her to go into the next room and rap with her knuckles on the other side of the wall to see if the sound could come from there and while i was alone a great thump came close to my head upon the wainscot and on a different wall of the room later in the day a servant heard a heavy footstep going through the empty house and that night when i and my two cousins went for a walk she saw the ground under some trees all in a blaze of light i saw nothing but presently we crossed the river and went along its edge where they say there was a village destroyed i think in the wars of the 17th century and near an old graveyard suddenly we all saw light moving over the river where there is a great rush of waters it was like a very brilliant torch a moment later the girl saw a man coming towards us who disappeared in the water i kept asking myself if i could be deceived perhaps after all though it seemed impossible somebody was walking in the water with a torch but we could see a small light low down on knocknarea seven miles off and it began to move upward over the mountain slope i timed it on my watch and in five minutes it reached the summit and i who had often climbed the mountain knew that no human footstep was so speedy  from that on i wandered about raths and faery hills and questioned old women and old men and when i was tired out or unhappy began to long for some such end as true thomas found i did not believe with my intellect that you could be carried away body and soul but i believed with my emotions and the belief of the country people made that easy once when i had crawled into the stone passage in some rath of the third rosses the pilot who had come with me called down the passage are you all right sir  and one night as i came near the village of rosses on the road from sligo a fire blazed up on a green bank at my right side seven or eight feet above me and another fire suddenly answered from knocknarea i hurried on doubting and yet hardly doubting in my heart that i saw again the fires that i had seen by the river at ballisodare i began occasionally telling people that one should believe whatever had been believed in all countries and periods and only reject any part of it after much evidence instead of starting all over afresh and only believing what one could prove but i was always ready to deny or turn into a joke what was for all that my secret fanaticism when i had read darwin and huxley and believed as they did i had wanted because an established authority was upon my side to argue with everybody   xxii  i no longer went to the harcourt street school and we had moved from howth to rathgar i was at the arts schools in kildare street but my father who came to the school now and then was my teacher the masters left me alone for they liked a very smooth surface and a very neat outline and indeed understood nothing but neatness and smoothness a drawing of the discobolus after my father had touched it making the shoulder stand out with swift and broken lines had no meaning for them and for the most part i exaggerated all that my father did sometimes indeed out of rivalry to some student near i too would try to be smooth and neat one day i helped the student next me who certainly had no artistic gifts to make a drawing of some plaster fruit in his gratitude he told me his history i dont care for art he said i am a good billiard player one of the best in dublin but my guardian said i must take a profession so i asked my friends to tell me where i would not have to pass an examination and here i am it may be that i myself was there for no better reason my father had wanted me to go to trinity college and when i would not had said my father and grandfather and greatgrandfather have been there i did not tell him my reason was that i did not believe my classics or my mathematics good enough for any examination  i had for fellowstudent an unhappy village genius sent to dublin by some charitable connaught landlord he painted religious pictures upon sheets nailed to the wall of his bedroom a last judgment among the rest then there was a wild young man who would come to school of a morning with a daisychain hung round his neck and george russel Æ the poet and mystic he did not paint the model as we tried to for some other image rose always before his eyes a st john in the desert i remember and already he spoke to us of his visions his conversation so lucid and vehement today was all but incomprehensible though now and again some phrase would be understood and repeated one day he announced that he was leaving the art schools because his will was weak and the arts or any other emotional pursuit could but weaken it further  presently i went to the modelling class to be with certain elder students who had authority among us among these were john hughes and oliver sheppard wellknown now as irish sculptors the day i first went into the studio where they worked i stood still upon the threshold in amazement a pretty gentlelooking girl was modelling in the middle of the room and all the men were swearing at her for getting in their light with the most violent and fantastic oaths and calling her every sort of name and through it all she worked in undisturbed diligence presently the man nearest me saw my face and called out she is stone deaf so we always swear at her and call her names when she gets in our light in reality i soon found that everyone was kind to her carrying her drawingboards and the like and putting her into the tram at the days end we had no scholarship no critical knowledge of the history of painting and no settled standards a student would show his fellows some french illustrated paper that we might all admire now some statue by rodin or dalou and now some declamatory parisian monument and if i did not happen to have discussed the matter with my father i would admire with no more discrimination than the rest that pretentious monument to gambetta made a great stir among us no influence touched us but that of france where one or two of the older students had been already and all hoped to go of england i alone knew anything our ablest student had learnt italian to read dante but had never heard of tennyson or browning and it was i who carried into the school some knowledge of english poetry especially of browning who had begun to move me by his air of wisdom i do not believe that i worked well for i wrote a great deal and that tired me and the work i was set to bored me when alone and uninfluenced i longed for pattern for preraphaelitism for an art allied to poetry and returned again and again to our national gallery to gaze at turners golden bough yet i was too timid had i known how to break away from my fathers style and the style of those about me i was always hoping that my father would return to the style of his youth and make pictures out of certain designs now lost that one could still find in his portfolios there was one of an old hunchback in vague medieval dress going through some underground place where there are beds with people in the beds a girl half rising from one has seized his hand and is kissing it i have forgotten its story but the strange old man and the intensity in the girls figure are vivid as in my childhood there is some passage i believe in the bible about a man who saved a city and went away and was never heard of again and here he was in another design an old ragged beggar in the marketplace laughing at his own statue but my father would say i must paint what i see in front of me of course i shall really paint something different because my nature will come in unconsciously sometimes i would try to argue with him for i had come to think the philosophy of his fellowartists and himself a misunderstanding created by victorian science and science i had grown to hate with a monkish hate but no good came of it and in a moment i would unsay what i had said and pretend that i did not really believe it my father was painting many fine portraits dublin leaders of the bar college notabilities or chance comers whom he would paint for nothing if he liked their heads but all displeased me in my heart i thought that only beautiful things should be painted and that only ancient things and the stuff of dreams were beautiful and i almost quarrelled with my father when he made a large watercolour one of his finest pictures and now lost of a consumptive beggar girl and a picture at the hibernian academy of cocottes with yellow faces sitting before a café by some follower of manets made me miserable for days but i was happy when partly through my fathers planning some whistlers were brought over and exhibited and did not agree when my father said imagine making your old mother an arrangement in gray i did not care for mere reality and believed that creation should be conscious and yet i could only imitate my father i could not compose anything but a portrait and even today i constantly see people as a portrait painter posing them in the minds eye before such and such a background meanwhile i was still very much of a child sometimes drawing with an elaborate frenzy simulating what i believed of inspiration and sometimes walking with an artificial stride in memory of hamlet and stopping at shop windows to look at my tie gathered into a loose sailorknot and to regret that it could not be always blown out by the wind like byrons tie in the picture i had as many ideas as i have now only i did not know how to choose from among them those that belonged to my life   xxiii  we lived in a villa where the red bricks were made pretentious and vulgar with streaks of slate colour and there seemed to be enemies everywhere at one side indeed there was a friendly architect but on the other some stupid stout woman and her family i had a study with a window opposite some window of hers  one night when i was writing i heard voices full of derision and saw the stout woman and her family standing in the window i have a way of acting what i write and speaking it aloud without knowing what i am doing perhaps i was on my hands and knees or looking down over the back of a chair talking into what i imagined an abyss another day a woman asked me to direct her on her way and while i was hesitating being so suddenly called out of my thought a woman from some neighbouring house came by she said i was a poet and my questioner turned away contemptuously upon the other hand the policeman and tramway conductor thought my absence of mind sufficiently explained when our servant told them i was a poet oh well said the policeman who had been asking why i went indifferently through clean and muddy places if it is only the poetry that is working in his head i imagine i looked gaunt and emaciated for the little boys at the neighbouring crossroad used to say when i passed by oh here is king death again one morning when my father was on the way to his studio he met his landlord who had a big grocers shop and they had this conversation will you tell me sir if you think tennyson should have been given that peerage ones only doubt is if he should have accepted it it was a finer thing to be alfred tennyson there was a silence and then well all the people i know think he should not have got it then spitefully whats the good of poetry oh it gives our minds a great deal of pleasure but wouldnt it have given your mind more pleasure if he had written an improving book oh in that case i should not have read it my father returned in the evening delighted with his story but i could not understand how he could take such opinions lightly and not have seriously argued with the man none of these people had ever seen any poet but an old whitehaired man who had written volumes of easy toohonied verse and run through his money and gone clean out of his mind he was a common figure in the streets and lived in some shabby neighbourhood of tenement houses where there were hens and chickens among the cobble stones every morning he carried home a loaf and gave half of it to the hens and chickens the birds or to some dog or starving cat he was known to live in one room with a nail in the middle of the ceiling from which innumerable cords were stretched to other nails in the walls in this way he kept up the illusion that he was living under canvas in some arabian desert i could not escape like this old man from house and neighbourhood but hated both hearing every whisper noticing every passing glance when my grandfather came for a few days to see a doctor i was shocked to see him in our house my father read out to him in the evening clark russells wreck of the grosvenor but the doctor forbade it for my grandfather got up in the middle of the night and acted through the mutiny as i acted my verse saying the while yes yes that is the way it would all happen   xxiv  from our first arrival in dublin my father had brought me from time to time to see edward dowden he and my father had been college friends and were trying perhaps to take up again their old friendship sometimes we were asked to breakfast and afterwards my father would tell me to read out one of my poems dowden was wise in his encouragement never overpraising and never unsympathetic and he would sometimes lend me books the orderly prosperous house where all was in good taste where poetry was rightly valued made dublin tolerable for a while and for perhaps a couple of years he was an image of romance my father would not share my enthusiasm and soon i noticed grew impatient at these meetings he would sometimes say that he had wanted dowden when they were young to give himself to creative art and would talk of what he considered dowdens failure in life i know now that he was finding in his friend what he himself had been saved from by the conversation of the preraphaelites he will not trust his nature he would say or he is too much influenced by his inferiors or he would praise renunciants one of dowdens poems to prove what dowden might have written i was not influenced for i had imagined a past worthy of that dark romantic face i took literally his verses touched here and there with swinburnian rhetoric and believed that he had loved unhappily and illicitly and when through the practice of my art i discovered that certain images about the love of woman were the properties of a school i but changed my fancy and thought of him as very wise  i was constantly troubled about philosophic questions i would say to my fellow students at the art school poetry and sculpture exist to keep our passions alive and somebody would say we would be much better without our passions or i would have a weeks anxiety over the problem do the arts make us happier or more sensitive and therefore more unhappy and i would say to hughes or sheppard if i cannot be certain they make us happier i will never write again if i spoke of these things to dowden he would put the question away with goodhumoured irony he seemed to condescend to everybody and everything and was now my sage i was about to learn that if a man is to write lyric poetry he must be shaped by nature and art to some one out of halfadozen traditional poses and be lover or saint sage or sensualist or mere mocker of all life and that none but that stroke of luckless luck can open before him the accumulated expression of the world and this thought before it could be knowledge was an instinct  i was vexed when my father called dowdens irony timidity but after many years his impression has not changed for he wrote to me but a few months ago it was like talking to a priest one had to be careful not to remind him of his sacrifice once after breakfast dowden read us some chapters of the unpublished life of shelley and i who had made the prometheus unbound my sacred book was delighted with all he read i was chilled however when he explained that he had lost his liking for shelley and would not have written it but for an old promise to the shelley family when it was published matthew arnold made sport of certain conventionalities and extravagances that were my father and i had come to see the violence or clumsiness of a conscientious man hiding from himself a lack of sympathy he had abandoned too or was about to abandon what was to have been his masterwork the life of goethe though in his youth a lecture course at alexandra college that spoke too openly of goethes loves had brought upon him the displeasure of our protestant archbishop of dublin only wordsworth he said kept more than all his early love  though my faith was shaken it was only when he urged me to read george eliot that i became angry and disillusioned  worked myself into a quarrel or halfquarrel i had read all victor hugos romances and a couple of balzacs and was in no mind to like her she seemed to have a distrust or a distaste for all in life that gives one a springing foot then too she knew so well how to enforce her distaste by the authority of her midvictorian science or by some habit of mind of its breeding that i who had not escaped the fascination of what i loathed doubted while the book lay open whatsoever my instinct knew of splendour she disturbed me and alarmed me but when i spoke of her to my father he threw her aside with a phrase oh she was an ugly woman who hated handsome men and handsome women and he began to praise wuthering heights  only the other day when i got dowdens letters did i discover for how many years the friendship between dowden and my father had been an antagonism my father had written from fitzroy road in the sixties that the brotherhood by which he meant the poet edwin ellis nettleship and himself abhorred wordsworth and dowden not remembering that another week would bring a different mood and abhorrence had written a pained and solemn letter my father had answered that dowden believed too much in the intellect and that all valuable education was but a stirring up of the emotions and had added that this did not mean excitability in the completely emotional man he wrote the least awakening of feeling is a harmony in which every chord of every feeling vibrates excitement is the feature of an insufficiently emotional nature the harsh vibrating discourse of but one or two chords living in a free world accustomed to the gay exaggeration of the talk of equals of men who talk and write to discover truth and not for popular instruction he had already when both men were in their twenties decided it is plain that dowden was a provincial   xxv  it was only when i began to study psychical research and mystical philosophy that i broke away from my fathers influence he had been a follower of john stuart mill and had grown to manhood with the scientific movement in this he had never been of rossettis party who said that it mattered to nobody whether the sun went round the earth or the earth round the sun but through this new research this reaction from popular science i had begun to feel that i had allies for my secret thought once when i was in dowdens drawingroom a servant announced my late headmaster i must have got pale or red for dowden with some ironical friendly remark brought me into another room and there i stayed until the visitor was gone a few months later when i met the headmaster again i had more courage we chanced upon one another in the street and he said i want you to use your influence with soandso for he is giving all his time to some sort of mysticism and he will fail in his examination i was in great alarm but i managed to say something about the children of this world being wiser than the children of light he went off with a brusque good morning i do not think that even at that age i would have been so grandiloquent but for my alarm he had however aroused all my indignation  my new allies and my old had alike sustained me intermediate examinations which i had always refused meant money for pupil and for teacher and that alone my father had brought me up never when at school to think of the future or of any practical result i have even known him to say when i was young the definition of a gentleman was a man not wholly occupied in getting on and yet this master wanted to withdraw my friend from the pursuit of the most important of all the truths my friend now in his last year at school was a show boy and had beaten all ireland again and again but now he and i were reading baron reichenbach on odic force and manuals published by the theosophical society we spent a good deal of time in the kildare street museum passing our hands over the glass cases feeling or believing we felt the odic force flowing from the big crystals we also found pins blindfolded and read papers on our discoveries to the hermetic society that met near the roof in york street i had when we first made our society proposed for our consideration that whatever the great poets had affirmed in their finest moments was the nearest we could come to an authoritative religion and that their mythology their spirits of water and wind were but literal truth i had read prometheus unbound with this thought in mind and wanted help to carry my study through all literature i was soon to vex my father by defining truth as the dramatically appropriate utterance of the highest man and if i had been asked to define the highest man i would have said perhaps we can but find him as homer found odysseus when he was looking for a theme  my friend had written to some missionary society to send him to the south seas when i offered him renans life of christ and a copy of esoteric buddhism he refused both but a few days later while reading for an examination in kildare street library he asked in an idle moment for esoteric buddhism and came out an esoteric buddhist he wrote to the missionaries withdrawing his letter and offered himself to the theosophical society as a chela he was vexed now at my lack of zeal for i had stayed somewhere between the books held there perhaps by my fathers scepticism i said and he thought it was a great joke though i was serious that even if i were certain in my own mind i did not know a single person with a talent for conviction for a time he made me ashamed of my world and its lack of zeal and i wondered if his world his father was a notorious orange leader where everything was a matter of belief was not better than mine he himself proposed the immediate conversion of the other show boy a clever little fellow now a dublin mathematician and still under five feet i found him a day later in much depression i said did he refuse to listen to you not at all was the answer for i had only been talking for a quarter of an hour when he said he believed certainly those minds parched by many examinations were thirsty  sometimes a professor of oriental languages at trinity college a persian came to our society and talked of the magicians of the east when he was a little boy he had seen a vision in a pool of ink a multitude of spirits singing in arabic woe unto those that do not believe in us and we persuaded a brahmin philosopher to come from london and stay for a few days with the only one among us who had rooms of his own it was my first meeting with a philosophy that confirmed my vague speculations and seemed at once logical and boundless consciousness he taught does not merely spread out its surface but has in vision and in contemplation another motion and can change in height and in depth a handsome young man with the typical face of christ he chaffed me goodhumouredly because he said i came at breakfast and began some question that was interrupted by the first caller waited in silence till ten or eleven at night when the last caller had gone and finished my question   xxvi  i thought a great deal about the system of education from which i had suffered and believing that everybody had a philosophical defence for all they did i desired greatly to meet some schoolmaster that i might question him for a moment it seemed as if i should have my desire i had been invited to read out a poem called the island of statues an arcadian play in imitation of edmund spenser to a gathering of critics who were to decide whether it was worthy of publication in the college magazine the magazine had already published a lyric of mine the first ever printed and people began to know my name we met in the rooms of mr c h oldham now professor of political economy at our new university and though professor bury then a very young man was to be the deciding voice mr oldham had asked quite a large audience when the reading was over and the poem had been approved i was left alone why i cannot remember with a young man who was i had been told a schoolmaster i was silent gathering my courage and he also was silent and presently i said without anything to lead up to it i know you will defend the ordinary system of education by saying that it strengthens the will but i am convinced that it only seems to do so because it weakens the impulses then i stopped overtaken by shyness he made no answer but smiled and looked surprised as though i had said you will say they are persian attire but let them be changed   xxvii  i had begun to frequent a club founded by mr oldham and not from natural liking but from a secret ambition i wished to become selfpossessed to be able to play with hostile minds as hamlet played to look in the lions face as it were with unquivering eyelash in ireland harsh argument which had gone out of fashion in england was still the manner of our conversation and at this club unionist and nationalist could interrupt one another and insult one another without the formal and traditional restraint of public speech sometimes they would change the subject  discuss socialism or a philosophical question merely to discover their old passions under a new shape i spoke easily and i thought well till some one was rude and then i would become silent or exaggerate my opinion to absurdity or hesitate and grow confused or be carried away myself by some party passion i would spend hours afterwards going over my words and putting the wrong ones right discovering that i was only selfpossessed with people i knew intimately i would often go to a strange house where i knew i would spend a wretched hour for schooling sake i did not discover that hamlet had his selfpossession from no schooling but from indifference and passion conquering sweetness and that less heroic minds can but hope it from old age   xxviii  i had very little money and one day the tolltaker at the metal bridge over the liffey and a gossip of his laughed when i refused the halfpenny and said no i will go round by oconnell bridge when i called for the first time at a house in leinster road several middleaged women were playing cards and suggested my taking a hand and gave me a glass of sherry the sherry went to my head and i was impoverished for days by the loss of sixpence my hostess was ellen oleary who kept house for her brother john oleary the fenian the handsomest old man i had ever seen he had been condemned to twenty years penal servitude but had been set free after five on condition that he did not return to ireland for fifteen years he had said to the government i will not return if germany makes war on you but i will return if france does he and his old sister lived exactly opposite the orange leader for whom he had a great respect his sister stirred my affection at first for no better reason than her likeness of face and figure to the matron of my london school a friendly person but when i came to know her i found sister and brother alike were of plutarchs people she told me of her brothers life how in his youth as now in his age he would spend his afternoons searching for rare books among secondhand bookshops how the fenian organizer james stephens had found him there and asked for his help i do not think you have any chance of success he had said but if you never ask me to enroll anybody else i will join it will be very good for the morals of the country she told me how it grew to be a formidable movement and of the arrests that followed i believe that her own sweetheart had somehow fallen among the wreckage of sentences of death pronounced upon false evidence amid a public panic and told it all without bitterness no fanaticism could thrive amid such gentleness she never found it hard to believe that an opponent had as high a motive as her own and needed upon her difficult road no spur of hate  her brother seemed very unlike on a first hearing for he had some violent oaths good god in heaven being one of them and if he disliked anything one said or did he spoke all his thought but in a little one heard his justice match her charity never has there been a cause so bad he would say that it has not been defended by good men for good reasons nor would he overvalue any man because they shared opinions and when he lent me the poems of davis and the young irelanders of whom i had known nothing he did not although the poems of davis had made him a patriot claim that they were very good poetry  his room was full of books always secondhand copies that had often been ugly and badly printed when new and had not grown to my unhistoric mind more pleasing from the dirt of some old dublin bookshop great numbers were irish and for the first time i began to read histories and verses that a catholic irishman knows from boyhood he seemed to consider politics almost wholly as a moral discipline and seldom said of any proposed course of action that it was practical or otherwise when he spoke to me of his prison life he spoke of all with seeming freedom but presently one noticed that he never spoke of hardship and if one asked him why he would say i was in the hands of my enemies why should i complain i have heard since that the governor of his jail found out that he had endured some unnecessary discomfort for months and had asked why he did not speak of it i did not come here to complain was the answer he had the moral genius that moves all young people and moves them the more if they are repelled by those who have strict opinions and yet have lived commonplace lives i had begun as would any other of my training to say violent and paradoxical things to shock provincial sobriety and dowdens ironical calm had come to seem but a professional pose but here was something as spontaneous as the life of an artist sometimes he would say things that would have sounded well in some heroic elizabethan play it became my delight to rouse him to these outbursts for i was the poet in the presence of his theme once when i was defending an irish politician who had made a great outcry because he was treated as a common felon by showing that he did it for the causes sake he said there are things that a man must not do even to save a nation he would speak a sentence like that in ignorance of its passionate value and would forget it the moment after  i met at his house friends of later life katharine tynan who still lived upon her fathers farm and dr hyde still a college student who took snuff like those mayo county people whose stories and songs he was writing down davitt wants followers by the thousand oleary would say i only want halfadozen one constant caller looked at me with much hostility john f taylor an obscure great orator the other day in dublin i overheard a man murmuring to another one of his speeches as i might some elizabethan lyric that is in my very bones it was delivered at some dublin debate some college society perhaps the lord chancellor had spoken with balanced unemotional sentences now selfcomplacent now in derision taylor began hesitating and stopping for words but after speaking very badly for a little straightened his figure and spoke as out of a dream i am carried to another age a nobler court and another lord chancellor is speaking i am at the court of the first pharaoh thereupon he put into the mouth of that egyptian all his audience had listened to but now it was spoken to the children of israel if you have any spirituality as you boast why not use our great empire to spread it through the world why still cling to that beggarly nationality of yours what are its history and its works weighed with those of egypt then his voice changed and sank i see a man at the edge of the crowd he is standing listening there but he will not obey and then with his voice rising to a cry had he obeyed he would never have come down the mountain carrying in his arms the tables of the law in the language of the outlaw  he had been in a linendrapers shop for a while had educated himself and put himself to college and was now as a lawyer famous for hopeless cases where unsure judgment could not make things worse and eloquence power of crossexamination and learning might amend all conversation with him was always argument and for an obstinate opponent he had such phrases as have you your head in a bag sir and i seemed his particular aversion as with many of the selfmade men of that generation carlyle was his chief literary enthusiasm supporting him as he believed in his contempt for the complexities and refinements he had not found in his hard life and i belonged to a generation that had begun to call carlyle rhetorician and demagogue i had once seen what i had believed to be an enraged bull in a field and had walked up to it as a test of courage to discover just as panic fell upon me that it was merely an irritable cow i braved taylor again and again but always found him worse than my expectation i would say quoting mill oratory is heard poetry is overheard and he would answer his voice full of contempt that there was always an audience and yet in his moments of lofty speech he himself was alone no matter what the crowd  at other times his science or his catholic orthodoxy i never could discover which would become enraged with my supernaturalism i can but once remember escaping him unabashed and unconquered i said with deliberate exaggeration at some evening party at olearys five out of every six people have seen a ghost and taylor fell into my net with well i will ask everybody here i managed that the first answer should come from a man who had heard a voice he believed to be that of his dead brother and the second from a doctors wife who had lived in a haunted house and met a man with his throat cut whose throat as he drifted along the gardenwalk had opened and closed like the mouth of a fish taylor threw up his head like an angry horse but asked no further question and did not return to the subject that evening if he had gone on he would have heard from everybody some like story though not all at first hand and miss oleary would have told him what happened at the death of one of the macmanus brothers well known in the politics of young ireland one brother was watching by the bed where the other lay dying and saw a strange hawklike bird fly through the open window and alight upon the breast of the dying man he did not dare to drive it away and it remained there as it seemed looking into his brothers eyes until death came and then it flew out of the window i think though i am not sure that she had the story from the watcher himself  it was understood that taylors temper kept him from public life though he may have been the greatest orator of his time partly because no leader would accept him and still more because in the words of one of his dublin enemies he had never joined any party and as soon as one joined him he seceded with oleary he was always even when they differed as they often did gentle and deferential but once only and that was years afterwards did i think that he was about to include me among his friends we met by chance in a london street and he stopped me with an abrupt movement yeats he said i have been thinking if you and  naming another aversion were born in a small italian principality in the middle ages he would have friends at court and you would be in exile with a price on your head he went off without another word and the next time we met he was no less offensive than before he imprisoned in himself and not the always unperturbed oleary comes before me as the tragic figure of my youth the same passion for all moral and physical splendour that drew him to oleary would make him beg leave to wear for some few days a friends ring or pin and gave him a heart that every pretty woman set on fire i doubt if he was happy in his loves for those his powerful intellect had fascinated were i believe repelled by his coarse red hair his gaunt ungainly body his stiff movements as of a dutch doll his badly rolled shabby umbrella and yet with women as with oleary he was gentle deferential almost diffident  a young ireland society met in the lecture hall of a workmans club in york street with oleary for president and there four or five university students and myself and occasionally taylor spoke on irish history or literature when taylor spoke it was a great event and his delivery in the course of a speech or lecture of some political verse by thomas davis gave me a conviction of how great might be the effect of verse spoken by a man almost rhythmdrunk at some moment of intensity the apex of long mounting thought verses that seemed when one saw them upon the page flat and empty caught from that voice whose beauty was half in its harsh strangeness nobility and style my father had always read verse with an equal intensity and a greater subtlety but this art was public and his private and it is taylors voice that rings in my ears and awakens my longing when i have heard some player speak lines so naturally as a famous player said to me that nobody can find out that it is verse at all i made a good many speeches more i believe as a training for selfpossession than from desire of speech  once our debates roused a passion that came to the newspapers and the streets there was an excitable man who had fought for the pope against the italian patriots and who always rode a white horse in our nationalist processions he got on badly with oleary who had told him that attempting to oppress others was a poor preparation for liberating your own country oleary had written some letter to the press condemning the irishamerican dynamite party as it was called and defining the limits of honourable warfare at the next meeting the papal soldier rose in the middle of the discussion on some other matter and moved a vote of censure on oleary i myself he said do not approve of bombs but i do not think that any irishman should be discouraged oleary ruled him out of order he refused to obey and remained standing those round him began to threaten he swung the chair he had been sitting on round his head and defied everybody however he was seized from all sides and thrown out and a special meeting called to expel him he wrote letters to the papers and addressed a crowd somewhere no young ireland society he protested could expel a man whose grandfather had been hanged in 1798 when the night of the special meeting came his expulsion was moved but before the vote could be taken an excited man announced that there was a crowd in the street that the papal soldier was making a speech that in a moment we should be attacked three or four of us ran and put our backs to the door while others carried on the debate it was an inner door with narrow glass windows at each side and through these we could see the streetdoor and the crowd in the street presently a man asked us through the crack in the door if we would as a favour leave the crowd to the workmans club upstairs in a couple of minutes there was a great noise of sticks and broken glass and after that our landlord came to find out who was to pay for the halllamp   xxix  from these debates from olearys conversation and from the irish books he lent or gave me has come all i have set my hand to since i had begun to know a great deal about the irish poets who had written in english i read with excitement books i should find unreadable today and found romance in lives that had neither wit nor adventure i did not deceive myself i knew how often they wrote a cold and abstract language and yet i who had never wanted to see the houses where keats and shelley lived would ask everybody what sort of place inchedony was because callanan had named after it a bad poem in the manner of childe harold walking home from a debate i remember saying to some college student ireland cannot put from her the habits learned from her old military civilization and from a church that prays in latin those popular poets have not touched her heart her poetry when it comes will be distinguished and lonely oleary had once said to me neither ireland nor england knows the good from the bad in any art but ireland unlike england does not hate the good when it is pointed out to her i began to plot and scheme how one might seal with the right image the soft wax before it began to harden i had noticed that irish catholics among whom had been born so many political martyrs had not the good taste the household courtesy and decency of the protestant ireland i had known and yet protestant ireland had begun to think of nothing but getting on i thought we might bring the halves together if we had a national literature that made ireland beautiful in the memory and yet had been freed from provincialism by an exacting criticism an european pose it was because of this dream when we returned to london that i made with pastels upon the ceiling of my study a map of sligo decorated like some old map with a ship and an elaborate compass and wrote a little against the grain a couple of sligo stories one a vague echo of grettir the strong which my father had read to me in childhood and finished with better heart my wanderings of oisin and began after ridding my style of romantic colour the countess cathleen i saw that our people did not read but that they listened patiently how many long political speeches have they listened to and saw that there must be a theatre and if i could find the right musicians words set to music i foresaw a great deal that we are doing now though never the appetite of our new middleclass for realism nor the greatness of the opposition nor the slowness of the victory davis had done so much in the four years of his working life i had thought all needful pamphleteering and speechmaking could be run through at the days end not knowing that taste is so much more deeply rooted than opinion that even if one had school and newspaper to help one could scarcely stir it under two generations then too bred up in a studio where all things are discussed and where i had even been told that indiscretion and energy are inseparable i knew nothing of the conservatism or of the suspicions of piety i had planned a drama like that of greece and romances that were it may be half hugo and half de la motte fouqué to bring into the town the memories and visions of the country and to spread everywhere the history and legends of mediaeval ireland and to fill ireland once more with sacred places i even planned out and in some detail for those mysterious lights and voices were never long forgotten another samothrace a new eleusis i believed so great was my faith or so deceptive the precedent of young ireland that i should find men of genius everywhere i had not the conviction as it may seem that a people can be compelled to write what one pleases for that could but end in rhetoric or in some educational movement but believed i had divined the soul of the people and had set my shoes upon a road that would be crowded presently   xxx  someone at the young ireland society gave me a newspaper that i might read some article or letter i began idly reading verses describing the shore of ireland as seen by a returning dying emigrant my eyes filled with tears and yet i knew the verses were badly writtenvague abstract words such as one finds in a newspaper i looked at the end and saw the name of some political exile who had died but a few days after his return to ireland they had moved me because they contained the actual thoughts of a man at a passionate moment of life and when i met my father i was full of the discovery we should write out our own thoughts in as nearly as possible the language we thought them in as though in a letter to an intimate friend we should not disguise them in any way for our lives give them force as the lives of people in plays give force to their words personal utterance which had almost ceased in english literature could be as fine an escape from rhetoric and abstraction as drama itself my father was indignant almost violent and would hear of nothing but drama personal utterance was only egotism i knew it was not but as yet did not know how to explain the difference i tried from that on to write out of my emotions exactly as they came to me in life not changing them to make them more beautiful and to rid my syntax of all inversions and my vocabulary of literary words and that made it hard to write at all it meant rejecting the words or the constructions that had been used over and over because they flow most easily into rhyme and measure then too how hard it was to be sincere not to make the emotion more beautiful and more violent or the circumstance more romantic if i can be sincere and make my language natural and without becoming discursive like a novelist and so indiscreet and prosaic i said to myself i shall if good luck or bad luck make my life interesting be a great poet for it will be no longer a matter of literature at all yet when i reread those early poems which gave me so much trouble i find little but romantic convention unconscious drama it is so many years before one can believe enough in what one feels even to know what the feeling is   xxxi  perhaps a year before we returned to london a catholic friend brought me to a spiritualistic seance at the house of a young man who had been lately arrested under a suspicion of fenianism but had been released for lack of evidence he and his friends had been sitting weekly about a table in the hope of spiritual manifestation and one had developed mediumship a drawer full of books had leaped out of the table when no one was touching it a picture had moved upon the wall there were some half dozen of us and our host began by making passes until the medium fell asleep sitting upright in his chair then the lights were turned out and we sat waiting in the dim light of a fire presently my shoulders began to twitch and my hands i could easily have stopped them but i had never heard of such a thing and i was curious after a few minutes the movement became violent and i stopped it i sat motionless for a while and then my whole body moved like a suddenly unrolled watchspring and i was thrown backward on the wall i again stilled the movement and sat at the table everybody began to say i was a medium and that if i would not resist some wonderful thing would happen i remembered that my father had told me that balzac had once desired to take opium for the experience sake but would not because he dreaded the surrender of his will we were now holding each others hands and presently my right hand banged the knuckles of the woman next to me upon the table she laughed and the medium speaking for the first time and with difficulty out of his mesmeric sleep said tell her there is great danger he stood up and began walking round me making movements with his hands as though he were pushing something away i was now struggling vainly with this force which compelled me to movements i had not willed and my movements had become so violent that the table was broken i tried to pray and because i could not remember a prayer repeated in a loud voice    of mans first disobedience and the fruit   of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste   brought death into the world and all our woe   sing heavenly muse  my catholic friend had left the table and was saying a pater noster and ave maria in the corner presently all became still and so dark that i could not see anybody i described it to somebody next day as like going out of a noisy political meeting on to a quiet country road i said to myself i am now in a trance but i no longer have any desire to resist but when i turned my eyes to the fireplace i could see a faint gleam of light so i thought no i am not in a trance then i saw shapes faintly appearing in the darkness  thought they are spirits but they were only the spiritualists and my friend at her prayers the medium said in a faint voice we are through the bad spirits i said will they ever come again do you think and he said no never again i think and in my boyish vanity i thought it was i who had banished them for years afterwards i would not go to a seance or turn a table and would often ask myself what was that violent impulse that had run through my nerves was it a part of myselfsomething always to be a danger perhaps or had it come from without as it seemed   xxxii  i had published my first book of poems by subscription oleary finding many subscribers and a book of stories when i heard that my grandmother was dead and went to sligo for the funeral she had asked to see me but by some mistake i was not sent for she had heard that i was much about with a beautiful admired woman and feared that i did not speak of marriage because i was poor and wanted to say to me women care nothing about money my grandfather was dying also and only survived her a few weeks i went to see him and wondered at his handsome face now sickness had refined it and noticed that he foretold the changes in the weather by indications of the light and of the temperature that could not have told me anything as i sat there my old childish fear returned and i was glad to get away i stayed with my uncle whose house was opposite where my grandfather lived and walking home with him one day we met the doctor the doctor said there was no hope and that my grandfather should be told but my uncle would not allow it he said it would make a man mad to know he was dying in vain the doctor pleaded that he had never known a man not made calmer by the knowledge i listened sad and angry but my uncle always took a low view of human nature his very tolerance which was exceedingly great came from his hoping nothing of anybody before he had given way my grandfather lifted up his arms and cried out there she is and fell backward dead before he was dead old servants of that house where there had never been noise or disorder began their small pilferings and after his death there was a quarrel over the disposition of certain mantlepiece ornaments of no value   xxxiii  for some months now i have lived with my own youth and childhood not always writing indeed but thinking of it almost every day and i am sorrowful and disturbed it is not that i have accomplished too few of my plans for i am not ambitious but when i think of all the books i have read and of the wise words i have heard spoken and of the anxiety i have given to parents and grandparents and of the hopes that i have had all life weighed in the scales of my own life seems to me a preparation for something that never happens   printed in the united states of america
