that i should prefix to the following biographical sketch some mention of the reasons which have made me think it desirable that i should leave behind me such a memorial of so uneventful a life as mine i do not for a moment imagine that any part of what i have to relate can be interesting to the public as a narrative or as being connected with myself but i have thought that in an age in which education and its improvement are the subject of more if not of profounder study than at any former period of english history it may be useful that there should be some record of an education which was unusual and remarkable and which whatever else it may have done has proved how much more than is commonly supposed may be taught and well taught in those early years which in the common modes of what is called instruction are little better than wasted it has also seemed to me that in an age of transition in opinions there may be somewhat both of interest and of benefit in noting the successive phases of any mind which was always pressing forward equally ready to learn and to unlearn either from its own thoughts or from those of others but a motive which weighs more with me than either of these is a desire to make acknowledgment of the debts which my intellectual and moral development owes to other persons some of them of recognised eminence others less known than they deserve to be and the one to whom most of all is due one whom the world had no opportunity of knowing the reader whom these things do not interest has only himself to blame if he reads farther and i do not desire any other indulgence from him than that of bearing in mind that for him these pages were not written  i was born in london on the 20th of may 1806 and was the eldest son of james mill the author of the history of british india my father the son of a petty tradesman and i believe small farmer at northwater bridge in the county of angus was when a boy recommended by his abilities to the notice of sir john stuart of fettercairn one of the barons of the exchequer in scotland and was in consequence sent to the university of edinburgh at the expense of a fund established by lady jane stuart the wife of sir john stuart and some other ladies for educating young men for the scottish church he there went through the usual course of study and was licensed as a preacher but never followed the profession having satisfied himself that he could not believe the doctrines of that or any other church for a few years he was a private tutor in various families in scotland among others that of the marquis of tweeddale but ended by taking up his residence in london and devoting himself to authorship nor had he any other means of support until 1819 when he obtained an appointment in the india house  in this period of my fathers life there are two things which it is impossible not to be struck with one of them unfortunately a very common circumstance the other a most uncommon one the first is that in his position with no resource but the precarious one of writing in periodicals he married and had a large family conduct than which nothing could be more opposed both as a matter of good sense and of duty to the opinions which at least at a later period of life he strenuously upheld the other circumstance is the extraordinary energy which was required to lead the life he led with the disadvantages under which he laboured from the first and with those which he brought upon himself by his marriage it would have been no small thing had he done no more than to support himself and his family during so many years by writing without ever being in debt or in any pecuniary difficulty holding as he did opinions both in politics and in religion which were more odious to all persons of influence and to the common run of prosperous englishmen in that generation than either before or since and being not only a man whom nothing would have induced to write against his convictions but one who invariably threw into everything he wrote as much of his convictions as he thought the circumstances would in any way permit being it must also be said one who never did anything negligently never undertook any task literary or other on which he did not conscientiously bestow all the labour necessary for performing it adequately but he with these burdens on him planned commenced and completed the history of india and this in the course of about ten years a shorter time than has been occupied even by writers who had no other employment in the production of almost any other historical work of equal bulk and of anything approaching to the same amount of reading and research and to this is to be added that during the whole period a considerable part of almost every day was employed in the instruction of his children in the case of one of whom myself he exerted an amount of labour care and perseverance rarely if ever employed for a similar purpose in endeavouring to give according to his own conception the highest order of intellectual education  a man who in his own practice so vigorously acted up to the principle of losing no time was likely to adhere to the same rule in the instruction of his pupil i have no remembrance of the time when i began to learn greek i have been told that it was when i was three years old my earliest recollection on the subject is that of committing to memory what my father termed vocables being lists of common greek words with their signification in english which he wrote out for me on cards of grammar until some years later i learnt no more than the inflections of the nouns and verbs but after a course of vocables proceeded at once to translation and i faintly remember going through aesops fables the first greek book which i read the anabasis which i remember better was the second i learnt no latin until my eighth year at that time i had read under my fathers tuition a number of greek prose authors among whom i remember the whole of herodotus and of xenophons cyropaedia and memorials of socrates some of the lives of the philosophers by diogenes laertius part of lucian and isocrates ad demonicum and ad nicoclem i also read in 1813 the first six dialogues in the common arrangement of plato from the euthyphron to the theoctetus inclusive which last dialogue i venture to think would have been better omitted as it was totally impossible i should understand it but my father in all his teaching demanded of me not only the utmost that i could do but much that i could by no possibility have done what he was himself willing to undergo for the sake of my instruction may be judged from the fact that i went through the whole process of preparing my greek lessons in the same room and at the same table at which he was writing and as in those days greek and english lexicons were not and i could make no more use of a greek and latin lexicon than could be made without having yet begun to learn latin i was forced to have recourse to him for the meaning of every word which i did not know this incessant interruption he one of the most impatient of men submitted to and wrote under that interruption several volumes of his history and all else that he had to write during those years  the only thing besides greek that i learnt as a lesson in this part of my childhood was arithmetic this also my father taught me it was the task of the evenings and i well remember its disagreeableness but the lessons were only a part of the daily instruction i received much of it consisted in the books i read by myself and my fathers discourses to me chiefly during our walks from 1810 to the end of 1813 we were living in newington green then an almost rustic neighbourhood my fathers health required considerable and constant exercise and he walked habitually before breakfast generally in the green lanes towards hornsey in these walks i always accompanied him and with my earliest recollections of green fields and wild flowers is mingled that of the account i gave him daily of what i had read the day before to the best of my remembrance this was a voluntary rather than a prescribed exercise i made notes on slips of paper while reading and from these in the morning walks i told the story to him for the books were chiefly histories of which i read in this manner a great number robertsons histories hume gibbon but my greatest delight then and for long afterwards was watsons philip the second and third the heroic defence of the knights of malta against the turks and of the revolted provinces of the netherlands against spain excited in me an intense and lasting interest next to watson my favourite historical reading was hookes history of rome of greece i had seen at that time no regular history except school abridgments and the last two or three volumes of a translation of rollins ancient history beginning with philip of macedon but i read with great delight langhornes translation of plutarch in english history beyond the time at which hume leaves off i remember reading burnets history of his own time though i cared little for anything in it except the wars and battles and the historical part of the annual register from the beginning to about 1788 where the volumes my father borrowed for me from mr bentham left off i felt a lively interest in frederic of prussia during his difficulties and in paoli the corsican patriot but when i came to the american war i took my part like a child as i was until set right by my father on the wrong side because it was called the english side in these frequent talks about the books i read he used as opportunity offered to give me explanations and ideas respecting civilization government morality mental cultivation which he required me afterwards to restate to him in my own words he also made me read and give him a verbal account of many books which would not have interested me sufficiently to induce me to read them of myself among others millars historical view of the english government a book of great merit for its time and which he highly valued mosheims ecclesiastical history mccries life of john knox and even sewell and ruttys histories of the quakers he was fond of putting into my hands books which exhibited men of energy and resource in unusual circumstances struggling against difficulties and overcoming them of such works i remember beavers african memoranda and collinss account of the first settlement of new south wales two books which i never wearied of reading were ansons voyages so delightful to most young persons and a collection hawkesworths i believe of voyages round the world in four volumes beginning with drake and ending with cook and bougainville of childrens books any more than of playthings i had scarcely any except an occasional gift from a relation or acquaintance among those i had robinson crusoe was preeminent and continued to delight me through all my boyhood it was no part however of my fathers system to exclude books of amusement though he allowed them very sparingly of such books he possessed at that time next to none but he borrowed several for me those which i remember are the arabian nights cazottes arabian tales don quixote miss edgeworths popular tales and a book of some reputation in its day brookes fool of quality  in my eighth year i commenced learning latin in conjunction with a younger sister to whom i taught it as i went on and who afterwards repeated the lessons to my father from this time other sisters and brothers being successively added as pupils a considerable part of my days work consisted of this preparatory teaching it was a part which i greatly disliked the more so as i was held responsible for the lessons of my pupils in almost as full a sense as for my own i however derived from this discipline the great advantage of learning more thoroughly and retaining more lastingly the things which i was set to teach perhaps too the practice it afforded in explaining difficulties to others may even at that age have been useful in other respects the experience of my boyhood is not favourable to the plan of teaching children by means of one another the teaching i am sure is very inefficient as teaching and i well know that the relation between teacher and taught is not a good moral discipline to either i went in this manner through the latin grammar and a considerable part of cornelius nepos and caesars commentaries but afterwards added to the superintendence of these lessons much longer ones of my own  in the same year in which i began latin i made my first commencement in the greek poets with the iliad after i had made some progress in this my father put popes translation into my hands it was the first english verse i had cared to read and it became one of the books in which for many years i most delighted i think i must have read it from twenty to thirty times through i should not have thought it worth while to mention a taste apparently so natural to boyhood if i had not as i think observed that the keen enjoyment of this brilliant specimen of narrative and versification is not so universal with boys as i should have expected both a priori and from my individual experience soon after this time i commenced euclid and somewhat later algebra still under my fathers tuition  from my eighth to my twelfth year the latin books which i remember reading were the bucolics of virgil and the first six books of the aeneid all horace except the epodes the fables of phaedrus the first five books of livy to which from my love of the subject i voluntarily added in my hours of leisure the remainder of the first decade all sallust a considerable part of ovids metamorphoses some plays of terence two or three books of lucretius several of the orations of cicero and of his writings on oratory also his letters to atticus my father taking the trouble to translate to me from the french the historical explanations in mingaults notes in greek i read the iliad and odyssey through one or two plays of sophocles euripides and aristophanes though by these i profited little all thucydides the hellenics of xenophon a great part of demosthenes aeschines and lysias theocritus anacreon part of the anthology a little of dionysius several books of polybius and lastly aristotles rhetoric which as the first expressly scientific treatise on any moral or psychological subject which i had read and containing many of the best observations of the ancients on human nature and life my father made me study with peculiar care and throw the matter of it into synoptic tables during the same years i learnt elementary geometry and algebra thoroughly the differential calculus and other portions of the higher mathematics far from thoroughly for my father not having kept up this part of his early acquired knowledge could not spare time to qualify himself for removing my difficulties and left me to deal with them with little other aid than that of books while i was continually incurring his displeasure by my inability to solve difficult problems for which he did not see that i had not the necessary previous knowledge  as to my private reading i can only speak of what i remember history continued to be my strongest predilection and most of all ancient history mitfords greece i read continually my father had put me on my guard against the tory prejudices of this writer and his perversions of facts for the whitewashing of despots and blackening of popular institutions these points he discoursed on exemplifying them from the greek orators and historians with such effect that in reading mitford my sympathies were always on the contrary side to those of the author and i could to some extent have argued the point against him yet this did not diminish the ever new pleasure with which i read the book roman history both in my old favourite hooke and in ferguson continued to delight me a book which in spite of what is called the dryness of its style i took great pleasure in was the ancient universal history through the incessant reading of which i had my head full of historical details concerning the obscurest ancient people while about modern history except detached passages such as the dutch war of independence i knew and cared comparatively little a voluntary exercise to which throughout my boyhood i was much addicted was what i called writing histories i successively composed a roman history picked out of hooke and an abridgment of the ancient universal history a history of holland from my favourite watson and from an anonymous compilation and in my eleventh and twelfth year i occupied myself with writing what i flattered myself was something serious this was no less than a history of the roman government compiled with the assistance of hooke from livy and dionysius of which i wrote as much as would have made an octavo volume extending to the epoch of the licinian laws it was in fact an account of the struggles between the patricians and plebeians which now engrossed all the interest in my mind which i had previously felt in the mere wars and conquests of the romans i discussed all the constitutional points as they arose though quite ignorant of niebuhrs researches i by such lights as my father had given me vindicated the agrarian laws on the evidence of livy and upheld to the best of my ability the roman democratic party a few years later in my contempt of my childish efforts i destroyed all these papers not then anticipating that i could ever feel any curiosity about my first attempts at writing and reasoning my father encouraged me in this useful amusement though as i think judiciously he never asked to see what i wrote so that i did not feel that in writing it i was accountable to any one nor had the chilling sensation of being under a critical eye  but though these exercises in history were never a compulsory lesson there was another kind of composition which was so namely writing verses and it was one of the most disagreeable of my tasks greek and latin verses i did not write nor learnt the prosody of those languages my father thinking this not worth the time it required contented himself with making me read aloud to him and correcting false quantities i never composed at all in greek even in prose and but little in latin not that my father could be indifferent to the value of this practice in giving a thorough knowledge of these languages but because there really was not time for it the verses i was required to write were english when i first read popes homer i ambitiously attempted to compose something of the same kind and achieved as much as one book of a continuation of the iliad there probably the spontaneous promptings of my poetical ambition would have stopped but the exercise begun from choice was continued by command conformably to my fathers usual practice of explaining to me as far as possible the reasons for what he required me to do he gave me for this as i well remember two reasons highly characteristic of him one was that some things could be expressed better and more forcibly in verse than in prose this he said was a real advantage the other was that people in general attached more value to verse than it deserved and the power of writing it was on this account worth acquiring he generally left me to choose my own subjects which as far as i remember were mostly addresses to some mythological personage or allegorical abstraction but he made me translate into english verse many of horaces shorter poems i also remember his giving me thomsons winter to read and afterwards making me attempt without book to write something myself on the same subject the verses i wrote were of course the merest rubbish nor did i ever attain any facility of versification but the practice may have been useful in making it easier for me at a later period to acquire readiness of expression1 i had read up to this time very little english poetry shakspeare my father had put into my hands chiefly for the sake of the historical plays from which however i went on to the others my father never was a great admirer of shakspeare the english idolatry of whom he used to attack with some severity he cared little for any english poetry except milton for whom he had the highest admiration goldsmith burns and grays bard which he preferred to his elegy perhaps i may add cowper and beattie he had some value for spenser and i remember his reading to me unlike his usual practice of making me read to him the first book of the fairie queene but i took little pleasure in it the poetry of the present century he saw scarcely any merit in and i hardly became acquainted with any of it till i was grown up to manhood except the metrical romances of walter scott which i read at his recommendation and was intensely delighted with as i always was with animated narrative drydens poems were among my fathers books and many of these he made me read but i never cared for any of them except alexanders feast which as well as many of the songs in walter scott i used to sing internally to a music of my own to some of the latter indeed i went so far as to compose airs which i still remember cowpers short poems i read with some pleasure but never got far into the longer ones and nothing in the two volumes interested me like the prose account of his three hares in my thirteenth year i met with campbells poems among which lochiel hohenlinden the exile of erin and some others gave me sensations i had never before experienced from poetry here too i made nothing of the longer poems except the striking opening of gertrude of wyoming which long kept its place in my feelings as the perfection of pathos  during this part of my childhood one of my greatest amusements was experimental science in the theoretical however not the practical sense of the word not trying experimentsa kind of discipline which i have often regretted not having hadnor even seeing but merely reading about them i never remember being so wrapt up in any book as i was in joyces scientific dialogues and i was rather recalcitrant to my fathers criticisms of the bad reasoning respecting the first principles of physics which abounds in the early part of that work i devoured treatises on chemistry especially that of my fathers early friend and schoolfellow dr thomson for years before i attended a lecture or saw an experiment  from about the age of twelve i entered into another and more advanced stage in my course of instruction in which the main object was no longer the aids and appliances of thought but the thoughts themselves this commenced with logic in which i began at once with the organon and read it to the analytics inclusive but profited little by the posterior analytics which belong to a branch of speculation i was not yet ripe for contemporaneously with the organon my father made me read the whole or parts of several of the latin treatises on the scholastic logic giving each day to him in our walks a minute account of what i had read and answering his numerous and most searching questions after this i went in a similar manner through the computatio sive logica of hobbes a work of a much higher order of thought than the books of the school logicians and which he estimated very highly in my own opinion beyond its merits great as these are it was his invariable practice whatever studies he exacted from me to make me as far as possible understand and feel the utility of them and this he deemed peculiarly fitting in the case of the syllogistic logic the usefulness of which had been impugned by so many writers of authority i well remember how and in what particular walk in the neighbourhood of bagshot heath where we were on a visit to his old friend mr wallace then one of the mathematical professors at sandhurst he first attempted by questions to make me think on the subject and frame some conception of what constituted the utility of the syllogistic logic and when i had failed in this to make me understand it by explanations the explanations did not make the matter at all clear to me at the time but they were not therefore useless they remained as a nucleus for my observations and reflections to crystallize upon the import of his general remarks being interpreted to me by the particular instances which came under my notice afterwards my own consciousness and experience ultimately led me to appreciate quite as highly as he did the value of an early practical familiarity with the school logic i know of nothing in my education to which i think myself more indebted for whatever capacity of thinking i have attained the first intellectual operation in which i arrived at any proficiency was dissecting a bad argument and finding in what part the fallacy lay and though whatever capacity of this sort i attained was due to the fact that it was an intellectual exercise in which i was most perseveringly drilled by my father yet it is also true that the school logic and the mental habits acquired in studying it were among the principal instruments of this drilling i am persuaded that nothing in modern education tends so much when properly used to form exact thinkers who attach a precise meaning to words and propositions and are not imposed on by vague loose or ambiguous terms the boasted influence of mathematical studies is nothing to it for in mathematical processes none of the real difficulties of correct ratiocination occur it is also a study peculiarly adapted to an early stage in the education of philosophical students since it does not presuppose the slow process of acquiring by experience and reflection valuable thoughts of their own they may become capable of disentangling the intricacies of confused and selfcontradictory thought before their own thinking faculties are much advanced a power which for want of some such discipline many otherwise able men altogether lack and when they have to answer opponents only endeavour by such arguments as they can command to support the opposite conclusion scarcely even attempting to confute the reasonings of their antagonists and therefore at the utmost leaving the question as far as it depends on argument a balanced one  during this time the latin and greek books which i continued to read with my father were chiefly such as were worth studying not for the language merely but also for the thoughts this included much of the orators and especially demosthenes some of whose principal orations i read several times over and wrote out by way of exercise a full analysis of them my fathers comments on these orations when i read them to him were very instructive to me he not only drew my attention to the insight they afforded into athenian institutions and the principles of legislation and government which they often illustrated but pointed out the skill and art of the oratorhow everything important to his purpose was said at the exact moment when he had brought the minds of his audience into the state most fitted to receive it how he made steal into their minds gradually and by insinuation thoughts which if expressed in a more direct manner would have roused their opposition most of these reflections were beyond my capacity of full comprehension at the time but they left seed behind which germinated in due season at this time i also read the whole of tacitus juvenal and quintilian the latter owing to his obscure style and to the scholastic details of which many parts of his treatise are made up is little read and seldom sufficiently appreciated his book is a kind of encyclopaedia of the thoughts of the ancients on the whole field of education and culture and i have retained through life many valuable ideas which i can distinctly trace to my reading of him even at that early age it was at this period that i read for the first time some of the most important dialogues of plato in particular the gorgias the protagoras and the republic there is no author to whom my father thought himself more indebted for his own mental culture than plato or whom he more frequently recommended to young students i can bear similar testimony in regard to myself the socratic method of which the platonic dialogues are the chief example is unsurpassed as a discipline for correcting the errors and clearing up the confusions incident to the intellectus sibi permissus the understanding which has made up all its bundles of associations under the guidance of popular phraseology the close searching elenchus by which the man of vague generalities is constrained either to express his meaning to himself in definite terms or to confess that he does not know what he is talking about the perpetual testing of all general statements by particular instances the siege in form which is laid to the meaning of large abstract terms by fixing upon some still larger classname which includes that and more and dividing down to the thing soughtmarking out its limits and definition by a series of accurately drawn distinctions between it and each of the cognate objects which are successively parted off from it all this as an education for precise thinking is inestimable and all this even at that age took such hold of me that it became part of my own mind i have felt ever since that the title of platonist belongs by far better right to those who have been nourished in and have endeavoured to practise platos mode of investigation than to those who are distinguished only by the adoption of certain dogmatical conclusions drawn mostly from the least intelligible of his works and which the character of his mind and writings makes it uncertain whether he himself regarded as anything more than poetic fancies or philosophic conjectures  in going through plato and demosthenes since i could now read these authors as far as the language was concerned with perfect ease i was not required to construe them sentence by sentence but to read them aloud to my father answering questions when asked but the particular attention which he paid to elocution in which his own excellence was remarkable made this reading aloud to him a most painful task of all things which he required me to do there was none which i did so constantly ill or in which he so perpetually lost his temper with me he had thought much on the principles of the art of reading especially the most neglected part of it the inflections of the voice or modulation as writers on elocution call it in contrast with articulation on the one side and expression on the other and had reduced it to rules grounded on the logical analysis of a sentence these rules he strongly impressed upon me and took me severely to task for every violation of them but i even then remarked though i did not venture to make the remark to him that though he reproached me when i read a sentence ill and told me how i ought to have read it he never by reading it himself showed me how it ought to be read a defect running through his otherwise admirable modes of instruction as it did through all his modes of thought was that of trusting too much to the intelligibleness of the abstract when not embodied in the concrete it was at a much later period of my youth when practising elocution by myself or with companions of my own age that i for the first time understood the object of his rules and saw the psychological grounds of them at that time i and others followed out the subject into its ramifications and could have composed a very useful treatise grounded on my fathers principles he himself left those principles and rules unwritten i regret that when my mind was full of the subject from systematic practice i did not put them and our improvements of them into a formal shape  a book which contributed largely to my education in the best sense of the term was my fathers history of india it was published in the beginning of 1818 during the year previous while it was passing through the press i used to read the proof sheets to him or rather i read the manuscript to him while he corrected the proofs the number of new ideas which i received from this remarkable book and the impulse and stimulus as well as guidance given to my thoughts by its criticism and disquisitions on society and civilization in the hindoo part on institutions and the acts of governments in the english part made my early familiarity with it eminently useful to my subsequent progress and though i can perceive deficiencies in it now as compared with a perfect standard i still think it if not the most one of the most instructive histories ever written and one of the books from which most benefit may be derived by a mind in the course of making up its opinions  the preface among the most characteristic of my fathers writings as well as the richest in materials of thought gives a picture which may be entirely depended on of the sentiments and expectations with which he wrote the history saturated as the book is with the opinions and modes of judgment of a democratic radicalism then regarded as extreme and treating with a severity at that time most unusual the english constitution the english law and all parties and classes who possessed any considerable influence in the country he may have expected reputation but certainly not advancement in life from its publication nor could he have supposed that it would raise up anything but enemies for him in powerful quarters least of all could he have expected favour from the east india company to whose commercial privileges he was unqualifiedly hostile and on the acts of whose government he had made so many severe comments though in various parts of his book he bore a testimony in their favour which he felt to be their just due namely that no government had on the whole given so much proof to the extent of its lights of good intention towards its subjects and that if the acts of any other government had the light of publicity as completely let in upon them they would in all probability still less bear scrutiny  on learning however in the spring of 1819 about a year after the publication of the history that the east india directors desired to strengthen the part of their home establishment which was employed in carrying on the correspondence with india my father declared himself a candidate for that employment and to the credit of the directors successfully he was appointed one of the assistants of the examiner of india correspondence officers whose duty it was to prepare drafts of despatches to india for consideration by the directors in the principal departments of administration in this office and in that of examiner which he subsequently attained the influence which his talents his reputation and his decision of character gave him with superiors who really desired the good government of india enabled him to a great extent to throw into his drafts of despatches and to carry through the ordeal of the court of directors and board of control without having their force much weakened his real opinions on indian subjects in his history he had set forth for the first time many of the true principles of indian administration and his despatches following his history did more than had ever been done before to promote the improvement of india and teach indian officials to understand their business if a selection of them were published they would i am convinced place his character as a practical statesman fully on a level with his eminence as a speculative writer  this new employment of his time caused no relaxation in his attention to my education it was in this same year 1819 that he took me through a complete course of political economy his loved and intimate friend ricardo had shortly before published the book which formed so great an epoch in political economy a book which would never have been published or written but for the entreaty and strong encouragement of my father for ricardo the most modest of men though firmly convinced of the truth of his doctrines deemed himself so little capable of doing them justice in exposition and expression that he shrank from the idea of publicity the same friendly encouragement induced ricardo a year or two later to become a member of the house of commons where during the remaining years of his life unhappily cut short in the full vigour of his intellect he rendered so much service to his and my fathers opinions both on political economy and on other subjects  though ricardos great work was already in print no didactic treatise embodying its doctrines in a manner fit for learners had yet appeared my father therefore commenced instructing me in the science by a sort of lectures which he delivered to me in our walks he expounded each day a portion of the subject and i gave him next day a written account of it which he made me rewrite over and over again until it was clear precise and tolerably complete in this manner i went through the whole extent of the science and the written outline of it which resulted from my daily compte rendu served him afterwards as notes from which to write his elements of political economy after this i read ricardo giving an account daily of what i read and discussing in the best manner i could the collateral points which offered themselves in our progress  on money as the most intricate part of the subject he made me read in the same manner ricardos admirable pamphlets written during what was called the bullion controversy to these succeeded adam smith and in this reading it was one of my fathers main objects to make me apply to smiths more superficial view of political economy the superior lights of ricardo and detect what was fallacious in smiths arguments or erroneous in any of his conclusions such a mode of instruction was excellently calculated to form a thinker but it required to be worked by a thinker as close and vigorous as my father the path was a thorny one even to him and i am sure it was so to me notwithstanding the strong interest i took in the subject he was often and much beyond reason provoked by my failures in cases where success could not have been expected but in the main his method was right and it succeeded i do not believe that any scientific teaching ever was more thorough or better fitted for training the faculties than the mode in which logic and political economy were taught to me by my father striving even in an exaggerated degree to call forth the activity of my faculties by making me find out everything for myself he gave his explanations not before but after i had felt the full force of the difficulties and not only gave me an accurate knowledge of these two great subjects as far as they were then understood but made me a thinker on both i thought for myself almost from the first and occasionally thought differently from him though for a long time only on minor points and making his opinion the ultimate standard at a later period i even occasionally convinced him and altered his opinion on some points of detail which i state to his honour not my own it at once exemplifies his perfect candour and the real worth of his method of teaching  at this point concluded what can properly be called my lessons when i was about fourteen i left england for more than a year and after my return though my studies went on under my fathers general direction he was no longer my schoolmaster i shall therefore pause here and turn back to matters of a more general nature connected with the part of my life and education included in the preceding reminiscences  in the course of instruction which i have partially retraced the point most superficially apparent is the great effort to give during the years of childhood an amount of knowledge in what are considered the higher branches of education which is seldom acquired if acquired at all until the age of manhood the result of the experiment shows the ease with which this may be done and places in a strong light the wretched waste of so many precious years as are spent in acquiring the modicum of latin and greek commonly taught to schoolboys a waste which has led so many educational reformers to entertain the illjudged proposal of discarding these languages altogether from general education if i had been by nature extremely quick of apprehension or had possessed a very accurate and retentive memory or were of a remarkably active and energetic character the trial would not be conclusive but in all these natural gifts i am rather below than above par what i could do could assuredly be done by any boy or girl of average capacity and healthy physical constitution and if i have accomplished anything i owe it among other fortunate circumstances to the fact that through the early training bestowed on me by my father i started i may fairly say with an advantage of a quarter of a century over my contemporaries  there was one cardinal point in this training of which i have already given some indication and which more than anything else was the cause of whatever good it effected most boys or youths who have had much knowledge drilled into them have their mental capacities not strengthened but overlaid by it they are crammed with mere facts and with the opinions or phrases of other people and these are accepted as a substitute for the power to form opinions of their own and thus the sons of eminent fathers who have spared no pains in their education so often grow up mere parroters of what they have learnt incapable of using their minds except in the furrows traced for them mine however was not an education of cram my father never permitted anything which i learnt to degenerate into a mere exercise of memory he strove to make the understanding not only go along with every step of the teaching but if possible precede it anything which could be found out by thinking i never was told until i had exhausted my efforts to find it out for myself as far as i can trust my remembrance i acquitted myself very lamely in this department my recollection of such matters is almost wholly of failures hardly ever of success it is true the failures were often in things in which success in so early a stage of my progress was almost impossible i remember at some time in my thirteenth year on my happening to use the word idea he asked me what an idea was and expressed some displeasure at my ineffectual efforts to define the word i recollect also his indignation at my using the common expression that something was true in theory but required correction in practice and how after making me vainly strive to define the word theory he explained its meaning and showed the fallacy of the vulgar form of speech which i had used leaving me fully persuaded that in being unable to give a correct definition of theory and in speaking of it as something which might be at variance with practice i had shown unparalleled ignorance in this he seems and perhaps was very unreasonable but i think only in being angry at my failure a pupil from whom nothing is ever demanded which he cannot do never does all he can  one of the evils most liable to attend on any sort of early proficiency and which often fatally blights its promise my father most anxiously guarded against this was selfconceit he kept me with extreme vigilance out of the way of hearing myself praised or of being led to make selfflattering comparisons between myself and others from his own intercourse with me i could derive none but a very humble opinion of myself and the standard of comparison he always held up to me was not what other people did but what a man could and ought to do he completely succeeded in preserving me from the sort of influences he so much dreaded i was not at all aware that my attainments were anything unusual at my age if i accidentally had my attention drawn to the fact that some other boy knew less than myselfwhich happened less often than might be imaginedi concluded not that i knew much but that he for some reason or other knew little or that his knowledge was of a different kind from mine my state of mind was not humility but neither was it arrogance i never thought of saying to myself i am or i can do so and so i neither estimated myself highly nor lowly i did not estimate myself at all if i thought anything about myself it was that i was rather backward in my studies since i always found myself so in comparison with what my father expected from me i assert this with confidence though it was not the impression of various persons who saw me in my childhood they as i have since found thought me greatly and disagreeably selfconceited probably because i was disputatious and did not scruple to give direct contradictions to things which i heard said i suppose i acquired this bad habit from having been encouraged in an unusual degree to talk on matters beyond my age and with grown persons while i never had inculcated on me the usual respect for them my father did not correct this illbreeding and impertinence probably from not being aware of it for i was always too much in awe of him to be otherwise than extremely subdued and quiet in his presence yet with all this i had no notion of any superiority in myself and well was it for me that i had not i remember the very place in hyde park where in my fourteenth year on the eve of leaving my fathers house for a long absence he told me that i should find as i got acquainted with new people that i had been taught many things which youths of my age did not commonly know and that many persons would be disposed to talk to me of this and to compliment me upon it what other things he said on this topic i remember very imperfectly but he wound up by saying that whatever i knew more than others could not be ascribed to any merit in me but to the very unusual advantage which had fallen to my lot of having a father who was able to teach me and willing to give the necessary trouble and time that it was no matter of praise to me if i knew more than those who had not had a similar advantage but the deepest disgrace to me if i did not i have a distinct remembrance that the suggestion thus for the first time made to me that i knew more than other youths who were considered well educated was to me a piece of information to which as to all other things which my father told me i gave implicit credence but which did not at all impress me as a personal matter i felt no disposition to glorify myself upon the circumstance that there were other persons who did not know what i knew nor had i ever flattered myself that my acquirements whatever they might be were any merit of mine but now when my attention was called to the subject i felt that what my father had said respecting my peculiar advantages was exactly the truth and common sense of the matter and it fixed my opinion and feeling from that time forward     chapter ii  moral influences in early youth my fathers character and opinions   in my education as in that of everyone the moral influences which are so much more important than all others are also the most complicated and the most difficult to specify with any approach to completeness without attempting the hopeless task of detailing the circumstances by which in this respect my early character may have been shaped i shall confine myself to a few leading points which form an indispensable part of any true account of my education  i was brought up from the first without any religious belief in the ordinary acceptation of the term my father educated in the creed of scotch presbyterianism had by his own studies and reflections been early led to reject not only the belief in revelation but the foundations of what is commonly called natural religion i have heard him say that the turning point of his mind on the subject was reading butlers analogy that work of which he always continued to speak with respect kept him as he said for some considerable time a believer in the divine authority of christianity by proving to him that whatever are the difficulties in believing that the old and new testaments proceed from or record the acts of a perfectly wise and good being the same and still greater difficulties stand in the way of the belief that a being of such a character can have been the maker of the universe he considered butlers argument as conclusive against the only opponents for whom it was intended those who admit an omnipotent as well as perfectly just and benevolent maker and ruler of such a world as this can say little against christianity but what can with at least equal force be retorted against themselves finding therefore no halting place in deism he remained in a state of perplexity until doubtless after many struggles he yielded to the conviction that concerning the origin of things nothing whatever can be known this is the only correct statement of his opinion for dogmatic atheism he looked upon as absurd as most of those whom the world has considered atheists have always done these particulars are important because they show that my fathers rejection of all that is called religious belief was not as many might suppose primarily a matter of logic and evidence the grounds of it were moral still more than intellectual he found it impossible to believe that a world so full of evil was the work of an author combining infinite power with perfect goodness and righteousness his intellect spurned the subtleties by which men attempt to blind themselves to this open contradiction the sabaean or manichaean theory of a good and an evil principle struggling against each other for the government of the universe he would not have equally condemned and i have heard him express surprise that no one revived it in our time he would have regarded it as a mere hypothesis but he would have ascribed to it no depraving influence as it was his aversion to religion in the sense usually attached to the term was of the same kind with that of lucretius he regarded it with the feelings due not to a mere mental delusion but to a great moral evil he looked upon it as the greatest enemy of morality first by setting up fictitious excellencesbelief in creeds devotional feelings and ceremonies not connected with the good of humankindand causing these to be accepted as substitutes for genuine virtues but above all by radically vitiating the standard of morals making it consist in doing the will of a being on whom it lavishes indeed all the phrases of adulation but whom in sober truth it depicts as eminently hateful i have a hundred times heard him say that all ages and nations have represented their gods as wicked in a constantly increasing progression that mankind have gone on adding trait after trait till they reached the most perfect conception of wickedness which the human mind can devise and have called this god and prostrated themselves before it this ne plus ultra of wickedness he considered to be embodied in what is commonly presented to mankind as the creed of christianity think he used to say of a being who would make a hellwho would create the human race with the infallible foreknowledge and therefore with the intention that the great majority of them were to be consigned to horrible and everlasting torment the time i believe is drawing near when this dreadful conception of an object of worship will be no longer identified with christianity and when all persons with any sense of moral good and evil will look upon it with the same indignation with which my father regarded it my father was as well aware as anyone that christians do not in general undergo the demoralizing consequences which seem inherent in such a creed in the manner or to the extent which might have been expected from it the same slovenliness of thought and subjection of the reason to fears wishes and affections which enable them to accept a theory involving a contradiction in terms prevents them from perceiving the logical consequences of the theory such is the facility with which mankind believe at one and the same time things inconsistent with one another and so few are those who draw from what they receive as truths any consequences but those recommended to them by their feelings that multitudes have held the undoubting belief in an omnipotent author of hell and have nevertheless identified that being with the best conception they were able to form of perfect goodness their worship was not paid to the demon which such a being as they imagined would really be but to their own ideal of excellence the evil is that such a belief keeps the ideal wretchedly low and opposes the most obstinate resistance to all thought which has a tendency to raise it higher believers shrink from every train of ideas which would lead the mind to a clear conception and an elevated standard of excellence because they feel even when they do not distinctly see that such a standard would conflict with many of the dispensations of nature and with much of what they are accustomed to consider as the christian creed and thus morality continues a matter of blind tradition with no consistent principle nor even any consistent feeling to guide it  it would have been wholly inconsistent with my fathers ideas of duty to allow me to acquire impressions contrary to his convictions and feelings respecting religion and he impressed upon me from the first that the manner in which the world came into existence was a subject on which nothing was known that the question who made me cannot be answered because we have no experience or authentic information from which to answer it and that any answer only throws the difficulty a step further back since the question immediately presents itself who made god he at the same time took care that i should be acquainted with what had been thought by mankind on these impenetrable problems i have mentioned at how early an age he made me a reader of ecclesiastical history and he taught me to take the strongest interest in the reformation as the great and decisive contest against priestly tyranny for liberty of thought  i am thus one of the very few examples in this country of one who has not thrown off religious belief but never had it i grew up in a negative state with regard to it i looked upon the modern exactly as i did upon the ancient religion as something which in no way concerned me it did not seem to me more strange that english people should believe what i did not than that the men i read of in herodotus should have done so history had made the variety of opinions among mankind a fact familiar to me and this was but a prolongation of that fact this point in my early education had however incidentally one bad consequence deserving notice in giving me an opinion contrary to that of the world my father thought it necessary to give it as one which could not prudently be avowed to the world this lesson of keeping my thoughts to myself at that early age was attended with some moral disadvantages though my limited intercourse with strangers especially such as were likely to speak to me on religion prevented me from being placed in the alternative of avowal or hypocrisy i remember two occasions in my boyhood on which i felt myself in this alternative and in both cases i avowed my disbelief and defended it my opponents were boys considerably older than myself one of them i certainly staggered at the time but the subject was never renewed between us the other who was surprised and somewhat shocked did his best to convince me for some time without effect  the great advance in liberty of discussion which is one of the most important differences between the present time and that of my childhood has greatly altered the moralities of this question and i think that few men of my fathers intellect and public spirit holding with such intensity of moral conviction as he did unpopular opinions on religion or on any other of the great subjects of thought would now either practise or inculcate the withholding of them from the world unless in the cases becoming fewer every day in which frankness on these subjects would either risk the loss of means of subsistence or would amount to exclusion from some sphere of usefulness peculiarly suitable to the capacities of the individual on religion in particular the time appears to me to have come when it is the duty of all who being qualified in point of knowledge have on mature consideration satisfied themselves that the current opinions are not only false but hurtful to make their dissent known at least if they are among those whose station or reputation gives their opinion a chance of being attended to such an avowal would put an end at once and for ever to the vulgar prejudice that what is called very improperly unbelief is connected with any bad qualities either of mind or heart the world would be astonished if it knew how great a proportion of its brightest ornamentsof those most distinguished even in popular estimation for wisdom and virtueare complete sceptics in religion many of them refraining from avowal less from personal considerations than from a conscientious though now in my opinion a most mistaken apprehension lest by speaking out what would tend to weaken existing beliefs and by consequence as they suppose existing restraints they should do harm instead of good  of unbelievers so called as well as of believers there are many species including almost every variety of moral type but the best among them as no one who has had opportunities of really knowing them will hesitate to affirm are more genuinely religious in the best sense of the word religion than those who exclusively arrogate to themselves the title the liberality of the age or in other words the weakening of the obstinate prejudice which makes men unable to see what is before their eyes because it is contrary to their expectations has caused it be very commonly admitted that a deist may be truly religious but if religion stands for any graces of character and not for mere dogma the assertion may equally be made of many whose belief is far short of deism though they may think the proof incomplete that the universe is a work of design and though they assuredly disbelieve that it can have an author and governor who is absolute in power as well as perfect in goodness they have that which constitutes the principal worth of all religions whatever an ideal conception of a perfect being to which they habitually refer as the guide of their conscience and this ideal of good is usually far nearer to perfection than the objective deity of those who think themselves obliged to find absolute goodness in the author of a world so crowded with suffering and so deformed by injustice as ours  my fathers moral convictions wholly dissevered from religion were very much of the character of those of the greek philosophers and were delivered with the force and decision which characterized all that came from him even at the very early age at which i read with him the memorabilia of xenophon i imbibed from that work and from his comments a deep respect for the character of socrates who stood in my mind as a model of ideal excellence and i well remember how my father at that time impressed upon me the lesson of the choice of hercules at a somewhat later period the lofty moral standard exhibited in the writings of plato operated upon me with great force my fathers moral inculcations were at all times mainly those of the socratici viri justice temperance to which he gave a very extended application veracity perseverance readiness to encounter pain and especially labour regard for the public good estimation of persons according to their merits and of things according to their intrinsic usefulness a life of exertion in contradiction to one of selfindulgent ease and sloth these and other moralities he conveyed in brief sentences uttered as occasion arose of grave exhortation or stern reprobation and contempt  but though direct moral teaching does much indirect does more and the effect my father produced on my character did not depend solely on what he said or did with that direct object but also and still more on what manner of man he was  in his views of life he partook of the character of the stoic the epicurean and the cynic not in the modern but the ancient sense of the word in his personal qualities the stoic predominated his standard of morals was epicurean inasmuch as it was utilitarian taking as the exclusive test of right and wrong the tendency of actions to produce pleasure or pain but he had and this was the cynic element scarcely any belief in pleasure at least in his later years of which alone on this point i can speak confidently he was not insensible to pleasures but he deemed very few of them worth the price which at least in the present state of society must be paid for them the greater number of miscarriages in life he considered to be attributable to the overvaluing of pleasures accordingly temperance in the large sense intended by the greek philosophers stopping short at the point of moderation in all indulgenceswas with him as with them almost the central point of educational precept his inculcations of this virtue fill a large place in my childish remembrances he thought human life a poor thing at best after the freshness of youth and of unsatisfied curiosity had gone by this was a topic on which he did not often speak especially it may be supposed in the presence of young persons but when he did it was with an air of settled and profound conviction he would sometimes say that if life were made what it might be by good government and good education it would be worth having but he never spoke with anything like enthusiasm even of that possibility he never varied in rating intellectual enjoyments above all others even in value as pleasures independently of their ulterior benefits the pleasures of the benevolent affections he placed high in the scale and used to say that he had never known a happy old man except those who were able to live over again in the pleasures of the young for passionate emotions of all sorts and for everything which bas been said or written in exaltation of them he professed the greatest contempt he regarded them as a form of madness the intense was with him a byeword of scornful disapprobation he regarded as an aberration of the moral standard of modern times compared with that of the ancients the great stress laid upon feeling feelings as such he considered to be no proper subjects of praise or blame right and wrong good and bad he regarded as qualities solely of conductof acts and omissions there being no feeling which may not lead and does not frequently lead either to good or to bad actions conscience itself the very desire to act right often leading people to act wrong consistently carrying out the doctrine that the object of praise and blame should be the discouragement of wrong conduct and the encouragement of right he refused to let his praise or blame be influenced by the motive of the agent he blamed as severely what he thought a bad action when the motive was a feeling of duty as if the agents had been consciously evil doers he would not have accepted as a plea in mitigation for inquisitors that they sincerely believed burning heretics to be an obligation of conscience but though he did not allow honesty of purpose to soften his disapprobation of actions it had its full effect on his estimation of characters no one prized conscientiousness and rectitude of intention more highly or was more incapable of valuing any person in whom he did not feel assurance of it but he disliked people quite as much for any other deficiency provided he thought it equally likely to make them act ill he disliked for instance a fanatic in any bad cause as much as or more than one who adopted the same cause from selfinterest because he thought him even more likely to be practically mischievous and thus his aversion to many intellectual errors or what he regarded as such partook in a certain sense of the character of a moral feeling all this is merely saying that he in a degree once common but now very unusual threw his feelings into his opinions which truly it is difficult to understand how anyone who possesses much of both can fail to do none but those who do not care about opinions will confound this with intolerance those who having opinions which they hold to be immensely important and their contraries to be prodigiously hurtful have any deep regard for the general good will necessarily dislike as a class and in the abstract those who think wrong what they think right and right what they think wrong though they need not therefore be nor was my father insensible to good qualities in an opponent nor governed in their estimation of individuals by one general presumption instead of by the whole of their character i grant that an earnest person being no more infallible than other men is liable to dislike people on account of opinions which do not merit dislike but if he neither himself does them any ill office nor connives at its being donc by others he is not intolerant and the forbearance which flows from a conscientious sense of the importance to mankind of the equal freedom of all opinions is the only tolerance which is commendable or to the highest moral order of minds possible  it will be admitted that a man of the opinions and the character above described was likely to leave a strong moral impression on any mind principally formed by him and that his moral teaching was not likely to err on the side of laxity or indulgence the element which was chiefly deficient in his moral relation to his children was that of tenderness i do not believe that this deficiency lay in his own nature i believe him to have had much more feeling than he habitually showed and much greater capacities of feeling than were ever developed he resembled most englishmen in being ashamed of the signs of feeling and by the absence of demonstration starving the feelings themselves if we consider further that he was in the trying position of sole teacher and add to this that his temper was constitutionally irritable it is impossible not to feel true pity for a father who did and strove to do so much for his children who would have so valued their affection yet who must have been constantly feeling that fear of him was drying it up at its source this was no longer the case later in life and with his younger children they loved him tenderly and if i cannot say so much of myself i was always loyally devoted to him as regards my own education i hesitate to pronounce whether i was more a loser or gainer by his severity it was not such as to prevent me from having a happy childhood and i do not believe that boys can be induced to apply themselves with vigour andwhat is so much more difficultperseverance to dry and irksome studies by the sole force of persuasion and soft words much must be done and much must be learnt by children for which rigid discipline and known liability to punishment are indispensable as means it is no doubt a very laudable effort in modern teaching to render as much as possible of what the young are required to learn easy and interesting to them but when this principle is pushed to the length of not requiring them to learn anything but what has been made easy and interesting one of the chief objects of education is sacrificed i rejoice in the decline of the old brutal and tyrannical system of teaching which however did succeed in enforcing habits of application but the new as it seems to me is training up a race of men who will be incapable of doing anything which is disagreeable to them i do not then believe that fear as an element in education can be dispensed with but i am sure that it ought not to be the main element and when it predominates so much as to preclude love and confidence on the part of the child to those who should be the unreservedly trusted advisers of after years and perhaps to seal up the fountains of frank and spontaneous communicativeness in the childs nature it is an evil for which a large abatement must be made from the benefits moral and intellectual which may flow from any other part of the education  during this first period of my life the habitual frequenters of my fathers house were limited to a very few persons most of them little known to the world but whom personal worth and more or less of congeniality with at least his political opinions not so frequently to be met with then as since inclined him to cultivate and his conversations with them i listened to with interest and instruction my being an habitual inmate of my fathers study made me acquainted with the dearest of his friends david ricardo who by his benevolent countenance and kindliness of manner was very attractive to young persons and who after i became a student of political economy invited me to his house and to walk with him in order to converse on the subject i was a more frequent visitor from about 1817 or 1818 to mr hume who born in the same part of scotland as my father and having been i rather think a younger schoolfellow or college companion of his had on returning from india renewed their youthful acquaintance and whocoming like many others greatly under the influence of my fathers intellect and energy of characterwas induced partly by that influence to go into parliament and there adopt the line of conduct which has given him an honourable place in the history of his country of mr bentham i saw much more owing to the close intimacy which existed between him and my father i do not know how soon after my fathers first arrival in england they became acquainted but my father was the earliest englishman of any great mark who thoroughly understood and in the main adopted benthams general views of ethics government and law and this was a natural foundation for sympathy between them and made them familiar companions in a period of benthams life during which he admitted much fewer visitors than was the case subsequently at this time mr bentham passed some part of every year at barrow green house in a beautiful part of the surrey hills a few miles from godstone and there i each summer accompanied my father in a long visit in 1813 mr bentham my father and i made an excursion which included oxford bath and bristol exeter plymouth and portsmouth in this journey i saw many things which were instructive to me and acquired my first taste for natural scenery in the elementary form of fondness for a view in the succeeding winter we moved into a house very near mr benthams which my father rented from him in queen square westminster from 1814 to 1817 mr bentham lived during half of each year at ford abbey in somersetshire or rather in a part of devonshire surrounded by somersetshire which intervals i had the advantage of passing at that place this sojourn was i think an important circumstance in my education nothing contributes more to nourish elevation of sentiments in a people than the large and free character of their habitations the middleage architecture the baronial hall and the spacious and lofty rooms of this fine old place so unlike the mean and cramped externals of english middleclass life gave the sentiment of a larger and freer existence and were to me a sort of poetic cultivation aided also by the character of the grounds in which the abbey stood which were riant and secluded umbrageous and full of the sound of falling waters  i owed another of the fortunate circumstances in my education a years residence in france to mr benthams brother general sir samuel bentham i had seen sir samuel bentham and his family at their house near gosport in the course of the tour already mentioned he being then superintendent of the dockyard at portsmouth and during a stay of a few days which they made at ford abbey shortly after the peace before going to live on the continent in 1820 they invited me for a six months visit to them in the south of france which their kindness ultimately prolonged to nearly a twelvemonth sir samuel bentham though of a character of mind different from that of his illustrious brother was a man of very considerable attainments and general powers with a decided genius for mechanical art his wife a daughter of the celebrated chemist dr fordyce was a woman of strong will and decided character much general knowledge and great practical good sense of the edgeworth kind she was the ruling spirit of the household as she deserved and was well qualified to be their family consisted of one son the eminent botanist and three daughters the youngest about two years my senior i am indebted to them for much and various instruction and for an almost parental interest in my welfare when i first joined them in may 1820 they occupied the château of pompignan still belonging to a descendant of voltaires enemy on the heights overlooking the plain of the garonne between montauban and toulouse i accompanied them in an excursion to the pyrenees including a stay of some duration at bagnères de bigorre a journey to pau bayonne and bagnères de luchon and an ascent of the pic du midi de bigorre  this first introduction to the highest order of mountain scenery made the deepest impression on me and gave a colour to my tastes through life in october we proceeded by the beautiful mountain route of castres and st pons from toulouse to montpellier in which last neighbourhood sir samuel had just bought the estate of restinclière near the foot of the singular mountain of st loup during this residence in france i acquired a familiar knowledge of the french language and acquaintance with the ordinary french literature i took lessons in various bodily exercises in none of which however i made any proficiency and at montpellier i attended the excellent winter courses of lectures at the faculté des sciences those of m anglada on chemistry of m provençal on zoology and of a very accomplished representative of the eighteenth century metaphysics m gergonne on logic under the name of philosophy of the sciences i also went through a course of the higher mathematics under the private tuition of m lenthéric a professor at the lycée of montpellier but the greatest perhaps of the many advantages which i owed to this episode in my education was that of having breathed for a whole year the free and genial atmosphere of continental life this advantage was not the less real though i could not then estimate nor even consciously feel it having so little experience of english life and the few people i knew being mostly such as had public objects of a large and personally disinterested kind at heart i was ignorant of the low moral tone of what in england is called society the habit of not indeed professing but taking for granted in every mode of implication that conduct is of course always directed towards low and petty objects the absence of high feelings which manifests itself by sneering depreciation of all demonstrations of them and by general abstinence except among a few of the stricter religionists from professing any high principles of action at all except in those preordained cases in which such profession is put on as part of the costume and formalities of the occasion i could not then know or estimate the difference between this manner of existence and that of a people like the french whose faults if equally real are at all events different among whom sentiments which by comparison at least may be called elevated are the current coin of human intercourse both in books and in private life and though often evaporating in profession are yet kept alive in the nation at large by constant exercise and stimulated by sympathy so as to form a living and active part of the existence of great numbers of persons and to be recognised and understood by all neither could i then appreciate the general culture of the understanding which results from the habitual exercise of the feelings and is thus carried down into the most uneducated classes of several countries on the continent in a degree not equalled in england among the socalled educated except where an unusual tenderness of conscience leads to a habitual exercise of the intellect on questions of right and wrong i did not know the way in which among the ordinary english the absence of interest in things of an unselfish kind except occasionally in a special thing here and there and the habit of not speaking to others nor much even to themselves about the things in which they do feel interest causes both their feelings and their intellectual faculties to remain undeveloped or to develop themselves only in some single and very limited direction reducing them considered as spiritual beings to a kind of negative existence all these things i did not perceive till long afterwards but i even then felt though without stating it clearly to myself the contrast between the frank sociability and amiability of french personal intercourse and the english mode of existence in which everybody acts as if everybody else with few or no exceptions was either an enemy or a bore in france it is true the bad as well as the good points both of individual and of national character come more to the surface and break out more fearlessly in ordinary intercourse than in england but the general habit of the people is to show as well as to expect friendly feeling in every one towards every other wherever there is not some positive cause for the opposite in england it is only of the best bred people in the upper or upper middle ranks that anything like this can be said  in my way through paris both going and returning i passed some time in the house of m say the eminent political economist who was a friend and correspondent of my father having become acquainted with him on a visit to england a year or two after the peace he was a man of the later period of the french revolution a fine specimen of the best kind of french republican one of those who had never bent the knee to bonaparte though courted by him to do so a truly upright brave and enlightened man he lived a quiet and studious life made happy by warm affections public and private he was acquainted with many of the chiefs of the liberal party and i saw various noteworthy persons while staying at this house among whom i have pleasure in the recollection of having once seen saintsimon not yet the founder either of a philosophy or a religion and considered only as a clever original the chief fruit which i carried away from the society i saw was a strong and permanent interest in continental liberalism of which i ever afterwards kept myself au courant as much as of english politics a thing not at all usual in those days with englishmen and which had a very salutary influence on my development keeping me free from the error always prevalent in englandand from which even my father with all his superiority to prejudice was not exemptof judging universal questions by a merely english standard after passing a few weeks at caen with an old friend of my fathers i returned to england in july 1821 and my education resumed its ordinary course     chapter iii  last stage of education and first of selfeducation   for the first year or two after my visit to france i continued my old studies with the addition of some new ones when i returned my father was just finishing for the press his elements of political economy and he made me perform an exercise on the manuscript which mr bentham practised on all his own writings making what he called marginal contents a short abstract of every paragraph to enable the writer more easily to judge of and improve the order of the ideas and the general character of the exposition soon after my father put into my hands condillacs traité des sensations and the logical and metaphysical volumes of his cours detudes the first notwithstanding the superficial resemblance between condillacs psychological system and my fathers quite as much for a warning as for an example i am not sure whether it was in this winter or the next that i first read a history of the french revolution i learnt with astonishment that the principles of democracy then apparently in so insignificant and hopeless a minority everywhere in europe had borne all before them in france thirty years earlier and had been the creed of the nation as may be supposed from this i had previously a very vague idea of that great commotion i knew only that the french had thrown off the absolute monarchy of louis xiv and xv had put the king and queen to death guillotined many persons one of whom was lavoisier and had ultimately fallen under the despotism of bonaparte from this time as was natural the subject took an immense hold of my feelings it allied itself with all my juvenile aspirations to the character of a democratic champion what had happened so lately seemed as if it might easily happen again and the most transcendent glory i was capable of conceiving was that of figuring successful or unsuccessful as a girondist in an english convention  during the winter of 18212 mr john austin with whom at the time of my visit to france my father had but lately become acquainted kindly allowed me to read roman law with him my father notwithstanding his abhorrence of the chaos of barbarism called english law had turned his thoughts towards the bar as on the whole less ineligible for me than any other profession and these readings with mr austin who had made benthams best ideas his own and added much to them from other sources and from his own mind were not only a valuable introduction to legal studies but an important portion of general education with mr austin i read heineccius on the institutes his roman antiquities and part of his exposition of the pandects to which was added a considerable portion of blackstone it was at the commencement of these studies that my father as a needful accompaniment to them put into my hands benthams principal speculations as interpreted to the continent and indeed to all the world by dumont in the traité de législation the reading of this book was an epoch in my life one of the turning points in my mental history  my previous education had been in a certain sense already a course of benthamism the benthamic standard of the greatest happiness was that which i had always been taught to apply i was even familiar with an abstract discussion of it forming an episode in an unpublished dialogue on government written by my father on the platonic model yet in the first pages of bentham it burst upon me with all the force of novelty what thus impressed me was the chapter in which bentham passed judgment on the common modes of reasoning in morals and legislation deduced from phrases like law of nature right reason the moral sense natural rectitude and the like and characterized them as dogmatism in disguise imposing its sentiments upon others under cover of sounding expressions which convey no reason for the sentiment but set up the sentiment as its own reason it had not struck me before that benthams principle put an end to all this the feeling rushed upon me that all previous moralists were superseded and that here indeed was the commencement of a new era in thought this impression was strengthened by the manner in which bentham put into scientific form the application of the happiness principle to the morality of actions by analysing the various classes and orders of their consequences but what struck me at that time most of all was the classification of offences which is much more clear compact and imposing in dumonts rédaction than in the original work of bentham from which it was taken logic and the dialectics of plato which had formed so large a part of my previous training had given me a strong relish for accurate classification this taste had been strengthened and enlightened by the study of botany on the principles of what is called the natural method which i had taken up with great zeal though only as an amusement during my stay in france and when i found scientific classification applied to the great and complex subject of punishable acts under the guidance of the ethical principle of pleasurable and painful consequences followed out in the method of detail introduced into these subjects by bentham i felt taken up to an eminence from which i could survey a vast mental domain and see stretching out into the distance intellectual results beyond all computation as i proceeded further there seemed to be added to this intellectual clearness the most inspiring prospects of practical improvement in human affairs to benthams general view of the construction of a body of law i was not altogether a stranger having read with attention that admirable compendium my fathers article on jurisprudence but i had read it with little profit and scarcely any interest no doubt from its extremely general and abstract character and also because it concerned the form more than the substance of the corpus juris the logic rather than the ethics of law but benthams subject was legislation of which jurisprudence is only the formal part and at every page he seemed to open a clearer and broader conception of what human opinions and institutions ought to be how they might be made what they ought to be and how far removed from it they now are when i laid down the last volume of the traité i had become a different being the principle of utility understood as bentham understood it and applied in the manner in which he applied it through these three volumes fell exactly into its place as the keystone which held together the detached and fragmentary component parts of my knowledge and beliefs it gave unity to my conceptions of things i now had opinions a creed a doctrine a philosophy in one among the best senses of the word a religion the inculcation and diffusion of which could be made the principal outward purpose of a life and i had a grand conception laid before me of changes to be effected in the condition of mankind through that doctrine the traité de legislation wound up with what was to me a most impressive picture of human life as it would be made by such opinions and such laws as were recommended in the treatise the anticipations of practicable improvement were studiously moderate deprecating and discountenancing as reveries of vague enthusiasm many things which will one day seem so natural to human beings that injustice will probably be done to those who once thought them chimerical but in my state of mind this appearance of superiority to illusion added to the effect which benthams doctrines produced on me by heightening the impression of mental power and the vista of improvement which he did open was sufficiently large and brilliant to light up my life as well as to give a definite shape to my aspirations  after this i read from time to time the most important of the other works of bentham which had then seen the light either as written by himself or as edited by dumont this was my private reading while under my fathers direction my studies were carried into the higher branches of analytic psychology i now read lockes essay and wrote out an account of it consisting of a complete abstract of every chapter with such remarks as occurred to me which was read by or i think to my father and discussed throughout i performed the same process with helvetius de lesprit which i read of my own choice this preparation of abstracts subject to my fathers censorship was of great service to me by compelling precision in conceiving and expressing psychological doctrines whether accepted as truths or only regarded as the opinion of others after helvetius my father made me study what he deemed the really masterproduction in the philosophy of mind hartleys observations on man this book though it did not like the traité de législation give a new colour to my existence made a very similar impression on me in regard to its immediate subject hartleys explanation incomplete as in many points it is of the more complex mental phenomena by the law of association commended itself to me at once as a real analysis and made me feel by contrast the insufficiency of the merely verbal generalizations of condillac and even of the instructive gropings and feelings about for psychological explanations of locke it was at this very time that my father commenced writing his analysis of the mind which carried hartleys mode of explaining the mental phenomena to so much greater length and depth he could only command the concentration of thought necessary for this work during the complete leisure of his holiday for a month or six weeks annually and he commenced it in the summer of 1822 in the first holiday he passed at dorking in which neighbourhood from that time to the end of his life with the exception of two years he lived as far as his official duties permitted for six months of every year he worked at the analysis during several successive vacations up to the year 1829 when it was published and allowed me to read the manuscript portion by portion as it advanced the other principal english writers on mental philosophy i read as i felt inclined particularly berkeley humes essays reid dugald stewart and brown on cause and effect browns lectures i did not read until two or three years later nor at that time had my father himself read them  among the works read in the course of this year which contributed materially to my development i owe it to mention a book written on the foundation of some of benthams manuscripts and published under the pseudonyme of philip beauchamp entitled analysis of the influence of natural religion on the temporal happiness of mankind this was an examination not of the truth but of the usefulness of religious belief in the most general sense apart from the peculiarities of any special revelation which of all the parts of the discussion concerning religion is the most important in this age in which real belief in any religious doctrine is feeble and precarious but the opinion of its necessity for moral and social purposes almost universal and when those who reject revelation very generally take refuge in an optimistic deism a worship of the order of nature and the supposed course of providence at least as full of contradictions and perverting to the moral sentiments as any of the forms of christianity if only it is as completely realized yet very little with any claim to a philosophical character has been written by sceptics against the usefulness of this form of belief the volume bearing the name of philip beauchamp had this for its special object having been shown to my father in manuscript it was put into my hands by him and i made a marginal analysis of it as i had done of the elements of political economy next to the traité de législation it was one of the books which by the searching character of its analysis produced the greatest effect upon me on reading it lately after an interval of many years i find it to have some of the defects as well as the merits of the benthamic modes of thought and to contain as i now think many weak arguments but with a great overbalance of sound ones and much good material for a more completely philosophic and conclusive treatment of the subject  i have now i believe mentioned all the books which had any considerable effect on my early mental development from this point i began to carry on my intellectual cultivation by writing still more than by reading in the summer of 1822 i wrote my first argumentative essay i remember very little about it except that it was an attack on what i regarded as the aristocratic prejudice that the rich were or were likely to be superior in moral qualities to the poor my performance was entirely argumentative without any of the declamation which the subject would admit of and might be expected to suggest to a young writer in that department however i was and remained very inapt dry argument was the only thing i could manage or willingly attempted though passively i was very susceptible to the effect of all composition whether in the form of poetry or oratory which appealed to the feelings on any basis of reason my father who knew nothing of this essay until it was finished was well satisfied and as i learnt from others even pleased with it but perhaps from a desire to promote the exercise of other mental faculties than the purely logical he advised me to make my next exercise in composition one of the oratorical kind on which suggestion availing myself of my familiarity with greek history and ideas and with the athenian orators i wrote two speeches one an accusation the other a defence of pericles on a supposed impeachment for not marching out to fight the lacedemonians on their invasion of attica after this i continued to write papers on subjects often very much beyond my capacity but with great benefit both from the exercise itself and from the discussions which it led to with my father  i had now also begun to converse on general subjects with the instructed men with whom i came in contact and the opportunities of such contact naturally became more numerous the two friends of my father from whom i derived most and with whom i most associated were mr grote and mr john austin the acquaintance of both with my father was recent but had ripened rapidly into intimacy mr grote was introduced to my father by mr ricardo i think in 1819 being then about twentyfive years old and sought assiduously his society and conversation already a highly instructed man he was yet by the side of my father a tyro in the great subjects of human opinion but he rapidly seized on my fathers best ideas and in the department of political opinion he made himself known as early as 1820 by a pamphlet in defence of radical reform in reply to a celebrated article by sir james mackintosh then lately published in he edinburgh review mr grotes father the banker was i believe a thorough tory and his mother intensely evangelical so that for his liberal opinions he was in no way indebted to home influences but unlike most persons who have the prospect of being rich by inheritance he had though actively engaged in the business of banking devoted a great portion of time to philosophic studies and his intimacy with my father did much to decide the character of the next stage in his mental progress him i often visited and my conversations with him on political moral and philosophical subjects gave me in addition to much valuable instruction all the pleasure and benefit of sympathetic communion with a man of the high intellectual and moral eminence which his life and writings have since manifested to the world  mr austin who was four or five years older than mr grote was the eldest son of a retired miller in suffolk who had made money by contracts during the war and who must have been a man of remarkable qualities as i infer from the fact that all his sons were of more than common ability and all eminently gentlemen the one with whom we are now concerned and whose writings on jurisprudence have made him celebrated was for some time in the army and served in sicily under lord william bentinck after the peace he sold his commission and studied for the bar to which he had been called for some time before my father knew him he was not like mr grote to any extent a pupil of my father but he had attained by reading and thought a considerable number of the same opinions modified by his own very decided individuality of character he was a man of great intellectual powers which in conversation appeared at their very best from the vigour and richness of expression with which under the excitement of discussion he was accustomed to maintain some view or other of most general subjects and from an appearance of not only strong but deliberate and collected will mixed with a certain bitterness partly derived from temperament and partly from the general cast of his feelings and reflections the dissatisfaction with life and the world felt more or less in the present state of society and intellect by every discerning and highly conscientious mind gave in his case a rather melancholy tinge to the character very natural to those whose passive moral susceptibilities are more than proportioned to their active energies for it must be said that the strength of will of which his manner seemed to give such strong assurance expended itself principally in manner with great zeal for human improvement a strong sense of duty and capacities and acquirements the extent of which is proved by the writings he has left he hardly ever completed any intellectual task of magnitude he had so high a standard of what ought to be done so exaggerated a sense of deficiencies in his own performances and was so unable to content himself with the amount of elaboration sufficient for the occasion and the purpose that he not only spoilt much of his work for ordinary use by overlabouring it but spent so much time and exertion in superfluous study and thought that when his task ought to have been completed he had generally worked himself into an illness without having half finished what he undertook from this mental infirmity of which he is not the sole example among the accomplished and able men whom i have known combined with liability to frequent attacks of disabling though not dangerous illhealth he accomplished through life little in comparison with what he seemed capable of but what he did produce is held in the very highest estimation by the most competent judges and like coleridge he might plead as a setoff that he had been to many persons through his conversation a source not only of much instruction but of great elevation of character on me his influence was most salutary it was moral in the best sense he took a sincere and kind interest in me far beyond what could have been expected towards a mere youth from a man of his age standing and what seemed austerity of character there was in his conversation and demeanour a tone of highmindedness which did not show itself so much if the quality existed as much in any of the other persons with whom at that time i associated my intercourse with him was the more beneficial owing to his being of a different mental type from all other intellectual men whom i frequented and he from the first set himself decidedly against the prejudices and narrownesses which are almost sure to be found in a young man formed by a particular mode of thought or a particular social circle  his younger brother charles austin of whom at this time and for the next year or two i saw much had also a great effect on me though of a very different description he was but a few years older than myself and had then just left the university where he had shone with great éclat as a man of intellect and a brilliant orator and converser the effect he produced on his cambridge contemporaries deserves to be accounted an historical event for to it may in part be traced the tendency towards liberalism in general and the benthamic and politicoeconomic form of it in particular which showed itself in a portion of the more activeminded young men of the higher classes from this time to 1830 the union debating society at that time at the height of its reputation was an arena where what were then thought extreme opinions in politics and philosophy were weekly asserted face to face with their opposites before audiences consisting of the élite of the cambridge youth and though many persons afterwards of more or less note of whom lord macaulay is the most celebrated gained their first oratorical laurels in those debates the really influential mind among these intellectual gladiators was charles austin he continued after leaving the university to be by his conversation and personal ascendency a leader among the same class of young men who had been his associates there and he attached me among others to his car through him i became acquainted with macaulay hyde and charles villiers strutt now lord belper romilly now lord romilly and master of the rolls and various others who subsequently figured in literature or politics and among whom i heard discussions on many topics as yet to a certain degree new to me the influence of charles austin over me differed from that of the persons i have hitherto mentioned in being not the influence of a man over a boy but that of an elder contemporary it was through him that i first felt myself not a pupil under teachers but a man among men he was the first person of intellect whom i met on a ground of equality though as yet much his inferior on that common ground he was a man who never failed to impress greatly those with whom he came in contact even when their opinions were the very reverse of his the impression he gave was that of boundless strength together with talents which combined with such apparent force of will and character seemed capable of dominating the world those who knew him whether friendly to him or not always anticipated that he would play a conspicuous part in public life it is seldom that men produce so great an immediate effect by speech unless they in some degree lay themselves out for it and he did this in no ordinary degree he loved to strike and even to startle he knew that decision is the greatest element of effect and he uttered his opinions with all the decision he could throw into them never so well pleased as when he astonished anyone by their audacity very unlike his brother who made war against the narrower interpretations and applications of the principles they both professed he on the contrary presented the benthamic doctrines in the most startling form of which they were susceptible exaggerating everything in them which tended to consequences offensive to anyones preconceived feelings all which he defended with such verve and vivacity and carried off by a manner so agreeable as well as forcible that he always either came off victor or divided the honours of the field it is my belief that much of the notion popularly entertained of the tenets and sentiments of what are called benthamites or utilitarians had its origin in paradoxes thrown out by charles austin it must be said however that his example was followed haud passibus aequis by younger proselytes and that to outrer whatever was by anybody considered offensive in the doctrines and maxims of benthamism became at one time the badge of a small coterie of youths all of these who had anything in them myself among others quickly outgrew this boyish vanity and those who had not became tired of differing from other people and gave up both the good and the bad part of the heterodox opinions they had for some time professed  it was in the winter of 18223 that i formed the plan of a little society to be composed of young men agreeing in fundamental principlesacknowledging utility as their standard in ethics and politics and a certain number of the principal corollaries drawn from it in the philosophy i had acceptedand meeting once a fortnight to read essays and discuss questions conformably to the premises thus agreed on the fact would hardly be worth mentioning but for the circumstance that the name i gave to the society i had planned was the utilitarian society it was the first time that anyone had taken the title of utilitarian and the term made its way into the language from this humble source i did not invent the word but found it in one of galts novels the annals of the parish in which the scotch clergyman of whom the book is a supposed autobiography is represented as warning his parishioners not to leave the gospel and become utilitarians with a boys fondness for a name and a banner i seized on the word and for some years called myself and others by it as a sectarian appellation and it came to be occasionally used by some others holding the opinions which it was intended to designate as those opinions attracted more notice the term was repeated by strangers and opponents and got into rather common use just about the time when those who had originally assumed it laid down that along with other sectarian characteristics the society so called consisted at first of no more than three members one of whom being mr benthams amanuensis obtained for us permission to hold our meetings in his house the number never i think reached ten and the society was broken up in 1826 it had thus an existence of about three years and a half the chief effect of it as regards myself over and above the benefit of practice in oral discussion was that of bringing me in contact with several young men at that time less advanced than myself among whom as they professed the same opinions i was for some time a sort of leader and had considerable influence on their mental progress any young man of education who fell in my way and whose opinions were not incompatible with those of the society i endeavoured to press into its service and some others i probably should never have known had they not joined it those of the members who became my intimate companionsno one of whom was in any sense of the word a disciple but all of them independent thinkers on their own basiswere william eyton tooke son of the eminent political economist a young man of singular worth both moral and intellectual lost to the world by an early death his friend william ellis an original thinker in the field of political economy now honourably known by his apostolic exertions for the improvement of education george graham afterwards official assignee of the bankruptcy court a thinker of originality and power on almost all abstract subjects and from the time when he came first to england to study for the bar in 1824 or 1825 a man who has made considerably more noise in the world than any of these john arthur roebuck  in may 1823 my professional occupation and status for the next thirtyfive years of my life were decided by my fathers obtaining for me an appointment from the east india company in the office of the examiner of india correspondence immediately under himself i was appointed in the usual manner at the bottom of the list of clerks to rise at least in the first instance by seniority but with the understanding that i should be employed from the beginning in preparing drafts of despatches and be thus trained up as a successor to those who then filled the higher departments of the office my drafts of course required for some time much revision from my immediate superiors but i soon became well acquainted with the business and by my fathers instructions and the general growth of my own powers i was in a few years qualified to be and practically was the chief conductor of the correspondence with india in one of the leading departments that of the native states this continued to be my official duty until i was appointed examiner only two years before the time when the abolition of the east india company as a political body determined my retirement i do not know any one of the occupations by which a subsistence can now be gained more suitable than such as this to anyone who not being in independent circumstances desires to devote a part of the twentyfour hours to private intellectual pursuits writing for the press cannot be recommended as a permanent resource to anyone qualified to accomplish anything in the higher departments of literature or thought not only on account of the uncertainty of this means of livelihood especially if the writer has a conscience and will not consent to serve any opinions except his own but also because the writings by which one can live are not the writings which themselves live and are never those in which the writer does his best books destined to form future thinkers take too much time to write and when written come in general too slowly into notice and repute to be relied on for subsistence those who have to support themselves by their pen must depend on literary drudgery or at best on writings addressed to the multitude and can employ in the pursuits of their own choice only such time as they can spare from those of necessity which is generally less than the leisure allowed by office occupations while the effect on the mind is far more enervating and fatiguing for my own part i have through life found office duties an actual rest from the other mental occupations which i have carried on simultaneously with them they were sufficiently intellectual not to be a distasteful drudgery without being such as to cause any strain upon the mental powers of a person used to abstract thought or to the labour of careful literary composition the drawbacks for every mode of life has its drawbacks were not however unfelt by me i cared little for the loss of the chances of riches and honours held out by some of the professions particularly the bar which had been as i have already said the profession thought of for me but i was not indifferent to exclusion from parliament and public life and i felt very sensibly the more immediate unpleasantness of confinement to london the holiday allowed by india house practice not exceeding a month in the year while my taste was strong for a country life and my sojourn in france had left behind it an ardent desire of travelling but though these tastes could not be freely indulged they were at no time entirely sacrificed i passed most sundays throughout the year in the country taking long rural walks on that day even when residing in london the months holiday was for a few years passed at my fathers house in the country afterwards a part or the whole was spent in tours chiefly pedestrian with some one or more of the young men who were my chosen companions and at a later period in longer journeys or excursions alone or with other friends france belgium and rhenish germany were within easy reach of the annual holiday and two longer absences one of three the other of six months under medical advice added switzerland the tyrol and italy to my list fortunately also both these journeys occurred rather early so as to give the benefit and charm of the remembrance to a large portion of life  i am disposed to agree with what has been surmised by others that the opportunity which my official position gave me of learning by personal observation the necessary conditions of the practical conduct of public affairs has been of considerable value to me as a theoretical reformer of the opinions and institutions of my time not indeed that public business transacted on paper to take effect on the other side of the globe was of itself calculated to give much practical knowledge of life but the occupation accustomed me to see and hear the difficulties of every course and the means of obviating them stated and discussed deliberately with a view to execution it gave me opportunities of perceiving when public measures and other political facts did not produce the effects which had been expected of them and from what causes above all it was valuable to me by making me in this portion of my activity merely one wheel in a machine the whole of which had to work together as a speculative writer i should have had no one to consult but myself and should have encountered in my speculations none of the obstacles which would have started up whenever they came to be applied to practice but as a secretary conducting political correspondence i could not issue an order or express an opinion without satisfying various persons very unlike myself that the thing was fit to be done i was thus in a good position for finding out by practice the mode of putting a thought which gives it easiest admittance into minds not prepared for it by habit while i became practically conversant with the difficulties of moving bodies of men the necessities of compromise the art of sacrificing the nonessential to preserve the essential i learnt how to obtain the best i could when i could not obtain everything instead of being indignant or dispirited because i could not have entirely my own way to be pleased and encouraged when i could have the smallest part of it and when even that could not be to bear with complete equanimity the being overruled altogether i have found through life these acquisitions to be of the greatest possible importance for personal happiness and they are also a very necessary condition for enabling anyone either as theorist or as practical man to effect the greatest amount of good compatible with his opportunities     chapter iv  youthful propagandism the westminster review   the occupation of so much of my time by office work did not relax my attention to my own pursuits which were never carried on more vigorously it was about this time that i began to write in newspapers the first writings of mine which got into print were two letters published towards the end of 1822 in the traveller evening newspaper the traveller which afterwards grew into the globe and traveller by the purchase and incorporation of the globe was then the property of the wellknown political economist colonel torrens and under the editorship of an able man mr walter coulson who after being an amanuensis of mr bentham became a reporter then an editor next a barrister and conveyancer and died counsel to the home office it had become one of the most important newspaper organs of liberal politics colonel torrens himself wrote much of the political economy of his paper and had at this time made an attack upon some opinion of ricardo and my father to which at my fathers instigation i attempted an answer and coulson out of consideration for my father and goodwill to me inserted it there was a reply by torrens to which i again rejoined i soon after attempted something considerably more ambitious the prosecutions of richard carlile and his wife and sister for publications hostile to christianity were then exciting much attention and nowhere more than among the people i frequented freedom of discussion even in politics much more in religion was at that time far from being even in theory the conceded point which it at least seems to be now and the holders of obnoxious opinions had to be always ready to argue and reargue for the liberty of expressing them i wrote a series of five letters under the signature of wickliffe going over the whole length and breadth of the question of free publication of all opinions on religion and offered them to the morning chronicle three of them were published in january and february 1823 the other two containing things too outspoken for that journal never appeared at all but a paper which i wrote soon after on the same subject à propos of a debate in the house of commons was inserted as a leading article and during the whole of this year 1823 a considerable number of my contributions were printed in the chronicle and traveller sometimes notices of books but oftener letters commenting on some nonsense talked in parliament or some defect of the law or misdoings of the magistracy or the courts of justice in this last department the chronicle was now rendering signal service after the death of mr perry the editorship and management of the paper had devolved on mr john black long a reporter on its establishment a man of most extensive reading and information great honesty and simplicity of mind a particular friend of my father imbued with many of his and benthams ideas which he reproduced in his articles among other valuable thoughts with great facility and skill from this time the chronicle ceased to be the merely whig organ it was before and during the next ten years became to a considerable extent a vehicle of the opinions of the utilitarian radicals this was mainly by what black himself wrote with some assistance from fonblanque who first showed his eminent qualities as a writer by articles and jeux desprit in the chronicle the defects of the law and of the administration of justice were the subject on which that paper rendered most service to improvement up to that time hardly a word had been said except by bentham and my father against that most peccant part of english institutions and of their administration it was the almost universal creed of englishmen that the law of england the judicature of england the unpaid magistracy of england were models of excellence i do not go beyond the mark in saying that after bentham who supplied the principal materials the greatest share of the merit of breaking down this wretched superstition belongs to black as editor of the morning chronicle he kept up an incessant fire against it exposing the absurdities and vices of the law and the courts of justice paid and unpaid until he forced some sense of them into peoples minds on many other questions he became the organ of opinions much in advance of any which had ever before found regular advocacy in the newspaper press black was a frequent visitor of my father and mr grote used to say that he always knew by the monday mornings article whether black had been with my father on the sunday black was one of the most influential of the many channels through which my fathers conversation and personal influence made his opinions tell on the world cooperating with the effect of his writings in making him a power in the country such as it has rarely been the lot of an individual in a private station to be through the mere force of intellect and character and a power which was often acting the most efficiently where it was least seen and suspected i have already noticed how much of what was done by ricardo hume and grote was the result in part of his prompting and persuasion he was the good genius by the side of brougham in most of what he did for the public either on education law reform or any other subject and his influence flowed in minor streams too numerous to be specified this influence was now about to receive a great extension by the foundation of the westminster review  contrary to what may have been supposed my father was in no degree a party to setting up the westminster review the need of a radical organ to make head against the edinburgh and quarterly then in the period of their greatest reputation and influence had been a topic of conversation between him and mr bentham many years earlier and it had been a part of their château en espagne that my father should be the editor but the idea had never assumed any practical shape in 1823 however mr bentham determined to establish the review at his own cost and offered the editorship to my father who declined it as incompatible with his india house appointment it was then entrusted to mr now sir john bowring at that time a merchant in the city mr bowring had been for two or three years previous an assiduous frequenter of mr bentham to whom he was recommended by many personal good qualities by an ardent admiration for bentham a zealous adoption of many though not all of his opinions and not least by an extensive acquaintanceship and correspondence with liberals of all countries which seemed to qualify him for being a powerful agent in spreading benthams fame and doctrines through all quarters of the world my father had seen little of bowring but knew enough of him to have formed a strong opinion that he was a man of an entirely different type from what my father considered suitable for conducting a political and philosophical review and he augured so ill of the enterprise that he regretted it altogether feeling persuaded not only that mr bentham would lose his money but that discredit would probably be brought upon radical principles he could not however desert mr bentham and he consented to write an article for the first number as it had been a favourite portion of the scheme formerly talked of that part of the work should be devoted to reviewing the other reviews this article of my fathers was to be a general criticism of the edinburgh review from its commencement before writing it he made me read through all the volumes of the review or as much of each as seemed of any importance which was not so arduous a task in 1823 as it would be now and make notes for him of the articles which i thought he would wish to examine either on account of their good or their bad qualities this paper of my fathers was the chief cause of the sensation which the westminster review produced at its first appearance and is both in conception and in execution one of the most striking of all his writings he began by an analysis of the tendencies of periodical literature in general pointing out that it cannot like books wait for success but must succeed immediately or not at all and is hence almost certain to profess and inculcate the opinions already held by the public to which it addresses itself instead of attempting to rectify or improve those opinions he next to characterize the position of the edinburgh review as a political organ entered into a complete analysis from the radical point of view of the british constitution he held up to notice its thoroughly aristocratic character the nomination of a majority of the house of commons by a few hundred families the entire identification of the more independent portion the county members with the great landholders the different classes whom this narrow oligarchy was induced for convenience to admit to a share of power and finally what he called its two props the church and the legal profession he pointed out the natural tendency of an aristocratic body of this composition to group itself into two parties one of them in possession of the executive the other endeavouring to supplant the former and become the predominant section by the aid of public opinion without any essential sacrifice of the aristocratical predominance he described the course likely to be pursued and the political ground occupied by an aristocratic party in opposition coquetting with popular principles for the sake of popular support he showed how this idea was realized in the conduct of the whig party and of the edinburgh review as its chief literary organ he described as their main characteristic what he termed seesaw writing alternately on both sides of the question which touched the power or interest of the governing classes sometimes in different articles sometimes in different parts of the same article and illustrated his position by copious specimens so formidable an attack on the whig party and policy had never before been made nor had so great a blow ever been struck in this country for radicalism nor was there i believe any living person capable of writing that article except my father2  in the meantime the nascent review had formed a junction with another project of a purely literary periodical to be edited by mr henry southern afterwards a diplomatist then a literary man by profession the two editors agreed to unite their corps and divide the editorship bowring taking the political southern the literary department southerns review was to have been published by longman and that firm though part proprietors of the edinburgh were willing to be the publishers of the new journal but when all the arrangements had been made and the prospectuses sent out the longmans saw my fathers attack on the edinburgh and drew back my father was now appealed to for his interest with his own publisher baldwin which was exerted with a successful result and so in april 1824 amidst anything but hope on my fathers part and that of most of those who afterwards aided in carrying on the review the first number made its appearance  that number was an agreeable surprise to most of us the average of the articles was of much better quality than had been expected the literary and artistic department had rested chiefly on mr bingham a barrister subsequently a police magistrate who had been for some years a frequenter of bentham was a friend of both the austins and had adopted with great ardour mr benthams philosophical opinions partly from accident there were in the first number as many as five articles by bingham and we were extremely pleased with them i well remember the mixed feeling i myself had about the review the joy of finding what we did not at all expect that it was sufficiently good to be capable of being made a creditable organ of those who held the opinions it professed and extreme vexation since it was so good on the whole at what we thought the blemishes of it when however in addition to our generally favourable opinion of it we learned that it had an extraordinary large sale for a first number and found that the appearance of a radical review with pretensions equal to those of the established organs of parties had excited much attention there could be no room for hesitation and we all became eager in doing everything we could to strengthen and improve it  my father continued to write occasional articles the quarterly review received its exposure as a sequel to that of the edinburgh of his other contributions the most important were an attack on southeys book of the church in the fifth number and a political article in the twelfth mr austin only contributed one paper but one of great merit an argument against primogeniture in reply to an article then lately published in the edinburgh review by mcculloch grote also was a contributor only once all the time he could spare being already taken up with his history of greece the article he wrote was on his own subject and was a very complete exposure and castigation of mitford bingham and charles austin continued to write for some time fonblanque was a frequent contributor from the third number of my particular associates ellis was a regular writer up to the ninth number and about the time when he left off others of the set began eyton tooke graham and roebuck i was myself the most frequent writer of all having contributed from the second number to the eighteenth thirteen articles reviews of books on history and political economy or discussions on special political topics as corn laws game laws law of libel occasional articles of merit came in from other acquaintances of my fathers and in time of mine and some of mr bowrings writers turned out well on the whole however the conduct of the review was never satisfactory to any of the persons strongly interested in its principles with whom i came in contact hardly ever did a number come out without containing several things extremely offensive to us either in point of opinion of taste or by mere want of ability the unfavourable judgments passed by my father grote the two austins and others were reechoed with exaggeration by us younger people and as our youthful zeal rendered us by no means backward in making complaints we led the two editors a sad life from my knowledge of what i then was i have no doubt that we were at least as often wrong as right and i am very certain that if the review had been carried on according to our notions i mean those of the juniors it would have been no better perhaps not even so good as it was but it is worth noting as a fact in the history of benthamism that the periodical organ by which it was best known was from the first extremely unsatisfactory to those whose opinions on all subjects it was supposed specially to represent  meanwhile however the review made considerable noise in the world and gave a recognised status in the arena of opinion and discussion to the benthamic type of radicalism out of all proportion to the number of its adherents and to the personal merits and abilities at that time of most of those who could be reckoned among them it was a time as is known of rapidly rising liberalism when the fears and animosities accompanying the war with france had been brought to an end and people had once more a place in their thoughts for home politics the tide began to set towards reform the renewed oppression of the continent by the old reigning families the countenance apparently given by the english government to the conspiracy against liberty called the holy alliance and the enormous weight of the national debt and taxation occasioned by so long and costly a war rendered the government and parliament very unpopular radicalism under the leadership of the burdetts and cobbetts had assumed a character and importance which seriously alarmed the administration and their alarm had scarcely been temporarily assuaged by the celebrated six acts when the trial of queen caroline roused a still wider and deeper feeling of hatred though the outward signs of this hatred passed away with its exciting cause there arose on all sides a spirit which had never shown itself before of opposition to abuses in detail mr humes persevering scrutiny of the public expenditure forcing the house of commons to a division on every objectionable item in the estimates had begun to tell with great force on public opinion and had extorted many minor retrenchments from an unwilling administration political economy had asserted itself with great vigour in public affairs by the petition of the merchants of london for free trade drawn up in 1820 by mr tooke and presented by mr alexander baring and by the noble exertions of ricardo during the few years of his parliamentary life his writings following up the impulse given by the bullion controversy and followed up in their turn by the expositions and comments of my father and mcculloch whose writings in the edinburgh review during those years were most valuable had drawn general attention to the subject making at least partial converts in the cabinet itself and huskisson supported by canning had commenced that gradual demolition of the protective system which one of their colleagues virtually completed in 1846 though the last vestiges were only swept away by mr gladstone in 1860 mr peel then home secretary was entering cautiously into the untrodden and peculiarly benthamic path of law reform at this period when liberalism seemed to be becoming the tone of the time when improvement of institutions was preached from the highest places and a complete change of the constitution of parliament was loudly demanded in the lowest it is not strange that attention should have been roused by the regular appearance in controversy of what seemed a new school of writers claiming to be the legislators and theorists of this new tendency the air of strong conviction with which they wrote when scarcely anyone else seemed to have an equally strong faith in as definite a creed the boldness with which they tilted against the very front of both the existing political parties their uncompromising profession of opposition to many of the generally received opinions and the suspicion they lay under of holding others still more heterodox than they professed the talent and verve of at least my fathers articles and the appearance of a corps behind him sufficient to carry on a review and finally the fact that the review was bought and read made the socalled bentham school in philosophy and politics fill a greater place in the public mind than it had held before or has ever again held since other equally earnest schools of thought have arisen in england as i was in the headquarters of it knew of what it was composed and as one of the most active of its very small number might say without undue assumption quorum pars magna fui it belongs to me more than to most others to give some account of it  this supposed school then had no other existence than what was constituted by the fact that my fathers writings and conversation drew round him a certain number of young men who had already imbibed or who imbibed from him a greater or smaller portion of his very decided political and philosophical opinions the notion that bentham was surrounded by a band of disciples who received their opinions from his lips is a fable to which my father did justice in his fragment on mackintosh and which to all who knew mr benthams habits of life and manner of conversation is simply ridiculous the influence which bentham exercised was by his writings through them he has produced and is producing effects on the condition of mankind wider and deeper no doubt than any which can be attributed to my father he is a much greater name in history but my father exercised a far greater personal ascendency he was sought for the vigour and instructiveness of his conversation and did use it largely as an instrument for the diffusion of his opinions i have never known any man who could do such ample justice to his best thoughts in colloquial discussion his perfect command over his great mental resources the terseness and expressiveness of his language and the moral earnestness as well as intellectual force of his delivery made him one of the most striking of all argumentative conversers and he was full of anecdote a hearty laugher and when with people whom he liked a most lively and amusing companion it was not solely or even chiefly in diffusing his merely intellectual convictions that his power showed itself it was still more through the influence of a quality of which i have only since learnt to appreciate the extreme rarity that exalted public spirit and regard above all things to the good of the whole which warmed into life and activity every germ of similar virtue that existed in the minds he came in contact with the desire he made them feel for his approbation the shame at his disapproval the moral support which his conversation and his very existence gave to those who were aiming at the same objects and the encouragement he afforded to the fainthearted or desponding among them by the firm confidence which though the reverse of sanguine as to the results to be expected in any one particular case he always felt in the power of reason the general progress of improvement and the good which individuals could do by judicious effort  if was my fathers opinions which gave the distinguishing character to the benthamic or utilitarian propagandism of that time they fell singly scattered from him in many directions but they flowed from him in a continued stream principally in three channels one was through me the only mind directly formed by his instructions and through whom considerable influence was exercised over various young men who became in their turn propagandists a second was through some of the cambridge contemporaries of charles austin who either initiated by him or under the general mental impulse which he gave had adopted many opinions allied to those of my father and some of the more considerable of whom afterwards sought my fathers acquaintance and frequented his house among these may be mentioned strutt afterwards lord belper and the present lord romilly with whose eminent father sir samuel my father had of old been on terms of friendship the third channel was that of a younger generation of cambridge undergraduates contemporary not with austin but with eyton tooke who were drawn to that estimable person by affinity of opinions and introduced by him to my father the most notable of these was charles buller various other persons individually received and transmitted a considerable amount of my fathers influence for example black as before mentioned and fonblanque most of these however we accounted only partial allies fonblanque for instance was always divergent from us on many important points but indeed there was by no means complete unanimity among any portion of us nor had any of us adopted implicitly all my fathers opinions for example although his essay on government was regarded probably by all of us as a masterpiece of political wisdom our adhesion by no means extended to the paragraph of it in which he maintains that women may consistently with good government be excluded from the suffrage because their interest is the same with that of men from this doctrine i and all those who formed my chosen associates most positively dissented it is due to my father to say that he denied having intended to affirm that women should be excluded any more than men under the age of forty concerning whom he maintained in the very next paragraph an exactly similar thesis he was as he truly said not discussing whether the suffrage had better be restricted but only assuming that it is to be restricted what is the utmost limit of restriction which does not necessarily involve a sacrifice of the securities for good government but i thought then as i have always thought since that the opinion which he acknowledged no less than that which he disclaimed is as great an error as any of those against which the essay was directed that the interest of women is included in that of men exactly as much as the interest of subjects is included in that of kings and no more and that every reason which exists for giving the suffrage to anybody demands that it should not be withheld from women this was also the general opinion of the younger proselytes and it is pleasant to be able to say that mr bentham on this important point was wholly on our side  but though none of us probably agreed in every respect with my father his opinions as i said before were the principal element which gave its colour and character to the little group of young men who were the first propagators of what was afterwards called philosophic radicalism their mode of thinking was not characterized by benthamism in any sense which has relation to bentham as a chief or guide but rather by a combination of benthams point of view with that of the modern political economy and with the hartleian metaphysics malthuss population principle was quite as much a banner and point of union among us as any opinion specially belonging to bentham this great doctrine originally brought forward as an argument against the indefinite improvability of human affairs we took up with ardent zeal in the contrary sense as indicating the sole means of realizing that improvability by securing full employment at high wages to the whole labouring population through a voluntary restriction of the increase of their numbers the other leading characteristics of the creed which we held in common with my father may be stated as follows  in politics an almost unbounded confidence in the efficacy of two things representative government and complete freedom of discussion so complete was my fathers reliance on the influence of reason over the minds of mankind whenever it is allowed to reach them that he felt as if all would be gained if the whole population were taught to read if all sorts of opinions were allowed to be addressed to them by word and in writing and if by means of the suffrage they could nominate a legislature to give effect to the opinions they adopted he thought that when the legislature no longer represented a class interest it would aim at the general interest honestly and with adequate wisdom since the people would be sufficiently under the guidance of educated intelligence to make in general a good choice of persons to represent them and having done so to leave to those whom they had chosen a liberal discretion accordingly aristocratic rule the government of the few in any of its shapes being in his eyes the only thing which stood between mankind and an administration of their affairs by the best wisdom to be found among them was the object of his sternest disapprobation and a democratic suffrage the principal article of his political creed not on the ground of liberty rights of man or any of the phrases more or less significant by which up to that time democracy had usually been defended but as the most essential of securities for good government in this too he held fast only to what he deemed essentials he was comparatively indifferent to monarchical or republican formsfar more so than bentham to whom a king in the character of corruptergeneral appeared necessarily very noxious next to aristocracy an established church or corporation of priests as being by position the great depravers of religion and interested in opposing the progress of the human mind was the object of his greatest detestation though he disliked no clergyman personally who did not deserve it and was on terms of sincere friendship with several in ethics his moral feelings were energetic and rigid on all points which he deemed important to human well being while he was supremely indifferent in opinion though his indifference did not show itself in personal conduct to all those doctrines of the common morality which he thought had no foundation but in asceticism and priestcraft he looked forward for example to a considerable increase of freedom in the relations between the sexes though without pretending to define exactly what would be or ought to be the precise conditions of that freedom this opinion was connected in him with no sensuality either of a theoretical or of a practical kind he anticipated on the contrary as one of the beneficial effects of increased freedom that the imagination would no longer dwell upon the physical relation and its adjuncts and swell this into one of the principal objects of life a perversion of the imagination and feelings which he regarded as one of the deepest seated and most pervading evils in the human mind in psychology his fundamental doctrine was the formation of all human character by circumstances through the universal principle of association and the consequent unlimited possibility of improving the moral and intellectual condition of mankind by education of all his doctrines none was more important than this or needs more to be insisted on unfortunately there is none which is more contradictory to the prevailing tendencies of speculation both in his time and since  these various opinions were seized on with youthful fanaticism by the little knot of young men of whom i was one and we put into them a sectarian spirit from which in intention at least my father was wholly free what we or rather a phantom substituted in the place of us were sometimes by a ridiculous exaggeration called by others namely a school some of us for a time really hoped and aspired to be the french philosophes of the eighteenth century were the examples we sought to imitate and we hoped to accomplish no less results no one of the set went to so great excesses in his boyish ambition as i did which might be shown by many particulars were it not an useless waste of space and time  all this however is properly only the outside of our existence or at least the intellectual part alone and no more than one side of that in attempting to penetrate inward and give any indication of what we were as human beings i must be understood as speaking only of myself of whom alone i can speak from sufficient knowledge and i do not believe that the picture would suit any of my companions without many and great modifications  i conceive that the description so often given of a benthamite as a mere reasoning machine though extremely inapplicable to most of those who have been designated by that title was during two or three years of my life not altogether untrue of me it was perhaps as applicable to me as it can well be to anyone just entering into life to whom the common objects of desire must in general have at least the attraction of novelty there is nothing very extraordinary in this fact no youth of the age i then was can be expected to be more than one thing and this was the thing i happened to be ambition and desire of distinction i had in abundance and zeal for what i thought the good of mankind was my strongest sentiment mixing with and colouring all others but my zeal was as yet little else at that period of my life than zeal for speculative opinions it had not its root in genuine benevolence or sympathy with mankind though these qualities held their due place in my ethical standard nor was it connected with any high enthusiasm for ideal nobleness yet of this feeling i was imaginatively very susceptible but there was at that time an intermission of its natural aliment poetical culture while there was a superabundance of the discipline antagonistic to it that of mere logic and analysis add to this that as already mentioned my fathers teachings tended to the undervaluing of feeling it was not that he was himself coldhearted or insensible i believe it was rather from the contrary quality he thought that feeling could take care of itself that there was sure to be enough of it if actions were properly cared about offended by the frequency with which in ethical and philosophical controversy feeling is made the ultimate reason and justification of conduct instead of being itself called on for a justification while in practice actions the effect of which on human happiness is mischievous are defended as being required by feeling and the character of a person of feeling obtains a credit for desert which he thought only due to actions he had a real impatience of attributing praise to feeling or of any but the most sparing reference to it either in the estimation of persons or in the discussion of things in addition to the influence which this characteristic in him had on me and others we found all the opinions to which we attached most importance constantly attacked on the ground of feeling utility was denounced as cold calculation political economy as hardhearted antipopulation doctrines as repulsive to the natural feelings of mankind we retorted by the word sentimentality which along with declamation and vague generalities served us as common terms of opprobrium although we were generally in the right as against those who were opposed to us the effect was that the cultivation of feeling except the feelings of public and private duty was not in much esteem among us and had very little place in the thoughts of most of us myself in particular what we principally thought of was to alter peoples opinions to make them believe according to evidence and know what was their real interest which when they once knew they would we thought by the instrument of opinion enforce a regard to it upon one another while fully recognising the superior excellence of unselfish benevolence and love of justice we did not expect the regeneration of mankind from any direct action on those sentiments but from the effect of educated intellect enlightening the selfish feelings although this last is prodigiously important as a means of improvement in the hands of those who are themselves impelled by nobler principles of action i do not believe that any one of the survivors of the benthamites or utilitarians of that day now relies mainly upon it for the general amendment of human conduct  from this neglect both in theory and in practice of the cultivation of feeling naturally resulted among other things an undervaluing of poetry and of imagination generally as an element of human nature it is or was part of the popular notion of benthamites that they are enemies of poetry this was partly true of bentham himself he used to say that all poetry is misrepresentation but in the sense in which he said it the same might have been said of all impressive speech of all representation or inculcation more oratorical in its character than a sum in arithmetic an article of binghams in the first number of the westminster review in which he offered as an explanation of something which he disliked in moore that mr moore is a poet and therefore is not a reasoner did a good deal to attach the notion of hating poetry to the writers in the review but the truth was that many of us were great readers of poetry bingham himself had been a writer of it while as regards me and the same thing might be said of my father the correct statement would be not that i disliked poetry but that i was theoretically indifferent to it i disliked any sentiments in poetry which i should have disliked in prose and that included a great deal and i was wholly blind to its place in human culture as a means of educating the feelings but i was always personally very susceptible to some kinds of it in the most sectarian period of my benthamism i happened to look into popes essay on man and though every opinion in it was contrary to mine i well remember how powerfully it acted on my imagination perhaps at that time poetical composition of any higher type than eloquent discussion in verse might not have produced a similar effect upon me at all events i seldom gave it an opportunity this however was a mere passive state long before i had enlarged in any considerable degree the basis of my intellectual creed i had obtained in the natural course of my mental progress poetic culture of the most valuable kind by means of reverential admiration for the lives and characters of heroic persons especially the heroes of philosophy the same inspiring effect which so many of the benefactors of mankind have left on record that they had experienced from plutarchs lives was produced on me by platos pictures of socrates and by some modern biographies above all by condorcets life of turgot a book well calculated to rouse the best sort of enthusiasm since it contains one of the wisest and noblest of lives delineated by one of the wisest and noblest of men the heroic virtue of these glorious representatives of the opinions with which i sympathized deeply affected me and i perpetually recurred to them as others do to a favourite poet when needing to be carried up into the more elevated regions of feeling and thought i may observe by the way that this book cured me of my sectarian follies the two or three pages beginning il regardait toute secte comme nuisible and explaining why turgot always kept himself perfectly distinct from the encyclopedists sank deeply into my mind i left off designating myself and others as utilitarians and by the pronoun we or any other collective designation i ceased to afficher sectarianism my real inward sectarianism i did not get rid of till later and much more gradually  about the end of 1824 or beginning of 1825 mr bentham having lately got back his papers on evidence from m dumont whose traité des preuves judiciaires grounded on them was then first completed and published resolved to have them printed in the original and bethought himself of me as capable of preparing them for the press in the same manner as his book of fallacies had been recently edited by bingham i gladly undertook this task and it occupied nearly all my leisure for about a year exclusive of the time afterwards spent in seeing the five large volumes through the press mr bentham had begun this treatise three times at considerable intervals each time in a different manner and each time without reference to the preceding two of the three times he had gone over nearly the whole subject these three masses of manuscript it was my business to condense into a single treatise adopting the one last written as the groundwork and incorporating with it as much of the two others as it had not completely superseded i had also to unroll such of benthams involved and parenthetical sentences as seemed to overpass by their complexity the measure of what readers were likely to take the pains to understand it was further mr benthams particular desire that i should from myself endeavour to supply any lacunae which he had left and at his instance i read for this purpose the most authoritative treatises on the english law of evidence and commented on a few of the objectionable points of the english rules which had escaped benthams notice i also replied to the objections which had been made to some of his doctrines by reviewers of dumonts book and added a few supplementary remarks on some of the more abstract parts of the subject such as the theory of improbability and impossibility the controversial part of these editorial additions was written in a more assuming tone than became one so young and inexperienced as i was but indeed i had never contemplated coming forward in my own person and as an anonymous editor of bentham i fell into the tone of my author not thinking it unsuitable to him or to the subject however it might be so to me my name as editor was put to the book after it was printed at mr benthams positive desire which i in vain attempted to persuade him to forego  the time occupied in this editorial work was extremely well employed in respect to my own improvement the rationale of judicial evidence is one of the richest in matter of all benthams productions the theory of evidence being in itself one of the most important of his subjects and ramifying into most of the others the book contains very fully developed a great proportion of all his best thoughts while among more special things it comprises the most elaborate exposure of the vices and defects of english law as it then was which is to be found in his works not confined to the law of evidence but including by way of illustrative episode the entire procedure or practice of westminster hall the direct knowledge therefore which i obtained from the book and which was imprinted upon me much more thoroughly than it could have been by mere reading was itself no small acquisition but this occupation did for me what might seem less to be expected it gave a great start to my powers of composition everything which i wrote subsequently to this editorial employment was markedly superior to anything that i had written before it benthams later style as the world knows was heavy and cumbersome from the excess of a good quality the love of precision which made him introduce clause within clause into the heart of every sentence that the reader might receive into his mind all the modifications and qualifications simultaneously with the main proposition and the habit grew on him until his sentences became to those not accustomed to them most laborious reading but his earlier style that of the fragment on government plan of a judicial establishment etc is a model of liveliness and ease combined with fulness of matter scarcely ever surpassed and of this earlier style there were many striking specimens in the manuscripts on evidence all of which i endeavoured to preserve so long a course of this admirable writing had a considerable effect upon my own and i added to it by the assiduous reading of other writers both french and english who combined in a remarkable degree ease with force such as goldsmith fielding pascal voltaire and courier through these influences my writing lost the jejuneness of my early compositions the bones and cartilages began to clothe themselves with flesh and the style became at times lively and almost light  this improvement was first exhibited in a new field mr marshall of leeds father of the present generation of marshalls the same who was brought into parliament for yorkshire when the representation forfeited by grampound was transferred to it an earnest parliamentary reformer and a man of large fortune of which he made a liberal use had been much struck with benthams book of fallacies and the thought had occurred to him that it would be useful to publish annually the parliamentary debates not in the chronological order of hansard but classified according to subjects and accompanied by a commentary pointing out the fallacies of the speakers with this intention he very naturally addressed himself to the editor of the book of fallacies and bingham with the assistance of charles austin undertook the editorship the work was called parliamentary history and review its sale was not sufficient to keep it in existence and it only lasted three years it excited however some attention among parliamentary and political people the best strength of the party was put forth in it and its execution did them much more credit than that of the westminster review had ever done bingham and charles austin wrote much in it as did strutt romilly and several other liberal lawyers my father wrote one article in his best style the elder austin another coulson wrote one of great merit it fell to my lot to lead off the first number by an article on the principal topic of the session that of 1825 the catholic association and the catholic disabilities in the second number i wrote an elaborate essay on the commercial crisis of 1825 and the currency debates in the third i had two articles one on a minor subject the other on the reciprocity principle in commerce à propos of a celebrated diplomatic correspondence between canning and gallatin these writings were no longer mere reproductions and applications of the doctrines i had been taught they were original thinking as far as that name can be applied to old ideas in new forms and connexions and i do not exceed the truth in saying that there was a maturity and a welldigested character about them which there had not been in any of my previous performances in execution therefore they were not at all juvenile but their subjects have either gone by or have been so much better treated since that they are entirely superseded and should remain buried in the same oblivion with my contributions to the first dynasty of the westminster review  while thus engaged in writing for the public i did not neglect other modes of selfcultivation it was at this time that i learnt german beginning it on the hamiltonian method for which purpose i and several of my companions formed a class for several years from this period our social studies assumed a shape which contributed very much to my mental progress the idea occurred to us of carrying on by reading and conversation a joint study of several of the branches of science which we wished to be masters of we assembled to the number of a dozen or more mr grote lent a room of his house in threadneedle street for the purpose and his partner prescott one of the three original members of the utilitarian society made one among us we met two mornings in every week from halfpast eight till ten at which hour most of us were called off to our daily occupations our first subject was political economy we chose some systematic treatise as our textbook my fathers elements being our first choice one of us read aloud a chapter or some smaller portion of the book the discussion was then opened and anyone who had an objection or other remark to make made it our rule was to discuss thoroughly every point raised whether great or small prolonging the discussion until all who took part were satisfied with the conclusion they had individually arrived at and to follow up every topic of collateral speculation which the chapter or the conversation suggested never leaving it until we had untied every knot which we found we repeatedly kept up the discussion of some one point for several weeks thinking intently on it during the intervals of our meetings and contriving solutions of the new difficulties which had risen up in the last mornings discussion when we had finished in this way my fathers elements we went in the same manner through ricardos principles of political economy and baileys dissertation on value these close and vigorous discussions were not only improving in a high degree to those who took part in them but brought out new views of some topics of abstract political economy the theory of international values which i afterwards published emanated from these conversations as did also the modified form of ricardos theory of profits laid down in my essay on profits and interest those among us with whom new speculations chiefly originated were ellis graham and i though others gave valuable aid to the discussions especially prescott and roebuck the one by his knowledge the other by his dialectical acuteness the theories of international values and of profits were excogitated and worked out in about equal proportions by myself and graham and if our original project had been executed my essays on some unsettled questions of political economy would have been brought out along with some papers of his under our joint names but when my exposition came to be written i found that i had so much overestimated my agreement with him and he dissented so much from the most original of the two essays that on international values that i was obliged to consider the theory as now exclusively mine and it came out as such when published many years later i may mention that among the alterations which my father made in revising his elements for the third edition several were founded on criticisms elicited by these conversations and in particular he modified his opinions though not to the extent of our new speculations on both the points to which i have adverted  when we had enough of political economy we took up the syllogistic logic in the same manner grote now joining us our first textbook was aldrich but being disgusted with its superficiality we reprinted one of the most finished among the many manuals of the school logic which my father a great collector of such books possessed the manuductio ad logicam of the jesuit du trieu after finishing this we took up whatelys logic then first republished from the encyclopedia metropolitana and finally the computatio sive logica of hobbes these books dealt with in our manner afforded a high range for original metaphysical speculation and most of what has been done in the first book of my system of logic to rationalize and correct the principles and distinctions of the school logicians and to improve the theory of the import of propositions had its origin in these discussions graham and i originating most of the novelties while grote and others furnished an excellent tribunal or test from this time i formed the project of writing a book on logic though on a much humbler scale than the one i ultimately executed  having done with logic we launched into analytic psychology and having chosen hartley for our textbook we raised priestleys edition to an extravagant price by searching through london to furnish each of us with a copy when we had finished hartley we suspended our meetings but my fathers analysis of the mind being published soon after we reassembled for the purpose of reading it with this our exercises ended i have always dated from these conversations my own real inauguration as an original and independent thinker it was also through them that i acquired or very much strengthened a mental habit to which i attribute all that i have ever done or ever shall do in speculation that of never accepting halfsolutions of difficulties as complete never abandoning a puzzle but again and again returning to it until it was cleared up never allowing obscure corners of a subject to remain unexplored because they did not appear important never thinking that i perfectly understood any part of a subject until i understood the whole  our doings from 1825 to 1830 in the way of public speaking filled a considerable place in my life during those years and as they had important effects on my development something ought to be said of them  there was for some time in existence a society of owenites called the cooperative society which met for weekly public discussions in chancery lane in the early part of 1825 accident brought roebuck in contact with several of its members and led to his attending one or two of the meetings and taking part in the debate in opposition to owenism some one of us started the notion of going there in a body and having a general battle and charles austin and some of his friends who did not usually take part in our joint exercises entered into the project it was carried out by concert with the principal members of the society themselves nothing loth as they naturally preferred a controversy with opponents to a tame discussion among their own body the question of population was proposed as the subject of debate charles austin led the case on our side with a brilliant speech and the fight was kept up by adjournment through five or six weekly meetings before crowded auditories including along with the members of the society and their friends many hearers and some speakers from the inns of court when this debate was ended another was commenced on the general merits of owens system and the contest altogether lasted about three months it was a lutte corps à corps between owenites and political economists whom the owenites regarded as their most inveterate opponents but it was a perfectly friendly dispute we who represented political economy had the same objects in view as they had and took pains to show it and the principal champion on their side was a very estimable man with whom i was well acquainted mr william thompson of cork author of a book on the distribution of wealth and of an  appeal in behalf of women against the passage relating to them in my fathers essay on government ellis roebuck and i took an active part in the debate and among those from the inns of court who joined in it i remember charles villiers the other side obtained also on the population question very efficient support from without the wellknown gale jones then an elderly man made one of his florid speeches but the speaker with whom i was most struck though i dissented from nearly every word he said was thirlwall the historian since bishop of st davids then a chancery barrister unknown except by a high reputation for eloquence acquired at the cambridge union before the era of austin and macaulay his speech was in answer to one of mine before he had uttered ten sentences i set him down as the best speaker i had ever heard and i have never since heard anyone whom i placed above him  the great interest of these debates predisposed some of those who took part in them to catch at a suggestion thrown out by mcculloch the political economist that a society was wanted in london similar to the speculative society at edinburgh in which brougham horner and others first cultivated public speaking our experience at the cooperative society seemed to give cause for being sanguine as to the sort of men who might be brought together in london for such a purpose mcculloch mentioned the matter to several young men of influence to whom he was then giving private lessons in political economy some of these entered warmly into the project particularly george villiers after earl of clarendon he and his brothers hyde and charles romilly charles austin and i with some others met and agreed on a plan we determined to meet once a fortnight from november to june at the freemasons tavern and we had soon a fine list of members containing along with several members of parliament nearly all the most noted speakers of the cambridge union and of the oxford united debating society it is curiously illustrative of the tendencies of the time that our principal difficulty in recruiting for the society was to find a sufficient number of tory speakers almost all whom we could press into the service were liberals of different orders and degrees besides those already named we had macaulay thirlwall praed lord howick samuel wilberforce afterwards bishop of oxford charles poulett thomson afterwards lord sydenham edward and henry lytton bulwer fonblanque and many others whom i cannot now recollect but who made themselves afterwards more or less conspicuous in public or literary life nothing could seem more promising but when the time for action drew near and it was necessary to fix on a president and find somebody to open the first debate none of our celebrities would consent to perform either office of the many who were pressed on the subject the only one who could be prevailed on was a man of whom i knew very little but who had taken high honours at oxford and was said to have acquired a great oratorical reputation there who some time afterwards became a tory member of parliament he accordingly was fixed on both for filling the presidents chair and for making the first speech the important day arrived the benches were crowded all our great speakers were present to judge of but not to help our efforts the oxford orators speech was a complete failure this threw a damp on the whole concern the speakers who followed were few and none of them did their best the affair was a complete fiasco and the oratorical celebrities we had counted on went away never to return giving to me at least a lesson in knowledge of the world this unexpected breakdown altered my whole relation to the project i had not anticipated taking a prominent part or speaking much or often particularly at first but i now saw that the success of the scheme depended on the new men and i put my shoulder to the wheel i opened the second question and from that time spoke in nearly every debate it was very uphill work for some time the three villiers and romilly stuck to us for some time longer but the patience of all the founders of the society was at last exhausted except me and roebuck in the season following 18267 things began to mend we had acquired two excellent tory speakers hayward and shee afterwards sergeant shee the radical side was reinforced by charles buller cockburn and others of the second generation of cambridge benthamities and with their and other occasional aid and the two tories as well as roebuck and me for regular speakers almost every debate was a bataille rangée between the philosophic radicals and the tory lawyers until our conflicts were talked about and several persons of note and consideration came to hear us this happened still more in the subsequent seasons 1828 and 1829 when the coleridgians in the persons of maurice and sterling made their appearance in the society as a second liberal and even radical party on totally different grounds from benthamism and vehemently opposed to it bringing into these discussions the general doctrines and modes of thought of the european reaction against the philosophy of the eighteenth century and adding a third and very important belligerent party to our contests which were now no bad exponent of the movement of opinion among the most cultivated part of the new generation our debates were very different from those of common debating societies for they habitually consisted of the strongest arguments and most philosophic principles which either side was able to produce thrown often into close and serré confutations of one another the practice was necessarily very useful to us and eminently so to me i never indeed acquired real fluency and had always a bad and ungraceful delivery but i could make myself listened to and as i always wrote my speeches when from the feelings involved or the nature of the ideas to be developed expression seemed important i greatly increased my power of effective writing acquiring not only an ear for smoothness and rhythm but a practical sense for telling sentences and an immediate criterion of their telling property by their effect on a mixed audience  the society and the preparation for it together with the preparation for the morning conversations which were going on simultaneously occupied the greater part of my leisure and made me feel it a relief when in the spring of 1828 i ceased to write for the westminster the review had fallen into difficulties though the sale of the first number had been very encouraging the permanent sale had never i believe been sufficient to pay the expenses on the scale on which the review was carried on those expenses had been considerably but not sufficiently reduced one of the editors southern had resigned and several of the writers including my father and me who had been paid like other contributors for our earlier articles had latterly written without payment nevertheless the original funds were nearly or quite exhausted and if the review was to be continued some new arrangement of its affairs had become indispensable my father and i had several conferences with bowring on the subject we were willing to do our utmost for maintaining the review as an organ of our opinions but not under bowrings editorship while the impossibility of its any longer supporting a paid editor afforded a ground on which without affront to him we could propose to dispense with his services we and some of our friends were prepared to carry on the review as unpaid writers either finding among ourselves an unpaid editor or sharing the editorship among us but while this negotiation was proceeding with bowrings apparent acquiescence he was carrying on another in a different quarter with colonel perronet thompson of which we received the first intimation in a letter from bowring as editor informing us merely that an arrangement had been made and proposing to us to write for the next number with promise of payment we did not dispute bowrings right to bring about if he could an arrangement more favourable to himself than the one we had proposed but we thought the concealment which he had practised towards us while seemingly entering into our own project an affront and even had we not thought so we were indisposed to expend any more of our time and trouble in attempting to write up the review under his management accordingly my father excused himself from writing though two or three years later on great pressure he did write one more political article as for me i positively refused and thus ended my connexion with the original westminster the last article which i wrote in it had cost me more labour than any previous but it was a labour of love being a defence of the early french revolutionists against the tory misrepresentations of sir walter scott in the introduction to his life of napoleon the number of books which i read for this purpose making notes and extractseven the number i had to buy for in those days there was no public or subscription library from which books of reference could be taken homefar exceeded the worth of the immediate object but i had at that time a halfformed intention of writing a history of the french revolution and though i never executed it my collections afterwards were very useful to carlyle for a similar purpose     chapter v  crisis in my mental history one stage onward   for some years after this time i wrote very little and nothing regularly for publication and great were the advantages which i derived from the intermission it was of no common importance to me at this period to be able to digest and mature my thoughts for my own mind only without any immediate call for giving them out in print had i gone on writing it would have much disturbed the important transformation in my opinions and character which took place during those years the origin of this transformation or at least the process by which i was prepared for it can only be explained by turning some distance back  from the winter of 1821 when i first read bentham and especially from the commencement of the westminster review i had what might truly be called an object in life to be a reformer of the world my conception of my own happiness was entirely identified with this object the personal sympathies i wished for were those of fellow labourers in this enterprise i endeavoured to pick up as many flowers as i could by the way but as a serious and permanent personal satisfaction to rest upon my whole reliance was placed on this and i was accustomed to felicitate myself on the certainty of a happy life which i enjoyed through placing my happiness in something durable and distant in which some progress might be always making while it could never be exhausted by complete attainment this did very well for several years during which the general improvement going on in the world and the idea of myself as engaged with others in struggling to promote it seemed enough to fill up an interesting and animated existence but the time came when i awakened from this as from a dream it was in the autumn of 1826 i was in a dull state of nerves such as everybody is occasionally liable to unsusceptible to enjoyment or pleasurable excitement one of those moods when what is pleasure at other times becomes insipid or indifferent the state i should think in which converts to methodism usually are when smitten by their first conviction of sin in this frame of mind it occurred to me to put the question directly to myself suppose that all your objects in life were realized that all the changes in institutions and opinions which you are looking forward to could be completely effected at this very instant would this be a great joy and happiness to you and an irrepressible selfconsciousness distinctly answered no at this my heart sank within me the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down all my happiness was to have been found in the continual pursuit of this end the end had ceased to charm and how could there ever again be any interest in the means i seemed to have nothing left to live for  at first i hoped that the cloud would pass away of itself but it did not a nights sleep the sovereign remedy for the smaller vexations of life had no effect on it i awoke to a renewed consciousness of the woful fact i carried it with me into all companies into all occupations hardly anything had power to cause me even a few minutes oblivion of it for some months the cloud seemed to grow thicker and thicker the lines in coleridges dejectioni was not then acquainted with themexactly describe my case     a grief without a pang void dark and drear     a drowsy stifled unimpassioned grief     which finds no natural outlet or relief     in word or sigh or tear  in vain i sought relief from my favourite books those memorials of past nobleness and greatness from which i had always hitherto drawn strength and animation i read them now without feeling or with the accustomed feeling minus all its charm and i became persuaded that my love of mankind and of excellence for its own sake had worn itself out i sought no comfort by speaking to others of what i felt if i had loved anyone sufficiently to make confiding my griefs a necessity i should not have been in the condition i was i felt too that mine was not an interesting or in any way respectable distress there was nothing in it to attract sympathy advice if i had known where to seek it would have been most precious the words of macbeth to the physician often occurred to my thoughts but there was no one on whom i could build the faintest hope of such assistance my father to whom it would have been natural to me to have recourse in any practical difficulties was the last person to whom in such a case as this i looked for help everything convinced me that he had no knowledge of any such mental state as i was suffering from and that even if he could be made to understand it he was not the physician who could heal it my education which was wholly his work had been conducted without any regard to the possibility of its ending in this result and i saw no use in giving him the pain of thinking that his plans had failed when the failure was probably irremediable and at all events beyond the power of his remedies of other friends i had at that time none to whom i had any hope of making my condition intelligible it was however abundantly intelligible to myself and the more i dwelt upon it the more hopeless it appeared  my course of study had led me to believe that all mental and moral feelings and qualities whether of a good or of a bad kind were the results of association that we love one thing and hate another take pleasure in one sort of action or contemplation and pain in another sort through the clinging of pleasurable or painful ideas to those things from the effect of education or of experience as a corollary from this i had always heard it maintained by my father and was myself convinced that the object of education should be to form the strongest possible associations of the salutary class associations of pleasure with all things beneficial to the great whole and of pain with all things hurtful to it this doctrine appeared inexpugnable but it now seemed to me on retrospect that my teachers had occupied themselves but superficially with the means of forming and keeping up these salutary associations they seemed to have trusted altogether to the old familiar instruments praise and blame reward and punishment now i did not doubt that by these means begun early and applied unremittingly intense associations of pain and pleasure especially of pain might be created and might produce desires and aversions capable of lasting undiminished to the end of life but there must always be something artificial and casual in associations thus produced the pains and pleasures thus forcibly associated with things are not connected with them by any natural tie and it is therefore i thought essential to the durability of these associations that they should have become so intense and inveterate as to be practically indissoluble before the habitual exercise of the power of analysis had commenced for i now saw or thought i saw what i had always before received with incredulity that the habit of analysis has a tendency to wear away the feelings as indeed it has when no other mental habit is cultivated and the analysing spirit remains without its natural complements and correctives the very excellence of analysis i argued is that it tends to weaken and undermine whatever is the result of prejudice that it enables us mentally to separate ideas which have only casually clung together and no associations whatever could ultimately resist this dissolving force were it not that we owe to analysis our clearest knowledge of the permanent sequences in nature the real connexions between things not dependent on our will and feelings natural laws by virtue of which in many cases one thing is inseparable from another in fact which laws in proportion as they are clearly perceived and imaginatively realized cause our ideas of things which are always joined together in nature to cohere more and more closely in our thoughts analytic habits may thus even strengthen the associations between causes and effects means and ends but tend altogether to weaken those which are to speak familiarly a mere matter of feeling they are therefore i thought favourable to prudence and clear sightedness but a perpetual worm at the root both of the passions and of the virtues and above all fearfully undermine all desires and all pleasures which are the effects of association that is according to the theory i held all except the purely physical and organic of the entire insufficiency of which to make life desirable no one had a stronger conviction than i had these were the laws of human nature by which as it seemed to me i had been brought to my present state all those to whom i looked up were of opinion that the pleasure of sympathy with human beings and the feelings which made the good of others and especially of mankind on a large scale the object of existence were the greatest and surest sources of happiness of the truth of this i was convinced but to know that a feeling would make me happy if i had it did not give me the feeling my education i thought had failed to create these feelings in sufficient strength to resist the dissolving influence of analysis while the whole course of my intellectual cultivation had made precocious and premature analysis the inveterate habit of my mind i was thus as i said to myself left stranded at the commencement of my voyage with a wellequipped ship and a rudder but no sail without any real desire for the ends which i had been so carefully fitted out to work for no delight in virtue or the general good but also just as little in anything else the fountains of vanity and ambition seemed to have dried up within me as completely as those of benevolence i had had as i reflected some gratification of vanity at too early an age i had obtained some distinction and felt myself of some importance before the desire of distinction and of importance had grown into a passion and little as it was which i had attained yet having been attained too early like all pleasures enjoyed too soon it had made me blasé and indifferent to the pursuit thus neither selfish nor unselfish pleasures were pleasures to me and there seemed no power in nature sufficient to begin the formation of my character anew and create in a mind now irretrievably analytic fresh associations of pleasure with any of the objects of human desire  these were the thoughts which mingled with the dry heavy dejection of the melancholy winter of 18267 during this time i was not incapable of my usual occupations i went on with them mechanically by the mere force of habit i had been so drilled in a certain sort of mental exercise that i could still carry it on when all the spirit had gone out of it i even composed and spoke several speeches at the debating society how or with what degree of success i know not of four years continual speaking at that society this is the only year of which i remember next to nothing two lines of coleridge in whom alone of all writers i have found a true description of what i felt were often in my thoughts not at this time for i had never read them but in a later period of the same mental malady      work without hope draws nectar in a sieve      and hope without an object cannot live  in all probability my case was by no means so peculiar as i fancied it and i doubt not that many others have passed through a similar state but the idiosyncrasies of my education had given to the general phenomenon a special character which made it seem the natural effect of causes that it was hardly possible for time to remove i frequently asked myself if i could or if i was bound to go on living when life must be passed in this manner i generally answered to myself that i did not think i could possibly bear it beyond a year when however not more than half that duration of time had elapsed a small ray of light broke in upon my gloom i was reading accidentally marmontels mémoires and came to the passage which relates his fathers death the distressed position of the family and the sudden inspiration by which he then a mere boy felt and made them feel that he would be everything to themwould supply the place of all that they had lost a vivid conception of the scene and its feelings came over me and i was moved to tears from this moment my burden grew lighter the oppression of the thought that all feeling was dead within me was gone i was no longer hopeless i was not a stock or a stone i had still it seemed some of the material out of which all worth of character and all capacity for happiness are made relieved from my everpresent sense of irremediable wretchedness i gradually found that the ordinary incidents of life could again give me some pleasure that i could again find enjoyment not intense but sufficient for cheerfulness in sunshine and sky in books in conversation in public affairs and that there was once more excitement though of a moderate kind in exerting myself for my opinions and for the public good thus the cloud gradually drew off and i again enjoyed life and though i had several relapses some of which lasted many months i never again was as miserable as i had been  the experiences of this period had two very marked effects on my opinions and character in the first place they led me to adopt a theory of life very unlike that on which i had before i acted and having much in common with what at that time i certainly had never heard of the antiself consciousness theory of carlyle i never indeed wavered in the conviction that happiness is the test of all rules of conduct and the end of life but i now thought that this end was only to be attained by not making it the direct end those only are happy i thought who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness on the happiness of others on the improvement of mankind even on some art or pursuit followed not as a means but as itself an ideal end aiming thus at something else they find happiness by the way the enjoyments of life such was now my theory are sufficient to make it a pleasant thing when they are taken en passant without being made a principal object once make them so and they are immediately felt to be insufficient they will not bear a scrutinizing examination ask yourself whether you are happy and you cease to be so the only chance is to treat not happiness but some end external to it as the purpose of life let your selfconsciousness your scrutiny your selfinterrogation exhaust themselves on that and if otherwise fortunately circumstanced you will inhale happiness with the air you breathe without dwelling on it or thinking about it without either forestalling it in imagination or putting it to flight by fatal questioning this theory now became the basis of my philosophy of life and i still hold to it as the best theory for all those who have but a moderate degree of sensibility and of capacity i for enjoyment that is for the great majority of mankind  the other important change which my opinions at this time underwent was that i for the first time gave its proper place among the prime necessities of human wellbeing to the internal culture of the individual i ceased to attach almost exclusive importance to the ordering of outward circumstances and the training of the human being for speculation and for action  i had now learnt by experience that the passing susceptibilities needed to be cultivated as well as the active capacities and required to be nourished and enriched as well as guided i did not for an instant lose sight of or undervalue that part of the truth which i had seen before i never turned recreant to intellectual culture or ceased to consider the power and practice of analysis as an essential condition both of individual and of social improvement but 1 thought that it had consequences which required to be corrected by joining other kinds of cultivation with it the maintenance of a due balance among the faculties now seemed to be of primary importance the cultivation of the feelings became one of the cardinal points in my ethical and philosophical creed and my thoughts and inclinations turned in an increasing degree towards whatever seemed capable of being instrumental to that object  i now began to find meaning in the things which i had read or heard about the importance of poetry and art as instruments of human culture but it was some time longer before i began to know this by personal experience the only one of the imaginative arts in which i had from childhood taken great pleasure was music the best effect of which and in this it surpasses perhaps every other art consists in exciting enthusiasm in winding up to a high pitch those feelings of an elevated kind which are already in the character but to which this excitement gives a glow and a fervour which though transitory at its utmost height is precious for sustaining them at other times this effect of music i had often experienced but like all my pleasurable susceptibilities it was suspended during the gloomy period i had sought relief again and again from this quarter but found none after the tide had turned and i was in process of recovery i had been helped forward by music but in a much less elevated manner i at this time first became acquainted with webers oberon and the extreme pleasure which i drew from its delicious melodies did me good by showing me a source of pleasure to which i was as susceptible as ever the good however was much impaired by the thought that the pleasure of music as is quite true of such pleasure as this was that of mere tune fades with familiarity and requires either to be revived by intermittence or fed by continual novelty and it is very characteristic both of my then state and of the general tone of my mind at this period of my life that i was seriously tormented by the thought of the exhaustibility of musical combinations the octave consists only of five tones and two semitones which can be put together in only a limited number of ways of which but a small proportion are beautiful most of these it seemed to me must have been already discovered and there could not be room for a long succession of mozarts and webers to strike out as these had done entirely new and surpassingly rich veins of musical beauty this source of anxiety may perhaps be thought to resemble that of the philosophers of laputa who feared lest the sun should be burnt out it was however connected with the best feature in my character and the only good point to be found in my very unromantic and in no way honourable distress for though my dejection honestly looked at could not be called other than egotistical produced by the ruin as i thought of my fabric of happiness yet the destiny of mankind in general was ever in my thoughts and could not be separated from my own i felt that the flaw in my life must be a flaw in life itself that the question was whether if the reformers of society and government could succeed in their objects and every person in the community were free and in a state of physical comfort the pleasures of life being no longer kept up by struggle and privation would cease to be pleasures and i felt that unless i could see my way to some better hope than this for human happiness in general my dejection must continue but that if i could see such an outlet i should then look on the world with pleasure content as far as i was myself concerned with any fair share of the general lot  this state of my thoughts and feelings made the fact of my reading wordsworth for the first time in the autumn of 1828 an important event of my life i took up the collection of his poems from curiosity with no expectation of mental relief from it though i had before resorted to poetry with that hope in the worst period of my depression i had read through the whole of byron then new to me to try whether a poet whose peculiar department was supposed to be that of the intenser feelings could rouse any feeling in me as might be expected i got no good from this reading but the reverse the poets state of mind was too like my own his was the lament of a man who had worn out all pleasures and who seemed to think that life to all who possess the good things of it must necessarily be the vapid uninteresting thing which i found it his harold and manfred had the same burden on them which i had and i was not in a frame of mind to desire any comfort from the vehement sensual passion of his giaours or the sullenness of his laras but while byron was exactly what did not suit my condition wordsworth was exactly what did i had looked into the excursion two or three years before and found little in it and i should probably have found as little had i read it at this time but the miscellaneous poems in the twovolume edition of 1815 to which little of value was added in the latter part of the authors life proved to be the precise thing for my mental wants at that particular juncture  in the first place these poems addressed themselves powerfully to one of the strongest of my pleasurable susceptibilities the love of rural objects and natural scenery to which i had been indebted not only for much of the pleasure of my life but quite recently for relief from one of my longest relapses into depression in this power of rural beauty over me there was a foundation laid for taking pleasure in wordsworths poetry the more so as his scenery lies mostly among mountains which owing to my early pyrenean excursion were my ideal of natural beauty but wordsworth would never have had any great effect on me if he had merely placed before me beautiful pictures of natural scenery scott does this still better than wordsworth and a very secondrate landscape does it more effectually than any poet what made wordsworths poems a medicine for my state of mind was that they expressed not mere outward beauty but states of feeling and of thought coloured by feeling under the excitement of beauty they seemed to be the very culture of the feelings which i was in quest of in them i seemed to draw from a source of inward joy of sympathetic and imaginative pleasure which could be shared in by all human beings which had no connection with struggle or imperfection but would be made richer by every improvement in the physical or social condition of mankind from them i seemed to learn what would be the perennial sources of happiness when all the greater evils of life shall have been removed and i felt myself at once better and happier as i came under their influence there have certainly been even in our own age greater poets than wordsworth but poetry of deeper and loftier feeling could not have done for me at that time what his did i needed to be made to feel that there was real permanent happiness in tranquil contemplation wordsworth taught me this not only without turning away from but with a greatly increased interest in the common feelings and common destiny of human beings and the delight which these poems gave me proved that with culture of this sort there was nothing to dread from the most confirmed habit of analysis at the conclusion of the poems came the famous ode falsely called platonic intimations of immortality in which along with more than his usual sweetness of melody and rhythm and along with the two passages of grand imagery but bad philosophy so often quoted i found that he too had had similar experience to mine that he also had felt that the first freshness of youthful enjoyment of life was not lasting but that he had sought for compensation and found it in the way in which he was now teaching me to find it the result was that i gradually but completely emerged from my habitual depression and was never again subject to it i long continued to value wordsworth less according to his intrinsic merits than by the measure of what he had done for me compared with the greatest poets he may be said to be the poet of unpoetical natures possessed of quiet and contemplative tastes but unpoetical natures are precisely those which require poetic cultivation this cultivation wordsworth is much more fitted to give than poets who are intrinsically far more poets than he  it so fell out that the merits of wordsworth were the occasion of my first public declaration of my new way of thinking and separation from those of my habitual companions who had not undergone a similar change the person with whom at that time i was most in the habit of comparing notes on such subjects was roebuck and i induced him to read wordsworth in whom he also at first seemed to find much to admire but i like most wordsworthians threw myself into strong antagonism to byron both as a poet and as to his influence on the character roebuck all whose instincts were those of action and struggle had on the contrary a strong relish and great admiration of byron whose writings he regarded as the poetry of human life while wordsworths according to him was that of flowers and butterflies we agreed to have the fight out at our debating society where we accordingly discussed for two evenings the comparative merits of byron and wordsworth propounding and illustrating by long recitations our respective theories of poetry sterling also in a brilliant speech putting forward his particular theory this was the first debate on any weighty subject in which roebuck and i had been on opposite sides the schism between us widened from this time more and more though we continued for some years longer to be companions in the beginning our chief divergence related to the cultivation of the feelings roebuck was in many respects very different from the vulgar notion of a benthamite or utilitarian he was a lover of poetry and of most of the fine arts he took great pleasure in music in dramatic performances especially in painting and himself drew and designed landscapes with great facility and beauty but he never could be made to see that these things have any value as aids in the formation of character personally instead of being as benthamites are supposed to be void of feeling he had very quick and strong sensibilities but like most englishmen who have feelings he found his feelings stand very much in his way he was much more susceptible to the painful sympathies than to the pleasurable and looking for his happiness elsewhere he wished that his feelings should be deadened rather than quickened and in truth the english character and english social circumstances make it so seldom possible to derive happiness from the exercise of the sympathies that it is not wonderful if they count for little in an englishmans scheme of life in most other countries the paramount importance of the sympathies as a constituent of individual happiness is an axiom taken for granted rather than needing any formal statement but most english thinkers always seem to regard them as necessary evils required for keeping mens actions benevolent and compassionate roebuck was or appeared to be this kind of englishman he saw little good in any cultivation of the feelings and none at all in cultivating them through the imagination which he thought was only cultivating illusions it was in vain i urged on him that the imaginative emotion which an idea when vividly conceived excites in us is not an illusion but a fact as real as any of the other qualities of objects and far from implying anything erroneous and delusive in our mental apprehension of the object is quite consistent with the most accurate knowledge and most perfect practical recognition of all its physical and intellectual laws and relations the intensest feeling of the beauty of a cloud lighted by the setting sun is no hindrance to my knowing that the cloud is vapour of water subject to all the laws of vapours in a state of suspension and i am just as likely to allow for and act on these physical laws whenever there is occasion to do so as if i had been incapable of perceiving any distinction between beauty and ugliness  while my intimacy with roebuck diminished i fell more and more into friendly intercourse with our coleridgian adversaries in the society frederick maurice and john sterling both subsequently so well known the former by his writings the latter through the biographies by hare and carlyle of these two friends maurice was the thinker sterling the orator and impassioned expositor of thoughts which at this period were almost entirely formed for him by maurice  with maurice i had for some time been acquainted through eyton tooke who had known him at cambridge and although my discussions with him were almost always disputes i had carried away from them much that helped to build up my new fabric of thought in the same way as i was deriving much from coleridge and from the writings of goethe and other german authors which i read during these years i have so deep a respect for maurices character and purposes as well as for his great mental gifts that it is with some unwillingness i say anything which may seem to place him on a less high eminence than i would gladly be able to accord to him but i have always thought that there was more intellectual power wasted in maurice than in any other of my contemporaries few of them certainly have had so much to waste great powers of generalization rare ingenuity and subtlety and a wide perception of important and unobvious truths served him not for putting something better into the place of the worthless heap of received opinions on the great subjects of thought but for proving to his own mind that the church of england had known everything from the first and that all the truths on the ground of which the church and orthodoxy have been attacked many of which he saw as clearly as anyone are not only consistent with the thirtynine articles but are better understood and expressed in those articles than by anyone who rejects them i have never been able to find any other explanation of this than by attributing it to that timidity of conscience combined with original sensitiveness of temperament which has so often driven highly gifted men into romanism from the need of a firmer support than they can find in the independent conclusions of their own judgment any more vulgar kind of timidity no one who knew maurice would ever think of imputing to him even if he had not given public proof of his freedom from it by his ultimate collision with some of the opinions commonly regarded as orthodox and by his noble origination of the christian socialist movement the nearest parallel to him in a moral point of view is coleridge to whom in merely intellectual power apart from poetical genius i think him decidedly superior at this time however he might be described as a disciple of coleridge and sterling as a disciple of coleridge and of him the modifications which were taking place in my old opinions gave me some points of contact with them and both maurice and sterling were of considerable use to my development with sterling i soon became very intimate and was more attached to him than i have ever been to any other man he was indeed one of the most lovable of men his frank cordial affectionate and expansive character a love of truth alike conspicuous in the highest things and the humblest a generous and ardent nature which threw itself with impetuosity into the opinions it adopted but was as eager to do justice to the doctrines and the men it was opposed to as to make war on what it thought their errors and an equal devotion to the two cardinal points of liberty and duty formed a combination of qualities as attractive to me as to all others who knew him as well as i did with his open mind and heart he found no difficulty in joining hands with me across the gulf which as yet divided our opinions he told me how he and others had looked upon me from hearsay information as a made or manufactured man having had a certain impress of opinion stamped on me which i could only reproduce and what a change took place in his feelings when he found in the discussion on wordsworth and byron that wordsworth and all which that name implies belonged to me as much as to him and his friends the failure of his health soon scattered all his plans of life and compelled him to live at a distance from london so that after the first year or two of our acquaintance we only saw each other at distant intervals but as he said himself in one of his letters to carlyle when we did meet it was like brothers though he was never in the full sense of the word a profound thinker his openness of mind and the moral courage in which he greatly surpassed maurice made him outgrow the dominion which maurice and coleridge had once exercised over his intellect though he retained to the last a great but discriminating admiration of both and towards maurice a warm affection except in that short and transitory phasis of his life during which he made the mistake of becoming a clergyman his mind was ever progressive and the advance he always seemed to have made when i saw him after an interval made me apply to him what goethe said of schiller er hatte eine furchtliche fortschreitung he and i started from intellectual points almost as wide apart as the poles but the distance between us was always diminishing if i made steps towards some of his opinions he during his short life was constantly approximating more and more to several of mine and if he had lived and had health and vigour to prosecute his ever assiduous selfculture there is no knowing how much further this spontaneous assimilation might have proceeded  after 1829 i withdrew from attendance on the debating society i had had enough of speechmaking and was glad to carry on my private studies and meditations without any immediate call for outward assertion of their results i found the fabric of my old and taught opinions giving way in many fresh places and i never allowed it to fall to pieces but was incessantly occupied in weaving it anew i never in the course of my transition was content to remain for ever so short a time confused and unsettled when i had taken in any new idea i could not rest till i had adjusted its relation to my old opinions and ascertained exactly how far its effect ought to extend in modifying or superseding them  the conflicts which i had so often had to sustain in defending the theory of government laid down in benthams and my fathers writings and the acquaintance i had obtained with other schools of political thinking made me aware of many things which that doctrine professing to be a theory of government in general ought to have made room for and did not but these things as yet remained with me rather as corrections to be made in applying the theory to practice than as defects in the theory i felt that politics could not be a science of specific experience and that the accusations against the benthamic theory of being a theory of proceeding a priori by way of general reasoning instead of baconian experiment showed complete ignorance of bacons principles and of the necessary conditions of experimental investigation at this juncture appeared in the edinburgh review macaulays famous attack on my fathers essay on government this gave me much to think about i saw that macaulays conception of the logic of politics was erroneous that he stood up for the empirical mode of treating political phenomena against the philosophical that even in physical science his notions of philosophizing might have recognised kepler but would have excluded newton and laplace but i could not help feeling that though the tone was unbecoming an error for which the writer at a later period made the most ample and honourable amends there was truth in several of his strictures on my fathers treatment of the subject that my fathers premises were really too narrow and included but a small number of the general truths on which in politics the important consequences depend identity of interest between the governing body and the community at large is not in any practical sense which can be attached to it the only thing on which good government depends neither can this identity of interest be secured by the mere conditions of election i was not at all satisfied with the mode in which my father met the criticisms of macaulay he did not as i thought he ought to have done justify himself by saying i was not writing a scientific treatise on politics i was writing an argument for parliamentary reform he treated macaulays argument as simply irrational an attack upon the reasoning faculty an example of the saying of hobbes that when reason is against a man a man will be against reason this made me think that there was really something more fundamentally erroneous in my fathers conception of philosophical method as applicable to politics than i had hitherto supposed there was but i did not at first see clearly what the error might be at last it flashed upon me all at once in the course of other studies in the early part of 1830 i had begun to put on paper the ideas on logic chiefly on the distinctions among terms and the import of propositions which had been suggested and in part worked out in the morning conversations already spoken of having secured these thoughts from being lost i pushed on into the other parts of the subject to try whether i could do anything further towards clearing up the theory of logic generally i grappled at once with the problem of induction postponing that of reasoning on the ground that it is necessary to obtain premises before we can reason from them now induction is mainly a process for finding the causes of effects and in attempting to fathom the mode of tracing causes and effects in physical science i soon saw that in the more perfect of the sciences we ascend by generalization from particulars to the tendencies of causes considered singly and then reason downward from those separate tendencies to the effect of the same causes when combined i then asked myself what is the ultimate analysis of this deductive process the common theory of the syllogism evidently throwing no light upon it my practice learnt from hobbes and my father being to study abstract principles by means of the best concrete instances i could find the composition of forces in dynamics occurred to me as the most complete example of the logical process i was investigating on examining accordingly what the mind does when it applies the principle of the composition of forces i found that it performs a simple act of addition it adds the separate effect of the one force to the separate effect of the other and puts down the sum of these separate effects as the joint effect but is this a legitimate process in dynamics and in all the mathematical branches of physics it is but in some other cases as in chemistry it is not and i then recollected that something not unlike this was pointed out as one of the distinctions between chemical and mechanical phenomena in the introduction to that favourite of my boyhood thompsons system of chemistry this distinction at once made my mind clear as to what was perplexing me in respect to the philosophy of politics i now saw that a science is either deductive or experimental according as in the province it deals with the effects of causes when conjoined are or are not the sums of the effects which the same causes produce when separate it followed that politics must be a deductive science it thus appeared that both macaulay and my father were wrong the one in assimilating the method of philosophizing in politics to the purely experimental method of chemistry while the other though right in adopting a deductive method had made a wrong selection of one having taken as the type of deduction not the appropriate process that of the deductive branches of natural philosophy but the inappropriate one of pure geometry which not being a science of causation at all does not require or admit of any summingup of effects a foundation was thus laid in my thoughts for the principal chapters of what i afterwards published on the logic of the moral sciences and my new position in respect to my old political creed now became perfectly definite  if i am asked what system of political philosophy i substituted for that which as a philosophy i had abandoned i answer no system only a conviction that the true system was something much more complex and manysided than i had previously had any idea of and that its office was to supply not a set of model institutions but principles from which the institutions suitable to any given circumstances might be deduced the influences of european that is to say continental thought and especially those of the reaction of the nineteenth century against the eighteenth were now streaming in upon me they came from various quarters from the writings of coleridge which i had begun to read with interest even before the change in my opinions from the coleridgians with whom i was in personal intercourse from what i had read of goethe from carlyles early articles in the edinburgh and foreign reviews though for a long time i saw nothing in these as my father saw nothing in them to the last but insane rhapsody from these sources and from the acquaintance i kept up with the french literature of the time i derived among other ideas which the general turning upside down of the opinions of european thinkers had brought uppermost these in particular that the human mind has a certain order of possible progress in which some things must precede others an order which governments and public instructors can modify to some but not to an unlimited extent that all questions of political institutions are relative not absolute and that different stages of human progress not only will have but ought to have different institutions that government is always either in the hands or passing into the hands of whatever is the strongest power in society and that what this power is does not depend on institutions but institutions on it that any general theory or philosophy of politics supposes a previous theory of human progress and that this is the same thing with a philosophy of history these opinions true in the main were held in an exaggerated and violent manner by the thinkers with whom i was now most accustomed to compare notes and who as usual with a reaction ignored that half of the truth which the thinkers of the eighteenth century saw but though at one period of my progress i for some time undervalued that great century i never joined in the reaction against it but kept as firm hold of one side of the truth as i took of the other the fight between the nineteenth century and the eighteenth always reminded me of the battle about the shield one side of which was white and the other black i marvelled at the blind rage with which the combatants rushed against one another i applied to them and to coleridge himself many of coleridges sayings about half truths and goethes device manysidedness was one which i would most willingly at this period have taken for mine  the writers by whom more than by any others a new mode of political thinking was brought home to me were those of the st simonian school in france in 1829 and 1830 i became acquainted with some of their writings they were then only in the earlier stages of their speculations they had not yet dressed out their philosophy as a religion nor had they organized their scheme of socialism they were just beginning to question the principle of hereditary property i was by no means prepared to go with them even this length but i was greatly struck with the connected view which they for the first time presented to me of the natural order of human progress and especially with their division of all history into organic periods and critical periods during the organic periods they said mankind accept with firm conviction some positive creed claiming jurisdiction over all their actions and containing more or less of truth and adaptation to the needs of humanity under its influence they make all the progress compatible with the creed and finally outgrow it when a period follows of criticism and negation in which mankind lose their old convictions without acquiring any new ones of a general or authoritative character except the conviction that the old are false the period of greek and roman polytheism so long as really believed in by instructed greeks and romans was an organic period succeeded by the critical or sceptical period of the greek philosophers another organic period came in with christianity the corresponding critical period began with the reformation has lasted ever since still lasts and cannot altogether cease until a new organic period has been inaugurated by the triumph of a yet more advanced creed these ideas i knew were not peculiar to the st simonians on the contrary they were the general property of europe or at least of germany and france but they had never to my knowledge been so completely systematized as by these writers nor the distinguishing characteristics of a critical period so powerfully set forth for i was not then acquainted with fichtes lectures on the characteristics of the present age in carlyle indeed i found bitter denunciations of an age of unbelief and of the present age as such which i like most people at that time supposed to be passionate protests in favour of the old modes of belief but all that was true in these denunciations i thought that i found more calmly and philosophically stated by the st simonians among their publications too there was one which seemed to me far superior to the rest in which the general idea was matured into something much more definite and instructive this was an early work of auguste comte who then called himself and even announced himself in the titlepage as a pupil of saint simon in this tract m comte first put forth the doctrine which he afterwards so copiously illustrated of the natural succession of three stages in every department of human knowledge first the theological next the metaphysical and lastly the positive stage and contended that social science must be subject to the same law that the feudal and catholic system was the concluding phasis of the theological state of the social science protestantism the commencement and the doctrines of the french revolution the consummation of the metaphysical and that its positive state was yet to come this doctrine harmonized well with my existing notions to which it seemed to give a scientific shape i already regarded the methods of physical science as the proper models for political but the chief benefit which i derived at this time from the trains of thought suggested by the st simonians and by comte was that i obtained a clearer conception than ever before of the peculiarities of an era of transition in opinion and ceased to mistake the moral and intellectual characteristics of such an era for the normal attributes of humanity i looked forward through the present age of loud disputes but generally weak convictions to a future which shall unite the best qualities of the critical with the best qualities of the organic periods unchecked liberty of thought unbounded freedom of individual action in all modes not hurtful to others but also convictions as to what is right and wrong useful and pernicious deeply engraven on the feelings by early education and general unanimity of sentiment and so firmly grounded in reason and in the true exigencies of life that they shall not like all former and present creeds religious ethical and political require to be periodically thrown off and replaced by others  m comte soon left the st simonians and i lost sight of him and his writings for a number of years but the st simonians i continued to cultivate i was kept au courant of their progress by one of their most enthusiastic disciples m gustave deichthal who about that time passed a considerable interval in england i was introduced to their chiefs bazard and enfantin in 1830 and as long as their public teachings and proselytism continued i read nearly everything they wrote their criticisms on the common doctrines of liberalism seemed to me full of important truth and it was partly by their writings that my eyes were opened to the very limited and temporary value of the old political economy which assumes private property and inheritance as indefeasible facts and freedom of production and exchange as the dernier mot of social improvement the scheme gradually unfolded by the st simonians under which the labour and capital of society would be managed for the general account of the community every individual being required to take a share of labour either as thinker teacher artist or producer all being classed according to their capacity and remunerated according to their work appeared to me a far superior description of socialism to owens their aim seemed to me desirable and rational however their means might be inefficacious and though i neither believed in the practicability nor in the beneficial operation of their social machinery i felt that the proclamation of such an ideal of human society could not but tend to give a beneficial direction to the efforts of others to bring society as at present constituted nearer to some ideal standard i honoured them most of all for what they have been most cried down forthe boldness and freedom from prejudice with which they treated the subject of the family the most important of any and needing more fundamental alterations than remain to be made in any other great social institution but on which scarcely any reformer has the courage to touch in proclaiming the perfect equality of men and women and an entirely new order of things in regard to their relations with one another the st simonians in common with owen and fourier have entitled themselves to the grateful remembrance of future generations  in giving an account of this period of my life i have only specified such of my new impressions as appeared to me both at the time and since to be a kind of turning points marking a definite progress in my mode of thought but these few selected points give a very insufficient idea of the quantity of thinking which i carried on respecting a host of subjects during these years of transition much of this it is true consisted in rediscovering things known to all the world which i had previously disbelieved or disregarded but the rediscovery was to me a discovery giving me plenary possession of the truths not as traditional platitudes but fresh from their source and it seldom failed to place them in some new light by which they were reconciled with and seemed to confirm while they modified the truths less generally known which lay in my early opinions and in no essential part of which i at any time wavered all my new thinking only laid the foundation of these more deeply and strongly while it often removed misapprehension and confusion of ideas which had perverted their effect for example during the later returns of my dejection the doctrine of what is called philosophical necessity weighed on my existence like an incubus i felt as if i was scientifically proved to be the helpless slave of antecedent circumstances as if my character and that of all others had been formed for us by agencies beyond our control and was wholly out of our own power i often said to myself what a relief it would be if i could disbelieve the doctrine of the formation of character by circumstances and remembering the wish of fox respecting the doctrine of resistance to governments that it might never be forgotten by kings nor remembered by subjects i said that it would be a blessing if the doctrine of necessity could be believed by all quoad the characters of others and disbelieved in regard to their own i pondered painfully on the subject till gradually i saw light through it i perceived that the word necessity as a name for the doctrine of cause and effect applied to human action carried with it a misleading association and that this association was the operative force in the depressing and paralysing influence which i had experienced i saw that though our character is formed by circumstances our own desires can do much to shape those circumstances and that what is really inspiriting and ennobling in the doctrine of freewill is the conviction that we have real power over the formation of our own character that our will by influencing some of our circumstances can modify our future habits or capabilities of willing all this was entirely consistent with the doctrine of circumstances or rather was that doctrine itself properly understood from that time i drew in my own mind a clear distinction between the doctrine of circumstances and fatalism discarding altogether the misleading word necessity the theory which i now for the first time rightly apprehended ceased altogether to be discouraging and besides the relief to my spirits i no longer suffered under the burdenso heavy to one who aims at being a reformer in opinionsof thinking one doctrine true and the contrary doctrine morally beneficial the train of thought which had extricated me from this dilemma seemed to me in after years fitted to render a similar service to others and it now forms the chapter on liberty and necessity in the concluding book of my system of logic  again in politics though i no longer accepted the doctrine of the essay on government as a scientific theory though i ceased to consider representative democracy as an absolute principle and regarded it as a question of time place and circumstance though i now looked upon the choice of political institutions as a moral and educational question more than one of material interests thinking that it ought to be decided mainly by the consideration what great improvement in life and culture stands next in order for the people concerned as the condition of their further progress and what institutions are most likely to promote that nevertheless this change in the premises of my political philosophy did not alter my practical political creed as to the requirements of my own time and country i was as much as ever a radical and democrat for europe and especially for england i thought the predominance of the aristocratic classes the noble and the rich in the english constitution an evil worth any struggle to get rid of not on account of taxes or any such comparatively small inconvenience but as the great demoralizing agency in the country demoralizing first because it made the conduct of the government an example of gross public immorality through the predominance of private over public interests in the state and the abuse of the powers of legislation for the advantage of classes secondly and in a still greater degree because the respect of the multitude always attaching itself principally to that which in the existing state of society is the chief passport to power and under english institutions riches hereditary or acquired being the almost exclusive source of political importance riches and the signs of riches were almost the only things really respected and the life of the people was mainly devoted to the pursuit of them i thought that while the higher and richer classes held the power of government the instruction and improvement of the mass of the people were contrary to the selfinterest of those classes because tending to render the people more powerful for throwing off the yoke but if the democracy obtained a large and perhaps the principal share in the governing power it would become the interest of the opulent classes to promote their education in order to ward off really mischievous errors and especially those which would lead to unjust violations of property on these grounds i was not only as ardent as ever for democratic institutions but earnestly hoped that owenite st simonian and all other antiproperty doctrines might spread widely among the poorer classes not that i thought those doctrines true or desired that they should be acted on but in order that the higher classes might be made to see that they had more to fear from the poor when uneducated than when educated  in this frame of mind the french revolution of july found me it roused my utmost enthusiasm and gave me as it were a new existence i went at once to paris was introduced to lafayette and laid the groundwork of the intercourse i afterwards kept up with several of the active chiefs of the extreme popular party after my return i entered warmly as a writer into the political discussions of the time which soon became still more exciting by the coming in of lord greys ministry and the proposing of the reform bill for the next few years i wrote copiously in newspapers it was about this time that fonblanque who had for some time written the political articles in the examiner became the proprietor and editor of the paper it is not forgotten with what verve and talent as well as fine wit he carried it on during the whole period of lord greys ministry and what importance it assumed as the principal representative in the newspaper press of radical opinions the distinguishing character of the paper was given to it entirely by his own articles which formed at least threefourths of all the original writing contained in it but of the remaining fourth i contributed during those years a much larger share than anyone else i wrote nearly all the articles on french subjects including a weekly summary of french politics often extending to considerable length together with many leading articles on general politics commercial and financial legislation and any miscellaneous subjects in which i felt interested and which were suitable to the paper including occasional reviews of books mere newspaper articles on the occurrences or questions of the moment gave no opportunity for the development of any general mode of thought but i attempted in the beginning of 1831 to embody in a series of articles headed the spirit of the age some of my new opinions and especially to point out in the character of the present age the anomalies and evils characteristic of the transition from a system of opinions which had worn out to another only in process of being formed these articles were i fancy lumbering in style and not lively or striking enough to be at any time acceptable to newspaper readers but had they been far more attractive still at that particular moment when great political changes were impending and engrossing all minds these discussions were illtimed and missed fire altogether the only effect which i know to have been produced by them was that carlyle then living in a secluded part of scotland read them in his solitude and saying to himself as he afterwards told me here is a new mystic inquired on coming to london that autumn respecting their authorship an inquiry which was the immediate cause of our becoming personally acquainted  i have already mentioned carlyles earlier writings as one of the channels through which i received the influences which enlarged my early narrow creed but i do not think that those writings by themselves would ever have had any effect on my opinions what truths they contained though of the very kind which i was already receiving from other quarters were presented in a form and vesture less suited than any other to give them access to a mind trained as mine had been they seemed a haze of poetry and german metaphysics in which almost the only clear thing was a strong animosity to most of the opinions which were the basis of my mode of thought religious scepticism utilitarianism the doctrine of circumstances and the attaching any importance to democracy logic or political economy instead of my having been taught anything in the first instance by carlyle it was only in proportion as i came to see the same truths through media more suited to my mental constitution that i recognised them in his writings then indeed the wonderful power with which he put them forth made a deep impression upon me and i was during a long period one of his most fervent admirers but the good his writings did me was not as philosophy to instruct but as poetry to animate even at the time when our acquaintance commenced i was not sufficiently advanced in my new modes of thought to appreciate him fully a proof of which is that on his showing me the manuscript of sartor resartus his best and greatest work which he just then finished i made little of it though when it came out about two years afterwards in frasers magazine i read it with enthusiastic admiration and the keenest delight i did not seek and cultivate carlyle less on account of the fundamental differences in our philosophy he soon found out that i was not another mystic and when for the sake of my own integrity i wrote to him a distinct profession of all those of my opinions which i knew he most disliked he replied that the chief difference between us was that i was as yet consciously nothing of a mystic i do not know at what period he gave up the expectation that i was destined to become one but though both his and my opinions underwent in subsequent years considerable changes we never approached much nearer to each others modes of thought than we were in the first years of our acquaintance i did not however deem myself a competent judge of carlyle i felt that he was a poet and that i was not that he was a man of intuition which i was not and that as such he not only saw many things long before me which i could only when they were pointed out to me hobble after and prove but that it was highly probable he could see many things which were not visible to me even after they were pointed out i knew that i could not see round him and could never be certain that i saw over him and i never presumed to judge him with any definiteness until he was interpreted to me by one greatly the superior of us bothwho was more a poet than he and more a thinker than iwhose own mind and nature included his and infinitely more  among the persons of intellect whom i had known of old the one with whom i had now most points of agreement was the elder austin i have mentioned that he always set himself in opposition to our early sectarianism and latterly he had like myself come under new influences having been appointed professor of jurisprudence in the london university now university college he had lived for some time at bonn to study for his lectures and the influences of german literature and of the german character and state of society had made a very perceptible change in his views of life his personal disposition was much softened he was less militant and polemic his tastes had begun to turn themselves towards the poetic and contemplative he attached much less importance than formerly to outward changes unless accompanied by a better cultivation of the inward nature he had a strong distaste for the general meanness of english life the absence of enlarged thoughts and unselfish desires the low objects on which the faculties of all classes of the english are intent even the kind of public interests which englishmen care for he held in very little esteem he thought that there was more practical good government and which is true enough infinitely more care for the education and mental improvement of all ranks of the people under the prussian monarchy than under the english representative government and he held with the french economistes that the real security for good government is un peuple éclairé which is not always the fruit of popular institutions and which if it could be had without them would do their work better than they though he approved of the reform bill he predicted what in fact occurred that it would not produce the great immediate improvements in government which many expected from it the men he said who could do these great things did not exist in the country there were many points of sympathy between him and me both in the new opinions he had adopted and in the old ones which he retained like me he never ceased to be a utilitarian and with all his love for the germans and enjoyment of their literature never became in the smallest degree reconciled to the innateprinciple metaphysics he cultivated more and more a kind of german religion a religion of poetry and feeling with little if anything of positive dogma while in politics and here it was that i most differed with him he acquired an indifference bordering on contempt for the progress of popular institutions though he rejoiced in that of socialism as the most effectual means of compelling the powerful classes to educate the people and to impress on them the only real means of permanently improving their material condition a limitation of their numbers neither was he at this time fundamentally opposed to socialism in itself as an ultimate result of improvement he professed great disrespect for what he called the universal principles of human nature of the political economists and insisted on the evidence which history and daily experience afford of the extraordinary pliability of human nature a phrase which i have somewhere borrowed from him nor did he think it possible to set any positive bounds to the moral capabilities which might unfold themselves in mankind under an enlightened direction of social and educational influences whether he retained all these opinions to the end of life i know not certainly the modes of thinking of his later years and especially of his last publication were much more tory in their general character than those which he held at this time  my fathers tone of thought and feeling i now felt myself at a great distance from greater indeed than a full and calm explanation and reconsideration on both sides might have shown to exist in reality but my father was not one with whom calm and full explanations on fundamental points of doctrine could be expected at least with one whom he might consider as in some sort a deserter from his standard fortunately we were almost always in strong agreement on the political questions of the day which engrossed a large part of his interest and of his conversation on those matters of opinion on which we differed we talked little he knew that the habit of thinking for myself which his mode of education had fostered sometimes led me to opinions different from his and he perceived from time to time that i did not always tell him how different i expected no good but only pain to both of us from discussing our differences and i never expressed them but when he gave utterance to some opinion or feeling repugnant to mine in a manner which would have made it disingenuousness on my part to remain silent  it remains to speak of what i wrote during these years which independently of my contributions to newspapers was considerable in 1830 and 1831 i wrote the five essays since published under the title of essays on some unsettled questions of political economy almost as they now stand except that in 1833 i partially rewrote the fifth essay they were written with no immediate purpose of publication and when some years later i offered them to a publisher he declined them they were only printed in 1844 after the success of the system of logic i also resumed my speculations on this last subject and puzzled myself like others before me with the great paradox of the discovery of new truths by general reasoning as to the fact there could be no doubt as little could it be doubted that all reasoning is resolvable into syllogisms and that in every syllogism the conclusion is actually contained and implied in the premises how being so contained and implied it could be new truth and how the theorems of geometry so different in appearance from the definitions and axioms could be all contained in these was a difficulty which no one i thought had sufficiently felt and which at all events no one had succeeded in clearing up the explanations offered by whately and others though they might give a temporary satisfaction always in my mind left a mist still hanging over the subject at last when reading a second or third time the chapters on reasoning in the second volume of dugald stewart interrogating myself on every point and following out as far as i knew how every topic of thought which the book suggested i came upon an idea of his respecting the use of axioms in ratiocination which i did not remember to have before noticed but which now in meditating on it seemed to me not only true of axioms but of all general propositions whatever and to be the key of the whole perplexity from this germ grew the theory of the syllogism propounded in the second book of the logic which i immediately fixed by writing it out and now with greatly increased hope of being able to produce a work on logic of some originality and value i proceeded to write the first book from the rough and imperfect draft i had already made what i now wrote became the basis of that part of the subsequent treatise except that it did not contain the theory of kinds which was a later addition suggested by otherwise inextricable difficulties which met me in my first attempt to work out the subject of some of the concluding chapters of the third book at the point which i had now reached i made a halt which lasted five years i had come to the end of my tether i could make nothing satisfactory of induction at this time i continued to read any book which seemed to promise light on the subject and appropriated as well as i could the results but for a long time i found nothing which seemed to open to me any very important vein of meditation  in 1832 i wrote several papers for the first series of taits magazine and one for a quarterly periodical called the jurist which had been founded and for a short time carried on by a set of friends all lawyers and law reformers with several of whom i was acquainted the paper in question is the one on the rights and duties of the state respecting corporation and church property now standing first among the collected dissertations and discussions where one of my articles in tait the currency juggle also appears in the whole mass of what i wrote previous to these there is nothing of sufficient permanent value to justify reprinting the paper in the jurist which i still think a very complete discussion of the rights of the state over foundations showed both sides of my opinions asserting as firmly as i should have done at any time the doctrine that all endowments are national property which the government may and ought to control but not as i should once have done condemning endowments in themselves and proposing that they should be taken to pay off the national debt on the contrary i urged strenuously the importance of a provision for education not dependent on the mere demand of the market that is on the knowledge and discernment of average parents but calculated to establish and keep up a higher standard of instruction than is likely to be spontaneously demanded by the buyers of the article all these opinions have been confirmed and strengthened by the whole of my subsequent reflections      chapter vi  commencement of the most valuable friendship of my life my fathers death writings and other proceedings up to 1840   it was the period of my mental progress which i have now reached that i formed the friendship which has been the honour and chief blessing of my existence as well as the source of a great part of all that i have attempted to do or hope to effect hereafter for human improvement my first introduction to the lady who after a friendship of twenty years consented to become my wife was in 1830 when i was in my twentyfifth and she in her twentythird year with her husbands family it was the renewal of an old acquaintanceship his grandfather lived in the next house to my fathers in newington green and i had sometimes when a boy been invited to play in the old gentlemans garden he was a fine specimen of the old scotch puritan stern severe and powerful but very kind to children on whom such men make a lasting impression although it was years after my introduction to mrs taylor before my acquaintance with her became at all intimate or confidential i very soon felt her to be the most admirable person i had ever known it is not to be supposed that she was or that any one at the age at which i first saw her could be all that she afterwards became least of all could this be true of her with whom selfimprovement progress in the highest and in all senses was a law of her nature a necessity equally from the ardour with which she sought it and from the spontaneous tendency of faculties which could not receive an impression or an experience without making it the source or the occasion of an accession of wisdom up to the time when i first saw her her rich and powerful nature had chiefly unfolded itself according to the received type of feminine genius to her outer circle she was a beauty and a wit with an air of natural distinction felt by all who approached her to the inner a woman of deep and strong feeling of penetrating and intuitive intelligence and of an eminently meditative and poetic nature married at an early age to a most upright brave and honourable man of liberal opinions and good education but without the intellectual or artistic tastes which would have made him a companion for her though a steady and affectionate friend for whom she had true esteem and the strongest affection through life and whom she most deeply lamented when dead shut out by the social disabilities of women from any adequate exercise of her highest faculties in action on the world without her life was one of inward meditation varied by familiar intercourse with a small circle of friends of whom one only long since deceased was a person of genius or of capacities of feeling or intellect kindred with her own but all had more or less of alliance with her in sentiments and opinions into this circle i had the good fortune to be admitted and i soon perceived that she possessed in combination the qualities which in all other persons whom i had known i had been only too happy to find singly in her complete emancipation from every kind of superstition including that which attributes a pretended perfection to the order of nature and the universe and an earnest protest against many things which are still part of the established constitution of society resulted not from the hard intellect but from strength of noble and elevated feeling and coexisted with a highly reverential nature in general spiritual characteristics as well as in temperament and organisation i have often compared her as she was at this time to shelley but in thought and intellect shelley so far as his powers were developed in his short life was but a child compared with what she ultimately became alike in the highest regions of speculation and in the smaller practical concerns of daily life her mind was the same perfect instrument piercing to the very heart and marrow of the matter always seizing the essential idea or principle the same exactness and rapidity of operation pervading as it did her sensitive as well as her mental faculties would with her gifts of feeling and imagination have fitted her to be a consummate artist as her fiery and tender soul and her vigorous eloquence would certainly have made her a great orator and her profound knowledge of human nature and discernment and sagacity in practical life would in the times when such a carrière was open to women have made her eminent among the rulers of mankind her intellectual gifts did but minister to a moral character at once the noblest and the best balanced which i have ever met with in life her unselfishness was not that of a taught system of duties but of a heart which thoroughly identified itself with the feelings of others and often went to excess in consideration for them by imaginatively investing their feelings with the intensity of its own the passion of justice might have been thought to be her strongest feeling but for her boundless generosity and a lovingness ever ready to pour itself forth upon any or all human beings who were capable of giving the smallest feeling in return the rest of her moral characteristics were such as naturally accompany these qualities of mind and heart the most genuine modesty combined with the loftiest pride a simplicity and sincerity which were absolute towards all who were fit to receive them the utmost scorn of whatever was mean and cowardly and a burning indignation at everything brutal or tyrannical faithless or dishonourable in conduct and character while making the broadest distinction between mala in se and mere mala prohibitabetween acts giving evidence of intrinsic badness in feeling and character and those which are only violations of conventions either good or bad violations which whether in themselves right or wrong are capable of being committed by persons in every other respect lovable or admirable  to be admitted into any degree of mental intercourse with a being of these qualities could not but have a most beneficial influence on my development though the effect was only gradual and many years elapsed before her mental progress and mine went forward in the complete companionship they at last attained the benefit i received was far greater than any which i could hope to give though to her who had at first reached her opinions by the moral intuition of a character of strong feeling there was doubtless help as well as encouragement to be derived from one who had arrived at many of the same results by study and reasoning and in the rapidity of her intellectual growth her mental activity which converted everything into knowledge doubtless drew from me as it did from other sources many of its materials what i owe even intellectually to her is in its detail almost infinite of its general character a few words will give some though a very imperfect idea  with those who like all the best and wisest of mankind are dissatisfied with human life as it is and whose feelings are wholly identified with its radical amendment there are two main regions of thought one is the region of ultimate aims the constituent elements of the highest realizable ideal of human life the other is that of the immediately useful and practically attainable in both these departments i have acquired more from her teaching than from all other sources taken together and to say truth it is in these two extremes principally that real certainty lies my own strength lay wholly in the uncertain and slippery intermediate region that of theory or moral and political science respecting the conclusions of which in any of the forms in which i have received or originated them whether as political economy analytic psychology logic philosophy of history or anything else it is not the least of my intellectual obligations to her that i have derived from her a wise scepticism which while it has not hindered me from following out the honest exercise of my thinking faculties to whatever conclusions might result from it has put me on my guard against holding or announcing these conclusions with a degree of confidence which the nature of such speculations does not warrant and has kept my mind not only open to admit but prompt to welcome and eager to seek even on the questions on which i have most meditated any prospect of clearer perceptions and better evidence i have often received praise which in my own right i only partially deserve for the greater practicality which is supposed to be found in my writings compared with those of most thinkers who have been equally addicted to large generalizations the writings in which this quality has been observed were not the work of one mind but of the fusion of two one of them as preeminently practical in its judgments and perceptions of things present as it was high and bold in its anticipations for a remote futurity at the present period however this influence was only one among many which were helping to shape the character of my future development and even after it became i may truly say the presiding principle of my mental progress it did not alter the path but only made me move forward more boldly and at the same time more cautiously in the same course the only actual revolution which has ever taken place in my modes of thinking was already complete my new tendencies had to be confirmed in some respects moderated in others but the only substantial changes of opinion that were yet to come related to politics and consisted on one hand in a greater approximation so far as regards the ultimate prospects of humanity to a qualified socialism and on the other a shifting of my political ideal from pure democracy as commonly understood by its partisans to the modified form of it which is set forth in my considerations on representative government  this last change which took place very gradually dates its commencement from my reading or rather study of m de tocquevilles democracy in america which fell into my hands immediately after its first appearance in that remarkable work the excellences of democracy were pointed out in a more conclusive because a more specific manner than i had ever known them to be even by the most enthusiastic democrats while the specific dangers which beset democracy considered as the government of the numerical majority were brought into equally strong light and subjected to a masterly analysis not as reasons for resisting what the author considered as an inevitable result of human progress but as indications of the weak points of popular government the defences by which it needs to be guarded and the correctives which must be added to it in order that while full play is given to its beneficial tendencies those which are of a different nature may be neutralized or mitigated i was now well prepared for speculations of this character and from this time onward my own thoughts moved more and more in the same channel though the consequent modifications in my practical political creed were spread over many years as would be shown by comparing my first review of democracy in america written and published in 1835 with the one in 1840 reprinted in the dissertations and this last with the considerations on representative government  a collateral subject on which also i derived great benefit from the study of tocqueville was the fundamental question of centralization the powerful philosophic analysis which he applied to american and to french experience led him to attach the utmost importance to the performance of as much of the collective business of society as can safely be so performed by the people themselves without any intervention of the executive government either to supersede their agency or to dictate the manner of its exercise he viewed this practical political activity of the individual citizen not only as one of the most effectual means of training the social feelings and practical intelligence of the people so important in themselves and so indispensable to good government but also as the specific counteractive to some of the characteristic infirmities of democracy and a necessary protection against its degenerating into the only despotism of which in the modern world there is real dangerthe absolute rule of the head of the executive over a congregation of isolated individuals all equals but all slaves there was indeed no immediate peril from this source on the british side of the channel where ninetenths of the internal business which elsewhere devolves on the government was transacted by agencies independent of it where centralization was and is the subject not only of rational disapprobation but of unreasoning prejudice where jealousy of government interference was a blind feeling preventing or resisting even the most beneficial exertion of legislative authority to correct the abuses of what pretends to be local selfgovernment but is too often selfish mismanagement of local interests by a jobbing and borné local oligarchy but the more certain the public were to go wrong on the side opposed to centralization the greater danger was there lest philosophic reformers should fall into the contrary error and overlook the mischiefs of which they had been spared the painful experience i was myself at this very time actively engaged in defending important measures such as the great poor law reform of 1834 against an irrational clamour grounded on the anticentralization prejudice and had it not been for the lessons of tocqueville i do not know that i might not like many reformers before me have been hurried into the excess opposite to that which being the one prevalent in my own country it was generally my business to combat as it is i have steered carefully between the two errors and whether i have or have not drawn the line between them exactly in the right place i have at least insisted with equal emphasis upon the evils on both sides and have made the means of reconciling the advantages of both a subject of serious study  in the meanwhile had taken place the election of the first reformed parliament which included several of the most notable of my radical friends and acquaintancesgrote roebuck buller sir william molesworth john and edward romilly and several more besides warburton strutt and others who were in parliament already those who thought themselves and were called by their friends the philosophic radicals had now it seemed a fair opportunity in a more advantageous position than they had ever before occupied for showing what was in them and i as well as my father founded great hopes on them these hopes were destined to be disappointed the men were honest and faithful to their opinions as far as votes were concerned often in spite of much discouragement when measures were proposed flagrantly at variance with their principles such as the irish coercion bill or the canada coercion in 1837 they came forward manfully and braved any amount of hostility and prejudice rather than desert the right but on the whole they did very little to promote any opinions they had little enterprise little activity they left the lead of the radical portion of the house to the old hands to hume and oconnell a partial exception must be made in favour of one or two of the younger men and in the case of roebuck it is his title to permanent remembrance that in the very first year during which he sat in parliament he originated or reoriginated after the unsuccessful attempt of mr brougham the parliamentary movement for national education and that he was the first to commence and for years carried on almost alone the contest for the selfgovernment of the colonies nothing on the whole equal to these two things was done by any other individual even of those from whom most was expected and now on a calm retrospect i can perceive that the men were less in fault than we supposed and that we had expected too much from them they were in unfavourable circumstances their lot was cast in the ten years of inevitable reaction when the reform excitement being over and the few legislative improvements which the public really called for having been rapidly effected power gravitated back in its natural direction to those who were for keeping things as they were when the public mind desired rest and was less disposed than at any other period since the peace to let itself be moved by attempts to work up the reform feeling into fresh activity in favour of new things it would have required a great political leader which no one is to be blamed for not being to have effected really great things by parliamentary discussion when the nation was in this mood my father and i had hoped that some competent leader might arise some man of philosophic attainments and popular talents who could have put heart into the many younger or less distinguished men that would have been ready to join himcould have made them available to the extent of their talents in bringing advanced ideas before the publiccould have used the house of commons as a rostra or a teachers chair for instructing and impelling the public mind and would either have forced the whigs to receive their measures from him or have taken the lead of the reform party out of their hands such a leader there would have been if my father had been in parliament for want of such a man the instructed radicals sank into a mere côté gauche of the whig party with a keen and as i now think an exaggerated sense of the possibilities which were open to the radicals if they made even ordinary exertion for their opinions i laboured from this time till 1839 both by personal influence with some of them and by writings to put ideas into their heads and purpose into their hearts i did some good with charles buller and some with sir william molesworth both of whom did valuable service but were unhappily cut off almost in the beginning of their usefulness on the whole however my attempt was vain to have had a chance of succeeding in it required a different position from mine it was a task only for one who being himself in parliament could have mixed with the radical members in daily consultation could himself have taken the initiative and instead of urging others to lead could have summoned them to follow  what i could do by writing i did during the year 1833 i continued working in the examiner with fonblanque who at that time was zealous in keeping up the fight for radicalism against the whig ministry during the session of 1834 i wrote comments on passing events of the nature of newspaper articles under the title notes on the newspapers in the monthly repository a magazine conducted by mr fox well known as a preacher and political orator and subsequently as member of parliament for oldham with whom i had lately become acquainted and for whose sake chiefly i wrote in his magazine i contributed several other articles to this periodical the most considerable of which on the theory of poetry is reprinted in the dissertations altogether the writings independently of those in newspapers which i published from 1832 to 1834 amount to a large volume this however includes abstracts of several of platos dialogues with introductory remarks which though not published until 1834 had been written several years earlier and which i afterwards on various occasions found to have been read and their authorship known by more people than were aware of anything else which i had written up to that time to complete the tale of my writings at this period i may add that in 1833 at the request of bulwer who was just then completing his england and the english a work at that time greatly in advance of the public mind i wrote for him a critical account of benthams philosophy a small part of which he incorporated in his text and printed the rest with an honourable acknowledgment as an appendix in this along with the favourable a part also of the unfavourable side of my estimation of benthams doctrines considered as a complete philosophy was for the first time put into print  but an opportunity soon offered by which as it seemed i might have it in my power to give more effectual aid and at the same time stimulus to the philosophic radical party than i had done hitherto one of the projects occasionally talked of between my father and me and some of the parliamentary and other radicals who frequented his house was the foundation of a periodical organ of philosophic radicalism to take the place which the westminster review had been intended to fill and the scheme had gone so far as to bring under discussion the pecuniary contributions which could be looked for and the choice of an editor nothing however came of it for some time but in the summer of 1834 sir william molesworth himself a laborious student and a precise and metaphysical thinker capable of aiding the cause by his pen as well as by his purse spontaneously proposed to establish a review provided i would consent to be the real if i could not be the ostensible editor such a proposal was not to be refused and the review was founded at first under the title of the london review and afterwards under that of the london and westminster molesworth having bought the westminster from its proprietor general thompson and merged the two into one in the years between 1834 and 1840 the conduct of this review occupied the greater part of my spare time in the beginning it did not as a whole by any means represent my opinions i was under the necessity of conceding much to my inevitable associates the review was established to be the representative of the philosophic radicals with most of whom i was now at issue on many essential points and among whom i could not even claim to be the most important individual my fathers cooperation as a writer we all deemed indispensable and he wrote largely in it until prevented by his last illness the subjects of his articles and the strength and decision with which his opinions were expressed in them made the review at first derive its tone and colouring from him much more than from any of the other writers i could not exercise editorial control over his articles and i was sometimes obliged to sacrifice to him portions of my own the old westminster review doctrines but little modified thus formed the staple of the review but i hoped by the side of these to introduce other ideas and another tone and to obtain for my own shade of opinion a fair representation along with those of other members of the party with this end chiefly in view i made it one of the peculiarities of the work that every article should bear an initial or some other signature and be held to express the opinions solely of the individual writer the editor being only responsible for its being worth publishing and not in conflict with the objects for which the review was set on foot i had an opportunity of putting in practice my scheme of conciliation between the old and the new philosophic radicalism by the choice of a subject for my own first contribution professor sedgwick a man of eminence in a particular walk of natural science but who should not have trespassed into philosophy had lately published his discourse on the studies of cambridge which had as its most prominent feature an intemperate assault on analytic psychology and utilitarian ethics in the form of an attack on locke and paley this had excited great indignation in my father and others which i thought it fully deserved and here i imagined was an opportunity of at the same time repelling an unjust attack and inserting into my defence of hartleianism and utilitarianism a number of the opinions which constituted my view of those subjects as distinguished from that of my old associates in this i partially succeeded though my relation to my father would have made it painful to me in any case and impossible in a review for which he wrote to speak out my whole mind on the subject at this time  i am however inclined to think that my father was not so much opposed as he seemed to the modes of thought in which i believed myself to differ from him that he did injustice to his own opinions by the unconscious exaggerations of an intellect emphatically polemical and that when thinking without an adversary in view he was willing to make room for a great portion of the truths he seemed to deny i have frequently observed that he made large allowance in practice for considerations which seemed to have no place in his theory his fragment on mackintosh which he wrote and published about this time although i greatly admired some parts of it i read as a whole with more pain than pleasure yet on reading it again long after i found little in the opinions it contains but what i think in the main just and i can even sympathize in his disgust at the verbiage of mackintosh though his asperity towards it went not only beyond what was judicious but beyond what was even fair one thing which i thought at the time of good augury was the very favourable reception he gave to tocquevilles democracy in america it is true he said and thought much more about what tocqueville said in favour of democracy than about what he said of its disadvantages still his high appreciation of a book which was at any rate an example of a mode of treating the question of government almost the reverse of hiswholly inductive and analytical instead of purely ratiocinativegave me great encouragement he also approved of an article which i published in the first number following the junction of the two reviews the essay reprinted in the dissertations under the title civilization into which i threw many of my new opinions and criticised rather emphatically the mental and moral tendencies of the time on grounds and in a manner which i certainly had not learnt from him  all speculation however on the possible future developments of my fathers opinions and on the probabilities of permanent cooperation between him and me in the promulgation of our thoughts was doomed to be cut short during the whole of 1835 his health had been declining his symptoms became unequivocally those of pulmonary consumption and after lingering to the last stage of debility he died on the 23rd of june 1836 until the last few days of his life there was no apparent abatement of intellectual vigour his interest in all things and persons that had interested him through life was undiminished nor did the approach of death cause the smallest wavering as in so strong and firm a mind it was impossible that it should in his convictions on the subject of religion his principal satisfaction after he knew that his end was near seemed to be the thought of what he had done to make the world better than he found it and his chief regret in not living longer that he had not had time to do more  his place is an eminent one in the literary and even in the political history of his country and it is far from honourable to the generation which has benefited by his worth that he is so seldom mentioned and compared with men far his inferiors so little remembered this is probably to be ascribed mainly to two causes in the first place the thought of him merges too much in the deservedly superior fame of bentham yet he was anything but benthams mere follower or disciple precisely because he was himself one of the most original thinkers of his time he was one of the earliest to appreciate and adopt the most important mass of original thought which had been produced by the generation preceding him his mind and benthams were essentially of different construction he had not all benthams high qualities but neither had bentham all his it would indeed be ridiculous to claim for him the praise of having accomplished for mankind such splendid services as benthams he did not revolutionize or rather create one of the great departments of human thought but leaving out of the reckoning all that portion of his labours in which he benefited by what bentham had done and counting only what he achieved in a province in which bentham had done nothing that of analytic psychology he will be known to posterity as one of the greatest names in that most important branch of speculation on which all the moral and political sciences ultimately rest and will mark one of the essential stages in its progress the other reason which has made his fame less than he deserved is that notwithstanding the great number of his opinions which partly through his own efforts have now been generally adopted there was on the whole a marked opposition between his spirit and that of the present time as brutus was called the last of the romans so was he the last of the eighteenth century he continued its tone of thought and sentiment into the nineteenth though not unmodified nor unimproved partaking neither in the good nor in the bad influences of the reaction against the eighteenth century which was the great characteristic of the first half of the nineteenth the eighteenth century was a great age an age of strong and brave men and he was a fit companion for its strongest and bravest by his writings and his personal influence he was a great centre of light to his generation during his later years he was quite as much the head and leader of the intellectual radicals in england as voltaire was of the philosophes of france it is only one of his minor merits that he was the originator of all sound statesmanship in regard to the subject of his largest work india he wrote on no subject which he did not enrich with valuable thought and excepting the elements of political economy a very useful book when first written but which has now for some time finished its work it will be long before any of his books will be wholly superseded or will cease to be instructive reading to students of their subjects in the power of influencing by mere force of mind and character the convictions and purposes of others and in the strenuous exertion of that power to promote freedom and progress he left as far as my knowledge extends no equal among men and but one among women  though acutely sensible of my own inferiority in the qualities by which he acquired his personal ascendancy i had now to try what it might be possible for me to accomplish without him and the review was the instrument on which i built my chief hopes of establishing a useful influence over the liberal and democratic section of the public mind deprived of my fathers aid i was also exempted from the restraints and reticences by which that aid had been purchased i did not feel that there was any other radical writer or politician to whom i was bound to defer further than consisted with my own opinions and having the complete confidence of molesworth i resolved henceforth to give full scope to my own opinions and modes of thought and to open the review widely to all writers who were in sympathy with progress as i understood it even though i should lose by it the support of my former associates carlyle consequently became from this time a frequent writer in the review sterling soon after an occasional one and though each individual article continued to be the expression of the private sentiments of its writer the general tone conformed in some tolerable degree to my opinions for the conduct of the review under and in conjunction with me i associated with myself a young scotchman of the name of robertson who had some ability and information much industry and an active scheming head full of devices for making the review more saleable and on whose capacities in that direction i founded a good deal of hope insomuch that when molesworth in the beginning of 1837 became tired of carrying on the review at a loss and desirous of getting rid of it he had done his part honourably and at no small pecuniary cost i very imprudently for my own pecuniary interest and very much from reliance on robertsons devices determined to continue it at my own risk until his plans should have had a fair trial the devices were good and i never had any reason to change my opinion of them but i do not believe that any devices would have made a radical and democratic review defray its expenses including a paid editor or subeditor and a liberal payment to writers i myself and several frequent contributors gave our labour gratuitously as we had done for molesworth but the paid contributors continued to be remunerated on the usual scale of the edinburgh and quarterly reviews and this could not be done from the proceeds of the sale  in the same year 1837 and in the midst of these occupations i resumed the logic i had not touched my pen on the subject for five years having been stopped and brought to a halt on the threshold of induction i had gradually discovered that what was mainly wanting to overcome the difficulties of that branch of the subject was a comprehensive and at the same time accurate view of the whole circle of physical science which i feared it would take me a long course of study to acquire since i knew not of any book or other guide that would spread out before me the generalities and processes of the sciences and i apprehended that i should have no choice but to extract them for myself as i best could from the details happily for me dr whewell early in this year published his history of the inductive sciences i read it with eagerness and found in it a considerable approximation to what i wanted much if not most of the philosophy of the work appeared open to objection but the materials were there for my own thoughts to work upon and the author had given to those materials that first degree of elaboration which so greatly facilitates and abridges the subsequent labour i had now obtained what i had been waiting for under the impulse given me by the thoughts excited by dr whewell i read again sir j herschels discourse on the study of natural philosophy and i was able to measure the progress my mind had made by the great help i now found in this workthough i had read and even reviewed it several years before with little profit i now set myself vigorously to work out the subject in thought and in writing the time i bestowed on this had to be stolen from occupations more urgent i had just two months to spare at this period in the intervals of writing for the review in these two months i completed the first draft of about a third the most difficult third of the book what i had before written i estimate at another third so that onethird remained what i wrote at this time consisted of the remainder of the doctrine of reasoning the theory of trains of reasoning and demonstrative science and the greater part of the book on induction when this was done i had as it seemed to me untied all the really hard knots and the completion of the book had become only a question of time having got thus far i had to leave off in order to write two articles for the next number of the review when these were written i returned to the subject and now for the first time fell in with comtes cours de philosophie positive or rather with the two volumes of it which were all that had at that time been published my theory of induction was substantially completed before i knew of comtes book and it is perhaps well that i came to it by a different road from his since the consequence has been that my treatise contains what his certainly does not a reduction of the inductive process to strict rules and to a scientific test such as the syllogism is for ratiocination comte is always precise and profound on the method of investigation but he does not even attempt any exact definition of the conditions of proof and his writings show that he never attained a just conception of them this however was specifically the problem which in treating of induction i had proposed to myself nevertheless i gained much from comte with which to enrich my chapters in the subsequent rewriting and his book was of essential service to me in some of the parts which still remained to be thought out as his subsequent volumes successively made their appearance i read them with avidity but when he reached the subject of social science with varying feelings the fourth volume disappointed me it contained those of his opinions on social subjects with which i most disagree but the fifth containing the connected view of history rekindled all my enthusiasm which the sixth or concluding volume did not materially abate in a merely logical point of view the only leading conception for which i am indebted to him is that of the inverse deductive method as the one chiefly applicable to the complicated subjects of history and statistics a process differing from the more common form of the deductive method in thisthat instead of arriving at its conclusions by general reasoning and verifying them by specific experience as is the natural order in the deductive branches of physical science it obtains its generalizations by a collation of specific experience and verifies them by ascertaining whether they are such as would follow from known general principles this was an idea entirely new to me when i found it in comte and but for him i might not soon if ever have arrived at it  i had been long an ardent admirer of comtes writings before i had any communication with himself nor did i ever to the last see him in the body but for some years we were frequent correspondents until our correspondence became controversial and our zeal cooled i was the first to slacken correspondence he was the first to drop it i found and he probably found likewise that i could do no good to his mind and that all the good he could do to mine he did by his books this would never have led to discontinuance of intercourse if the differences between us had been on matters of simple doctrine but they were chiefly on those points of opinion which blended in both of us with our strongest feelings and determined the entire direction of our aspirations i had fully agreed with him when he maintained that the mass of mankind including even their rulers in all the practical departments of life must from the necessity of the case accept most of their opinions on political and social matters as they do on physical from the authority of those who have bestowed more study on those subjects than they generally have it in their power to do this lesson had been strongly impressed on me by the early work of comte to which i have adverted and there was nothing in his great treatise which i admired more than his remarkable exposition of the benefits which the nations of modern europe have historically derived from the separation during the middle ages of temporal and spiritual power and the distinct organization of the latter i agreed with him that the moral and intellectual ascendancy once exercised by priests must in time pass into the hands of philosophers and will naturally do so when they become sufficiently unanimous and in other respects worthy to possess it but when he exaggerated this line of thought into a practical system in which philosophers were to be organized into a kind of corporate hierarchy invested with almost the same spiritual supremacy though without any secular power once possessed by the catholic church when i found him relying on this spiritual authority as the only security for good government the sole bulwark against practical oppression and expecting that by it a system of despotism in the state and despotism in the family would be rendered innocuous and beneficial it is not surprising that while as logicians we were nearly at one as sociologists we could travel together no further m comte lived to carry out these doctrines to their extremest consequences by planning in his last work the système de politique positive the completest system of spiritual and temporal despotism which ever yet emanated from a human brain unless possibly that of ignatius loyola a system by which the yoke of general opinion wielded by an organized body of spiritual teachers and rulers would be made supreme over every action and as far as is in human possibility every thought of every member of the community as well in the things which regard only himself as in those which concern the interests of others it is but just to say that this work is a considerable improvement in many points of feeling over comtes previous writings on the same subjects but as an accession to social philosophy the only value it seems to me to possess consists in putting an end to the notion that no effectual moral authority can be maintained over society without the aid of religious belief for comtes work recognises no religion except that of humanity yet it leaves an irresistible conviction that any moral beliefs concurred in by the community generally may be brought to bear upon the whole conduct and lives of its individual members with an energy and potency truly alarming to think of the book stands a monumental warning to thinkers on society and politics of what happens when once men lose sight in their speculations of the value of liberty and of individuality  to return to myself the review engrossed for some time longer nearly all the time i could devote to authorship or to thinking with authorship in view the articles from the london and westminster review which are reprinted in the dissertations are scarcely a fourth part of those i wrote in the conduct of the review i had two principal objects one was to free philosophic radicalism from the reproach of sectarian benthamism i desired while retaining the precision of expression the definiteness of meaning the contempt of declamatory phrases and vague generalities which were so honourably characteristic both of bentham and of my father to give a wider basis and a more free and genial character to radical speculations to show that there was a radical philosophy better and more complete than benthams while recognizing and incorporating all of benthams which is permanently valuable in this first object i to a certain extent succeeded the other thing i attempted was to stir up the educated radicals in and out of parliament to exertion and induce them to make themselves what i thought by using the proper means they might become a powerful party capable of taking the government of the country or at least of dictating the terms on which they should share it with the whigs this attempt was from the first chimerical partly because the time was unpropitious the reform fervour being in its period of ebb and the tory influences powerfully rallying but still more because as austin so truly said the country did not contain the men among the radicals in parliament there were several qualified to be useful members of an enlightened radical party but none capable of forming and leading such a party the exhortations i addressed to them found no response one occasion did present itself when there seemed to be room for a bold and successful stroke for radicalism lord durham had left the ministry by reason as was thought of their not being sufficiently liberal he afterwards accepted from them the task of ascertaining and removing the causes of the canadian rebellion he had shown a disposition to surround himself at the outset with radical advisers one of his earliest measures a good measure both in intention and in effect having been disapproved and reversed by the government at home he had resigned his post and placed himself openly in a position of quarrel with the ministers here was a possible chief for a radical party in the person of a man of importance who was hated by the tories and had just been injured by the whigs any one who had the most elementary notions of party tactics must have attempted to make something of such an opportunity lord durham was bitterly attacked from all sides inveighed against by enemies given up by timid friends while those who would willingly have defended him did not know what to say he appeared to be returning a defeated and discredited man i had followed the canadian events from the beginning i had been one of the prompters of his prompters his policy was almost exactly what mine would have been and i was in a position to defend it i wrote and published a manifesto in the review in which i took the very highest ground in his behalf claiming for him not mere acquittal but praise and honour instantly a number of other writers took up the tone i believe there was a portion of truth in what lord durham soon after with polite exaggeration said to methat to this article might be ascribed the almost triumphal reception which he met with on his arrival in england i believe it to have been the word in season which at a critical moment does much to decide the result the touch which determines whether a stone set in motion at the top of an eminence shall roll down on one side or on the other all hopes connected with lord durham as a politician soon vanished but with regard to canadian and generally to colonial policy the cause was gained lord durhams report written by charles buller partly under the inspiration of wakefield began a new era its recommendations extending to complete internal selfgovernment were in full operation in canada within two or three years and have been since extended to nearly all the other colonies of european race which have any claim to the character of important communities and i may say that in successfully upholding the reputation of lord durham and his advisers at the most important moment i contributed materially to this result  one other case occurred during my conduct of the review which similarly illustrated the effect of taking a prompt initiative i believe that the early success and reputation of carlyles french revolution were considerably accelerated by what i wrote about it in the review immediately on its publication and before the commonplace critics all whose rules and modes of judgment it set at defiance had time to preoccupy the public with their disapproval of it i wrote and published a review of the book hailing it as one of those productions of genius which are above all rules and are a law to themselves neither in this case nor in that of lord durham do i ascribe the impression which i think was produced by what i wrote to any particular merit of execution indeed in at least one of the cases the article on carlyle i do not think the execution was good and in both instances i am persuaded that anybody in a position to be read who had expressed the same opinion at the same precise time and had made any tolerable statement of the just grounds for it would have produced the same effect but after the complete failure of my hopes of putting a new life into radical politics by means of the review i am glad to look back on these two instances of success in an honest attempt to do mediate service to things and persons that deserved it after the last hope of the formation of a radical party had disappeared it was time for me to stop the heavy expenditure of time and money which the review cost me it had to some extent answered my personal purpose as a vehicle for my opinions it had enabled me to express in print much of my altered mode of thought and to separate myself in a marked manner from the narrower benthamism of my early writings this was done by the general tone of all i wrote including various purely literary articles but especially by the two papers reprinted in the dissertations which attempted a philosophical estimate of bentham and of coleridge in the first of these while doing full justice to the merits of bentham i pointed out what i thought the errors and deficiencies of his philosophy the substance of this criticism i still think perfectly just but i have sometimes doubted whether it was right to publish it at that time i have often felt that benthams philosophy as an instrument of progress has been to some extent discredited before it had done its work and that to lend a hand towards lowering its reputation was doing more harm than service to improvement now however when a counterreaction appears to be setting in towards what is good in benthamism i can look with more satisfaction on this criticism of its defects especially as i have myself balanced it by vindications of the fundamental principles of benthams philosophy which are reprinted along with it in the same collection in the essay on coleridge i attempted to characterize the european reaction against the negative philosophy of the eighteenth century and here if the effect only of this one paper were to be considered i might be thought to have erred by giving undue prominence to the favourable side as i had done in the case of bentham to the unfavourable in both cases the impetus with which i had detached myself from what was untenable in the doctrines of bentham and of the eighteenth century may have carried me though in appearance rather than in reality too far on the contrary side but as far as relates to the article on coleridge my defence is that i was writing for radicals and liberals and it was my business to dwell most on that in writers of a different school from the knowledge of which they might derive most improvement  the number of the review which contained the paper on coleridge was the last which was published during my proprietorship in the spring of 1840 i made over the review to mr hickson who had been a frequent and very useful unpaid contributor under my management only stipulating that the change should be marked by a resumption of the old name that of westminster review under that name mr hickson conducted it for ten years on the plan of dividing among contributors only the net proceeds of the review giving his own labour as writer and editor gratuitously under the difficulty in obtaining writers which arose from this low scale of payment it is highly creditable to him that he was able to maintain in some tolerable degree the character of the review as an organ of radicalism and progress i did not cease altogether to write for the review but continued to send it occasional contributions not however exclusively for the greater circulation of the edinburgh review induced me from this time to offer articles to it also when i had anything to say for which it appeared to be a suitable vehicle and the concluding volumes of democracy in america having just then come out i inaugurated myself as a contributor to the edinburgh by the article on that work which heads the second volume of the dissertations     chapter vii  general view of the remainder of my life   from this time what is worth relating of my life will come into a very small compass for i have no further mental changes to tell of but only as i hope a continued mental progress which does not admit of a consecutive history and the results of which if real will be best found in my writings i shall therefore greatly abridge the chronicle of my subsequent years  the first use i made of the leisure which i gained by disconnecting myself from the review was to finish the logic in july and august 1838 i had found an interval in which to execute what was still undone of the original draft of the third book in working out the logical theory of those laws of nature which are not laws of causation nor corollaries from such laws i was led to recognize kinds as realities in nature and not mere distinctions for convenience a light which i had not obtained when the first book was written and which made it necessary for me to modify and enlarge several chapters of that book the book on language and classification and the chapter on the classification of fallacies were drafted in the autumn of the same year the remainder of the work in the summer and autumn of 1840 from april following to the end of 1841 my spare time was devoted to a complete rewriting of the book from its commencement it is in this way that all my books have been composed they were always written at least twice over a first draft of the entire work was completed to the very end of the subject then the whole begun again de novo but incorporating in the second writing all sentences and parts of sentences of the old draft which appeared as suitable to my purpose as anything which i could write in lieu of them i have found great advantages in this system of double redaction it combines better than any other mode of composition the freshness and vigour of the first conception with the superior precision and completeness resulting from prolonged thought in my own case moreover i have found that the patience necessary for a careful elaboration of the details of composition and expression costs much less effort after the entire subject has been once gone through and the substance of all that i find to say has in some manner however imperfect been got upon paper the only thing which i am careful in the first draft to make as perfect as i am able is the arrangement if that is bad the whole thread on which the ideas string themselves becomes twisted thoughts placed in a wrong connection are not expounded in a manner that suits the right and a first draft with this original vice is next to useless as a foundation for the final treatment  during the rewriting of the logic dr whewells philosophy of the inductive sciences made its appearance a circumstance fortunate for me as it gave me what i greatly desired a full treatment of the subject by an antagonist and enabled me to present my ideas with greater clearness and emphasis as well as fuller and more varied development in defending them against definite objections or confronting them distinctly with an opposite theory the controversies with dr whewell as well as much matter derived from comte were first introduced into the book in the course of the rewriting  at the end of 1841 the book being ready for the press i offered it to murray who kept it until too late for publication that season and then refused it for reasons which could just as well have been given at first but i have had no cause to regret a rejection which led to my offering it to mr parker by whom it was published in the spring of 1843 my original expectations of success were extremely limited archbishop whately had indeed rehabilitated the name of logic and the study of the forms rules and fallacies of ratiocination and dr whewells writings had begun to excite an interest in the other part of my subject the theory of induction a treatise however on a matter so abstract could not be expected to be popular it could only be a book for students and students on such subjects were not only at least in england few but addicted chiefly to the opposite school of metaphysics the ontological and innate principles school i therefore did not expect that the book would have many readers or approvers and looked for little practical effect from it save that of keeping the tradition unbroken of what i thought a better philosophy what hopes i had of exciting any immediate attention were mainly grounded on the polemical propensities of dr whewell who i thought from observation of his conduct in other cases would probably do something to bring the book into notice by replying and that promptly to the attack on his opinions he did reply but not till 1850 just in time for me to answer him in the third edition how the book came to have for a work of the kind so much success and what sort of persons compose the bulk of those who have bought i will not venture to say read it i have never thoroughly understood but taken in conjunction with the many proofs which have since been given of a revival of speculation speculation too of a free kind in many quarters and above all where at one time i should have least expected it in the universities the fact becomes partially intelligible i have never indulged the illusion that the book had made any considerable impression on philosophical opinion the german or a priori view of human knowledge and of the knowing faculties is likely for some time longer though it may be hoped in a diminishing degree to predominate among those who occupy themselves with such inquiries both here and on the continent but the system of logic supplies what was much wanted a textbook of the opposite doctrinethat which derives all knowledge from experience and all moral and intellectual qualities principally from the direction given to the associations i make as humble an estimate as anybody of what either an analysis of logical processes or any possible canons of evidence can do by themselves towards guiding or rectifying the operations of the understanding combined with other requisites i certainly do think them of great use but whatever may be the practical value of a true philosophy of these matters it is hardly possible to exaggerate the mischiefs of a false one the notion that truths external to the mind may be known by intuition or consciousness independently of observation and experience is i am persuaded in these times the great intellectual support of false doctrines and bad institutions by the aid of this theory every inveterate belief and every intense feeling of which the origin is not remembered is enabled to dispense with the obligation of justifying itself by reason and is erected into its own allsufficient voucher and justification there never was such an instrument devised for consecrating all deepseated prejudices and the chief strength of this false philosophy in morals politics and religion lies in the appeal which it is accustomed to make to the evidence of mathematics and of the cognate branches of physical science to expel it from these is to drive it from its stronghold and because this had never been effectually done the intuitive school even after what my father had written in his analysis of the mind had in appearance and as far as published writings were concerned on the whole the best of the argument in attempting to clear up the real nature of the evidence of mathematical and physical truths the system of logic met the intuitive philosophers on ground on which they had previously been deemed unassailable and gave its own explanation from experience and association of that peculiar character of what are called necessary truths which is adduced as proof that their evidence must come from a deeper source than experience whether this has been done effectually is still sub judice and even then to deprive a mode of thought so strongly rooted in human prejudices and partialities of its mere speculative support goes but a very little way towards overcoming it but though only a step it is a quite indispensable one for since after all prejudice can only be successfully combated by philosophy no way can really be made against it permanently until it has been shown not to have philosophy on its side  being now released from any active concern in temporary politics and from any literary occupation involving personal communication with contributors and others i was enabled to indulge the inclination natural to thinking persons when the age of boyish vanity is once past for limiting my own society to a very few persons general society as now carried on in england is so insipid an affair even to the persons who make it what it is that it is kept up for any reason rather than the pleasure it affords all serious discussion on matters on which opinions differ being considered illbred and the national deficiency in liveliness and sociability having prevented the cultivation of the art of talking agreeably on trifles in which the french of the last century so much excelled the sole attraction of what is called society to those who are not at the top of the tree is the hope of being aided to climb a little higher in it while to those who are already at the top it is chiefly a compliance with custom and with the supposed requirements of their station to a person of any but a very common order in thought or feeling such society unless he has personal objects to serve by it must be supremely unattractive and most people in the present day of any really high class of intellect make their contact with it so slight and at such long intervals as to be almost considered as retiring from it altogether those persons of any mental superiority who do otherwise are almost without exception greatly deteriorated by it not to mention loss of time the tone of their feelings is lowered they become less in earnest about those of their opinions respecting which they must remain silent in the society they frequent they come to look upon their most elevated objects as unpractical or at least too remote from realization to be more than a vision or a theory and if more fortunate than most they retain their higher principles unimpaired yet with respect to the persons and affairs of their own day they insensibly adopt the modes of feeling and judgment in which they can hope for sympathy from the company they keep a person of high intellect should never go into unintellectual society unless he can enter it as an apostle yet he is the only person with high objects who can safely enter it at all persons even of intellectual aspirations had much better if they can make their habitual associates of at least their equals and as far as possible their superiors in knowledge intellect and elevation of sentiment moreover if the character is formed and the mind made up on the few cardinal points of human opinion agreement of conviction and feeling on these has been felt in all times to be an essential requisite of anything worthy the name of friendship in a really earnest mind all these circumstances united made the number very small of those whose society and still more whose intimacy i now voluntarily sought  among these by far the principal was the incomparable friend of whom i have already spoken at this period she lived mostly with one young daughter in a quiet part of the country and only occasionally in town with her first husband mr taylor i visited her equally in both places and was greatly indebted to the strength of character which enabled her to disregard the false interpretations liable to be put on the frequency of my visits to her while living generally apart from mr taylor and on our occasionally travelling together though in all other respects our conduct during those years gave not the slightest ground for any other supposition than the true one that our relation to each other at that time was one of strong affection and confidential intimacy only for though we did not consider the ordinances of society binding on a subject so entirely personal we did feel bound that our conduct should be such as in no degree to bring discredit on her husband nor therefore on herself  in this third period as it may be termed of my mental progress which now went hand in hand with hers my opinions gained equally in breadth and depth i understood more things and those which i had understood before i now understood more thoroughly i had now completely turned back from what there had been of excess in my reaction against benthamism i had at the height of that reaction certainly become much more indulgent to the common opinions of society and the world and more willing to be content with seconding the superficial improvement which had begun to take place in those common opinions than became one whose convictions on so many points differed fundamentally from them i was much more inclined than i can now approve to put in abeyance the more decidedly heretical part of my opinions which i now look upon as almost the only ones the assertion of which tends in any way to regenerate society but in addition to this our opinions were far more heretical than mine had been in the days of my most extreme benthamism in those days i had seen little further than the old school of political economists into the possibilities of fundamental improvement in social arrangements private property as now understood and inheritance appeared to me as to them the dernier mot of legislation and i looked no further than to mitigating the inequalities consequent on these institutions by getting rid of primogeniture and entails the notion that it was possible to go further than this in removing the injusticefor injustice it is whether admitting of a complete remedy or notinvolved in the fact that some are born to riches and the vast majority to poverty i then reckoned chimerical and only hoped that by universal education leading to voluntary restraint on population the portion of the poor might be made more tolerable in short i was a democrat but not the least of a socialist we were now much less democrats than i had been because so long as education continues to be so wretchedly imperfect we dreaded the ignorance and especially the selfishness and brutality of the mass but our ideal of ultimate improvement went far beyond democracy and would class us decidedly under the general designation of socialists while we repudiated with the greatest energy that tyranny of society over the individual which most socialistic systems are supposed to involve we yet looked forward to a time when society will no longer be divided into the idle and the industrious when the rule that they who do not work shall not eat will be applied not to paupers only but impartially to all when the division of the produce of labour instead of depending as in so great a degree it now does on the accident of birth will be made by concert on an acknowledged principle of justice and when it will no longer either be or be thought to be impossible for human beings to exert themselves strenuously in procuring benefits which are not to be exclusively their own but to be shared with the society they belong to the social problem of the future we considered to be how to unite the greatest individual liberty of action with a common ownership in the raw material of the globe and an equal participation of all in the benefits of combined labour we had not the presumption to suppose that we could already foresee by what precise form of institutions these objects could most effectually be attained or at how near or how distant a period they would become practicable we saw clearly that to render any such social transformation either possible or desirable an equivalent change of character must take place both in the uncultivated herd who now compose the labouring masses and in the immense majority of their employers both these classes must learn by practice to labour and combine for generous or at all events for public and social purposes and not as hitherto solely for narrowly interested ones but the capacity to do this has always existed in mankind and is not nor is ever likely to be extinct education habit and the cultivation of the sentiments will make a common man dig or weave for his country as readily as fight for his country true enough it is only by slow degrees and a system of culture prolonged through successive generations that men in general can be brought up to this point but the hindrance is not in the essential constitution of human nature interest in the common good is at present so weak a motive in the generality not because it can never be otherwise but because the mind is not accustomed to dwell on it as it dwells from morning till night on things which tend only to personal advantage when called into activity as only selfinterest now is by the daily course of life and spurred from behind by the love of distinction and the fear of shame it is capable of producing even in common men the most strenuous exertions as well as the most heroic sacrifices the deeprooted selfishness which forms the general character of the existing state of society is so deeply rooted only because the whole course of existing institutions tends to foster it and modern institutions in some respects more than ancient since the occasions on which the individual is called on to do anything for the public without receiving its pay are far less frequent in modern life than the smaller commonwealths of antiquity these considerations did not make us overlook the folly of premature attempts to dispense with the inducements of private interest in social affairs while no substitute for them has been or can be provided but we regarded all existing institutions and social arrangements as being in a phrase i once heard from austin merely provisional and we welcomed with the greatest pleasure and interest all socialistic experiments by select individuals such as the cooperative societies which whether they succeeded or failed could not but operate as a most useful education of those who took part in them by cultivating their capacity of acting upon motives pointing directly to the general good or making them aware of the defects which render them and others incapable of doing so  in the principles of political economy these opinions were promulgated less clearly and fully in the first edition rather more so in the second and quite unequivocally in the third the difference arose partly from the change of times the first edition having been written and sent to press before the french revolution of 1848 after which the public mind became more open to the reception of novelties in opinion and doctrines appeared moderate which would have been thought very startling a short time before in the first edition the difficulties of socialism were stated so strongly that the tone was on the whole that of opposition to it in the year or two which followed much time was given to the study of the best socialistic writers on the continent and to meditation and discussion on the whole range of topics involved in the controversy and the result was that most of what had been written on the subject in the first edition was cancelled and replaced by arguments and reflections which represent a more advanced opinion  the political economy was far more rapidly executed than the logic or indeed than anything of importance which i had previously written it was commenced in the autumn of 1845 and was ready for the press before the end of 1847 in this period of little more than two years there was an interval of six months during which the work was laid aside while i was writing articles in the morning chronicle which unexpectedly entered warmly into my purpose urging the formation of peasant properties on the waste lands of ireland this was during the period of the famine the winter of 184647 when the stern necessities of the time seemed to afford a chance of gaining attention for what appeared to me the only mode of combining relief to immediate destitution with permanent improvement of the social and economical condition of the irish people but the idea was new and strange there was no english precedent for such a proceeding and the profound ignorance of english politicians and the english public concerning all social phenomena not generally met with in england however common elsewhere made my endeavours an entire failure instead of a great operation on the waste lands and the conversion of cottiers into proprietors parliament passed a poor law for maintaining them as paupers and if the nation has not since found itself in inextricable difficulties from the joint operation of the old evils and the quack remedy it is indebted for its deliverance to that most unexpected and surprising fact the depopulation of ireland commenced by famine and continued by emigration  the rapid success of the political economy showed that the public wanted and were prepared for such a book published early in 1848 an edition of a thousand copies was sold in less than a year another similar edition was published in the spring of 1849 and a third of 1250 copies early in 1852 it was from the first continually cited and referred to as an authority because it was not a book merely of abstract science but also of application and treated political economy not as a thing by itself but as a fragment of a greater whole a branch of social philosophy so interlinked with all the other branches that its conclusions even in its own peculiar province are only true conditionally subject to interference and counteraction from causes not directly within its scope while to the character of a practical guide it has no pretension apart from other classes of considerations political economy in truth has never pretended to give advice to mankind with no lights but its own though people who knew nothing but political economy and therefore knew that ill have taken upon themselves to advise and could only do so by such lights as they had but the numerous sentimental enemies of political economy and its still more numerous interested enemies in sentimental guise have been very successful in gaining belief for this among other unmerited imputations against it and the principles having in spite of the freedom of many of its opinions become for the present the most popular treatise on the subject has helped to disarm the enemies of so important a study the amount of its worth as an exposition of the science and the value of the different applications which it suggests others of course must judge  for a considerable time after this i published no work of magnitude though i still occasionally wrote in periodicals and my correspondence much of it with persons quite unknown to me on subjects of public interest swelled to a considerable bulk during these years i wrote or commenced various essays for eventual publication on some of the fundamental questions of human and social life with regard to several of which i have already much exceeded the severity of the horatian precept i continued to watch with keen interest the progress of public events but it was not on the whole very encouraging to me the european reaction after 1848 and the success of an unprincipled usurper in december 1851 put an end as it seemed to all present hope for freedom or social improvement in france and the continent in england i had seen and continued to see many of the opinions of my youth obtain general recognition and many of the reforms in institutions for which i had through life contended either effected or in course of being so but these changes had been attended with much less benefit to human wellbeing than i should formerly have anticipated because they had produced very little improvement in that which all real amelioration in the lot of mankind depends on their intellectual and moral state and it might even be questioned if the various causes of deterioration which had been at work in the meanwhile had not more than counterbalanced the tendencies to improvement i had learnt from experience that many false opinions may be exchanged for true ones without in the least altering the habits of mind of which false opinions are the result the english public for example are quite as raw and undiscerning on subjects of political economy since the nation has been converted to freetrade as they were before and are still further from having acquired better habits of thought and feeling or being in any way better fortified against error on subjects of a more elevated character for though they have thrown off certain errors the general discipline of their minds intellectually and morally is not altered i am now convinced that no great improvements in the lot of mankind are possible until a great change takes place in the fundamental constitution of their modes of thought the old opinions in religion morals and politics are so much discredited in the more intellectual minds as to have lost the greater part of their efficacy for good while they have still life enough in them to be a powerful obstacle to the growing up of any better opinions on those subjects when the philosophic minds of the world can no longer believe its religion or can only believe it with modifications amounting to an essential change of its character a transitional period commences of weak convictions paralysed intellects and growing laxity of principle which cannot terminate until a renovation has been effected in the basis of their belief leading to the evolution of some faith whether religious or merely human which they can really believe and when things are in this state all thinking or writing which does not tend to promote such a renovation is of very little value beyond the moment since there was little in the apparent condition of the public mind indicative of any tendency in this direction my view of the immediate prospects of human improvement was not sanguine more recently a spirit of free speculation has sprung up giving a more encouraging prospect of the gradual mental emancipation of england and concurring with the renewal under better auspices of the movement for political freedom in the rest of europe has given to the present condition of human affairs a more hopeful aspect3  between the time of which i have now spoken and the present took place the most important events of my private life the first of these was my marriage in april 1851 to the lady whose incomparable worth had made her friendship the greatest source to me both of happiness and of improvement during many years in which we never expected to be in any closer relation to one another ardently as i should have aspired to this complete union of our lives at any time in the course of my existence at which it had been practicable i as much as my wife would far rather have foregone that privilege for ever than have owed it to the premature death of one for whom i had the sincerest respect and she the strongest affection that event however having taken place in july 1849 it was granted to me to derive from that evil my own greatest good by adding to the partnership of thought feeling and writing which had long existed a partnership of our entire existence for seven and ahalf years that blessing was mine for seven and ahalf only i can say nothing which could describe even in the faintest manner what that loss was and is but because i know that she would have wished it i endeavour to make the best of what life i have left and to work on for her purposes with such diminished strength as can be derived from thoughts of her and communion with her memory  when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common when all subjects of intellectual or moral interest are discussed between them in daily life and probed to much greater depths than are usually or conveniently sounded in writings intended for general readers when they set out from the same principles and arrive at their conclusions by processes pursued jointly it is of little consequence in respect to the question of originality which of them holds the pen the one who contributes least to the composition may contribute more to the thought the writings which result are the joint product of both and it must often be impossible to disentangle their respective parts and affirm that this belongs to one and that to the other in this wide sense not only during the years of our married life but during many of the years of confidential friendship which preceded all my published writings were as much here work as mine her share in them constantly increasing as years advanced but in certain cases what belongs to her can be distinguished and specially identified over and above the general influence which her mind had over mine the most valuable ideas and features in these joint productionsthose which have been most fruitful of important results and have contributed most to the success and reputation of the works themselvesoriginated with her were emanations from her mind my part in them being no greater than in any of the thoughts which i found in previous writers and made my own only by incorporating them with my own system of thought during the greater part of my literary life i have performed the office in relation to her which from a rather early period i had considered as the most useful part that i was qualified to take in the domain of thought that of an interpreter of original thinkers and mediator between them and the public for i had always a humble opinion of my own powers as an original thinker except in abstract science logic metaphysics and the theoretic principles of political economy and politics but thought myself much superior to most of my contemporaries in willingness and ability to learn from everybody as i found hardly anyone who made such a point of examining what was said in defence of all opinions however new or however old in the conviction that even if they were errors there might be a substratum of truth underneath them and that in any case the discovery of what it was that made them plausible would be a benefit to truth i had in consequence marked this out as a sphere of usefulness in which i was under a special obligation to make myself active the more so as the acquaintance i had formed with the ideas of the coleridgians of the german thinkers and of carlyle all of them fiercely opposed to the mode of thought in which i had been brought up had convinced me that along with much error they possessed much truth which was veiled from minds otherwise capable of receiving it by the transcendental and mystical phraseology in which they were accustomed to shut it up and from which they neither cared nor knew how to disengage it and i did not despair of separating the truth from the error and exposing it in terms which would be intelligible and not repulsive to those on my own side in philosophy thus prepared it will easily be believed that when i came into close intellectual communion with a person of the most eminent faculties whose genius as it grew and unfolded itself in thought continually struck out truths far in advance of me but in which i could not as i had done in those others detect any mixture of error the greatest part of my mental growth consisted in the assimilation of those truths and the most valuable part of my intellectual work was in building the bridges and clearing the paths which connected them with my general system of thought4  the first of my books in which her share was conspicious was the principles of political economy the system of logic owed little to her except in the minuter matters of composition in which respect my writings both great and small have largely benefited by her accurate and clearsighted criticism5 the chapter of the political econonomy which has had a greater influence on opinion than all the rest that on the probable future of the labouring classes is entirely due to her in the first draft of the book that chapter did not exist she pointed out the need of such a chapter and the extreme imperfection of the book without it she was the cause of my writing it and the more general part of the chapter the statement and discussion of the two opposite theories respecting the proper condition of the labouring classes was wholly an exposition of her thoughts often in words taken from her own lips the purely scientific part of the political economy i did not learn from her but it was chiefly her influence that gave to the book that general tone by which it is distinguished from all previous expositions of political economy that had any pretension to being scientific and which has made it so useful in conciliating minds which those previous expositions had repelled this tone consisted chiefly in making the proper distinction between the laws of the production of wealthwhich are laws of nature dependent on the properties of objectsand the modes of its distribution which subject to certain conditions depend on human will the commom run of political economists confuse these together under the designation of economic laws which they deem incapable of being defeated or modified by human effort ascribing the same necessity to things dependent on the unchangeable conditions of our earthly existence and to those which being but the necessary consequences of particular social arrangements are merely coextensive with these given certain institutions and customs wages profits and rent will be determined by certain causes but this class of political economists drop the indispensable presupposition and argue that these causes must by an inherent necessity against which no human means can avail determine the shares which fall in the division of the produce to labourers capitalists and landlords the principles of political economy yielded to none of its predecessors in aiming at the scientific appreciation of the action of these causes under the conditions which they presuppose but it set the example of not treating those conditions as final the economic generalizations which depend not on necessaties of nature but on those combined with the existing arrangements of society it deals with only as provisional and as liable to be much altered by the progress of social improvement i had indeed partially learnt this view of things from the thoughts awakened in me by the speculations of the st simonians but it was made a living principle pervading and animating the book by my wifes promptings this example illustrates well the general character of what she contributed to my writings what was abstract and purely scientific was generally mine the properly human element came from her in all that concerned the application of philosophy to the exigencies of human society and progress i was her pupil alike in boldness of speculation and cautiousness of practical judgment for on the one hand she was much more courageous and farsighted than without her i should have been in anticipation of an order of things to come in which many of the limited generalizations now so often confounded with universal principles will cease to be applicable those parts of my writings and especially of the political economy which contemplate possibilities in the future such as when affirmed by socialists have in general been fiercely denied by political economists would but for her either have been absent or the suggestions would have been made much more timidly and in a more qualified form but while she thus rendered me bolder in speculation on human affairs her practical turn of mind and her almost unerring estimate of practical obstacles repressed in me all tendencies that were really visionary her mind invested all ideas in a concrete shape and formed to itself a conception of how they would actually work and her knowledge of the existing feelings and conduct of mankind was so seldom at fault that the weak point in any unworkable suggestion seldom escapes her6  during the two years which immediately preceded the cessation of my official life my wife and i were working together at the liberty i had first planned and written it as a short essay in 1854 it was in mounting the steps of the capitol in january 1855 that the thought first arose of converting it into a volume none of my writings have been either so carefully composed or so sedulously corrected as this after it had been written as usual twice over we kept it by us bringing it out from time to time and going through it de novo reading weighing and criticizing every sentence its final revision was to have been a work of the winter of 18589 the first after my retirement which we had arranged to pass in the south of europe that hope and every other were frustrated by the most unexpected and bitter calamity of her deathat avignon on our way to montpellier from a sudden attack of pulmonary congestion  since then i have sought for such allevation as my state admitted of by the mode of life which most enabled me to feel her still near me i bought a cottage as close as possible to the place where she is buried and there her daughter my fellowsufferer and now my chief comfort and i live constantly during a great portion of the year my objects in life are solely those which were hers my pursuits and occupations those in which she shared or sympathized and which are indissolubly associated with her her memory is to me a religion and her approbation the standard by which summing up as it does all worthiness i endeavour to regulate my life  after my irreparable loss one of my earliest cares was to print and publish the treatise so much of which was the work of her whom i had lost and consecrate it to her memory i have made no alteration or addition to it nor shall i ever though it wants the last touch of her hand no substitute for that touch shall ever be attempted by mine  the liberty was more directly and literally our joint production than anything else which bears my name for there was not a sentence of it that was not several times gone through by us together turned over in many ways and carefully weeded of any faults either in thought or expression that we detected in it it is in consequence of this that although it never underwent her final revision it far surpasses as a mere specimen of composition anything which has proceeded from me either before or since with regard to the thoughts it is difficult to identify any particular part or element as being more hers than all the rest the whole mode of thinking of which the book was the expression was emphatically hers but i also was so thoroughly imbued with it that the same thoughts naturally occurred to us both that i was thus penetrated with it however i owe in a great degree to her there was a moment in my mental progress when i might easily have fallen into a tendency towards overgovernment both social and political as there was also a moment when by reaction from a contrary excess i might have become a less thorough radical and democrat than i am in both these points as in many others she benefited me as much by keeping me right where i was right as by leading me to new truths and ridding me of errors my great readiness and eagerness to learn from everybody and to make room in my opinions for every new acquisition by adjusting the old and the new to one another might but for her steadying influence have seduced me into modifying my early opinions too much she was in nothing more valuable to my mental development than by her just measure of the relative importance of different considerations which often protected me from allowing to truths i had only recently learnt to see a more important place in my thoughts than was properly their due  the liberty is likely to survive longer than anything else that i have written with the possible exception of the logic because the conjunction of her mind with mine has rendered it a kind of philosophic textbook of a single truth which the changes progressively taking place in modern society tend to bring out into ever stronger relief the importance to man and society of a large variety in types of character and of giving full freedom to human nature to expand itself in innumerable and conflicting directions nothing can better show how deep are the foundations of this truth than the great impression made by the exposition of it at a time which to superficial observation did not seem to stand much in need of such a lesson the fears we expressed lest the inevitable growth of social equality and of the government of public opinion should impose on mankind an oppressive yoke of uniformity in opinion and practice might easily have appeared chimerical to those who looked more at present facts than at tendencies for the gradual revolution that is taking place in society and institutions has thus far been decidedly favourable to the development of new opinions and has procured for them a much more unprejudiced hearing than they previously met with but this is a feature belonging to periods of transition when old notions and feelings have been unsettled and no new doctrines have yet succeeded to their ascendancy at such times people of any mental activity having given up their old beliefs and not feeling quite sure that those they still retain can stand unmodified listen eagerly to new opinions but this state of things is necessarily transitory some particular body of doctrine in time rallies the majority round it organizes social institutions and modes of action conformably to itself education impresses this new creed upon the new generations without the mental processes that have led to it and by degrees it acquires the very same power of compression so long exercised by the creeds of which it had taken the place whether this noxious power will be exercised depends on whether mankind have by that time become aware that it cannot be exercised without stunting and dwarfing human nature it is then that the teachings of the liberty will have their greatest value and it is to be feared that they will retain that value a long time  as regards originality it has of course no other than that which every thoughtful mind gives to its own mode of conceiving and expressing truths which are common property the leading thought of the book is one which though in many ages confined to insulated thinkers mankind have probably at no time since the beginning of civilization been entirely without to speak only of the last few generations it is distinctly contained in the vein of important thought respecting education and culture spread through the european mind by the labours and genius of pestalozzi the unqualified championship of it by wilhelm von humboldt is referred to in the book but he by no means stood alone in his own country during the early part of the present century the doctrine of the rights of individuality and the claim of the moral nature to develop itself in its own way was pushed by a whole school of german authors even to exaggeration and the writings of goethe the most celebrated of all german authors though not belonging to that or to any other school are penetrated throughout by views of morals and of conduct in life often in my opinion not defensible but which are incessantly seeking whatever defence they admit of in the theory of the right and duty of selfdevelopment in our own country before the book on liberty was written the doctrine of individuality had been enthusiastically asserted in a style of vigorous declamation sometimes reminding one of fichte by mr william maccall in a series of writings of which the most elaborate is entitled elements of individualism and a remarkable american mr warren had framed a system of society on the foundation of the sovereignty of the individual had obtained a number of followers and had actually commenced the formation of a village community whether it now exists i know not which though bearing a superficial resemblance to some of the projects of socialists is diametrically opposite to them in principle since it recognizes no authority whatever in society over the individual except to enforce equal freedom of development for all individualities as the book which bears my name claimed no originality for any of its doctrines and was not intended to write their history the only author who had preceded me in their assertion of whom i thought it appropriate to say anything was humboldt who furnished the motto to the work although in one passage i borrowed from the warrenites their phrase the sovereignty of the individual it is hardly necessary here to remark that there are abundant differences in detail between the conception of the doctrine by any of the predecessors i have mentioned and that set forth in the book  the political circumstances of the time induced me shortly after to complete and publish a pamphlet thoughts on parliamentary reform part of which had been written some years previously on the occasion of one of the abortive reform bills and had at the time been approved and revised by her its principal features were hostility to the ballot a change of opinion in both of us in which she rather preceded me and a claim of representation for minorities not however at that time going beyond the cumulative vote proposed by mr garth marshall in finishing the pamphlet for publication with a view to the discussions on the reform bill of lord derbys and mr disraelis government in 1859 i added a third feature a plurality of votes to be given not to property but to proved superiority of education this recommended itself to me as a means of reconciling the irresistible claim of every man or woman to be consulted and to be allowed a voice in the regulation of affairs which vitally concern them with the superiority of weight justly due to opinions grounded on superiority of knowledge the suggestion however was one which i had never discussed with my almost infallible counsellor and i have no evidence that she would have concurred in it as far as i have been able to observe it has found favour with nobody all who desire any sort of inequality in the electoral vote desiring it in favour of property and not of intelligence or knowledge if it ever overcomes the strong feeling which exists against it this will only be after the establishment of a systematic national education by which the various grades of politically valuable acquirement may be accurately defined and authenticated without this it will always remain liable to strong possibly conclusive objections and with this it would perhaps not be needed  it was soon after the publication of thoughts on parliamentary reform that i became acquainted with mr hares admirable system of personal representation which in its present shape was then for the first time published i saw in this great practical and philosophical idea the greatest improvement of which the system of representative government is susceptible an improvement which in the most felicitous manner exactly meets and cures the grand and what before seemed the inherent defect of the representative system that of giving to a numerical majority all power instead of only a power proportional to its numbers and enabling the strongest party to exclude all weaker parties from making their opinions heard in the assembly of the nation except through such opportunity as may be given to them by the accidentally unequal distribution of opinions in different localities to these great evils nothing more than very imperfect palliations had seemed possible but mr hares system affords a radical cure this great discovery for it is no less in the political art inspired me as i believe it has inspired all thoughtful persons who have adopted it with new and more sanguine hopes respecting the prospects of human society by freeing the form of political institutions towards which the whole civilized world is manifestly and irresistibly tending from the chief part of what seemed to qualify or render doubtful its ultimate benefits minorities so long as they remain minorities are and ought to be outvoted but under arrangements which enable any assemblage of voters amounting to a certain number to place in the legislature a representative of its own choice minorities cannot be suppressed independent opinions will force their way into the council of the nation and make themselves heard there a thing which often cannot happen in the existing forms of representative democracy and the legislature instead of being weeded of individual peculiarities and entirely made up of men who simply represent the creed of great political or religious parties will comprise a large proportion of the most eminent individual minds in the country placed there without reference to party by voters who appreciate their individual eminence i can understand that persons otherwise intelligent should for want of sufficient examination be repelled from mr hares plan by what they think the complex nature of its machinery but any one who does not feel the want which the scheme is intended to supply any one who throws it over as a mere theoretical subtlety or crotchet tending to no valuable purpose and unworthy of the attention of practical men may be pronounced an incompetent statesman unequal to the politics of the future i mean unless he is a minister or aspires to become one for we are quite accustomed to a minister continuing to profess unqualified hostility to an improvement almost to the very day when his conscience or his interest induces him to take it up as a public measure and carry it  had i met with mr hares system before the publication of my pamphlet i should have given an account of it there not having done so i wrote an article in frasers magazine reprinted in my miscellaneous writings principally for that purpose though i included in it along with mr hares book a review of two other productions on the question of the day one of them a pamphlet by my early friend mr john austin who had in his old age become an enemy to all further parliamentary reform the other an able and vigourous though partially erroneous work by mr lorimer  in the course of the same summer i fulfilled a duty particularly incumbent upon me that of helping by an article in the edinburgh review to make known mr bains profound treatise on the mind just then completed by the publication of its second volume and i carried through the press a selection of my minor writings forming the first two volumes of dissertations and discussions the selection had been made during my wifes lifetime but the revision in concert with her with a view to republication had been barely commenced and when i had no longer the guidance of her judgment i despaired of pursuing it further and republished the papers as they were with the exception of striking out such passages as were no longer in accordance with my opinions my literary work of the year was terminated with an essay in frasers magazine afterwards republished in the third volume of dissertations and discussions entitled a few words on nonintervention i was prompted to write this paper by a desire while vindicating england from the imputations commonly brought against her on the continent of a peculiar selfishness in matters of foreign policy to warn englishmen of the colour given to this imputation by the low tone in which english statesmen are accustomed to speak of english policy as concerned only with english interests and by the conduct of lord palmerston at that particular time in opposing the suez canal and i took the opportunity of expressing ideas which had long been in my mind some of them generated by my indian experience and others by the international questions which then greatly occupied the european public respecting the true principles of international morality and the legitimate modifications made in it by difference of times and circumstances a subject i had already to some extent discussed in the vindication of the french provisional government of 1848 against the attacks of lord brougham and others which i published at the time in the westminster review and which is reprinted in the dissertations  i had now settled as i believed for the remainder of my existence into a purely literary life if that can be called literary which continued to be occupied in a preeminent degree with politics and not merely with theoretical but practical politics although a great part of the year was spent at a distance of many hundred miles from the chief seat of the politics of my own country to which and primarily for which i wrote but in truth the modern facilities of communication have not only removed all the disadvantages to a political writer in tolerably easy circumstances of distance from the scene of political action but have converted them into advantages the immediate and regular receipt of newspapers and periodicals keeps him au courant of even the most temporary politics and gives him a much more correct view of the state and progress of opinion than he could acquire by personal contact with individuals for every ones social intercourse is more or less limited to particular sets or classes whose impressions and no others reach him through that channel and experience has taught me that those who give their time to the absorbing claims of what is called society not having leisure to keep up a large acquaintance with the organs of opinion remain much more ignorant of the general state either of the public mind or of the active and instructed part of it than a recluse who reads the newspapers need be there are no doubt disadvantages in too long a separation from ones countryin not occasionally renewing ones impressions of the light in which men and things appear when seen from a position in the midst of them but the deliberate judgment formed at a distance and undisturbed by inequalities of perspective is the most to be depended on even for application to practice alternating between the two positions i combined the advantages of both and though the inspirer of my best thoughts was no longer with me i was not alone she had left a daughter my stepdaughter miss helen taylor the inheritor of much of her wisdom and of all her nobleness of character whose ever growing and ripening talents from that day to this have been devoted to the same great purposes and have already made her name better and more widely known than was that of her mother though far less so than i predict that if she lives it is destined to become of the value of her direct cooperation with me something will be said hereafter of what i owe in the way of instruction to her great powers of original thought and soundness of practical judgment it would be a vain attempt to give an adequate idea surely no one ever before was so fortunate as after such a loss as mine to draw another prize in the lottery of life another companion stimulator adviser and instructor of the rarest quality whoever either now or hereafter may think of me and of the work i have done must never forget that it is the product not of one intellect and conscience but of three the least considerable of whom and above all the least original is the one whose name is attached to it  the work of the years 1860 and 1861 consisted chiefly of two treatises only one of which was intended for immediate publication this was the considerations on representative government a connected exposition of what by the thoughts of many years i had come to regard as the best form of a popular constitution along with as much of the general theory of government as is necessary to support this particular portion of its practice the volume contains many matured views of the principal questions which occupy the present age within the province of purely organic institutions and raises by anticipation some other questions to which growing necessities will sooner or later compel the attention both of theoretical and of practical politicians the chief of these last is the distinction between the function of making laws for which a numerous popular assembly is radically unfit and that of getting good laws made which is its proper duty and cannot be satisfactorily fulfilled by any other authority and the consequent need of a legislative commission as a permanent part of the constitution of a free country consisting of a small number of highly trained political minds on whom when parliament has determined that a law shall be made the task of making it should be devolved parliament retaining the power of passing or rejecting the bill when drawn up but not of altering it otherwise than by sending proposed amendments to be dealt with by the commission the question here raised respecting the most important of all public functions that of legislation is a particular case of the great problem of modern political organization stated i believe for the first time in its full extent by bentham though in my opinion not always satisfactorily resolved by him the combination of complete popular control over public affairs with the greatest attainable perfection of skilled agency  the other treatise written at this time is the one which was published some years7 later under the title of the subjection of women it was written at my daughters suggestion that there might in any event be in existence a written exposition of my opinions on that great question as full and conclusive as i could make it the intention was to keep this among other unpublished papers improving it from time to time if i was able and to publish it at the time when it should seem likely to be most useful as ultimately published it was enriched with some important ideas of my daughters and passages of her writing but in what was of my own composition all that is most striking and profound belongs to my wife coming from the fund of thought which had been made common to us both by our innumerable conversations and discussions on a topic which filled so large a place in our minds  soon after this time i took from their repository a portion of the unpublished papers which i had written during the last years of our married life and shaped them with some additional matter into the little work entitled utilitarianism which was first published in three parts in successive numbers of frasers magazine and afterwards reprinted in a volume  before this however the state of public affairs had become extremely critical by the commencement of the american civil war my strongest feelings were engaged in this struggle which i felt from the beginning was destined to be a turning point for good or evil of the course of human affairs for an indefinite duration having been a deeply interested observer of the slavery quarrel in america during the many years that preceded the open breach i knew that it was in all its stages an aggressive enterprise of the slaveowners to extend the territory of slavery under the combined influences of pecuniary interest domineering temper and the fanaticism of a class for its class privileges influences so fully and powerfully depicted in the admirable work of my friend professor cairnes the slave power their success if they succeeded would be a victory of the powers of evil which would give courage to the enemies of progress and damp the spirits of its friends all over the civilized world while it would create a formidable military power grounded on the worst and most antisocial form of the tyranny of men over men and by destroying for a long time the prestige of the great democratic republic would give to all the privileged classes of europe a false confidence probably only to be extinguished in blood on the other hand if the spirit of the north was sufficiently roused to carry the war to a successful termination and if that termination did not come too soon and too easily i foresaw from the laws of human nature and the experience of revolutions that when it did come it would in all probability be thorough that the bulk of the northern population whose conscience had as yet been awakened only to the point of resisting the further extension of slavery but whose fidelity to the constitution of the united states made them disapprove of any attempt by the federal government to interfere with slavery in the states where it already existed would acquire feelings of another kind when the constitution had been shaken off by armed rebellion would determine to have done for ever with the accursed thing and would join their banner with that of the noble body of abolitionists of whom garrison was the courageous and singleminded apostle wendell phillips the eloquent orator and john brown the voluntary martyr8 then too the whole mind of the united states would be let loose from its bonds no longer corrupted by the supposed necessity of apologizing to foreigners for the most flagrant of all possible violations of the free principles of their constitution while the tendency of a fixed state of society to stereotype a set of national opinions would be at least temporarily checked and the national mind would become more open to the recognition of whatever was bad in either the institutions or the customs of the people these hopes so far as related to slavery have been completely and in other respects are in course of being progressively realized foreseeing from the first this double set of consequences from the success or failure of the rebellion it may be imagined with what feelings i contemplated the rush of nearly the whole upper and middle classes of my own country even those who passed for liberals into a furious prosouthern partisanship the working classes and some of the literary and scientific men being almost the sole exceptions to the general frenzy i never before felt so keenly how little permanent improvement had reached the minds of our influential classes and of what small value were the liberal opinions they had got into the habit of professing none of the continental liberals committed the same frightful mistake but the generation which had extorted negro emancipation from our west india planters had passed away another had succeeded which had not learnt by many years of discussion and exposure to feel strongly the enormities of slavery and the inattention habitual with englishmen to whatever is going on in the world outside their own island made them profoundly ignorant of all the antecedents of the struggle insomuch that it was not generally believed in england for the first year or two of the war that the quarrel was one of slavery there were men of high principle and unquestionable liberality of opinion who thought it a dispute about tariffs or assimilated it to the cases in which they were accustomed to sympathize of a people struggling for independence  it was my obvious duty to be one of the small minority who protested against this perverted state of public opinion i was not the first to protest it ought to be remembered to the honour of mr hughes and of mr ludlow that they by writings published at the very beginning of the struggle began the protestation mr bright followed in one of the most powerful of his speeches followed by others not less striking i was on the point of adding my words to theirs when there occurred towards the end of 1861 the seizure of the southern envoys on board a british vessel by an officer of the united states even english forgetfulness has not yet had time to lose all remembrance of the explosion of feeling in england which then burst forth the expectation prevailing for some weeks of war with the united states and the warlike preparations actually commenced on this side while this state of things lasted there was no chance of a hearing for anything favourable to the american cause and moreover i agreed with those who thought the act unjustifiable and such as to require that england should demand its disavowal when the disavowal came and the alarm of war was over i wrote in january 1862 the paper in frasers magazine entitled the contest in america and i shall always feel grateful to my daughter that her urgency prevailed on me to write it when i did for we were then on the point of setting out for a journey of some months in greece and turkey and but for her i should have deferred writing till our return written and published when it was this paper helped to encourage those liberals who had felt overborne by the tide of illiberal opinion and to form in favour of the good cause a nucleus of opinion which increased gradually and after the success of the north began to seem probable rapidly when we returned from our journey i wrote a second article a review of professor cairnes book published in the westminster review england is paying the penalty in many uncomfortable ways of the durable resentment which her ruling classes stirred up in the united states by their ostentatious wishes for the ruin of america as a nation they have reason to be thankful that a few if only a few known writers and speakers standing firmly by the americans in the time of their greatest difficulty effected a partial diversion of these bitter feelings and made great britain not altogether odious to the americans  this duty having been performed my principal occupation for the next two years was on subjects not political the publication of mr austins lectures on jurisprudence after his decease gave me an opportunity of paying a deserved tribute to his memory and at the same time expressing some thoughts on a subject on which in my old days of benthamism i had bestowed much study but the chief product of those years was the examination of sir william hamiltons philosophy his lectures published in 1860 and 1861 i had read towards the end of the latter year with a halfformed intention of giving an account of them in a review but i soon found that this would be idle and that justice could not be done to the subject in less than a volume i had then to consider whether it would be advisable that i myself should attempt such a performance on consideration there seemed to be strong reasons for doing so i was greatly disappointed with the lectures i read them certainly with no prejudice against sir william hamilton i had up to that time deferred the study of his notes to reid on account of their unfinished state but i had not neglected his discussions in philosophy and though i knew that his general mode of treating the facts of mental philosophy differed from that of which i most approved yet his vigorous polemic against the later transcendentalists and his strenuous assertion of some important principles especially the relativity of human knowledge gave me many points of sympathy with his opinions and made me think that genuine psychology had considerably more to gain than to lose by his authority and reputation his lectures and the dissertations on reid dispelled this illusion and even the discussions read by the light which these throw on them lost much of their value i found that the points of apparent agreement between his opinions and mine were more verbal than real that the important philosophical principles which i had thought he recognised were so explained away by him as to mean little or nothing or were continually lost sight of and doctrines entirely inconsistent with them were taught in nearly every part of his philosophical writings my estimation of him was therefore so far altered that instead of regarding him as occupying a kind of intermediate position between the two rival philosophies holding some of the principles of both and supplying to both powerful weapons of attack and defence i now looked upon him as one of the pillars and in this country from his high philosophical reputation the chief pillar of that one of the two which seemed to me to be erroneous  now the difference between these two schools of philosophy that of intuition and that of experience and association is not a mere matter of abstract speculation it is full of practical consequences and lies at the foundation of all the greatest differences of practical opinion in an age of progress the practical reformer has continually to demand that changes be made in things which are supported by powerful and widelyspread feelings or to question the apparent necessity and indefeasibleness of established facts and it is often an indispensable part of his argument to show how those powerful feelings had their origin and how those facts came to seem necessary and indefeasible there is therefore a natural hostility between him and a philosophy which discourages the explanation of feelings and moral facts by circumstances and association and prefers to treat them as ultimate elements of human nature a philosophy which is addicted to holding up favourite doctrines as intuitive truths and deems intuition to be the voice of nature and of god speaking with an authority higher than that of our reason in particular i have long felt that the prevailing tendency to regard all the marked distinctions of human character as innate and in the main indelible and to ignore the irresistible proofs that by far the greater part of those differences whether between individuals races or sexes are such as not only might but naturally would be produced by differences in circumstances is one of the chief hindrances to the rational treatment of great social questions and one of the greatest stumbling blocks to human improvement this tendency has its source in the intuitional metaphysics which characterized the reaction of the nineteenth century against the eighteenth and it is a tendency so agreeable to human indolence as well as to conservative interests generally that unless attacked at the very root it is sure to be carried to even a greater length than is really justified by the more moderate forms of the intuitional philosophy that philosophy not always in its moderate forms had ruled the thought of europe for the greater part of a century my fathers analysis of the mind my own logic and professor bains great treatise had attempted to reintroduce a better mode of philosophizing latterly with quite as much success as could be expected but i had for some time felt that the mere contrast of the two philosophies was not enough that there ought to be a handtohand fight between them that controversial as well as expository writings were needed and that the time was come when such controversy would be useful considering then the writings and fame of sir w hamilton as the great fortress of the intuitional philosophy in this country a fortress the more formidable from the imposing character and the in many respects great personal merits and mental endowments of the man i thought it might be a real service to philosophy to attempt a thorough examination of all his most important doctrines and an estimate of his general claims to eminence as a philosopher and i was confirmed in this resolution by observing that in the writings of at least one and him one of the ablest of sir w hamiltons followers his peculiar doctrines were made the justification of a view of religion which i hold to be profoundly immoralthat it is our duty to bow down in worship before a being whose moral attributes are affirmed to be unknowable by us and to be perhaps extremely different from those which when we are speaking of our fellowcreatures we call by the same names  as i advanced in my task the damage to sir w hamiltons reputation became greater than i at first expected through the almost incredible multitude of inconsistencies which showed themselves on comparing different passages with one another it was my business however to show things exactly as they were and i did not flinch from it i endeavoured always to treat the philosopher whom i criticized with the most scrupulous fairness and i knew that he had abundance of disciples and admirers to correct me if i ever unintentionally did him injustice many of them accordingly have answered me more or less elaborately and they have pointed out oversights and misunderstandings though few in number and mostly very unimportant in substance such of those as had to my knowledge been pointed out before the publication of the latest edition at present the third have been corrected there and the remainder of the criticisms have been as far as seemed necessary replied to on the whole the book has done its work it has shown the weak side of sir william hamilton and has reduced his too great philosophical reputation within more moderate bounds and by some of its discussions as well as by two expository chapters on the notions of matter and of mind it has perhaps thrown additional light on some of the disputed questions in the domain of psychology and metaphysics  after the completion of the book on hamilton i applied myself to a task which a variety of reasons seemed to render specially incumbent upon me that of giving an account and forming an estimate of the doctrines of auguste comte i had contributed more than any one else to make his speculations known in england and in consequence chiefly of what i had said of him in my logic he had readers and admirers among thoughtful men on this side of the channel at a time when his name had not yet in france emerged from obscurity so unknown and unappreciated was he at the time when my logic was written and published that to criticize his weak points might well appear superfluous while it was a duty to give as much publicity as one could to the important contributions he had made to philosophic thought at the time however at which i have now arrived this state of affairs had entirely changed his name at least was known almost universally and the general character of his doctrines very widely he had taken his place in the estimation both of friends and opponents as one of the conspicuous figures in the thought of the age the better parts of his speculations had made great progress in working their way into those minds which by their previous culture and tendencies were fitted to receive them under cover of those better parts those of a worse character greatly developed and added to in his later writings had also made some way having obtained active and enthusiastic adherents some of them of no inconsiderable personal merit in england france and other countries these causes not only made it desirable that some one should undertake the task of sifting what is good from what is bad in m comtes speculations but seemed to impose on myself in particular a special obligation to make the attempt this i accordingly did in two essays published in successive numbers of the westminster review and reprinted in a small volume under the title auguste comte and positivism  the writings which i have now mentioned together with a small number of papers in periodicals which i have not deemed worth preserving were the whole of the products of my activity as a writer during the years from 1859 to 1865 in the early part of the lastmentioned year in compliance with a wish frequently expressed to me by working men i published cheap peoples editions of those of my writings which seemed the most likely to find readers among the working classes viz principles of political economy liberty and representative government this was a considerable sacrifice of my pecuniary interest especially as i resigned all idea of deriving profit from the cheap editions and after ascertaining from my publishers the lowest price which they thought would remunerate them on the usual terms of an equal division of profits i gave up my half share to enable the price to be fixed still lower to the credit of messrs longman they fixed unasked a certain number of years after which the copyright and stereotype plates were to revert to me and a certain number of copies after the sale of which i should receive half of any further profit this number of copies which in the case of the political economy was 10000 has for some time been exceeded and the peoples editions have begun to yield me a small but unexpected pecuniary return though very far from an equivalent for the diminution of profit from the library editions  in this summary of my outward life i have now arrived at the period at which my tranquil and retired existence as a writer of books was to be exchanged for the less congenial occupation of a member of the house of commons the proposal made to me early in 1865 by some electors of westminster did not present the idea to me for the first time it was not even the first offer i had received for more than ten years previous in consequence of my opinions on the irish land question mr lucas and mr duffy in the name of the popular party in ireland offered to bring me into parliament for an irish county which they could easily have done but the incompatibility of a seat in parliament with the office i then held in the india house precluded even consideration of the proposal after i had quitted the india house several of my friends would gladly have seen me a member of parliament but there seemed no probability that the idea would ever take any practical shape i was convinced that no numerous or influential portion of any electoral body really wished to be represented by a person of my opinions and that one who possessed no local connection or popularity and who did not choose to stand as the mere organ of a party had small chance of being elected anywhere unless through the expenditure of money now it was and is my fixed conviction that a candidate ought not to incur one farthing of expense for undertaking a public duty such of the lawful expenses of an election as have no special reference to any particular candidate ought to be borne as a public charge either by the state or by the locality what has to be done by the supporters of each candidate in order to bring his claims properly before the constituency should be done by unpaid agency or by voluntary subscription if members of the electoral body or others are willing to subscribe money of their own for the purpose of bringing by lawful means into parliament some one who they think would be useful there no one is entitled to object but that the expense or any part of it should fall on the candidate is fundamentally wrong because it amounts in reality to buying his seat even on the most favourable supposition as to the mode in which the money is expended there is a legitimate suspicion that any one who gives money for leave to undertake a public trust has other than public ends to promote by it and a consideration of the greatest importance the cost of elections when borne by the candidates deprives the nation of the services as members of parliament of all who cannot or will not afford to incur a heavy expense i do not say that so long as there is scarcely a chance for an independent candidate to come into parliament without complying with this vicious practice it must always be morally wrong in him to spend money provided that no part of it is either directly or indirectly employed in corruption but to justify it he ought to be very certain that he can be of more use to his country as a member of parliament than in any other mode which is open to him and this assurance in my own case i did not feel it was by no means clear to me that i could do more to advance the public objects which had a claim on my exertions from the benches of the house of commons than from the simple position of a writer i felt therefore that i ought not to seek election to parliament much less to expend any money in procuring it  but the conditions of the question were considerably altered when a body of electors sought me out and spontaneously offered to bring me forward as their candidate if it should appear on explanation that they persisted in this wish knowing my opinions and accepting the only conditions on which i could conscientiously serve it was questionable whether this was not one of those calls upon a member of the community by his fellowcitizens which he was scarcely justified in rejecting i therefore put their disposition to the proof by one of the frankest explanations ever tendered i should think to an electoral body by a candidate i wrote in reply to the offer a letter for publication saying that i had no personal wish to be a member of parliament that i thought a candidate ought neither to canvass nor to incur any expense and that i could not consent to do either i said further that if elected i could not undertake to give any of my time and labour to their local interests with respect to general politics i told them without reserve what i thought on a number of important subjects on which they had asked my opinion and one of these being the suffrage i made known to them among other things my conviction as i was bound to do since i intended if elected to act on it that women were entitled to representation in parliament on the same terms with men it was the first time doubtless that such a doctrine had ever been mentioned to english electors and the fact that i was elected after proposing it gave the start to the movement which has since become so vigorous in favour of womens suffrage nothing at the time appeared more unlikely than that a candidate if candidate i could be called whose professions and conduct set so completely at defiance all ordinary notions of electioneering should nevertheless be elected a wellknown literary man who was also a man of society was heard to say that the almighty himself would have no chance of being elected on such a programme i strictly adhered to it neither spending money nor canvassing nor did i take any personal part in the election until about a week preceding the day of nomination when i attended a few public meetings to state my principles and give to any questions which the electors might exercise their just right of putting to me for their own guidance answers as plain and unreserved as my address on one subject only my religious opinions i announced from the beginning that i would answer no questions a determination which appeared to be completely approved by those who attended the meetings my frankness on all other subjects on which i was interrogated evidently did me far more good than my answers whatever they might be did harm among the proofs i received of this one is too remarkable not to be recorded in the pamphlet thoughts on parliamentary reform i had said rather bluntly that the working classes though differing from those of some other countries in being ashamed of lying are yet generally liars this passage some opponent got printed in a placard which was handed to me at a meeting chiefly composed of the working classes and i was asked whether i had written and published it i at once answered i did scarcely were these two words out of my mouth when vehement applause resounded through the whole meeting it was evident that the working people were so accustomed to expect equivocation and evasion from those who sought their suffrages that when they found instead of that a direct avowal of what was likely to be disagreeable to them instead of being affronted they concluded at once that this was a person whom they could trust a more striking instance never came under my notice of what i believe is the experience of those who best know the working classes that the most essential of all recommendations to their favour is that of complete straightforwardness its presence outweighs in their minds very strong objections while no amount of other qualities will make amends for its apparent absence the first working man who spoke after the incident i have mentioned it was mr odger said that the working classes had no desire not to be told of their faults they wanted friends not flatterers and felt under obligation to any one who told them anything in themselves which he sincerely believed to require amendment and to this the meeting heartily responded  had i been defeated in the election i should still have had no reason to regret the contact it had brought me into with large bodies of my countrymen which not only gave me much new experience but enabled me to scatter my political opinions rather widely and by making me known in many quarters where i had never before been heard of increased the number of my readers and the presumable influence of my writings these latter effects were of course produced in a still greater degree when as much to my surprise as to that of any one i was returned to parliament by a majority of some hundreds over my conservative competitor  i was a member of the house during the three sessions of the parliament which passed the reform bill during which time parliament was necessarily my main occupation except during the recess i was a tolerably frequent speaker sometimes of prepared speeches sometimes extemporaneously but my choice of occasions was not such as i should have made if my leading object had been parliamentary influence when i had gained the ear of the house which i did by a successful speech on mr gladstones reform bill the idea i proceeded on was that when anything was likely to be as well done or sufficiently well done by other people there was no necessity for me to meddle with it as i therefore in general reserved myself for work which no others were likely to do a great proportion of my appearances were on points on which the bulk of the liberal party even the advanced portion of it either were of a different opinion from mine or were comparatively indifferent several of my speeches especially one against the motion for the abolition of capital punishment and another in favour of resuming the right of seizing enemies goods in neutral vessels were opposed to what then was and probably still is regarded as the advanced liberal opinion my advocacy of womens suffrage and of personal representation were at the time looked upon by many as whims of my own but the great progress since made by those opinions and especially the response made from almost all parts of the kingdom to the demand for womens suffrage fully justified the timeliness of those movements and have made what was undertaken as a moral and social duty a personal success another duty which was particularly incumbent on me as one of the metropolitan members was the attempt to obtain a municipal government for the metropolis but on that subject the indifference of the house of commons was such that i found hardly any help or support within its walls on this subject however i was the organ of an active and intelligent body of persons outside with whom and not with me the scheme originated and who carried on all the agitation on the subject and drew up the bills my part was to bring in bills already prepared and to sustain the discussion of them during the short time they were allowed to remain before the house after having taken an active part in the work of a committee presided over by mr ayrton which sat through the greater part of the session of 1866 to take evidence on the subject the very different position in which the question now stands 1870 may justly be attributed to the preparation which went on during those years and which produced but little visible effect at the time but all questions on which there are strong private interests on one side and only the public good on the other have a similar period of incubation to go through  the same idea that the use of my being in parliament was to do work which others were not able or not willing to do made me think it my duty to come to the front in defence of advanced liberalism on occasions when the obloquy to be encountered was such as most of the advanced liberals in the house preferred not to incur my first vote in the house was in support of an amendment in favour of ireland moved by an irish member and for which only five english and scotch votes were given including my own the other four were mr bright mr mclaren mr tb potter and mr hadfield and the second speech i delivered9 was on the bill to prolong the suspension of the habeas corpus in ireland in denouncing on this occasion the english mode of governing ireland i did no more than the general opinion of england now admits to have been just but the anger against fenianism was then in all its freshness any attack on what fenians attacked was looked upon as an apology for them and i was so unfavourably received by the house that more than one of my friends advised me and my own judgment agreed with the advice to wait before speaking again for the favourable opportunity that would be given by the first great debate on the reform bill during this silence many flattered themselves that i had turned out a failure and that they should not be troubled with me any more perhaps their uncomplimentary comments may by the force of reaction have helped to make my speech on the reform bill the success it was my position in the house was further improved by a speech in which i insisted on the duty of paying off the national debt before our coal supplies are exhausted and by an ironical reply to some of the tory leaders who had quoted against me certain passages of my writings and called me to account for others especially for one in my considerations on representative government which said that the conservative party was by the law of its composition the stupidest party they gained nothing by drawing attention to the passage which up to that time had not excited any notice but the sobriquet of the stupid party stuck to them for a considerable time afterwards having now no longer any apprehension of not being listened to i confined myself as i have since thought too much to occasions on which my services seemed specially needed and abstained more than enough from speaking on the great party questions with the exception of irish questions and those which concerned the working classes a single speech on mr disraelis reform bill was nearly all that i contributed to the great decisive debates of the last two of my three sessions  i have however much satisfaction in looking back to the part i took on the two classes of subjects just mentioned with regard to the working classes the chief topic of my speech on mr gladstones reform bill was the assertion of their claims to the suffrage a little later after the resignation of lord russells ministry and the succession of a tory government came the attempt of the working classes to hold a meeting in hyde park their exclusion by the police and the breaking down of the park railing by the crowd though mr beales and the leaders of the working men had retired under protest before this took place a scuffle ensued in which many innocent persons were maltreated by the police and the exasperation of the working men was extreme they showed a determination to make another attempt at a meeting in the park to which many of them would probably have come armed the government made military preparations to resist the attempt and something very serious seemed impending at this crisis i really believe that i was the means of preventing much mischief i had in my place in parliament taken the side of the working men and strongly censured the conduct of the government i was invited with several other radical members to a conference with the leading members of the council of the reform league and the task fell chiefly upon myself of persuading them to give up the hyde park project and hold their meeting elsewhere it was not mr beales and colonel dickson who needed persuading on the contrary it was evident that these gentlemen had already exerted their influence in the same direction thus far without success it was the working men who held out and so bent were they on their original scheme that i was obliged to have recourse to les grands moyens i told them that a proceeding which would certainly produce a collision with the military could only be justifiable on two conditions if the position of affairs had become such that a revolution was desirable and if they thought themselves able to accomplish one to this argument after considerable discussion they at last yielded and i was able to inform mr walpole that their intention was given up i shall never forget the depth of his relief or the warmth of his expressions of gratitude after the working men had conceded so much to me i felt bound to comply with their request that i would attend and speak at their meeting at the agricultural hall the only meeting called by the reform league which i ever attended i had always declined being a member of the league on the avowed ground that i did not agree in its programme of manhood suffrage and the ballot from the ballot i dissented entirely and i could not consent to hoist the flag of manhood suffrage even on the assurance that the exclusion of women was not intended to be implied since if one goes beyond what can be immediately carried and professes to take ones stand on a principle one should go the whole length of the principle i have entered thus particularly into this matter because my conduct on this occasion gave great displeasure to the tory and toryliberal press who have charged me ever since with having shown myself in the trials of public life intemperate and passionate i do not know what they expected from me but they had reason to be thankful to me if they knew from what i had in all probability preserved them and i do not believe it could have been done at that particular juncture by any one else no other person i believe had at that moment the necessary influence for restraining the working classes except mr gladstone and mr bright neither of whom was available mr gladstone for obvious reasons mr bright because he was out of town  when some time later the tory government brought in a bill to prevent public meetings in the parks i not only spoke strongly in opposition to it but formed one of a number of advanced liberals who aided by the very late period of the session succeeded in defeating the bill by what is called talking it out it has not since been renewed  on irish affairs also i felt bound to take a decided part i was one of the foremost in the deputation of members of parliament who prevailed on lord derby to spare the life of the condemned fenian insurgent general burke the church question was so vigorously handled by the leaders of the party in the session of 1868 as to require no more from me than an emphatic adhesion but the land question was by no means in so advanced a position the superstitions of landlordism had up to that time been little challenged especially in parliament and the backward state of the question so far as concerned the parliamentary mind was evidenced by the extremely mild measure brought in by lord russells government in 1866 which nevertheless could not be carried on that bill i delivered one of my most careful speeches in which i attempted to lay down some of the principles of the subject in a manner calculated less to stimulate friends than to conciliate and convince opponents the engrossing subject of parliamentary reform prevented either this bill or one of a similar character brought in by lord derbys government from being carried through they never got beyond the second reading meanwhile the signs of irish disaffection had become much more decided the demand for complete separation between the two countries had assumed a menacing aspect and there were few who did not feel that if there was still any chance of reconciling ireland to the british connection it could only be by the adoption of much more thorough reforms in the territorial and social relations of the country than had yet been contemplated the time seemed to me to have come when it would be useful to speak out my whole mind and the result was my pamphlet england and ireland which was written in the winter of 1867 and published shortly before the commencement of the session of 1868 the leading features of the pamphlet were on the one hand an argument to show the undesirableness for ireland as well as england of separation between the countries and on the other a proposal for settling the land question by giving to the existing tenants a permanent tenure at a fixed rent to be assessed after due inquiry by the state  the pamphlet was not popular except in ireland as i did not expect it to be but if no measure short of that which i proposed would do full justice to ireland or afford a prospect of conciliating the mass of the irish people the duty of proposing it was imperative while if on the other hand there was any intermediate course which had a claim to a trial i well knew that to propose something which would be called extreme was the true way not to impede but to facilitate a more moderate experiment it is most improbable that a measure conceding so much to the tenantry as mr gladstones irish land bill would have been proposed by a government or could have been carried through parliament unless the british public had been led to perceive that a case might be made and perhaps a party formed for a measure considerably stronger it is the character of the british people or at least of the higher and middle classes who pass muster for the british people that to induce them to approve of any change it is necessary that they should look upon it as a middle course they think every proposal extreme and violent unless they hear of some other proposal going still farther upon which their antipathy to extreme views may discharge itself so it proved in the present instance my proposal was condemned but any scheme for irish land reform short of mine came to be thought moderate by comparison i may observe that the attacks made on my plan usually gave a very incorrect idea of its nature it was usually discussed as a proposal that the state should buy up the land and become the universal landlord though in fact it only offered to each individual landlord this as an alternative if he liked better to sell his estate than to retain it on the new conditions and i fully anticipated that most landlords would continue to prefer the position of landowners to that of government annuitants and would retain their existing relation to their tenants often on more indulgent terms than the full rents on which the compensation to be given them by government would have been based this and many other explanations i gave in a speech on ireland in the debate on mr maguires resolution early in the session of 1868 a corrected report of this speech together with my speech on mr fortescues bill has been published not by me but with my permission in ireland  another public duty of a most serious kind it was my lot to have to perform both in and out of parliament during these years a disturbance in jamaica provoked in the first instance by injustice and exaggerated by rage and panic into a premeditated rebellion had been the motive or excuse for taking hundreds of innocent lives by military violence or by sentence of what were called courtsmartial continuing for weeks after the brief disturbance had been put down with many added atrocities of destruction of property logging women as well as men and a general display of the brutal recklessness which usually prevails when fire and sword are let loose the perpetrators of those deeds were defended and applauded in england by the same kind of people who had so long upheld negro slavery and it seemed at first as if the british nation was about to incur the disgrace of letting pass without even a protest excesses of authority as revolting as any of those for which when perpetrated by the instruments of other governments englishmen can hardly find terms sufficient to express their abhorrence after a short time however an indignant feeling was roused a voluntary association formed itself under the name of the jamaica committee to take such deliberation and action as the case might admit of and adhesions poured in from all parts of the country i was abroad at the time but i sent in my name to the committee as soon as i heard of it and took an active part in the proceedings from the time of my return there was much more at stake than only justice to the negroes imperative as was that consideration the question was whether the british dependencies and eventually perhaps great britain itself were to be under the government of law or of military licence whether the lives and persons of british subjects are at the mercy of any two or three officers however raw and inexperienced or reckless and brutal whom a panicstricken governor or other functionary may assume the right to constitute into a socalled courtmartial this question could only be decided by an appeal to the tribunals and such an appeal the committee determined to make their determination led to a change in the chairmanship of the committee as the chairman mr charles buxton thought it not unjust indeed but inexpedient to prosecute governor eyre and his principal subordinates in a criminal court but a numerously attended general meeting of the association having decided this point against him mr buxton withdrew from the committee though continuing to work in the cause and i was quite unexpectedly on my own part proposed and elected chairman it became in consequence my duty to represent the committee in the house of commons sometimes by putting questions to the government sometimes as the recipient of questions more or less provocative addressed by individual members to myself but especially as speaker in the important debate originated in the session of 1866 by mr buxton and the speech i then delivered is that which i should probably select as the best of my speeches in parliament10 for more than two years we carried on the combat trying every avenue legally open to us to the courts of criminal justice a bench of magistrates in one of the most tory counties in england dismissed our case we were more successful before the magistrates at bow street which gave an opportunity to the lord chief justice of the queens bench sir alexander cockburn for delivering his celebrated charge which settled the law of the question in favour of liberty as far as it is in the power of a judges charge to settle it there however our success ended for the old bailey grand jury by throwing out our bill prevented the case from coming to trial it was clear that to bring english functionaries to the bar of a criminal court for abuses of power committed against negroes and mulattoes was not a popular proceeding with the english middle classes we had however redeemed so far as lay in us the character of our country by showing that there was at any rate a body of persons determined to use all the means which the law afforded to obtain justice for the injured we had elicited from the highest criminal judge in the nation an authoritative declaration that the law was what we maintained it to be and we had given an emphatic warning to those who might be tempted to similar guilt hereafter that though they might escape the actual sentence of a criminal tribunal they were not safe against being put to some trouble and expense in order to avoid it colonial governors and other persons in authority will have a considerable motive to stop short of such extremities in future  as a matter of curiosity i kept some specimens of the abusive letters almost all of them anonymous which i received while these proceedings were going on they are evidence of the sympathy felt with the brutalities in jamaica by the brutal part of the population at home they graduated from coarse jokes verbal and pictorial up to threats of assassination  among other matters of importance in which i took an active part but which excited little interest in the public two deserve particular mention i joined with several other independent liberals in defeating an extradition bill introduced at the very end of the session of 1866 and by which though surrender avowedly for political offences was not authorized political refugees if charged by a foreign government with acts which are necessarily incident to all attempts at insurrection would have been surrendered to be dealt with by the criminal courts of the government against which they had rebelled thus making the british government an accomplice in the vengeance of foreign despotisms the defeat of this proposal led to the appointment of a select committee in which i was included to examine and report on the whole subject of extradition treaties and the result was that in the extradition act which passed through parliament after i had ceased to be a member opportunity is given to any one whose extradition is demanded of being heard before an english court of justice to prove that the offence with which he is charged is really political the cause of european freedom has thus been saved from a serious misfortune and our own country from a great iniquity the other subject to be mentioned is the fight kept up by a body of advanced liberals in the session of 1868 on the bribery bill of mr disraelis government in which i took a very active part i had taken counsel with several of those who had applied their minds most carefully to the details of the subjectmr wd christie serjeant pulling mr chadwickas well as bestowed much thought of my own for the purpose of framing such amendments and additional clauses as might make the bill really effective against the numerous modes of corruption direct and indirect which might otherwise as there was much reason to fear be increased instead of diminished by the reform act we also aimed at engrafting on the bill measures for diminishing the mischievous burden of what are called the legitimate expenses of elections among our many amendments was that of mr fawcett for making the returning officers expenses a charge on the rates instead of on the candidates another was the prohibition of paid canvassers and the limitation of paid agents to one for each candidate a third was the extension of the precautions and penalties against bribery to municipal elections which are well known to be not only a preparatory school for bribery at parliamentary elections but an habitual cover for it the conservative government however when once they had carried the leading provision of their bill for which i voted and spoke the transfer of the jurisdiction in elections from the house of commons to the judges made a determined resistance to all other improvements and after one of our most important proposals that of mr fawcett had actually obtained a majority they summoned the strength of their party and threw out the clause in a subsequent stage the liberal party in the house was greatly dishonoured by the conduct of many of its members in giving no help whatever to this attempt to secure the necessary conditions of an honest representation of the people with their large majority in the house they could have carried all the amendments or better ones if they had better to propose but it was late in the session members were eager to set about their preparations for the impending general election and while some such as sir robert anstruther honourably remained at their post though rival candidates were already canvassing their constituency a much greater number placed their electioneering interests before their public duty many liberals also looked with indifference on legislation against bribery thinking that it merely diverted public interest from the ballot which they consideredvery mistakenly as i expect it will turn outto be a sufficient and the only remedy from these causes our fight though kept up with great vigour for several nights was wholly unsuccessful and the practices which we sought to render more difficult prevailed more widely than ever in the first general election held under the new electoral law  in the general debates on mr disraelis reform bill my participation was limited to the one speech already mentioned but i made the bill an occasion for bringing the two great improvements which remain to be made in representative government formally before the house and the nation one of them was personal or as it is called with equal propriety proportional representation i brought this under the consideration of the house by an expository and argumentative speech on mr hares plan and subsequently i was active in support of the very imperfect substitute for that plan which in a small number of constituencies parliament was induced to adopt this poor makeshift had scarcely any recommendation except that it was a partial recognition of the evil which it did so little to remedy as such however it was attacked by the same fallacies and required to be defended on the same principles as a really good measure and its adoption in a few parliamentary elections as well as the subsequent introduction of what is called the cumulative vote in the elections for the london school board have had the good effect of converting the equal claim of all electors to a proportional share in the representation from a subject of merely speculative discussion into a question of practical politics much sooner than would otherwise have been the case  this assertion of my opinions on personal representation cannot be credited with any considerable or visible amount of practical result it was otherwise with the other motion which i made in the form of an amendment to the reform bill and which was by far the most important perhaps the only really important public service i performed in the capacity of a member of parliament a motion to strike out the words which were understood to limit the electoral franchise to males and thereby to admit to the suffrage all women who as householders or otherwise possessed the qualification required of male electors for women not to make their claim to the suffrage at the time when the elective franchise was being largely extended would have been to abjure the claim altogether and a movement on the subject was begun in 1866 when i presented a petition for the suffrage signed by a considerable number of distinguished women but it was as yet uncertain whether the proposal would obtain more than a few stray votes in the house and when after a debate in which the speakers on the contrary side were conspicuous by their feebleness the votes recorded in favour of the motion amounted to 73made up by pairs and tellers to above 80the surprise was general and the encouragement great the greater too because one of those who voted for the motion was mr bright a fact which could only be attributed to the impression made on him by the debate as he had previously made no secret of his nonconcurrence in the proposal the time appeared to my daughter miss helen taylor to have come for forming a society for the extension of the suffrage to women the existence of the society is due to my daughters initiative its constitution was planned entirely by her and she was the soul of the movement during its first years though delicate health and superabundant occupation made her decline to be a member of the executive committee many distinguished members of parliament professors and others and some of the most eminent women of whom the country can boast became members of the society a large proportion either directly or indirectly through my daughters influence she having written the greater number and all the best of the letters by which adhesions was obtained even when those letters bore my signature in two remarkable instances those of miss nightingale and miss mary carpenter the reluctance those ladies had at first felt to come forward for it was not on their past difference of opinion was overcome by appeals written by my daughter though signed by me associations for the same object were formed in various local centres manchester edinburgh birmingham bristol and glasgow and others which have done much valuable work for the cause all the societies take the title of branches of the national society for womens suffrage but each has its own governing body and acts in complete independence of the others  i believe i have mentioned all that is worth remembering of my proceedings in the house but their enumeration even if complete would give but an inadequate idea of my occupations during that period and especially of the time taken up by correspondence for many years before my election to parliament i had been continually receiving letters from strangers mostly addressed to me as a writer on philosophy and either propounding difficulties or communicating thoughts on subjects connected with logic or political economy in common i suppose with all who are known as political economists i was a recipient of all the shallow theories and absurd proposals by which people are perpetually endeavouring to show the way to universal wealth and happiness by some artful reorganization of the currency when there were signs of sufficient intelligence in the writers to make it worth while attempting to put them right i took the trouble to point out their errors until the growth of my correspondence made it necessary to dismiss such persons with very brief answers many however of the communications i received were more worthy of attention than these and in some oversights of detail were pointed out in my writings which i was thus enabled to correct correspondence of this sort naturally multiplied with the multiplication of the subjects on which i wrote especially those of a metaphysical character but when i became a member of parliament i began to receive letters on private grievances and on every imaginable subject that related to any kind of public affairs however remote from my knowledge or pursuits it was not my constituents in westminster who laid this burthen on me they kept with remarkable fidelity to the understanding on which i had consented to serve i received indeed now and then an application from some ingenuous youth to procure for him a small government appointment but these were few and how simple and ignorant the writers were was shown by the fact that the applications came in about equally whichever party was in power my invariable answer was that it was contrary to the principles on which i was elected to ask favours of any government but on the whole hardly any part of the country gave me less trouble than my own constituents the general mass of correspondence however swelled into an oppressive burthen  at this time and thenceforth a great proportion of all my letters including many which found their way into the newspapers were not written by me but by my daughter at first merely from her willingness to help in disposing of a mass of letters greater than i could get through without assistance but afterwards because i thought the letters she wrote superior to mine and more so in proportion to the difficulty and importance of the occasion even those which i wrote myself were generally much improved by her as is also the case with all the more recent of my prepared speeches of which and of some of my published writings not a few passages and those the most successful were hers  while i remained in parliament my work as an author was unavoidably limited to the recess during that time i wrote besides the pamphlet on ireland already mentioned the essay on plato published in the edinburgh review and reprinted in the third volume of dissertations and discussions and the address which conformably to custom i delivered to the university of st andrews whose students had done me the honour of electing me to the office of rector in this discourse i gave expression to many thoughts and opinions which had been accumulating in me through life respecting the various studies which belong to a liberal education their uses and influences and the mode in which they should be pursued to render their influences most beneficial the position taken up vindicating the high educational value alike of the old classic and the new scientific studies on even stronger grounds than are urged by most of their advocates and insisting that it is only the stupid inefficiency of the usual teaching which makes those studies be regarded as competitors instead of allies was i think calculated not only to aid and stimulate the improvement which has happily commenced in the national institutions for higher education but to diffuse juster ideas than we often find even in highly educated men on the conditions of the highest mental cultivation  during this period also i commenced and completed soon after i had left parliament the performance of a duty to philosophy and to the memory of my father by preparing and publishing an edition of the analysis of the phenomena of the human mind with notes bringing up the doctrines of that admirable book to the latest improvements in science and in speculation this was a joint undertaking the psychological notes being furnished in about equal proportions by mr bain and myself while mr grote supplied some valuable contributions on points in the history of philosophy incidentally raised and dr andrew findlater supplied the deficiencies in the book which had been occasioned by the imperfect philological knowledge of the time when it was written having been originally published at a time when the current of metaphysical speculation ran in a quite opposite direction to the psychology of experience and association the analysis had not obtained the amount of immediate success which it deserved though it had made a deep impression on many individual minds and had largely contributed through those minds to create that more favourable atmosphere for the association psychology of which we now have the benefit admirably adapted for a class book of the experience metaphysics it only required to be enriched and in some cases corrected by the results of more recent labours in the same school of thought to stand as it now does in company with mr bains treatises at the head of the systematic works on analytic psychology  in the autumn of 1868 the parliament which passed the reform act was dissolved and at the new election for westminster i was thrown out not to my surprise nor i believe to that of my principal supporters though in the few days preceding the election they had become more sanguine than before that i should not have been elected at all would not have required any explanation what excites curiosity is that i should have been elected the first time or having been elected then should have been defeated afterwards but the efforts made to defeat me were far greater on the second occasion than on the first for one thing the tory government was now struggling for existence and success in any contest was of more importance to them then too all persons of tory feelings were far more embittered against me individually than on the previous occasion many who had at first been either favourable or indifferent were vehemently opposed to my reelection as i had shown in my political writings that i was aware of the weak points in democratic opinions some conservatives it seems had not been without hopes of finding me an opponent of democracy as i was able to see the conservative side of the question they presumed that like them i could not see any other side yet if they had really read my writings they would have known that after giving full weight to all that appeared to me well grounded in the arguments against democracy i unhesitatingly decided in its favour while recommending that it should be accompanied by such institutions as were consistent with its principle and calculated to ward off its inconveniences one of the chief of these remedies being proportional representation on which scarcely any of the conservatives gave me any support some tory expectations appear to have been founded on the approbation i had expressed of plural voting under certain conditions and it has been surmised that the suggestion of this sort made in one of the resolutions which mr disraeli introduced into the house preparatory to his reform bill a suggestion which meeting with no favour he did not press may have been occasioned by what i had written on the point but if so it was forgotten that i had made it an express condition that the privilege of a plurality of votes should be annexed to education not to property and even so had approved of it only on the supposition of universal suffrage how utterly inadmissible such plural voting would be under the suffrage given by the present reform act is proved to any who could otherwise doubt it by the very small weight which the working classes are found to possess in elections even under the law which gives no more votes to any one elector than to any other  while i thus was far more obnoxious to the tory interest and to many conservative liberals than i had formerly been the course i pursued in parliament had by no means been such as to make liberals generally at all enthusiastic in my support it has already been mentioned how large a proportion of my prominent appearances had been on questions on which i differed from most of the liberal party or about which they cared little and how few occasions there had been on which the line i took was such as could lead them to attach any great value to me as an organ of their opinions i had moreover done things which had excited in many minds a personal prejudice against me many were offended by what they called the persecution of mr eyre and still greater offence was taken at my sending a subscription to the election expenses of mr bradlaugh having refused to be at any expense for my own election and having had all its expenses defrayed by others i felt under a peculiar obligation to subscribe in my turn where funds were deficient for candidates whose election was desirable i accordingly sent subscriptions to nearly all the working class candidates and among others to mr bradlaugh he had the support of the working classes having heard him speak i knew him to be a man of ability and he had proved that he was the reverse of a demagogue by placing himself in strong opposition to the prevailing opinion of the democratic party on two such important subjects as malthusianism and personal representation men of this sort who while sharing the democratic feelings of the working classes judged political questions for themselves and had courage to assert their individual convictions against popular opposition were needed as it seemed to me in parliament and i did not think that mr bradlaughs antireligious opinions even though he had been intemperate in the expression of them ought to exclude him in subscribing however to his election i did what would have been highly imprudent if i had been at liberty to consider only the interests of my own reelection and as might be expected the utmost possible use both fair and unfair was made of this act of mine to stir up the electors of westminster against me to these various causes combined with an unscrupulous use of the usual pecuniary and other influences on the side of my tory competitor while none were used on my side it is to be ascribed that i failed at my second election after having succeeded at the first no sooner was the result of the election known than i received three or four invitations to become a candidate for other constituencies chiefly counties but even if success could have been expected and this without expense i was not disposed to deny myself the relief of returning to private life i had no cause to feel humiliated at my rejection by the electors and if i had the feeling would have been far outweighed by the numerous expressions of regret which i received from all sorts of persons and places and in a most marked degree from those members of the liberal party in parliament with whom i had been accustomed to act  since that time little has occurred which there is need to commemorate in this place i returned to my old pursuits and to the enjoyment of a country life in the south of europe alternating twice a year with a residence of some weeks or months in the neighbourhood of london i have written various articles in periodicals chiefly in my friend mr morleys fortnightly review have made a small number of speeches on public occasions especially at the meetings of the womens suffrage society have published the subjection of women written some years before with some additions by my daughter and myself and have commenced the preparation of matter for future books of which it will be time to speak more particularly if i live to finish them here therefore for the present this memoir may close    notes  1in a subsequent stage of boyhood when these exercises had ceased to be compulsory like most youthful writers i wrote tragedies under the inspiration not so much of shakspeare as of joanna baillie whose constantine paleologus in particular appeared to me one of the most glorious of human compositions i still think it one of the best dramas of the last two centuries  2 the continuation of this article in the second number of the review was written by me under my fathers eye and except as practice in composition in which respect it was to me more useful than anything else i ever wrote was of little or no value  3 written about 1861  4 the steps in my mental growth for which i was indebted to her were far from being those which a person wholly uninformed on the subject would probably suspect it might be supposed for instance that my strong convictions on the complete equality in all legal political social and domestic relations which ought to exist between men and women may have been adopted or learnt from her this was so far from being the fact that those convictions were among the earliest results of the application of my mind to political subjects and the strength with which i held them was as i believe more than anything else the originating cause of the interest she felt in me what is true is that until i knew her the opinion was in my mind little more than an abstract principle i saw no more reason why women should be held in legal subjection to other people than why men should i was certain that their interests required fully as much protection as those of men and were quite as little likely to obtain it without an equal voice in making the laws by which they were bound but that perception of the vast practical bearings of womens disabilities which found expression in the book on the subjection of women was acquired mainly through her teaching but for her rare knowledge of human nature and comprehension of moral and social influences though i should doubtless have held my present opinions i should have had a very insufficient perception of the mode in which the consequences of the inferior position of women intertwine themselves with all the evils of existing society and with all the difficulties of human improvement i am indeed painfully conscious of how much of her best thoughts on the subject i have failed to reproduce and how greatly that little treatise falls short of what it would have been if she had put on paper her entire mind on this question or had lived to revise and improve as she certainly would have done my imperfect statement of the case  5 the only person from whom i received any direct assistence in the preparation of the system of logic was mr bain since so justly celebrated for his philosophical writings he went carefully through the manuscript before it was sent to the press and enriched it with a great number of additional examples and illustrations from science many of which as well as some detached remarks of his own in confirmation of my logical views i inserted nearly in his own words  6 a few dedicatory lines acknowledging what the book owed to her were prefixed to some of the presentation copies of the political economy on iets first publication her dislike of publicity alone prevented their insertion in the other copies of the work during the years which intervened between the commencement of my married life and the catastrophe which closed it the principal occurrences of my outward existence unless i count as such a first attack of the family disease and a consequent journey of more than six months for the recovery of health in italy sicily and greece had reference to my position in the india house in 1856 i was promoted to the rank of chief of the office in which i had served for upwards of thirtythree years the appointment that of examiner of india correspondence was the highest next to that of secretary in the east india companys home service involving the general superintendence of all the correspondence with the indian governments except the military naval and financial i held this office as long as it continued to exist being a little more than two years after which it pleased parliament in other words lord palmerston to put an end to the east india company as a branch of the government of india under the crown and convert the administration of that country into a thing to be scrambled for by the second and third class of english parliamentary politicians i was the chief manager of the resistance which the company made to their own political extinction and to the letters and petitions i wrote for them and the concluding chapter of my treatise on representative government i must refer for my opinions on the folly and mischief of this illconsidered change personally i considered myself a gainer by it as i had given enough of my life to india and was not unwilling to retire on the liberal compensation granted after the change was consummated lord stanley the first secretary of state for india made me the honourable offer of a seat in the council and the proposal was subsequently renewed by the council itself on the first occasion of its having to supply a vacancy in its own body but the conditions of indian government under the new system made me anticipate nothing but useless vexation and waste of effort from any participation in it and nothing that has since happened has had any tendency to make me regret my refusal  7 in 1869  8the saying of this true hero after his capture that he was worth more for hanging than any other purpose reminds one by its combination of wit wisdom and selfdevotion of sir thomas more  9 the first was in answer to mr lowes reply to mr bright on the cattle plague bill and was thought at the time to have helped to get rid of a provision in the government measure which would have given to landholders a second indemnity after they had already been once indemnified for the loss of some of their cattle by the increased selling price of the remainder  10 among the most active members of
