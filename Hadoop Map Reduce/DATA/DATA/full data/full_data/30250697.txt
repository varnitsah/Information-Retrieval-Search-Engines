30250697	a drift from redwood camp   by bret harte   they had all known him as a shiftless worthless creature from the time he first entered redwood camp carrying his entire effects in a red handkerchief on the end of a longhandled shovel until he lazily drifted out of it on a plank in the terrible inundation of 56 they never expected anything better of him in a community of strong men with sullen virtues and charmingly fascinating vices he was tolerated as possessing neithernot even rising by any dominant human weakness or ludicrous quality to the importance of a butt in the dramatis personae of redwood camp he was a simple superwho had only passive speechless roles in those fierce dramas that were sometimes unrolled beneath its greencurtained pines nameless and penniless he was overlooked by the census and ignored by the tax collector while in a hotlycontested election for sheriff when even the headboards of the scant cemetery were consulted to fill the polllists it was discovered that neither candidate had thought fit to avail himself of his actual vote he was debarred the rude heraldry of a nickname of achievement and in a camp made up of euchre bills poker dicks profane pete and snapshot harry was known vaguely as him skeesicks or that coot it was remembered long after with a feeling of superstition that he had never even met with the dignity of an accident nor received the fleeting honor of a chance shot meant for somebody else in any of the liberal and broadly comprehensive encounters which distinguished the camp and the inundation that finally carried him out of it was partly anticipated by his passive incompetency for while the others escapedor were drowned in escapinghe calmly floated off on his plank without an opposing effort  for all that elijah martinwhich was his real namewas far from being unamiable or repellent that he was cowardly untruthful selfish and lazy was undoubtedly the fact perhaps it was his peculiar misfortune that just then courage frankness generosity and activity were the dominant factors in the life of redwood camp his submissive gentleness his unquestioned modesty his half refinement and his amiable exterior consequently availed him nothing against the fact that he was missed during a raid of the digger indians and lied to account for it or that he lost his right to a gold discovery by failing to make it good against a bully and selfishly kept this discovery from the knowledge of the camp yet this weakness awakened no animosity in his companions and it is probable that the indifference of the camp to his fate in this final catastrophe came purely from a simple forgetfulness of one who at that supreme moment was weakly incapable  such was the reputation and such the antecedents of the man who on the 15th of march 1856 found himself adrift in a swollen tributary of the minyo a spring freshet of unusual volume had flooded the adjacent river until bursting its bounds it escaped through the narrow wedgeshaped valley that held redwood camp for a day and night the surcharged river poured half its waters through the straggling camp at the end of that time every vestige of the little settlement was swept away all that was left was scattered far and wide in the country caught in the hanging branches of waterside willows and alders embayed in sluggish pools dragged over submerged meadows and one fragmentbearing up elijah martinpursuing the devious courses of an unknown tributary fifty miles away had he been a rash impatient man he would have been speedily drowned in some earlier desperate attempt to reach the shore had he been an ordinary bold man he would have succeeded in transferring himself to the branches of some obstructing tree but he was neither and he clung to his broken raftlike berth with an endurance that was half the paralysis of terror and half the patience of habitual misfortune eventually he was caught in a side current swept to the bank and cast ashore on an unexplored wilderness  his first consciousness was one of hunger that usurped any sentiment of gratitude for his escape from drowning as soon as his cramped limbs permitted he crawled out of the bushes in search of food he did not know where he was there was no sign of habitationor even occupationanywhere he had been too terrified to notice the direction in which he had driftedeven if he had possessed the ordinary knowledge of a backwoodsman which he did not he was helpless in his bewildered state seeing a squirrel cracking a nut on the branch of a hollow tree near him he made a halffrenzied dart at the frightened animal which ran away but the same association of ideas in his torpid and confused brain impelled him to search for the squirrels hoard in the hollow of the tree he ate the few hazelnuts he found there ravenously the purely animal instinct satisfied he seemed to have borrowed from it a certain strength and intuition he limped through the thicket not unlike some awkward shy quadrumane stopping here and there to peer out through the openings over the marshes that lay beyond his sight hearing and even the sense of smell had become preternaturally acute it was the latter which suddenly arrested his steps with the odor of dried fish it had a significance beyond the mere instincts of hungerit indicated the contiguity of some indian encampment and as suchit meant danger torture and death  he stopped trembled violently and tried to collect his scattered senses redwood camp had embroiled itself needlessly and brutally with the surrounding indians and only held its own against them by reckless courage and unerring marksmanship the frequent use of a casual wandering indian as a target for the practising rifles of its members had kept up an undying hatred in the heart of the aborigines and stimulated them to terrible and isolated reprisals the scalped and skinned dead body of jack trainer tied on his horse and held hideously upright by a cross of wood behind his saddle had passed one night a slow and ghastly apparition into camp the corpse of dick ryner had been found anchored on the riverbed disembowelled and filled with stone and gravel the solitary and unprotected member of redwood camp who fell into the enemys hands was doomed  elijah martin remembered this but his fears gradually began to subside in a certain apathy of the imagination which perhaps dulled his apprehensions and allowed the instinct of hunger to become again uppermost he knew that the low bark tents or wigwams of the indians were hung with strips of dried salmon and his whole being was new centered upon an attempt to stealthily procure a delicious morsel as yet he had distinguished no other sign of life or habitation a few moments later however and grown bolder with an animallike trustfulness in his momentary security he crept out of the thicket and found himself near a long low mound or burrowlike structure of mud and bark on the riverbank a single narrow opening not unlike the entrance of an esquimau hut gave upon the river martin had no difficulty in recognizing the character of the building it was a sweathouse an institution common to nearly all the aboriginal tribes of california half a religious temple it was also half a sanitary asylum was used as a russian bath or superheated vault from which the braves sweltering and stifling all night by smothered fires at early dawn plunged perspiring into the icecold river the heat and smoke were further utilized to dry and cure the long strips of fish hanging from the roof and it was through the narrow aperture that served as a chimney that the odor escaped which martin had detected he knew that as the bathers only occupied the house from midnight to early morn it was now probably empty he advanced confidently toward it  he was a little surprised to find that the small open space between it and the river was occupied by a rude scaffolding like that on which certain tribes exposed their dead but in this instance it only contained the feathered leggings fringed blanket and eagleplumed headdress of some brave he did not however linger in this plainly visible area but quickly dropped on all fours and crept into the interior of the house here he completed his feast with the fish and warmed his chilled limbs on the embers of the still smouldering fires it was while drying his tattered clothes and shoeless feet that he thought of the dead braves useless leggings and moccasins and it occurred to him that he would be less likely to attract the indians attention from a distance and provoke a ready arrow if he were disguised as one of them crawling out again he quickly secured not only the leggings but the blanket and headdress and putting them on cast his own clothes into the stream a bolder more energetic or more provident man would have followed the act by quickly making his way back to the thicket to reconnoitre taking with him a supply of fish for future needs but elijah martin succumbed again to the recklessness of inertia he yielded once more to the animal instinct of momentary security he returned to the interior of the hut curled himself again on the ashes and weakly resolving to sleep until moonrise and as weakly hesitating ended by falling into uneasy but helpless stupor  when he awoke the rising sun almost level with the low entrance to the sweathouse was darting its direct rays into the interior as if searching it with fiery spears he had slept ten hours he rose tremblingly to his knees everything was quiet without he might yet escape he crawled to the opening the open space before it was empty but the scaffolding was gone the clear keen air revived him as he sprang out erect a shout that nearly stunned him seemed to rise from the earth on all sides he glanced around him in a helpless agony of fear a dozen concentric circles of squatting indians whose heads were visible above the reeds encompassed the banks around the sunken base of the sweathouse with successive dusky rings every avenue of escape seemed closed perhaps for that reason the attitude of his surrounding captors was passive rather than aggressive and the shrewd halfhebraic profiles nearest him expressed only stoical waiting there was a strange similarity of expression in his own immovable apathy of despair his only sense of averting his fate was a confused idea of explaining his intrusion his desperate memory yielded a few common indian words he pointed automatically to himself and the stream his white lips moved  i comefromthe river  a guttural cry as if the whole assembly were clearing their throats went round the different circles the nearest rocked themselves to and fro and bent their feathered heads toward him a hollowcheeked decrepit old man arose and said simply  it is he the great chief has come    he was saved more than that he was recreated for by signs and intimations he was quickly made aware that since the death of their late chief their medicinemen had prophesied that his perfect successor should appear miraculously before them borne noiselessly on the river from the sea in the plumes and insignia of his predecessor this mere coincidence of appearance and costume might not have been convincing to the braves had not elijah martins actual deficiencies contributed to their unquestioned faith in him not only his inert possession of the sweathouse and his apathetic attitude in their presence but his utter and complete unlikeness to the white frontiersmen of their knowledge and traditioncreatures of fire and sword and malevolent activityas well as his manifest dissimilarity to themselves settled their conviction of his supernatural origin his gentle submissive voice his yielding will his lazy helplessness the absence of strange weapons and fierce explosives in his possession his unwonted sobrietyall proved him an exception to his apparent race that was in itself miraculous for it must be confessed that in spite of the cherished theories of most romances and all statesmen and commanders that fear is the great civilizer of the savage barbarian and that he is supposed to regard the prowess of the white man and his mysterious deathdealing weapons as evidence of his supernatural origin and superior creation the facts have generally pointed to the reverse elijah martin was not long in discovering that when the minyo hunter with his obsolete bow dropped dead by a bullet from a viewless and apparently noiseless space it was not considered the lightnings of an avenging deity but was traced directly to the ambushed rifle of kansas joe swayed by a viciousness quite as human as their own the spectacle of blizzard dick verging on delirium tremens and riding amuck into an indian village with a revolver in each hand did not impress them as a supernatural act nor excite their respectful awe as much as the less harmful frenzy of one of their own medicinemen they were not influenced by implacable white gods who relaxed only to drive hard bargains and exchange mildewed flour and shoddy blankets for their fish and furs i am afraid they regarded these raids of christian civilization as they looked upon grasshopper plagues famines inundations and epidemics while an utterly impassive god washed his hands of the means he had employed and even encouraged the faithful to resist and overcome his emissariesthe white devils had elijah martin been a student of theology he would have been struck with the singular resemblance of these theoriesalthough the application thereof was reversedto the christian faith but elijah martin had neither the imagination of a theologian nor the insight of a politician he only saw that he hitherto ignored and despised in a community of halfbarbaric men now translated to a community of men wholly savage was respected and worshipped  it might have turned a stronger head than elijahs he was at first frightened fearful lest his reception concealed some hidden irony or that like the flowercrowned victim of ancient sacrifice he was exalted and sustained to give importance and majesty to some impending martyrdom then he began to dread that his innocent deceitif deceit it wasshould be discovered at last partly from meekness and partly from the animal contentment of present security he accepted the situation fortunately for him it was purely passive the great chief of the minyo tribe was simply an expressionless idol of flesh and blood the previous incumbent of that office had been an old man impotent and senseless of late years through age and disease the chieftains and braves had consulted in council before him and perfunctorily submitted their decisions like offerings to his unresponsive shrine in the same way all material eventsexpeditions trophies industrieswere supposed to pass before the dull impassive eyes of the great chief for direct acceptance on the second day of elijahs accession two of the braves brought a bleeding human scalp before him elijah turned pale trembled and averted his head and then remembering the danger of giving way to his weakness grew still more ghastly the warriors watched him with impassioned faces a gruntbut whether of astonishment dissent or approval he would not tellwent round the circle but the scalp was taken away and never again appeared in his presence  an incident still more alarming quickly followed two captives white men securely bound were one day brought before him on their way to the stake followed by a crowd of old and young squaws and children the unhappy elijah recognized in the prisoners two packers from a distant settlement who sometimes passed through redwood camp an agony of terror shame and remorse shook the pseudo chief to his crest of high feathers and blanched his face beneath its paint and yellow ochre to interfere to save them from the torture they were evidently to receive at the hands of those squaws and children according to custom would be exposure and death to him as well as themselves while to assist by his passive presence at the horrible sacrifice of his countrymen was too much for even his weak selfishness scarcely knowing what he did as the lugubrious procession passed before him he hurriedly hid his face in his blanket and turned his back upon the scene there was a dead silence the warriors were evidently unprepared for this extraordinary conduct of their chief what might have been their action it was impossible to conjecture for at that moment a little squaw perhaps impatient for the sport and partly emboldened by the fact that she had been selected only a few days before as the betrothed of the new chief approached him slyly from the other side the horrified eyes of elijah momentarily raised from his blanket saw and recognized her the feebleness of a weak nature that dared not measure itself directly with the real cause vented its rage on a secondary object he darted a quick glance of indignation and hatred at the young girl she ran back in startled terror to her companions a hurried consultation followed and in another moment the whole bevy of girls old women and children were on the wing shrieking and crying to their wigwams  you see said one of the prisoners coolly to the other in english i was right they never intended to do anything to us it was only a bluff these minyos are a different sort from the other tribes they never kill anybody if they can help it  youre wrong said the other excitedly it was that big chief there with his head in a blanket that sent those dogs to the right about hell did you see them run at just a look from him hes a high and mighty feller you bet look at his dignity  thats sohe aint no slouch said the other gazing at elijahs muffled head critically dd if he aint a born king  the sudden conflict and utter revulsion of emotion that those simple words caused in elijahs breast was almost incredible he had been at first astounded by the revelation of the peaceful reputation of the unknown tribe he had been called upon to govern but even this comforting assurance was as nothing compared to the greater revelations implied in the speakers praise of himself he elijah martin the despised the rejected the worthless outcast of redwood camp recognized as a born king a leader his power felt by the very men who had scorned him and he had done nothingstop had he actually done nothing was it not possible that he was really what they thought him his brain reeled under the strong unaccustomed wine of praise acting upon his weak selfishness it exalted him for a moment to their measure of his strength even as their former belief in his inefficiency had kept him down courage is too often only the memory of past success this was his first effort he forgot he had not earned it even as he now ignored the danger of earning it the few words of unconscious praise had fallen like the blade of knighthood on his cowering shoulders he had risen ennobled from the contact though his face was still muffled in his blanket he stood erect and seemed to have gained in stature  the braves had remained standing irresolute and yet watchful a few paces from their captives suddenly elijah still keeping his back to the prisoners turned upon the braves with blazing eyes violently throwing out his hands with the gesture of breaking bonds like all sudden demonstrations of undemonstrative men it was extravagant weird and theatrical but it was more potent than speechthe speech that even if effective would still have betrayed him to his countrymen the braves hurriedly cut the thongs of the prisoners another impulsive gesture from elijah and they too fled when he lifted his eyes cautiously from his blanket captors and captives had dispersed in opposite directions and he was aloneand triumphant  from that moment elijah martin was another man he went to bed that night in an intoxicating dream of power he arose a man of will of strength he read it in the eyes of the braves albeit at times averted in wonder he understood now that although peace had been their habit and custom they had nevertheless sought to test his theories of administration with the offering of the scalps and the captives and in this detection of their common weakness he forgot his own most heroes require the contrast of the unheroic to set them off and elijah actually found himself devising means for strengthening the defensive and offensive character of the tribe and was himself strengthened by it meanwhile the escaped packers did not fail to heighten the importance of their adventure by elevating the character and achievements of their deliverer and it was presently announced throughout the frontier settlements that the hitherto insignificant and peaceful tribe of minyos who inhabited a large territory bordering on the pacific ocean had developed into a powerful nation only kept from the warpath by a more powerful but mysterious chief the government sent an indian agent to treat with them in its usual halfpaternal halfaggressive and wholly inconsistent policy elijah who still retained the imitative sense and adaptability to surroundings which belong to most lazy impressible natures and in striped yellow and vermilion features looked the chief he personated met the agent with silent and becoming gravity the council was carried on by signs never before had an indian treaty been entered into with such perfect knowledge of the intentions and designs of the whites by the indians and such profound ignorance of the qualities of the indians by the whites it need scarcely be said that the treaty was an unquestionable indian success they did not give up their arable lands what they did sell to the agent they refused to exchange for extravagantpriced shoddy blankets worthless guns damp powder and mouldy meal they took pay in dollars and were thus enabled to open more profitable commerce with the traders at the settlements for better goods and better bargains they simply declined beads whiskey and bibles at any price the result was that the traders found it profitable to protect them from their countrymen and the chances of wantonly shooting down a possible valuable customer stopped the old indiscriminate riflepractice the indians were allowed to cultivate their fields in peace elijah purchased for them a few agricultural implements the catching curing and smoking of salmon became an important branch of trade they waxed prosperous and rich they lost their nomadic habitsa centralized settlement bearing the external signs of an indian village took the place of their old temporary encampments but the huts were internally an improvement on the old wigwams the dried fish were banished from the tentpoles to long sheds especially constructed for that purpose the sweathouse was no longer utilized for worldly purposes the wise and mighty elijah did not attempt to reform their religion but to preserve it in its integrity  that these improvements and changes were due to the influence of one man was undoubtedly true but that he was necessarily a superior man did not follow elijahs success was due partly to the fact that he had been enabled to impress certain negative virtues which were part of his own nature upon a community equally constituted to receive them each was strengthened by the recognition in each other of the unexpected value of those qualities each acquired a confidence begotten of their success hehideshisface as elijah martin was known to the tribe after the episode of the released captives was really not so much of an autocrat as many constitutional rulers    two years of tranquil prosperity passed elijah martin foundling outcast without civilized ties or relationship of any kind forgotten by his countrymen and lifted into alien power wealth security and respect becamehomesick  it was near the close of a summer afternoon he was sitting at the door of his lodge which overlooked on one side the farshining levels of the pacific and on the other the slow descent to the cultivated meadows and banks of the minyo river that debouched through a waste of saltmarsh beachgrass sanddunes and foamy estuary into the ocean the headland or promontorythe only eminence of the minyo territoryhad been reserved by him for his lodge partly on account of its isolation from the village at its base and partly for the view it commanded of his territory yet his wearying and discontented eyes were more often found on the ocean as a possible highway of escape from his irksome position than on the plain and the distant range of mountains so closely connected with the nearer past and his former detractors in his vague longing he had no desire to return to them even in triumph in his present security there still lingered a doubt of his ability to cope with the old conditions it was more like his easy indolent naturewhich revived in his prosperityto trust to this least practical and remote solution of his trouble his homesickness was as vague as his plan for escape from it he did not know exactly what he regretted but it was probably some life he had not enjoyed some pleasure that had escaped his former incompetency and poverty  he had sat thus a hundred times as aimlessly blinking at the vast possibilities of the shining sea beyond turning his back upon the nearer and more practicable mountains lulled by the faroff beating of monotonous rollers the lonely cry of the curlew and plover the drowsy changes of alternate breaths of cool fragrant reeds and warm spicy sands that blew across his eyelids and succumbed to sleep as he had done a hundred times before the narrow strips of colored cloth insignia of his dignity flapped lazily from his tentpoles and at last seemed to slumber with him the shadows of the leaftracery thrown by the baytree on the ground at his feet scarcely changed its pattern nothing moved but the round restless berrylike eyes of wachita his childwife the former heroine of the incident with the captive packers who sat near her lord armed with a willow wand watchful of intruding wasps sandflies and even the more ostentatious advances of a rotund and clericallooking humblebee with his monotonous homily content dumb submissive vacant at such times wachita debarred her husbands confidences through the native customs and his own indifferent taciturnity satisfied herself by gazing at him with the wondering but ineffectual sympathy of a faithful dog unfortunately for elijah her purely mechanical ministration could not prevent a more dangerous intrusion upon his security  he awoke with a light start and eyes that gradually fixed upon the woman a look of returning consciousness wachita pointed timidly to the village below  the messenger of the great white father has come today with his wagons and horses he would see the chief of the minyos but i would not disturb my lord  elijahs brow contracted relieved of its characteristic metaphor he knew that this meant that the new indian agent had made his usual official visit and had exhibited the usual anxiety to see the famous chieftain  good he said white rabbit his lieutenant will see the messenger and exchange gifts it is enough  the white messenger has brought his wangee white woman with him they would look upon the face of him who hides it continued wachita dubiously they would that wachita should bring them nearer to where my lord is that they might see him when he knew it not  elijah glanced moodily at his wife with the half suspicion with which he still regarded her alien character then let wachita go back to the squaws and old women and let her hide herself with them until the wangee strangers are gone he said curtly i have spoken go  accustomed to these abrupt dismissals which did not necessarily indicate displeasure wachita disappeared without a word elijah who had risen remained for a few moments leaning against the tentpoles gazing abstractedly toward the sea the bees droned uninterruptedly in his ears the faroff roll of the breakers came to him distinctly but suddenly with greater distinctness came the murmur of a womans voice  he dont look savage a bit why hes real handsome  hush you said a second voice in a frightened whisper  but if he did hear he couldnt understand returned the first voice a suppressed giggle followed  luckily elijahs natural and acquired habits of repression suited the emergency he did not move although he felt the quick blood fly to his face and the voice of the first speaker had suffused him with a strange and delicious anticipation he restrained himself though the words she had naively dropped were filling him with new and tremulous suggestion he was motionless even while he felt that the vague longing and yearning which had possessed him hitherto was now mysteriously taking some unknown form and action  the murmuring ceased the humblebees drone again became ascendanta sudden fear seized him she was going he should never see her while he had stood there a dolt and sluggard she had satisfied her curiosity and stolen away with a sudden yielding to impulse he darted quickly in the direction where he had heard her voice the thicket moved parted crackled and rustled and then undulated thirty feet before him in a long wave as if from the passage of some lithe invisible figure but at the same moment a little cry half of alarm half of laughter broke from his very feet and a bent manzanitobush relaxed by frightened fingers flew back against his breast thrusting it hurriedly aside his stooping eager face came almost in contact with the pink flushed cheeks and tangled curls of a womans head he was so near her moist and laughing eyes almost drowned his eager glance her parted lips and white teeth were so close to his that her quick breath took away his own  she had dropped on one knee as her companion fled expecting he would overlook her as he passed but his direct onset had extracted the feminine outcry yet even then she did not seem greatly frightened  its only a joke sir she said coolly lifting herself to her feet by grasping his arm im mrs dall the indian agents wife they said you wouldnt let anybody see youand i determined i would thats all she stopped threw back her tangled curls behind her ears shook the briers and thorns from her skirt and added well i reckon you arent afraid of a woman are you so no harms done goodby  she drew slightly back as if to retreat but the elasticity of the manzanito against which she was leaning threw her forward once more he again inhaled the perfume of her hair he saw even the tiny freckles that darkened her upper lip and brought out the moist red curve below a sudden recollection of a playmate of his vagabond childhood flashed across his mind a wild inspiration of lawlessness begotten of his past experience his solitude his dictatorial power and the beauty of the woman before him mounted to his brain he threw his arms passionately around her pressed his lips to hers and with a halfhysterical laugh drew back and disappeared in the thicket  mrs dall remained for an instant dazed and stupefied then she lifted her arm mechanically and with her sleeve wiped her bruised mouth and the ochrestain that his paint had left like blood upon her cheek her laughing face had become instantly grave but not from fear her dark eyes had clouded but not entirely with indignation she suddenly brought down her hand sharply against her side with a gesture of discovery  thats no injun she said with prompt decision the next minute she plunged back into the trail again and the dense foliage once more closed around her but as she did so the broad vacant face and the mutely wondering eyes of wachita rose like a placid moon between the branches of a tree where they had been hidden and shone serenely and impassively after her    a month elapsed but it was a month filled with more experience to elijah than his past two years of exaltation in the first few days following his meeting with mrs dall he was possessed by terror mingled with flashes of desperation at the remembrance of his rash imprudence his recollection of extravagant frontier chivalry to womankind and the swift retribution of the insulted husband or guardian alternately filled him with abject fear or extravagant recklessness at times prepared for flight even to the desperate abandonment of himself in a canoe to the waters of the pacific at times he was on the point of inciting his braves to attack the indian agency and precipitate the war that he felt would be inevitable as the days passed and there seemed to be no interruption to his friendly relations with the agency with that relief a new subtle joy crept into elijahs heart the image of the agents wife framed in the leafy screen behind his lodge the perfume of her hair and breath mingled with the spicing of the bay the brief thrill and tantalization of the stolen kiss still haunted him through his long shy abstention from society and his two years of solitary exile the fresh beauty of this young western wife in whom the frank artlessness of girlhood still lingered appeared to him like a superior creation he forgot his vague longings in the inception of a more tangible but equally unpractical passion he remembered her unconscious and spontaneous admiration of him he dared to connect it with her forgiving silence if she had withheld her confidences from her husband he could hopehe knew not exactly what  one afternoon wachita put into his hand a folded note with an instinctive presentiment of its contents elijah turned red and embarrassed in receiving it from the woman who was recognized as his wife but the impassive submissive manner of this household drudge instead of touching his conscience seemed to him a vulgar and brutal acceptance of the situation that dulled whatever compunction he might have had he opened the note and read hurriedly as follows  you took a great freedom with me the other day and i am justified in taking one with you now i believe you understand english as well as i do if you want to explain that and your conduct to me i will be at the same place this afternoon my friend will accompany me but she need not hear what you have to say  elijah read the letter which might have been written by an ordinary schoolgirl as if it had conveyed the veiled rendezvous of a princess the reserve caution and shyness which had been the safeguard of his weak nature were swamped in a flow of immature passion he flew to the interview with the eagerness and inexperience of first love he was completely at her mercy so utterly was he subjugated by her presence that she did not even run the risk of his passion whatever sentiment might have mingled with her curiosity she was never conscious of a necessity to guard herself against it at this second meeting she was in full possession of his secret he had told her everything she had promised nothing in returnshe had not even accepted anything even her actual afterrelations to the denouement of his passion are still shrouded in mystery  nevertheless elijah lived two weeks on the unsubstantial memory of this meeting what might have followed could not be known for at the end of that time an outrageso atrocious that even the peaceful minyos were thrilled with savage indignationwas committed on the outskirts of the village an old chief who had been specially selected to deal with the indian agent and who kept a small trading outpost had been killed and his goods despoiled by a reckless redwood packer the murderer had coolly said that he was only serving out the tool of a fraudulent imposture on the government and that he dared the archimpostor himself the socalled minyo chief to help himself a wave of ungovernable fury surged up to the very tentpoles of elijahs lodge and demanded vengeance elijah trembled and hesitated in the thraldom of his selfish passion for mrs dall he dared not contemplate a collision with her countrymen he would have again sought refuge in his passive noncommittal attitude but he knew the impersonal character of indian retribution and compensationa sacrifice of equal value without reference to the culpability of the victimand he dreaded some spontaneous outbreak to prevent the enforced expiation of the crime by some innocent brother packer he was obliged to give orders for the pursuit and arrest of the criminal secretly hoping for his escape or the interposition of some circumstance to avert his punishment a day of sullen expectancy to the old men and squaws in camp of gloomy anxiety to elijah alone in his lodge followed the departure of the braves on the warpath it was midnight when they returned elijah who from his habitual reserve and the accepted etiquette of his exalted station had remained impassive in his tent only knew from the guttural rejoicings of the squaws that the expedition had been successful and the captive was in their hands at any other time he might have thought it an evidence of some growing scepticism of his infallibility of judgment and a diminution of respect that they did not confront him with their prisoner but he was too glad to escape from the danger of exposure and possible arraignment of his past life by the desperate captive even though it might not have been understood by the spectators he reflected that the omission might have arisen from their recollection of his previous aversion to a retaliation on other prisoners enough that they would wait his signal for the torture and execution at sunrise the next day  the night passed slowly it is more than probable that the selfish and ignoble torments of the sleepless and vacillating judge were greater than those of the prisoner who dozed at the stake between his curses yet it was part of elijahs fatal weakness that his kinder and more human instincts were dominated even at that moment by his lawless passion for the indian agents wife and his indecision as to the fate of his captive was as much due to this preoccupation as to a selfish consideration of her relations to the result he hated the prisoner for his infelicitous and untimely crime yet he could not make up his mind to his death he paced the ground before his lodge in dishonorable incertitude the small eyes of the submissive wachita watched him with vague solicitude  toward morning he was struck by a shameful inspiration he would creep unperceived to the victims side unloose his bonds and bid him fly to the indian agency there he was to inform mrs dall that her husbands safety depended upon his absenting himself for a few days but that she was to remain and communicate with elijah she would understand everything perhaps at least she would know that the prisoners release was to please her but even if she did not no harm would be done a white mans life would be saved and his real motive would not be suspected he turned with feverish eagerness to the lodge wachita had disappearedprobably to join the other women it was well she would not suspect him  the tree to which the doomed man was bound was by custom selected nearest the chiefs lodge within its sacred enclosure with no other protection than that offered by its reserved seclusion and the outer semicircle of warriors tents before it to escape the captive would therefore have to pass beside the chiefs lodge to the rear and descend the hill toward the shore elijah would show him the way and make it appear as if he had escaped unaided as he glided into the shadow of a group of pines he could dimly discern the outline of the destined victim secured against one of the larger trees in a sitting posture with his head fallen forward on his breast as if in sleep but at the same moment another figure glided out from the shadow and approached the fatal tree it was wachita  he stopped in amazement but in another instant a flash of intelligence made it clear he remembered her vague uneasiness and solicitude at his agitation her sudden disappearance she had fathomed his perplexity as she had once before of her own accord she was going to release the prisoner the knife to cut his cords glittered in her hand brave and faithful animal  he held his breath as he drew nearer but to his horror the knife suddenly flashed in the air and darted down again and again upon the body of the helpless man there was a convulsive struggle but no outcry and the next moment the body hung limp and inert in its cords elijah would himself have fallen halffainting against a tree but by a revulsion of feeling came the quick revelation that the desperate girl had rightly solved the problem she had done what he ought to have doneand his loyalty and manhood were preserved that conviction and the courage to act upon itto have called the sleeping braves to witness his sacrificewould have saved him but it was ordered otherwise  as the girl rapidly passed him he threw out his hand and seized her wrist who did you do this for he demanded  for you she said stupidly  and why  because you no kill himyou love his squaw  his squaw he staggered back a terrible suspicion flashed upon him he dashed wachita aside and ran to the tree it was the body of the indian agent aboriginal justice had been satisfied the warriors had not caught the murderer but true to their idea of vicarious retribution had
