the ‘walk from london to fulham’ there have been many important changes on the road time has continued to efface interesting associations more old houses have been pulled down new ones built up and great alterations and improvements have taken place not contemplated a few years ago  it would be impossible for example that any one who has not visited the locality during the last few years could recognize the narrow lanes of yesterday in the fine roads now diverging beyond the south kensington museum which building has so recently been erected at the commencement of old brompton but modern improvements are seemingly endless and have of late become frequent  it is in the belief that the following pages will be an interesting and acceptable record of many places no longer in existence that they are submitted to the public in their present shape by                                                        t f dillon croker                                      to

eminent genealogist sir w betham of dublin ulster kingatarms well known as the author of numerous works on the antiquities of ireland and mr richard sainthill an equally zealous antiquary still living in cork were two of the most intimate friends and correspondents of the late mr crofton croker  the firstnamed gentleman drew up an elaborate table tracing the croker pedigree as far back as the battle of agincourt  the croker crest—“deus alit eos”—was granted to sir john croker who accompanied edward iv on his expedition to france in 1475 as cup and standardbearer but without going back to the original generation or tracing the limerick or any other branch of the family it will be sufficient to say here that the crokers if they did not “come over with william the conqueror” came originally from devonshire and settled in ireland in the reign of elizabeth  thomas crofton croker was the only son of thomas croker who after twentyfive years of arduous and faithful military service in north america holland and ireland and after having purchased every step in the army was gazetted brevetmajor on the 11th may 1802 in the same regiment which he had at first joined the 38th or 1st staffordshire foot and in which he had uninterruptedly served  indeed he was so much attached to his regiment that in his case at least the staffordshire knot became perfectly symbolic  the closer the knot was drawn the firmer the tie became  he commenced continued and ended an honourable life of activity in the service of his country from mere boyhood until illhealth and a broken constitution forced him to sell his commission  thomas croker was the eldest son of richard croker of mount long in the county of tipperary who died on the 1st january 1771 and his mother was anne the daughter of james long of dublin by the honourable mary butler daughter of theobald the seventh earl of cahir thomas croker was born on the 29th march 1761  in 1796 he married maria eldest daughter and coheir of croker dillon of baltidaniel in the county of cork and on the 15th january 1798 thomas crofton croker was born at the house of his maternal grandmother in buckingham square cork receiving his first christian name after his father and his second after his godfather the honourable sir e crofton bart  while very young during the years 1812 and 1815 crofton croker made several excursions in the south of ireland studying the character and traditions of the country on which occasions he was frequently accompanied by mr joseph humphreys a quaker afterwards master of the deaf and dumb institution at claremont near dublin  in 1813 he was placed with the mercantile firm of messrs lecky and mark and in 1817 he appeared as an exhibitor in the second exhibition of the cork society for he had already displayed considerable talent as an artist  in 1818 he contributed to an ephemeral production called ‘the literary and political examiner’ on the 22nd march of that year his father died and he left ireland not to revisit it until he made a short excursion there in 1821 with alfred nicholson and miss nicholson who afterwards became mrs croker children of the late mr francis nicholson one of the founders of the english watercolour school and who died in 1844 at the patriarchal age of ninetyone years  crofton croker’s first visit to england was paid to thomas moore in wiltshire and soon after his establishing in london he received from the late right hon john wilson croker an appointment at the admiralty of which office his namesake but no relation was secretary and from which he crofton retired in 1850 as senior clerk of the first class having served upwards of thirty years thirteen of which were passed in the highest class  this retirement although he stood first for promotion to the office of chief clerk was compulsory upon a reduction of office and was not a matter of private convenience  in 1830 crofton croker married miss marianne nicholson and the result of their union was an only child thomas francis dillon croker born 26th august 1831 the writer of the present memoir  the literary labours of crofton croker were attended with more gratifying results than his long and unwearied official services  the ‘researches in the south of ireland’ 1824 an arrangement of notes made during several excursions between the years 1812 and 1822 was his first important work  it was published by john murray the father of the present publisher of the ‘quarterly review’ and contained illustrations by mr alfred and miss nicholson with the ‘fairy legends’ however the name of crofton croker became more especially associated the first edition of which appeared anonymously in 1825 and produced a complimentary letter from sir walter scott which has been published in all subsequent editions  the success of the first edition of the legends was such as immediately to justify a second which appeared the next year illustrated with etchings after sketches by maclise and which was followed by a second series parts 2 and 3 in 1827  the third part although it appeared under the same title namely ‘fairy legends and traditions of the south of ireland’ may be considered as forming almost a separate work inasmuch as it comprised the fairy superstitions of wales and other countries in addition to those current in ireland  a translation of the legends by the brothers grimm appeared in germany in 1825 and another in paris in 1828 ‘les contes irlandais précédés d’une introduction par m p a dufau’ but it was not until 1834 that murray published them in a condensed form in his ‘family library’ the copyright of which edition as revised by the author was purchased of murray by the late mr tegg and is now published by his son  in october 1826 croker was introduced to sir walter scott at lockhart’s in pall mall sir walter recorded the interview thus—“at breakfast crofton croker author of the irish fairy tales—little as a dwarf keeneyed as a hawk and of easy prepossessing manners something like tom moore  here were also terry allan cunningham newton and others”  at this meeting sir walter scott suggested the adventures of daniel o’rourke as the subject for the adelphi pantomime and at the request of messrs terry and yates croker wrote a pantomime founded upon the legend which was produced at the adelphi the same year  it succeeded and underwent two editions the second was published in 1828 uniform with the legends and entitled ‘daniel o’rourke or rhymes of a pantomime founded on that story’  croker wrote to his sister mrs eyre coote alive at the present time the following account of the breakfast party at lockhart’s which though already published in ‘the gentleman’s magazine’ november 1854 is sufficiently interesting to be repeated  he first mentions “the writing and preparing for the adelphi theatre a christmas pantomime from the renowned adventures of daniel o’rourke two or three meetings with sir walter scott some anxious experiments in lithography under the directions of mr coindet one of the partners of englemann’s house of paris who has lately opened an establishment here which will be of the utmost importance to the advancement of the art in this country and of which i hope soon to send you specimens”  then he adds “to tell half the kindness and attention which i received from sir walter scott would be impossible  the breakfast party at lockhart’s consisted of allan cunningham terry the actor newton the artist a dr yates of brighton captain mr and mrs lockhart miss scott mr hogg and your humble servant  we had all assembled when sir walter entered the room maclise’s sketch does not give his expression although there is certainly a strong likeness—a likeness in it which cannot be mistaken but i have a very rough profile sketch in pen and ink by newton which is admirable and which some time or other i will copy and send you  when i was introduced to the ‘great unknown’ i really had not the power of speaking it was a strange feeling of embarrassment which i do not remember having felt before in so strong a manner and of course to his ‘i am glad to see you mr croker you and i are not unknown to each other’ i could say nothing  he contrived to say something neat to every one in the kindest manner—a wellturned compliment without however the slightest appearance of flattery—something at which every one felt gratified  after speaking for a few moments to mr terry and allan cunningham he returned to where i stood fixed and ‘mute as the monument on fish street hill’ but i soon recovered the use of my tongue from the easy manner in which he addressed me and no longer seemed to feel myself in the presence of some mighty and mysterious personage  he spoke slowly with a scotch accent and in rather a low tone of voice so much so indeed that i found it difficult to catch every word  he mentioned my ‘fairy legends’ and hoped he should soon have the very great enjoyment of reading the second volume  ‘you are our—i speak of the celtic nations’ said sir walter—‘great authority now on fairy superstition and have made fairy land your kingdom most sincerely do i hope it may prove a golden inheritance to you  to me’ continued sir walter ‘it is the land of promise of much future entertainment  i have been reading the german translation of your tales and the grimms’ very elaborate introduction’  mr terry mentioned having received from me daniel o’rourke in the shape of a christmas pantomime  ‘it is an admirable subject’ said sir walter ‘and if mr croker has only dramatized it with half the skill of tricking up old wives’ tales which he has shown himself to possess it must be and i prophesy although i have not seen it it will be as great a golden egg in your nest terry as mother goose was to one of the greater theatres some years ago’  he then repeated by heart part of the conversation between dan and the eagle with great zest  i must confess it was most sweet from such a man  but really i blush or ought to blush at writing all this flattery”  here the origin of maclise’s illustrations to the legends is thus given by the editor of the ‘gentleman’s magazine’  “the artist who had not then quitted his native city of cork was a frequent visitor to mr sainthill the author of ‘olla podrida’ at the time that the first edition of the work appeared  mr sainthill read the tales aloud from time to time in the evening and maclise would frequently on the next morning produce a drawing of what he had heard  these were not seen by mr croker until his next visit to cork but when he did see them he was so much pleased with them that he prevailed upon mr sainthill to allow them to be copied for his forthcoming edition and this was done by maclise and the drawings were engraved by w h brooke and maclise’s name was not attached to them but merely mentioned by mr croker in his preface”  scott made favourable mention of the ‘fairy legends’ in the collected edition of the ‘waverley novels’ published in 1830  in a note on fairy superstitions to chapter xi of ‘rob roy’ speaking of the elfin traditions peculiar to the wild scenery where avon dhu or the river forth has its birth he observes “the opinions entertained about these beings are much the same with those of the irish so exquisitely well narrated by mr crofton croker”  again in his ‘letters on demonology and witchcraft’ scott says “we know from the lively and entertaining legends published by mr crofton croker which though in most cases told with the wit of the editor and the humour of his country contain points of curious antiquarian information” as to what the opinions of the irish are  and again speaking of the banshee “the subject has been so lately and beautifully investigated and illustrated by mr crofton croker and others that i may dispense with being very particular regarding it” this was indeed gratifying from such an authority  the late thomas haynes bayley dedicated to crofton croker a volume entitled ‘songs from fairy land’  having dwelt at considerable length upon the legends the required limits of this notice will not permit more than a reference to the literary works of mr croker which succeeded them and as there is but occasion for their enumeration they shall be here given in the order of their appearance merely premising that the tales of ‘barney mahoney’ and ‘my village versus our village’ were not by mr croker although they bore his name they were in reality written by mrs croker  the list stands thus—  1828–9  ‘the christmasbox an annual present for children a collection of tales edited by mr croker and published by harrison ainsworth’ sir walter scott lockhart ainsworth maria edgeworth and miss mitford were among the contributors  1829  ‘legends of the lakes or sayings and doings at killarney collected chiefly from the manuscripts of r adolphus lynch esq h p king’s german legion with illustrations by maclise ebers’  a second edition compressed into one volume as a guide to the lakes appeared in 1831  fisher  from this time croker became contributor to the ‘gentleman’s’ and ‘fraser’s’ magazines  in 1832 he was a steward at the famous literary dinner given to hogg the ettrick shepherd  1835  ‘landscape illustrations to moore’s irish melodies with comments for the curious’  only one number appeared  power  1837  ‘a memoir of joseph holt general of the irish rebels in 1798 from holt’s autobiographical ms in the possession of sir w betham’ colburn  ‘the journal of a tour through ireland in 1644 translated from the french of m de la boullaye le gouz assisted by j roche father prout and thomas wright’  boone  dedicated to the elder disraeli “in remembrance of much attention and kindness received from him many years ago” which dedication was cordially responded to by that author  1839  ‘the popular songs of ireland’  colburn  1843  a description of rosamond’s bower fulham 18 the residence of mr croker for eight years with an inventory of the pictures furniture curiosities etc etc  privately printed  it was here that moore rogers maria edgeworth lucy aikin “father prout” mahony barham ingoldsby sydney smith jerdan theodore hook lover planché lords braybrooke strangford and northampton sir g back john barrow sir emerson tennent wyon mr and mrs s c hall t wright and many others were the guests of mr croker  one room in the house was fitted up as a museum where such visitors delighted to assemble  during subsequent years mr croker produced several minor works on antiquarian and popular subjects some of them printed for private circulation among his friends and others as contributions to the different societies of which he was a member  he died at his residence 3 gloucester road old brompton on the 8th of august 1854 aged 57 and was buried in the private grave of his fatherinlaw mr francis nicholson in the brompton cemetery a sketch of which by mr fairholt appears in these pages  it should not be forgotten that mr crofton croker was a contributor to the ‘amulet’ ‘literary souvenir’ and ‘friendship’s offering’ as well as more extensively to the ‘literary gazette’ when that journal possessed considerable influence under the editorship of w jerdan  mr croker also edited for the camden and percy societies in the formation of which he took an active part many works of antiquarian interest  he was connected also with the british archæological association as one of the secretaries 1844–9 under the presidency of lord albert conyngham the late lord londesborough  that recentlydeceased nobleman was one of mr croker’s most attached friends and opposite his lordship’s pew in grimston church yorkshire a neat marble tablet was erected bearing the following inscription “in memory of thomas crofton croker esq the amiable and accomplished author of the ‘fairy legends of ireland’ and other works literary and antiquarian  this tablet is erected by his friend lord londesborough 1855”  to enumerate all the societies and institutions of which crofton croker was a member honorary or otherwise would in these pages be superfluous but one society shall be here especially mentioned as originating with mr croker and a few members of the society of antiquaries  in 1828 a club was established composed of a select few fsa’s in consequence of an excursion during the summer to the site which in the time of the romans had been occupied by the city of noviomagus  in a field at keston near bromley common in kent mr croker had learned that the remains of a roman building were apparent above the grass and it was to ascertain this fact that the excursion was undertaken  an excavation was made and a few fragments of roman pottery and a stone coffin were discovered  from this circumstance the club was called the noviomagian society  mr croker was elected its president and although most of the original members had died off he continued in that office until within a very few months of his death  there are amongst them at the present time many highlyvalued friends of their late president who succeed in keeping up their meetings in the true noviomagian spirit  long may they be spared to assemble together occasionally introducing fresh life to the little society that its pleasant gatherings may not be allowed to die out  a portrait of mr croker was painted a few years before his death by mr stephen pearce the artist of the ‘arctic council’  it is a characteristic and an admirable likeness  the next best is that in maclise’s wellknown picture of ‘all hallow eve’ exhibited in the royal academy in 1833 on which lover in describing the engraving has remarked “and who is that standing behind them—he seems ‘far more genteel’ than the rest of the company  why ’tis crofton croker or as he is familiarly called amongst his friends ‘the honourable member for fairyland’  there you are crofty my boy with your notebook in your hand and maybe you won’t pick up a trifle in such good company”  it may be added that mr croker was for many years one of the registrars of the royal literary fund  and now in drawing this slight sketch of mr croker’s life to a close the writer hopes that it may not be an uninteresting addition to the present volume                                                                 t f d c     chapter i   knightsbridge to the bell and horns brompton  picture anyone obliged by circumstances to lead the life of a pendulum vibrating between a certain spot distant four miles from london and a certain spot just out of the smoke of the metropolis—going into town daily in the morning and returning in the evening—may be supposed after the novelty has worn off from the different ways by which he can shape his course to find little interest in his monotonous movement  indeed i have heard many who live a short distance from town complain of this swinging backwards and forwards or rather going forwards and backwards over the same ground every day as dull and wearisome but i cannot sympathise with them  on the contrary i find that the more constantly any particular line of road is adhered to the more intimate an acquaintance with it is formed and the more interesting it becomes  in some measure this may be accounted for by studious habits a tolerable memory apt to indulge in recollections of the past and to cherish rather than despise when not impertinent local gossip which repeoples the district with its former inhabitants—     “sweet memory wafted by thy gentle gale    oft up the tide of time i turn my sail    to view the fairy haunts of longlost hours    blest with far greener shades—far fresher flowers”  “we have all by heart” observes the author of the curiosities of literature “the true and delightful reflection of johnson on local associations where the scene we tread suggests to us the men or the deeds which have left their celebrity to the spot  ‘we are in the presence of their fame and feel its influence’”  how often have i fancied if the walls by which thousands now daily pass without a glance of recognition or regard if those walls could speak and name some of their former inmates how great would be the regret of many at having overlooked houses which they would perhaps have made a pilgrimage of miles to behold as associated with the memory of persons whose names history literature or art has embalmed for posterity or as the scene of circumstances treasured up in recollection  if the feelings could be recalled and faithfully recorded which the dull brick walls that i cannot help regarding with interest must have witnessed what a romantic chapter in the history of the human mind would be preserved for study and reflection—     “ay beautiful the dreaming brought       by valleys and green fields    but deeper feeling higher thought       is what the city yields”  the difficulty however is incredible of procuring accurate information as to any thing which has not been chronicled at the moment  none but those who have had occasion to search after a date or examine into a particular fact can properly estimate their value or the many inquiries that have to be made to ascertain what at first view would appear to be without embarrassment—so deceptive is the memory and so easy a thing is it to forget especially numbers and localities the aspect and even names of which change with a wonderful degree of rapidity in the progress of london out of town  thus many places become daily more and more confused and at last completely lose their identity to the regret of the contemplative mind which loves to associate objects with the recollection of those who “have left their celebrity to the spot”  these considerations have induced the writer to arrange his notes and illustrate them by such sketches as will aid the recognition of the points mentioned the appearance of which must be familiar to all who have journeyed between london and fulham—a district containing beside the ancient village of that name and remarkable as adjacent to the country seat of the bishop of london two smaller villages called walham green and parson’s green  the former of which stands on the main london road the latter on the king’s road—which roads form nearly parallel lines between fulham and the metropolis  for all information respecting the neighbourhood of knightsbridge the reader may be referred to a recently published work “the memorials of the hamlet of knightsbridge with notices of its immediate neighbourhood” by the late henry george davis edited by charles davis russell smith  from knightsbridge formerly a suburb and now part of london the main roads to fulham and hammersmith branch off at the north end of sloane street about a quarter of a mile west of hyde park corner thus—                                picture map  and at the south termination of sloane street which is 3299 feet in length the king’s road commences from sloane square  the main fulham road passes for about a mile through a district called by the general name of brompton which is a hamlet in the parish of kensington  the house no 14 queen’s buildings knightsbridge on the lefthand or south side of the road picture hooper’s court at the corner of hooper’s court occupied when sketched in 1844 as two shops by john hutchins dyer and moses bayliss tailor and now 1860 by hutchins alone was from 1792 to 1797 inclusive the residence of mr j c nattes an artist who deserves notice as one of the sixteen by whose association in 1805 the first exhibition of watercolour paintings was formed  from 1792 to 1797 this house was described as no 14 queen’s buildings knightsbridge but in the latter year the address was changed to no 14 knightsbridge green 25a  in 1800 it was known as no 14 knightsbridge and in 1803 as no 14 queen’s row knightsbridge 25b  in 1810 as gloucester buildings brompton 25c  in 1811 as queen’s buildings 25d  in 1828 as gloucester row 25e  in 1831 as gloucester buildings 25f and it has now reverted to its original name of queen’s buildings knightsbridge in opposition to queen’s buildings brompton the division being hooper’s court if indeed the original name was not queen’s row knightsbridge as this in 1772 was the address of william wynne ryland the engraver who was hanged for forgery in 1783  when houses began to be built on the same side of the way beyond queen’s row the term “buildings” appears to have been assumed as a distinction from the row west of hooper’s court which row would naturally have been considered as a continuation although in 1786 the royal academy catalogue records mr j g huck an exhibitor as residing at no 11 gloster row knightsbridge  these six alterations of name within half a century to say nothing of the previous changes illustrate the extreme difficulty which attends precise local identification in london and are merely offered at the very starting point as evidence at least of the desire to be accurate  about the year 1800 the late residence of mr nattes became the lodgings of arthur murphy too well known as a literary character of the last century to require here more than the mere mention of his name even to those who are accustomed to associate every thing with its pecuniary value as murphy’s portrait painted by sir joshua reynolds for mr thrale sold at christie’s in the sale of mr watson taylor’s pictures june 1823 for £94 10s  murphy had prepared his translation of tacitus 26 for the press at his house on hammersmith terrace the last at the west end but declining health and circumstances induced his removal into lodgings near london at “14 knightsbridge”  from these apartments “he soon removed to others in brompton row where he did not remain long not liking the mistress of the house but returned to his former residence no 14 where he resided till the time of his death” in 1803 the late lord sidmouth then mr addington conferred a pension of £200 ayear on murphy “to mark the sense” his majesty entertained “of literary merit particularly when accompanied with sound principles and unquestionable character” which gracious mark of royal favour murphy acknowledged on the 2nd of march from “14 queen’s row knightsbridge” here he wrote his life of garrick 27a a work which notwithstanding mr foot’s ingenious defence of it shews that garrick’s life remains to be written and that murphy’s intellectual powers were at the time when he composed it in a state of decay  murphy according to his biographer “possessed the first and second floors of a very pleasant neat house where there was a long gravel walk in the garden 27b and though his library had been much diminished yet in the remaining part he took care to reserve the elzevir editions of the classics  mrs mangeon the mistress of the house was a neat and intelligent woman and mr murphy secured her friendship by giving her son a presentation to christ’s hospital  anne dunn his own servantmaid was an excellent servant honest faithful and attentive so that what with the services he had rendered to the mistress of the house and what with the intrinsic fidelity of his female domestic he could put the whole family into a state of requisition and command an elegant table as well as ready attention upon any particular occasion such was the situation of a man of genius and an author in the decline of a long life and in a country at the highest pitch of grandeur and wealth  but it must be remembered that the comforts he possessed were not derived from the profits of literature”  during the last year of arthur murphy’s life he possessed a certain income of £500 and added to this was £150 for the copyright of his tacitus which however was less than half the sum he had been frequently offered for it  the translation of sallust which murphy left unfinished was completed by thomas moore and published in 1807  murphy appears to have perfectly reconciled his mind to the stroke of death  he made his will thirteen days previous to it and dictated and signed plain and accurate orders respecting his funeral  he directed his library of books and all his pictures to be sold by auction and the money arising therefrom together with what money he might have at his bankers or in his strong box he bequeathed to his executor mr jesse foot of dean street soho  to mrs mangeon his landlady he gave “all his prints in the room one pair of stairs and whatever articles of furniture” he had in her house “the bookcase excepted”  and to his servant anne dunn “twenty guineas with all his linen and wearing apparel”  after the completion of this will murphy observed “i have been preparing for my journey to another region and now do not care how soon i take my departure”  and on the day of his death 18th june 1805 he frequently repeated the lines of pope—     “taught half by reason half by mere decay    to welcome death and calmly pass away”  all that we can further glean respecting the interior of murphy’s apartment is that in it “there was a portrait of dunning lord ashburton a very striking likeness painted in crayons by ozias humphrey”  humphrey who was portraitpainter in crayons to george iii and in 1790 was elected member of the royal academy resided in 1792 and 1793 at no 19 queen’s buildings knightsbridge but whether this was the fifth house beyond nattes’ or the no 19 queen’s buildings now called brompton road mitchell’s a linendraper’s shop i am unable after many inquiries to determine  it will be remembered that dr walcott peter pindar introduced opie to the patronage of humphrey and there are many allusions to “honest ozias” as he was called in the contemporary literature     “but humphrey by whom shall your labours be told    how your colours enliven the young and the old”  is the comment of owen cambridge and hayley says     “thy graces humphrey and thy colours clear    from miniatures’ small circle disappear    may their distinguished merit still prevail    and shine with lustre on the larger scale”  a portrait of ozias humphrey painted by romney in 1772 is preserved at knowle a memorial of the visit of those artists to the duke of dorset it has been twice engraved and the private plate from it executed by caroline watson in 1784 is a work of very high merit  in 1799 humphrey resided

the second house beyond that occupied by ozias humphrey mr thomas trotter an ingenious engraver and draughtsman resided in 1801  he engraved several portraits of which the most esteemed are a head of the rev stephen whiston and a head of lord morpeth  nearly the last work of his burin was a portrait of shakspeare patronized by george steevens  trotter died on the 14th february 1803 having been prevented from following his profession in consequence of a blow on one of his eyes accidentally received by the fall of a flowerpot from a window  he however obtained employment in making drawings of churches and monuments for the late sir richard hoare and other gentlemen interested in topographical illustration  queen’s buildings brompton are divided rather than terminated at no 28 green’s an earthenwareshop by new street leading into hans place—“snug hans place” which possesses one house at least that all literary pilgrims would desire to turn out of their direct road to visit miss landon alluding to “the fascinations of hans place” playfully observes “vivid must be the imagination that could discover them—     ‘never hermit in his cell    where repose and silence dwell    human shape and human word    never seen and never heard’  had a life of duller calm than the indwellers of our square”  hans place may also be approached from sloane street and no 22 hans place is the southeast corner  picture no 22 hans place among its inmates have been lady caroline lamb 31 miss mitford lady bulwer miss landon mrs s c hall and miss roberts  how much of the “romance and reality” of life is in a moment conjured up in the mind by the mention of the names here grouped in local association  the editor of the memoirs of l e l records two or three circumstances which give a general interest to hans place  here it was that miss landon was born on the 14th august 1802 in the house now no 25 and “it is remarkable that the greater portion of l e l’s existence was passed on the spot where she was born  from hans place and its neighbourhood she was seldom absent and then not for any great length of time until within a year or two of her death she had there found her home not indeed in the house of her birth but close by  taken occasionally during the earlier years of childhood into the country it was to hans place she returned  here some of her school time was passed when her parents removed she yet clung to the old spot and as her own mistress chose the same scene for her residence  when one series of inmates quitted it she still resided there with their successors returning continually after every wandering ‘like a blackbird to his nest’”  the partiality of miss landon for london was extraordinary  in a letter written in 1834 and addressed to a reverend gentleman she ominously says “when i have the good luck or ill luck i rather lean to the latter opinion of being married i shall certainly insist on the wedding excursion not extending much beyond hyde park corner”  when in her sixth year 1808 miss landon was sent to school at no 22 hans place  this school was then kept by miss bowden who in 1801 had published ‘a poetical introduction to the study of botany’ 32a and in 1810 a poem entitled ‘the pleasures of friendship’ 32b  miss bowden became the countess st quentin and died some years ago in the neighbourhood of paris  in this house where she had been educated miss landon afterwards resided for many years as a boarder with the misses lance who conducted a ladies’ school  “it seems” observes the biographer of l e l “to have been appropriated to such purposes from the time it was built nor was l e l the first who drank at the ‘well of english’ within its walls  miss mitford we believe was educated there and lady caroline lamb was an inmate for a time”  it is the remark of miss landon herself that “a history of the how and where works of imagination have been produced would often be more extraordinary than the works themselves”  “her own case” observes a female friend “is in some degree an illustration of perfect independence of mind over all external circumstances  perhaps to the l e l of whom so many nonsensical things have been said as that she should write with a crystal pen dipped in dew upon silver paper and use for pounce the dust of a butterfly’s wing a dilettante of literature would assign for the scene of her authorship a fairylike boudoir with rosecoloured and silver hangings fitted with all the luxuries of a fastidious taste  how did the reality agree with this fancy sketch picture attic no 22 hans place miss landon’s drawingroom 33 indeed was prettily furnished but it was her invariable habit to write in her bedroom  i see it now that homelylooking almost uncomfortable room fronting the street and barely furnished with a simple white bed at the foot of which was a small old oblongshaped sort of dressingtable quite covered with a common worn writingdesk heaped with papers while some strewed the ground the table being too small for aught besides the desk a little highbacked cane chair which gave you any idea rather than that of comfort  a few books scattered about completed the author’s paraphernalia”  in this attic did the muse of l e l dream of and describe music moonlight and roses and “apostrophise loves memories hopes and fears” with how much ultimate appetite for invention or sympathy may be judged from her declaration that “there is one conclusion at which i have arrived that a horse in a mill has an easier life than an author i am fairly fagged out of my life”  miss roberts who had resided in the same house with miss landon prefixed a brief memoir to a collection of poems by that lamented lady which appeared shortly after her death her own mournful lines—     “alas hope is not prophecy—we dream    but rarely does the glad fulfilment come    we leave our land and we return no more”  and within less than twenty months from the selection of these lines they became applicable to her who had quoted them  emma roberts accompanied her sister mrs m’naughten to india where she resided for some time  on her sister’s death miss roberts returned to england and employed her pen assiduously and advantageously in illustrating the condition of our eastern dominions  she returned to india and died at poonah on the 17th september 1840  though considerably the elder she was one of the early friends of miss landon having for several years previous to her first visit to india boarded with the misses lance in hans place      “these were happy days and little boded the premature and melancholy     fate which awaited them in foreign climes  we believe” says the     editor of the ‘literary gazette’ “that it was the example of the     literary pursuits of miss landon which stimulated miss roberts to try     her powers as an author and we remember having the gratification to     assist her in launching her first essay—an historical production     35 which reflected high credit on her talents and at once     established her in a fair position in the ranks of literature  since     then she has been one of the most prolific of our female writers and     given to the public a number of works of interest and value  the     expedition to india on which she unfortunately perished was     undertaken with comprehensive views towards the further illustration     of the east and portions of her descriptions have appeared as she     journeyed to her destination in periodicals devoted to asiatic     pursuits”  the influence of miss landon’s literary popularity upon the mind of miss roberts very probably caused that lady to desire similar celebrity indeed so imitative are the impulses of the human mind that it may fairly be questioned if miss landon would ever have attuned her lyre had she mot been in the presence of miss mitford’s and miss rowden’s “fame and felt its influence”  miss mitford has chronicled so minutely all the sayings and doings of her schooldays in hans place h p as she mysteriously writes it that she admits us at once behind the scenes she describes herself as sent there we will not supply the date but presume it to be somewhere about 1800 “a petted child of ten years old born and bred in the country and as shy as a hare”  the schoolmistress a mrs s “seldom came near us  her post was to sit all day nicely dressed in a nicelyfurnished drawingroom busy with some piece of delicate needlework receiving mammas aunts and godmammas answering questions and administering as much praise as she conscientiously could—perhaps a little more  in the schoolroom she ruled like other rulers by ministers and delegates of whom the french teacher was the principal”  this french teacher the daughter of an émigré of distinction left upon the short peace of amiens to join her parents in an attempt to recover their property in which they succeeded  her successor is admirably sketched by miss mitford and the mutual antipathy which existed between the french and english teacher in whom we at once recognise miss rowden—      “never were two better haters  their relative situations had     probably something to do with it and yet it was wonderful that two     such excellent persons should so thoroughly detest each other  miss     r’s aversion was of the cold phlegmatic contemptuous provoking     sort she kept aloof and said nothing  madame’s was acute fiery     and loquacious she not only hated miss r but hated for her sake     knowledge and literature and wit and above all poetry which she     denounced as something fatal and contagious like the plague”  miss mitford’s literary and dramatic tastes seem to have been acquired from miss rowden whom she describes as “one of the most charming women that she had ever known”—      “the pretty word graziosa by which napoleon loved to describe     josephine seemed made for her  she was full of a delicate grace of     mind and person  her little elegant figure and her fair mild face     lighted up so brilliantly by her large hazel eyes corresponded     exactly with the soft gentle manners which were so often awakened     into a delightful playfulness or an enthusiasm more charming still     by the impulse of her quick and ardent spirit  to be sure she had a     slight touch of distraction about her distraction french not     distraction english an interesting absence of mind  she united in     her own person all the sins of forgetfulness of all the young ladies     mislaid her handkerchief her shawl her gloves her work her music     her drawing her scissors her keys would ask for a book when she     held it in her hand and set a whole class hunting for her thimble     whilst the said thimble was quietly perched upon her finger  oh     with what a pitying scorn our exact and recollective frenchwoman used     to look down on such an incorrigible scatterbrain  but she was a     poetess as madame said and what could you expect better”  such was miss landon’s schoolmistress and under this lady’s especial instruction did miss mitford pass the years 1802 3 and 4 together they read “chiefly poetry” and “besides the readings” says miss mitford “miss r compensated in another way for my unwilling application  she took me often to the theatre whether as an extra branch of education or because she was herself in the height of a dramatic fever it would be invidious to inquire  the effect may be easily foreseen my enthusiasm soon equalled her own we began to read shakspeare and read nothing else”  in 1810 miss mitford first appeared as an authoress by publishing a volume of poems which in the course of the following year passed into a second edition  at no 21 hans place the talented artistes mr and mrs alfred wigan resided some time  returning from hans place to the fulham road through new street no 7 may he pointed out as the house formerly occupied by chalon “animal painter to the royal family” and no 6 as the residence of the right hon david r pigot the late solicitorgeneral for ireland while in 1824–25 studying in the chambers of the late lord chiefjustice tindal for the profession of which his pupil rapidly became an eminent member  brompton was formerly an airy outlet to which the citizen with his spouse were wont to resort for an afternoon of rustic enjoyment  it had also the reputation of being a locality favourable to intrigue  steele shrewdly writing on the 27th july 1713 says—      “dear wife—if you please to call at button’s we will go together to     brompton

restrained by order of the district surveyor and brompton national school nearly opposite to new street a building in the tudor style was in 1841 wedged in there “for the education of 400 children after the design of mr george godwin jun” so at least the newspapers of the day informed the public  brompton row on the north or righthand side of the main fulham road now consists of fiftyfive respectablelooking houses uniform or nearly so in appearance and according to the statements in the ‘gentleman’s magazine’ 38b and mr faulkner’s ‘history of kensington’ 38c here died arthur murphy  but although this was not the case in brompton row have lived and died authors and actors and artists whose performances deserve full as much consideration from posterity  no 14 brompton row was the abode for more than ten years 1820 to 1831 of john vendramini a distinguished engraver  picture no 14 brompton row he was born at roncade near bassano in italy and died 8th february 1839 aged seventy  vendramini was a pupil of bartolozzi under whom he worked for many years and of the effect he produced upon british art much remains to be said  in 1805 vendramini visited russia and on his return to england engraved ‘the vision of st catherine’ after paul veronese the ‘st sebastian’ after spagnoletti ‘leda’ after leonardo da vinci and the ‘raising of lazarus’ from the sebastian del piombo in the national gallery  no 14 brompton row in 1842 was the residence of the late mr george herbert rodwell a favourite musical and dramatic composer who died january 22nd 1852  at no 23 brompton row resided mr walter hamilton who in 1819 published in two volumes 4to ‘a geographical statistical and historical description of hindostan and the adjacent country’ according to lowndes’ ‘bibliographer’s manual’ “an inestimable compilation containing a more full detailed and faithful picture of the whole of india than any former work on the subject”  picture embellishment mr hamilton subsequently lived for a short period at no 8 rawstorne street which street divides no 27 a confectioner’s shop and no 28 the crown and sceptre brompton row opposite to the red lion a publichouse of which the peculiar and characteristic style of embellishment could scarcely have escaped notice at the time when the annexed sketch was made 1844 but which decoration was removed in 1849  soon after his return to his house in brompton row mr hamilton died there in july or august 1828  rawstorne street leads to montpellier square built about 1837  in this square no 11 resides mr f w fairholt the distinguished artist and antiquary to whose pencil and for much valuable information the editor of these pages is greatly indebted and no 38 may be mentioned as the residence of mr walter lacy the favourite actor  mrs liston the widow of the comedian resided at no 35 brompton row and no 45 was the residence of the ingenious count rumford the early patron of sir humphry davy  the count occupied it between the years 1799 and 1802 when he finally left england for france where he married the widow of the famous chemist lavoisier and died in 1814  count rumford’s name was benjamin thompson or thomson  he was a native of the small town of rumford now concord in new england and obtained the rank of major in the local militia  in the war with america he rendered important services to the officers commanding the british army and coming to england was employed by lord george germaine and rewarded with the rank of a provincial lieutenantcolonel which entitled him to halfpay  picture no 45 brompton row in 1784 he was knighted and officiated for a short time as one of the undersecretaries of state  he afterwards entered the service of the king of bavaria in which he introduced various useful reforms in the civil and military departments and for which he was promoted to the rank of lieutenantgeneral and created a count  at munich count rumford began those experiments for the improvements of fireplaces and the plans for the better feeding and regulation of the poor which have rendered his name familiar to every one      “as his own household hearth”  no 45 was distinguished some years ago by peculiar projecting windows now removed outside of the ordinary windows—an experimental contrivance by count rumford it is said for raising the temperature of his rooms  the same house in 1810 was inhabited by the rev william beloe the translator of herodotus and the author of various works between the years 1783 and 1812  in his last publication ‘the anecdotes of literature’ mr beloe says “he who has written and published not less than forty volumes which is my case may well congratulate himself first that providence has graciously spared him for so long a period secondly that sufficient health and opportunity have been afforded and lastly that he has passed through a career so extended and so perilous without being seriously implicated in personal or literary hostilities” it is strange that a man who could feel thus should immediately have entered upon the composition of a work which appeared as a posthumous publication in 1817 under the title of ‘the sexagenarian or the recollections of a literary life’ and which contains the following note—      “dr parr branded beloe as an ingrate and a slanderer  he says ‘the     worthy and enlightened archdeacon nares disdained to have any concern     in this infamous work’  the rev mr rennell of kensington could     know but little of beloe but having read his slanderous book mr     r who is a sound scholar an orthodox clergyman and a most     animated writer would have done well not to have written a sort of     postscript  from motives of regard and respect for beloe’s amiable     widow dr parr abstained from refuting b’s wicked falsehoods but     dr butler of shrewsbury repelled them very ably in the ‘monthly     review’”  at no 46 brompton row mr john reeve an exceedingly popular low comedian died on the 24th of january 1838 at the early age of forty social habits led to habits of intemperance and poor john was the bottle imp of every theatre he ever played in  “the last time i saw him” says mr bunn in his ‘journal of the stage’ “he was posting at a rapid rate to a city dinner and on his drawing up to chat i said ‘well reeve how do you find yourself today’ and he returned for answer ‘the lordmayor finds me today’”  brompton grove commences on the south or lefthand side of the main fulham road immediately beyond the red lion before mentioned as opposite to 28 brompton row and continues to the bunch of grapes publichouse which was pulled down in august and rebuilt in september 1844 opposite to no 54 brompton row and in the wall of which publichouse was placed a stone with “yeoman’s row 1767” engraved upon it—the name of a street leading to the “grange” and in 1794 the address of michael novosielski the architect of the italian opera house in that year he exhibited in the royal academy

but of novosielski and the grange more hereafter  brompton grove now consists of two rows of houses standing a little way back from the main road between which rows there was a green space 1811 now occupied by shops which range close to the footway and have a street called grove place in the centre  upper brompton grove or that division of the grove nearest london consists of seven houses of which no 4 was the abode of major shadwell clerke who has reflected literary lustre upon the ‘united service’ by the able and judicious manner in which he conducted for so many years the periodical journal distinguished by that name  major clerke died 19th april 1849  lower brompton grove consisted of three houses only in 1844 numbered 8 9 and 10 the 11 of former days being of superior size and once known as “grove house”  the 12 which stood a considerable way behind it as the “hermitage” and the 13 as the “house next to the bunch of grapes” all of which except no 8 claim a passing remark  in no 9 where he had long resided died on the 12th of august 1842 mr john sidney hawkins at the age of eightyfive  he was the eldest son of sir john hawkins the wellknown author of the ‘history of music’ and one of the biographers of dr johnson  mr hawkins was brother of letitia matilda hawkins the popular authoress and a lady of whom the elder disraeli once remarked that she was “the redeeming genius of her family”  mr hawkins however was an antiquary of considerable learning research and industry but his temper was sour and jealous and throughout his whole and long literary career from 1782 to 1814 he appears to have been embroiled in trifling disputes and immaterial vindications of his father or himself  no 10 brompton grove now occupied by the “sisters of compassion” was the residence of james petit andrews esq younger brother of sir joseph andrews bart and one of the magistrates of queen square police office a gentleman remarkable for his humane feelings as well as for his literary taste  his exertions following up those of jonas hanway were the occasion of procuring an act of parliament in favour of chimneysweep apprentices  mr andrews was the author of a volume of ancient and modern anecdotes in 1789 to which a supplemental volume appeared the following year  he also published a ‘history of great britain connected with the chronology of europe’ 45a and a continuation of henry’s ‘history of great britain’ 45b soon after the appearance of which he died on the 6th of august 1797  grove house called in 1809 and 1810 as already mentioned no 11 brompton

council of bengal and when proceeding to the east indies in the ‘valentine’ indiaman distinguished himself in an action with the french fleet in praya bay sir john who was a very large man to encourage the sailors to stand to their guns promised and paid them from his own pocket five guineas a man which coupled with his bravery during the action so pleased the seamen that one of them swore “his soul must be as big as his body” and the jokes occasioned by this burst of feeling terminated only with sir john macpherson’s life  “fine soles—soles a match for macpherson’s” was a brompton fishmonger’s greeting to sir john etc  in the neighbourhood of brompton he was known by the sobriquet of “the gentle giant” from his usually riding a very small pony flourishing in the most determined manner a huge oak stick over the little animal’s head but of course never touching it with his club  upon the afterdinner conversation at grove house of mr hugh boyd rests chiefly that gentleman’s claim to be considered as one of the many authors of ‘junius’  his host having temporarily retired from table boyd’s words were “that sir john macpherson little knew he was entertaining in his mansion a political writer whose sentiments were once the occasion of a chivalrous appeal from sir john to arms”—immediately adding “i am the author of ‘junius’”  the will of sir john macpherson is a remarkable document and contains the following tribute to the character of george iv—      “i conclude this my last will and testament in expressing my early     and unalterable admiration of his royal highness the prince of wales     the truly glorious reigning prince of the british empire and i     request my executors to wait upon his royal highness immediately     after my decease and to state to him as i do now that i have     bequeathed to his royal highness my celebrated antique statue of     minerva which he often admired with any one of my antique rings     that would please his royal highness  i likewise request you to     assure his royal highness that i will leave him certain papers which     prove to a demonstration that the glorious system which he has     realised for his country and the world in his difficult reign of     eight years was the early system of his heart and his ambition”  the large room on the east side of grove house shown in the annexed sketch was used as the drawingroom and measured thirtytwo feet by eighteen  it was built by sir john macpherson for the purpose of entertaining the prince regent  picture grove house from the east 1844  grove house was afterwards occupied by mr wilberforce who in his diary of the 2nd of july 1823 notes “took possession of our new house at brompton”  mr wilberforce remained there about a year and his successor in the tenancy was mr jerdan the agreeable and wellknown editor of the ‘literary gazette’ 1817–50  this house pulled down in 1846 stood upon the ground which now forms the road entrance to ovington square  a narrow lane which ran down by the west side of grove house led to the hermitage a retreat of the much admired madame catalani during her sojourn this country and subsequently converted into an asylum for insane persons  this building was pulled down in 1844 and grove place has been erected on its site  picture the hermitage 1844  in the house no 13 brompton grove which stood a little way back from the road between grove house and the grapes publichouse and which was taken down in december 1844 and in the previous june when sketched occupied by a stonemason mr banim lodged from may 1822 to october 1824  picture no 13 brompton grove 1844 while residing here he was engaged in contributing to and editing a shortlived weekly paper entitled the ‘literary register’ the first number of which appeared on the 6th of july 1822 and which publication terminated with the fortyfourth on the 3rd of may 1823 when banim devoted his attention to preparing the ‘tales of the o’hara family’ for the press  it is a remarkable local coincidence that gerald griffin who      “to his own mind had lived a mystery”  the contemporary rival of banim as an irish novelist and dramatist should have immediately succeeded him in the tenancy of “13 brompton grove” as this house was sometimes called      “about this period 1825 he griffin took quiet retired lodgings     at a house at brompton now a stonemason’s close by hermitage lane     which separated it from the then residence of the editor of the     ‘literary gazette’ and a literary intercourse rather than a personal     intimacy though of a most agreeable nature grew up between them”     48  on the 10th of november 1824 griffin writing to his brother commences a letter full of literary gossip with—      “since my last i have visited mr j several times  the last time     he wished me to dine with him which i happened not to be able to do     and was very sorry for it for his acquaintance is to me a matter of     great importance not only from the engine he wields—and a formidable     one it is being the most widelycirculated journal in europe—but     also because he is acquainted with all the principal literary     characters of the day and a very pleasant kind of man”  to the honest support of the ‘literary gazette’ at this critical period in griffin’s life may be ascribed the struggle which he made for fame and fortune through the blind path of literary distinction  he came a raw irish lad to the metropolis with indistinct visions of celebrity floating through his poetical mind or as he candidly confesses himself—      “a young gentleman totally unknown even to a single family in     london with a few pounds in one pocket and a brace of tragedies in     the other supposing that the one will set him up before the others     are exhausted” which he admits “is not a very novel but a very     laughable delusion”  banim’s kindness—his sympathy indeed for griffin deserves notice      “i cannot tell you here” writes the latter “the many many     instances in which banim has shown his friendship since i wrote last     let it suffice to say that he is the sincerest heartiest most     disinterested being that breathes  his fireside is the only one     where i enjoy anything like social life or home  i go out to     brompton grove occasionally in an evening and talk or read for some     hours or have a bed and leave next day”  again in a letter dated 31st of march 1824 griffin says—      “what would i have done if i had not found banim  i should have     instantly despaired on ’s treatment of me  i should never be     tired of talking about and thinking of banim  mark me he is a man     the only one i have met since i left ireland almost  we walked over     hyde park together on st patrick’s day and renewed our home     recollections by gathering shamrocks and placing them in our hats     even under the eye of john bull”  michael’s place on the same side of the

1836” says his medical attendant in a letter published in the memoirs of the colman family  but this is an error as on the 19th of october he appears to have written to mr bunn  the last earthly struggle of george colman has been thus described—      “it has never fallen to my lot to witness in the hour of death so     much serenity of mind such perfect philosophy or resignation more     complete  up to within an hour of his decease he was perfectly     sensible of his danger and bore excruciating pain with the utmost     fortitude      “at one period of his life a more popular man was not in existence”     observes mr bunn “for the festive board of the prince or the peer     was incomplete without mr colman  he has left behind him a     perpetuity of fame in his dramatic works

should say let me begin the evening with     sheridan and finish it with colman  sheridan for dinner colman for     supper  sheridan for claret or port but colman for everything from     the madeira and champagne at dinner the claret with a layer of port     between the glasses up to the punch of the night and down to the     grog or ginandwater of daybreak  sheridan was a grenadier company     of lifeguards but colman a whole regiment—of light infantry to be     sure but still a regiment’”  the sale of colman’s effects took place on the 29th of november 1837 among the pictures sold was the wellknown portrait of george colman the elder by sir joshua reynolds which has been engraved another by gainsborough also engraved a third in crayons by rosalba and a fourth by zoffani which formerly

architect was mr donaldson and the first stone was laid in october 1826  on the 6th of june 1829 the bishop of london consecrated this church and its burialground which had been a flowergarden  when the first grave was made in the month following many of the flowers still appeared among the grass and after viewing it miss landon wrote the following verses  the “first grave” is in the extreme southwest of the corner churchyard close to the narrow pathway that skirts the wall leaving only space for a grave between the inscription on the stone which originally marked the “first grave” was—                                      sacred                                to the memory of                                 mr iohn corpe                                 of this parish

the only one       in this unbroken ground    where yet the garden leaf and flower       are lingering around    a single grave—my heart has felt       how utterly alone    in crowded halls where breathed for me       not one familiar tone     “the shade where foresttrees shut out       all but the distant sky—    i’ve felt the loneliness of night       when the dark winds pass’d by    my pulse has quicken’d with its awe       my lip has gasp’d for breath    but what were they to such as this—       the solitude of death     “a single grave—we half forget       how sunder human ties    when round the silent place of rest       a gather’d kindred lies    we stand beneath the haunted yew       and watch each quiet tomb    and in the ancient churchyard feel       solemnity not gloom     “the place is purified with hope—       the hope that is of prayer    and human love and heavenward thought       and pious faith are there    the wild flowers spring amid the grass       and many a stone appears    carved by affection’s memory       wet with affection’s tears     “the golden chord which binds us all       is loosed not rent in twain    and love and hope and fear unite       to bring the past again    but this grave is so desolate       with no remembering stone    no fellowgraves for sympathy—       ’tis utterly alone     “i do not know who sleeps beneath       his history or name    whether if lonely in his life       he is in death the same—    whether he died unloved unmourn’d       the last leaf on the bough    or if some desolated hearth       is weeping for him now     “perhaps this is too fanciful       though single be his sod    yet not the less it has around       the presence of his god    it may be weakness of the heart       but yet its kindliest best    better if in our selfish world       it could be less repress’d     “those gentler charities which draw       man closer with his kind    those sweet humilities which make       the music which they find    how many a bitter word ’t would hush       how many a pang ’t would save    if life more precious held those ties       which sanctify the grave”  now 1860 the gravestone has received two additional inscriptions and the character of the upright stone has been altered  picture reeve’s grave corpe was a ladies’ shoemaker and his son carried on that business at no 126 mount street berkeley square after the father’s death  while sketching the grave the sexton came up and observed “no one has ever noticed that grave sir before so much as to draw it out for a pattern as i suppose you are doing”  john reeve’s grave “alas poor yorick” is in the first avenue at the back of the church to the left hand and immediately at the edge of the path that runs parallel with the north side of the building  the stone which is similar to others in the same vicinity is inscribed—                                    in memory                                       of

1851  it was opened on the 24th june 1857 and is a result of the school of design founded at somerset house in 1838  it is the headquarters of the government department of science and art previously deposited in marlborough house which is under the management of mr henry cole  the collections are temporarily placed in a range of boilerroofed buildings hence the term “brompton boilers” has been applied to them  there are specimens here of ornamental art an architectural trade and economical museum a court of modern sculpture and the gallery of british art founded on the munificent gift of mr john sheepshanks  mr sheepshanks having bestowed on the nation a collection of 234 oil paintings mostly by modern british artists and some drawings etc the whole formed by himself including some of the most popular works of wilkie mulready sir edwin landseer leslie and other eminent artists of the english school  to these have been since added in several large rooms the turner collection and the pictures from the vernon gallery also the collection bequeathed to the nation by the late mr jacob bell and the pictures by british artists removed from the national gallery all which are well lighted from the roof  the objects of ornamental art consist of medieval furniture and decoration painted glass plaster casts electrotype copies photographs engravings and drawings etc the whole designed with the view of aiding general education and of diffusing among all classes those principles of science and art which are calculated to advance the individual interests of the country and to elevate the character of the people facilities are afforded for taking copies of objects upon application at the art library  the educational collections formed by the government which are in the central portion of the building comprise specimens of scientific instruments objects of natural history models casts and a library refreshment and waiting rooms are provided and there are lectures delivered in a

the floor to the roof  along the aisles galleries run access to which is obtained by two large central staircases at the ends of the building which is for the most part lighted from the roofs there is ample ventilation and by means of hot water pipes the building is heated when required  the exhibition space in floor and galleries is nearly one acre and a half exclusive of the wall space in the galleries and aisles  the arrangement it may be seen from this description is much the same as that adopted in the great exhibition of 1851  there are separate catalogues for each department to be had which give the visitor all necessary information  the building was constructed from designs and drawings prepared by messrs charles d young and co of great george street westminster  opposite the museum is thurloe place  no 1 may be mentioned as the residence of mr henry holl well known some years ago as the light comedian of the haymarket theatre  that gentleman has now retired from the profession but in addition to some dramatic productions written many years since he is the author of two or three successful pieces recently produced  it is not the intention of the writer to follow the course of the old brompton road but he will at once return to the main road after alluding to the newlyformed magnificent approaches from this point to kensington by exhibition road and prince albert’s road on the site of brompton park now broken up 62  a winter garden is in course of formation here and the horticultural society intend to appropriate part of the ground for their annual fêtes  the total amount expended on the purchase and laying out of the kensington gore estate from 1851 to 1856 inclusive was £277309     chapter ii   from the bell and horns brompton to little chelsea  to return to the continuation of michael’s place  it is divided between nos 11 and 12 by michael’s grove which led to brompton grange for some years the seat of the favourite veteran vocalist braham who made his appearance as a public singer at the age of ten years and so far back as 1787  the grange was taken down in october 1843 and in the course of twelve months its spacious grounds were covered by a decided crescent and other buildings  brompton grange which was constructed by novosielski for his own residence was previous to mr braham’s tenancy occupied by a gentleman of large fortune and weak nerves which were most painfully affected by the tone of a bell  after considerable research this spot was selected for his london residence in the belief that there he would be secure from annoyance  but the folly of human anticipation was speedily illustrated by the building of brompton church on the north side of his abode and of chelsea new church on the west so that whatever way the wind blew      “the sound of the churchgoing bell”  was certain of being wafted to the grange which was got rid of in consequence  from michael’s grove brompton crescent is nearly a straight row of twentyfive houses and forms an angle to the line of the main fulham road uniting with michael’s place at “crescent house” where the carriage communication was formerly interrupted by a bar in place of which a post supporting two lamps is now substituted  no 9 was for some time in the occupation of dr oswald wood the translator 1835 of von hammer’s ‘history of the assassins’ and who died at the early age of thirtyeight on the 5th of november 1842 in the west indies where he held the appointment of provostmarshal of antigua  at no 13 brompton crescent resided charles incledon the rival of his neighbour braham whose singing he was wont to designate as “italianised humbug” declaring that no one but himself charles incledon knew how to sing a british ballad and it must be admitted that “the storm” and “blackeyed susan” as sung by incledon produced a deep impression on the public mind  he was a native of cornwall and the son of a medical gentleman  as a chorister under the tuition of jackson in exeter cathedral incledon acquired his knowledge of music for when he was fifteen he entered the royal navy in which he served in the west indies from 1779 to 1783 when he abandoned the naval profession and joined a theatrical company at southampton  after a popular professional career of upwards of forty years as a public singer incledon died at worcester on the 11th of february 1826  of incledon many amusing anecdotes are told chiefly caused by his inordinate vanity and his mental singleness of purpose  he thought of no one but himself he saw nothing beyond the one and immediate object at which he grasped and yet these faults were caused rather by natural weakness of intellect than by an unkind or selfish disposition  in fact incledon lived and died a petted servant of the public which administered intoxicating draughts of applause to his selfesteem  mr g rodwell already mentioned as having been an inhabitant of no 14 brompton row resided at no 15 brompton crescent in 1830  no 20 brompton crescent was between the years 1822 and 1844 occupied by mr planché well known as perhaps the most prolific and skilful dramatic writer of the day and as a gentleman of high literary and antiquarian attainments  his connexion with the last musical efforts of the german composer weber in his opera of ‘oberon’ which was produced at covent garden on the 12th of may 1826 65 cannot be forgotten and to planché’s knowledge of costume and taste for pictorial effects the english stage is deeply indebted  in the drawingroom of this house have some of our most agreeable acting dramas been composed and nothing could have been in its style and appointments more typical of planché’s dialogue than was the apartment—smart and neat fit for all occasions and suited in a moment to the present purpose whatever that might be it was polished and elegant but there was nothing superfluous beyond a bit of exquisite china on the mantelpiece or a picture excellent in its way on the wall something which pleased the eye and which the mind received and relished like a nicelypointed joke  a wellpainted portrait of planché himself by briggs the royal academician which has been engraved hung opposite to the fireplace and as if to carry out the similitude between planché’s writings and the place where they were written foldingdoors revealed a back drawingroom which like his memory was richly stored with the works of heralds and antiquaries and of our elder dramatists and poets so judiciously arranged that in a moment he was certain of producing the precise passage or the effect which he desired  at the same time so completely was this little battery of knowledge masked under quaint bindings and tasteful covers that no one suspected what a mine of learning lay beneath nor like his own mental resources was a volume displayed without cause or unclasped without its effect  speaking earnestly to planché respecting the pains and pleasures of authorship l e l once said “i would give this moment all the fame of what i have written or ever shall write for one roar of applause from a crowded house such as you must have heard a thousand times”  mr planché afterwards removed to a new and detached house built on the site of brompton grange  he has now quitted the neighbourhood  mr c j richardson an architect whose publications illustrative of tudor architecture and domestic english antiquities have materially tended to diffuse a feeling of respect for the works of our ancestors and to forward the growing desire to preserve and restore edifices which time and circumstances have spared to the country has resided at no 22 brompton crescent  at no 28 in this crescent mrs liston died in 1854  the continuation of michael’s place which we left on our right to visit michael’s grove and brompton crescent is the corner house now dr cahill’s and mr hewett’s  at no 12 lewis schiavonetti a distinguished engraver died on the 7th of june 1810 at the age of fiftyfive  he was a native of bassano in the venetian territory and the eldest son of a stationer whose large family and moderate circumstances made him gladly accept the offer of julius golini a painter of some repute to receive his son at the age of thirteen for instruction in the arts  picture no 12 michael’s place in three years after golini expired in the arms of his youthful pupil  upon the death of his master he determined to seek the patronage of count remaudini who had given employment to bartolozzi and volpato and began to study the mechanical process of engraving under a poor man named lorio who unable to support himself by his profession officiated as sacristan to a church and could offer him no better accommodation for study than the sacristy  the circumstances of schiavonetti not permitting him to seek for higher instruction he remained with this master about twelve months when finding that he had learned all that poor lorio was able to teach and feeling an aversion to work occasionally among dead bodies he determined to alter his situation  a copy of a ‘holy family’ from bartolozzi after carlo maratta gained schiavonetti immediate employment from count remaudini and attracted the notice of suntach an engraver and printseller in opposition to remaudini  about this time there came to bassano a mr testolini of vicenza a wretched engraver of architecture but a man of consummate craft and address  he became acquainted with schiavonetti at suntach’s and finding in his genius and tractable disposition a tool which he could use to great advantage he engaged him to work at his house bartolozzi’s engravings in the chalk manner were then in great repute at bassano and testolini made several abortive attempts to discover the process  his young friend succeeded better and imitated several of bartolozzi’s prints to perfection and testolini took some of schiavonetti’s productions to the son of bartolozzi at venice and passed them off as his own  they gained him an introduction to that artist and an invitation to london where he was then in full occupation and his works highly appreciated  the change of climate seems to have deteriorated the talents of testolini but such was his adroitness that he gained a complete ascendancy over the easy temper of bartolozzi and lived in his house at north end fulham about three years  during that time finding that yet more important advantages might be derived from the aid of his former friend he made several propositions to schiavonetti to come to london  these were for a time declined the rising fame of the young artist caused his talents to be better appreciated and some venetian noblemen offered him a pension and constant employment if he would abandon his proposed emigration testolini to frustrate this induced bartolozzi to write a letter of persuasion partly dictated by himself and confident of its effect he set out for italy to bring schiavonetti over  during his absence bartolozzi gained an insight into his real character and interested views and on his return with his protégé told him that his house was no longer open to him but that schiavonetti was welcome to consider it his home  testolini however having found a house in sloane square soon persuaded schiavonetti that it would be better for him to follow his fortune than to remain with bartolozzi to which schiavonetti consented this circumstance terminated the connexion between bartolozzi and schiavonetti and shortly after the reputation of the latter as an engraver became established in london where he conducted every transaction he was engaged in with an uprightness and integrity that cause his memory to be equally respected as a gentleman and as an artist the ‘madre dolorosa’ after vandyke the portrait of that master in the character of paris michael angelo’s cartoon of the ‘surprise of the soldiers on the banks of the arno’ a series of etchings from designs by blake illustrative of blair’s ‘grave’ with a portrait of blake after phillips the ‘landing of the british troops in egypt’ from de loutherbourg and the etching of the ‘canterbury pilgrims’ from stothard’s admired picture are some of the most esteemed works of lewis schiavonetti  his funeral which took place on the 14th june 1810 from michael’s place was attended by west the president phillips tresham and other members of the royal academy by his countryman vendramini and almost all the distinguished engravers of the day with other artists and friends to art  the greater portion of no 13 michael’s place is shown in the sketch of no 12 and the former may be mentioned as the residence of the widow of the builder madame novosielski who died here on the 30th november 1820  this was the address of miss helen faucit immediately previous to her successful appearance in the english drama before a french audience and is at present in the occupation of mr weigall an artist whose works are highly prized  mrs billington the wellknown singer and actress has resided at no 15  miss pope an actress of considerable reputation died at no 17 michael’s place on the 30th july 1818 aged seventyfive  her talents had been cultivated by the celebrated mrs clive and she was distinguished by the notice of garrick  as a representative of old women miss pope is said to have been unrivalled and for more than half a century she remained constant to the boards of drury lane theatre never having performed at any other with the exception of a season at dublin and another at liverpool  mr john heneage jesse in 1842 while engaged in the publication of ‘memoirs of the court of england from the revolution of 1688 to the death of george ii’ 3 vols 8vo a continuation of his ‘history of the court of england during the reign of the stuarts’ lodged at no 18  mr yates the manager of the adelphi theatre and an actor of considerable and varied powers resided at no 21 michael’s place immediately previous to his accepting a short engagement in ireland where he ruptured a bloodvessel and returned to england in so weak a state that he died on the 21st june 1842 a few days after his arrival at the euston hotel euston square from whence it was considered when he reached london imprudent to remove him to brompton  he was in the fortyfifth year of his age and made his first appearance in london at covent garden on the 7th november 1818  on the 30th november 1823 mr yates married miss brunton an exemplary woman and an accomplished actress who had retired from the profession for some years previous to her death aged 61 on 30th august 1860  before mr yates’ tenancy no 21 was the residence of mr liston whose comic humour will long be remembered on the stage  mrs davenport a clever actress and an admirable representative of old women died at no 22 on 8th may 1843 aged eightyfour  on the 25th of may 1830 she retired from the stage after an uninterrupted service of thirtysix years at covent garden theatre where she took her “first last and only benefit” performing the nurse in ‘romeo and juliet’  no 25 michael’s place may be pointed out as the house in which miss pope “the other delicious old woman” dwelt previous to her removal to no 17 and no 26 as the lodgings of mrs mathews when occupied in the composition of the ‘memoirs’ of her husband 72 the eminent comedian—     “a man so various that he seemed to be    not one but all mankind’s epitome”  at no 33 died madame delille in 1857 at an advanced age  this lady was the mother of the late mr c j delille professor of the french language in christ’s hospital and in the city of london school and french examiner in the university of london  mr delille’s french grammar is universally adopted by schools in addition to his ‘répertoire littéraire’ and his ‘leçons et modèles de poésie française’  the ground upon which michael’s place and brompton crescent are built was known by the name of “flounder field” from its usual moist and muddy state  this field contained fourteen acres and is said to have been part of the estate of alderman henry smith which in this neighbourhood was upwards of eightyfour acres  he was a native of wandsworth where he is buried  it has been asserted that from very humble circumstances he rose to be an alderman of london—from circumstances so humble indeed that salmon in his ‘antiquities of surrey’ mentions that he had been in early life whipped out of mitcham parish for begging there  being a widower and without children he made over all his estates in 1620 to trustees for charitable purposes reserving out of the produce £500 ayear for himself  he died in 1627–8 and the intent of his will appears to have been to divide his estate equally between the poorest of his kindred and in case of any surplus it was to be applied to the relief and ransom of poor captives  mr smith is said but we know little of the history of this benevolent and extraordinary man to have himself suffered a long captivity in algiers  no application having been made for many years to redeem captives in 1772 an act of parliament was passed “to enable the trustees of henry smith esq deceased to apply certain sums of money to the relief of his poor kindred and to enable the said trustees to grant building leases of an estate in the parishes of kensington chelsea and st margaret’s westminster”  no 1 north terrace leading into alexander square was for some time the residence of the celebrated “o” smith who though a great ruffian upon the stage was in private life remarkable for his quiet manners and his varied attainments  at the end of this terrace is the western grammar school  alexander square on the north or righthand side of the main fulham road between the bell and horns publichouse and pelham crescent consists of twentyfour houses built in the years 1827 and 1830 and divided by alfred place before each portion there is a respectable enclosure and behind numerous new streets squares and houses have been built extending to the old brompton road  no 19 alexander square was the residence of captain glascock who commanded hms tyne and whose pen has enriched the nautical novel literature of england 73 with the same racy humour which has distinguished his professional career  when commanding in the douro some communications which glascock had occasion to make to the governor of oporto not having received that attention which the english captain considered was due to them and the governor having apologised for his deafness glascock replied that in future he would write to his excellency  he did so but the proceeding did not produce the required reply  glascock was then told that the governor’s memory was defective so he wrote again and two letters remained unanswered  in this state of things it was intimated to captain glascock by a distinguished diplomatist that as his letters might not have been delivered he ought to write another  “certainly” replied that officer “my letters to his excellency as you say might not have been delivered for i have had no report absolutely made to me that they had ever reached his hands but i will take care this time there shall be no mistake in the delivery for you shall see me attach my communication to a cannonball the report of which i can testify to my government and as my gunner is a sure shot his excellency will glascock was an irishman have my epistle delivered into his hand”  this intimation produced at once the desired effect of a satisfactory reply and apology  captain glascock was one of the inspectors under the poor relief act in ireland  he died in 1847  no 24 alexander square is the residence of mr george godwin the editor of the ‘builder’ and one of the honorary secretaries of the art union—an association which has exercised an important influence upon the progress of the fine arts in england  mr godwin is likewise favourably known to the public as the author of several essays which evince considerable professional knowledge antiquarian research and a fertile fancy  the bend of the fulham road terminates at

branching off at each side of the tavern  since this sketch was taken the old building has been pulled down 1856 and a large hotel erected on the same spot by b watts where in addition to the usual comforts of an inn hot and cold baths may be had  in 1818 the admiral keppel courted the custom of passing travellers by a poetical appeal to the feelings of both man and beast—     “stop brave boys

crescent  here it was with the exception of a short excursion to ireland that curran had resided during the twelve months previous to his death  picture no 7 amelia place curran’s public life may be said to have terminated in 1806 when he accepted the office of master of the rolls in ireland an appointment of £5000 a year  this situation he retained until 1815 when his health required a cessation from its laborious attendance  upon his retirement from office he “passed through the wateringplaces with the season” and then fixed himself at no 7 amelia place brompton which house has now kettle’s boot and shoe warehouse built out in front  to no other contemporary pen than that of the rev george croly can be ascribed the following glowing sketch of curran—      “from the period in which curran emerged from the first struggles of     an unfriended man labouring up a jealous profession his history     makes a part of the annals of his country once upon the surface his     light was always before the eye it never sank and was never     outshone  with great powers to lift himself beyond the reach of that     tumultuous and stormy agitation that must involve the movers of the     public mind in a country such as ireland then was he loved to cling     to the heavings of the wave he at least never rose to that     tranquil elevation to which his early contemporaries had one by one     climbed and never left the struggle till the storm had gone down it     is to be hoped for ever  this was his destiny but it might have     been his choice and he was not without the reward which to an     ambitious mind conscious of its eminent powers might be more than     equivalent to the reluctant patronage of the throne  to his habits     legal distinction would have been only a bounty upon his silence his     limbs would have been fettered by the ermine but he had the     compensation of boundless popular honour much respect from the     higher ranks of party much admiration and much fear from the lower     partizans  in parliament he was the assailant most dreaded in the     lawcourts he was the advocate deemed the most essential in both he     was an object of all the more powerful passions of man but rivalry—                        ‘he stood alone and shone alone’”  during curran’s residence in amelia place he suffered two slight apoplectic attacks but he nevertheless “occasionally indulged in society and was to his last sparkle the most interesting singular and delightful of all table companions”  the forenoon he generally passed in a solitary ramble through the neighbouring fields and gardens which have now disappeared and in the evening he enjoyed the conversation of a few friends but though the brilliancy of his wit shone to the last he seemed like one who had outlived everything in life that was worth enjoying  this is exemplified in curran’s melancholy repartee to his medical attendant a few days before his decease  the doctor remarked that his patient’s cough was not improved  “that is odd” remarked curran “for i have been practising all night”  on thursday the 9th of october curran dined abroad for the last time with mr richard “gentleman” jones 78 of no 14 chapel street grosvenor place for the purpose of being introduced to george colman “the younger”  the party besides the host and hostess consisted of mr harris and sir william chatterton  colman that evening was unusually brilliant anticipating by apt quotation and pointed remark almost everything that curran would have said  one comment of curran’s however made a deep impression on all present  speaking of lord byron’s ‘fare thee well and if for ever’ he observed that “his lordship first weeps over his wife and then wipes his eyes with the newspapers”  he left the dinnertable early and on going upstairs to coffee either affected not to know or did not remember george colman’s celebrity as a wit and inquired of mrs jones who that mr colman was  mr harris joined them at this moment and apologised for his friend colman engrossing so much of the conversation to himself adding that he was the spoiled child of society and that even the prince regent listened with attention when george colman talked  “ay” said curran with a melancholy smile “i now know who colman is we must both sleep in the same bed”  the next morning curran was seized with apoplexy and continued speechless though in possession of his senses till the early part of tuesday the 14th when he sunk into lethargy and towards evening died without a struggle so tranquil indeed were the last moments of curran that those in the room were unable to mark the precise time when his bright spirit passed away from this earth  his age has been variously stated at sixtyseven sixtyeight and seventy  the first lodging which john banim the irish novelist temporarily occupied in england april 1822 was in the house where his illustrious countryman had breathed his last and from whence banim removed to 13 brompton grove as already noticed  banim’s first wish when he found himself in england was to visit the scene of curran’s death led to the spot by a strong feeling of patriotic admiration and finding by a bill in the window that lodgings were to be let there he immediately took them “that he might dream of his country” as he energetically told the writer “with the halo of curran’s memory

upper robert street as being the continuation of robert street chelsea but under some notion of raising its respectability the inhabitants agreed to change the name  it happened however that the corner house adjoining the fulham road on the western side was occupied by a surgeon who imagined that the change in name might be injurious to his practice and he took advantage of his position to retain the old name on his house  thus for some time the street was known by both names but that of upper robert street is now entirely abandoned  the opposite corner house no 2 sydney street was for

in consequence of overmental excitement the sum of £8000 was voted by parliament upon the motion of mr whitbread for the purchase of mr hargrave’s law books which were enriched with valuable notes and for 300 mss to be deposited in the library of lincoln’s inn for public use  as documents of national historical importance may be particularised mr hargrave’s first publication in 1772 entitled ‘the case of james somerset a negro lately determined by the court of king’s bench wherein it is attempted to demonstrate the present unlawfulness of domestic slavery in england’ his ‘three arguments in the two causes in chancery on the last will of peter thellusson esq with mr morgan’s calculation of the accumulation under the trusts of the will 1799’ and his ‘opinion in the case of the duke of athol in respect to the isle of man’  opposite to york place was a fine open airy piece of ground to which mr curtis the eminent naturalist removed his botanical garden from lambeth marsh as a more desirable locality  upon the southeast portion of this nurseryground the first stone was laid by hrh prince albert on the 11th july 1844 of an hospital for consumption and diseases of the chest and which was speedily surrounded by houses on all sides probably a circumstance not contemplated at the time the ground was secured  the botanical garden of mr curtis as a public resort for study was continued at brompton until 1808 when the lease of the land being nearly expired mr salisbury who in 1792 became his pupil and in 1798 his partner in this horticultural speculation removed the establishment to the vacant space of ground now inclosed between sloane street and cadogan place where mr salisbury’s undertaking failed  a plan of the gardens there as arranged by him was published in the ‘gentleman’s magazine’ for august 1810 85  mr curtis whose death has been already mentioned was the son of a tanner and was born at alton in hampshire in 1746  he was bound apprentice to his grandfather a quaker apothecary of that town whose house was contiguous to the crown inn where the botanical knowledge of john lagg the hostler seems to have excited rivalry in the breast of young curtis  in the course of events he became assistant to mr thomas talwin an apothecary in gracechurch street of the same religious persuasion as his grandfather and succeeded mr talwin in his business mr curtis’s love of botanical science however increased with his knowledge  he connected with it the study of entomology by printing in 1771 ‘instructions for collecting and preserving insects’ and in the following year a translation of the ‘fundamenta entomologiæ’ of linnæus at this time he rented a very small garden for the cultivation of british plants “near the grange road at the bottom of bermondsey street” and here it was that he conceived the design of publishing his great work ‘the flora londinensis’      “the grange road garden was soon found too small for his extensive     ideas  he therefore took a larger piece of ground in lambeth     marsh where he soon assembled the largest collection of british     plants ever brought together into one place  but there was something     uncongenial in the air of this place which made it extremely     difficult to preserve sea plants and many of the rare annuals which     are adapted to an elevated situation—an evil rendered worse every     year by the increased number of buildings around  this led his     active mind ever anxious for improvement to inquire for a more     favourable soil and purer air  this at length he found at     brompton  here he procured a spacious territory in which he had the     pleasure of seeing his wishes gratified to the utmost extent of     reasonable expectation  here he continued to his death”  having i may add for many years previously devoted himself entirely to botanical pursuits  to support the slow sale of ‘the flora londinensis’ mr curtis about 1787 started ‘the botanical magazine’ which became one of the popular periodicals of the day and dr smith’s and mr sowerby’s ‘english botany’ was modelled after it  what mr curtis as an individual commenced the horticultural society are endeavouring as a body to effect  immediately past the hospital for consumption is fowlis terrace a row of newlybuilt houses running from the road  at the corner of church street on the opposite side of the road is an enclosure used as the burialground of the westminster congregation of the jews  there is an inscription in hebrew characters over the entrance above which is an english inscription with the date of the erection of the building according to the jewish computation am 5576 or 1816 ad  beside it is the milestone denoting that it is 1½ mile from london  the queen’s elm turnpike pulled down in 1848 was situated here and took its name from the tradition that queen elizabeth when walking out attended by lord burleigh 87a being overtaken by a heavy shower of rain found shelter here under an elmtree  after the rain was over the queen said “let this henceforward be called the queen’s tree”  the tradition is strongly supported by the parish records of chelsea as mention is made in 1586 the 28th of elizabeth and probably the year of the occurrence of a tree situated about this spot “at the end of the duke’s walk” 87b as “the queen’s tree” around which an arbour was built or in other words nine young elmtrees were planted by one bostocke at the charge of the parish  the first mention of “the queen’s elm” occurs in 1687 ninetynine years after her majesty had sheltered beneath the tree around which “an arbour was built” when the surveyors of the highway were amerced in the sum of five pounds “for not sufficiently mending the highway from the queen elm to the bridge and from the elm to church lane”  in a plan of chelsea from a survey made in 1664 by james hamilton and continued to 1717 a tree occupying the spot assigned to “the queen’s elm” is called “the cross tree” and in the vestry minutes it is designated as “the high elm” which latter name is used by sir hans sloane in 1727  bostocke’s arbour however had the effect of giving to the crossroad the name of “the nine elms”  steele on the 22nd june 1711 writing to his wife says “pray on the receipt of this go to the nine elms and i will follow you within an hour” 88 and so late as 1805 “the nine elms chelsea” appeared as a local address in newspaper advertisements  again let me crave indulgence for minute attention to the changes of name but much topographical difficulty often arises from this cause  the stump of the royal tree with as is asserted its root remaining in the ground undisturbed a few years ago existed squared down to the dimensions of an ordinary post about six feet in height and whitewashed but the identity appears questionable although a post not improbably fashioned out of one of the nine elms which grew around it stood till within the last few years in front of a publichouse named from the circumstance the queen’s elm which house has been a little altered since the annexed sketch was made by the introduction of a clock between the second floor windows and the house adjoining has been rebuilt overtopping it  picture queen’s elm public house  on the opposite or north side of the fulham road some small houses are called selwood place from being built on part of the ground of “mr selwood’s nursery” which is mentioned in 1712 by mr narcissus luttrell of whom more hereafter as one of the sources from which he derived a variety of pear cultivated by him in his garden at little chelsea  chelsea park on the same side of the way with the queen’s elm publichouse and distant about a furlong from it as seen from the road appears a noble structure with a magnificent portico  picture chelsea park portico the ground now called chelsea park belonged with an extensive tract of which it formed the northern part to the famous sir thomas more and in his time was unenclosed and termed “the sand hills” it received the present name in 1625 when the lordtreasurer cranfield earl of middlesex surrounded with a brick wall about thirtytwo acres which he had purchased in 1620 from mr blake  in 1717 chelsea park which extended from the fulham to the king’s road was estimated at forty acres and belonged to the marquis of wharton with whom when appointed in 1709 lordlieutenant of ireland addison went over as secretary  it subsequently became the scene of a jointstock company speculation under a patent granted in 1718 to john appletree esq for producing raw silk of the growth of england and for raising a fund for carrying on the same  this undertaking was divided into shares of £5 each of which £1 was paid down  proposals were published a subscriptionbook opened in which several hundred names were soon entered a deed of trust executed and enrolled in chancery directors were chosen by the subscribers for managing the affairs of the company and chelsea park being thought a proper soil for the purpose and in a convenient situation a lease was taken of it for 122 years  here upwards of 2000 mulberrytrees were soon planted and extensive edifices erected for carrying on the work this number of trees was however but a small part of what the company intended to plant if they were successful  in the following year mr henry barham frs who was probably a member of the company published ‘an essay on the silk worm’ in which he thinks “all objections and difficulties against this glorious undertaking are shown to be mere phantoms and trifles”  the event however proved that the company met with difficulties of a real and formidable nature for though the expectation of this gentleman who questioned not that in the ensuing year they should produce a considerable quantity of raw silk may have been partly answered the undertaking soon began to decline and in the course of a few years came to nothing  it must however be admitted that the violent stockjobbing speculations of the year 1720 which involved the shares of all projects of this nature might have produced many changes among the proprietors and contributed to derange the original design  however from that period to the present time no effort has been made to cultivate the silkworm in this country as a mercantile speculation although individuals have continued to rear it with success as an object of curiosity  walpole in his ‘catalogue of engravers’ tells us that james christopher le blon a fleming by birth and a mezzotintengraver by profession some time subsequent to 1732 “set up a project for copying the cartoons in tapestry and made some very fine drawings for that purpose  houses were built and looms erected in the mulberry ground at chelsea but either the expense was precipitated too fast or contributions did not arrive fast enough  the bubble burst several suffered and le blon was heard of no more”  walpole adds “it is said he died in an hospital at paris in 1740” and observes that le blon was “very far from young when he knew him but of surprising vivacity and volubility and with a head admirably mechanic but an universal projector and with at least one of the qualities that attend that vocation either a dupe or a cheat i think” he continues “the former though as most of his projects ended in air the sufferers believed the latter  as he was much an enthusiast perhaps like most enthusiasts he was both one and t’ other”  the present mansion was built upon a portion of chelsea park by mr william broomfield an eminent surgeon who resided in it for several years  the late possessor was sir henry wright wilson bart to whose wife lady frances wilson daughter of the earl of aylesbury was left a valuable estate in hampshire 92 said to be worth about £3000 a year under the following very singular circumstances  her ladyship was informed one morning in february 1814 while at breakfast that an eccentric person named wright who had died a few days previously at an obscure lodging in pimlico had appointed her and mr charles abbott his executors and after some legacies had bequeathed to lady frances the residue of his property by a will dated so far back as august 1800  as lady frances declared herself to be unacquainted even with the name of the testator she at first concluded that there was some mistake in the matter  after further explanation the person of mr wright was described to her and lady frances at last recollected that the description answered that of a gentleman she had remembered as a constant frequenter of the opera some years previously and considered to be a foreigner and who had annoyed her extremely there by constantly staring at her box  to satisfy herself of the identity she went to the lodgings of the late mr wright and saw him in his coffin when she recognized the features perfectly as those of the person whose eyes had so often persecuted her when she was lady frances bruce but who had never spoken to her and of whom she had no other knowledge whatever  mr wright left legacies of £4000 to the countess of rosslyn £4000 to the speaker of the house of commons £1000 to the lordchancellor and the same sum to archdeacon pott the rector of st martininthefields which church mr wright had been in the habit of frequenting having as little acquaintance with any of these parties as he had with lady frances wilson  it may be supposed from these facts that lady frances wilson was exceedingly beautiful and that an admiration of her charms might have influenced mr wright to make this extraordinary bequest in her favour but those who knew lady frances well assert that such could not possibly have been the case as she was far from beautiful at any period of her life and the oddity of the story is and it seemed to be the general opinion that mr wright’s legacy was intended for a lady who usually occupied a box next to that in which lady frances sat and who at the period was regarded as the belle of the opera  thistle grove on the opposite side of the road from chelsea park leads by what had been a garden pathway to the old brompton road  at each side of “the grove” now occupying the sites of trees are detached villas houses lodges and cottages named or not named after the taste of their respective proprietors one of which on the left hand some fourteen houses distant from the main fulham road was for many years the residence of mr john burke whose laborious heraldic and genealogical inquiries induced him to arrange and publish various important collections relative to the peerage and family history of the united kingdom in which may be found condensed for immediate reference an immense mass of important information  in thistle grove mr j p warde the wellknown actor died in 1840  immediately beyond chelsea park the village of little chelsea commences about the centre of which and on the same side of the way at the corner of the road leading to battersea bridge stands the goat in boots publichouse  picture goat in boots in 1663 there was a “house called the goat at little chelsea” which between that year and 1713 enjoyed the right of commonage for two cows and one heifer upon chelsea heath  how the goat became equipped in boots and the designation of the house changed has been the subject of various conjectures the most probable of which is that it originates in a corruption of the latter part of the dutch legend—      “mercurius is der goden boode”     mercury is the messenger of the gods  which being divided between each side of a sign bearing the figure of mercury—a sign commonly used in the early part of the last century to denote that posthorses were to be obtained—“der goden boode” became freely translated into english “the goat in boots”  to le blon is attributed the execution of this sign and its motto but whoever the original artist may have been and the intermediate retouchers or repainters of the god certain it is that the pencil of morland in accordance with the desire of the landlord either transformed the petasus of mercury into the horned head of a goat his talaria into spurs upon boots of huge dimensions and his caduceus into a cutlass or thus decorated the original sign thereby liquidating a score which he had run up here without any other means of payment than what his pencil afforded  the sign however has been painted over with considerable additional embellishments from gold leaf so that not the least trace of morland’s work remains except perhaps in the outline  park walk the road turning off at the goat in boots proceeds to the king’s road and although not in a direct line to battersea bridge opposite the goat in boots is gilston road

general riego “the restorer and martyr of spanish freedom”  her short and eventful history possesses more than ordinary melancholy  while yet a child she had to endure all the hardships and privations consequent upon a state of warfare and under the protection of her maternal grandfather had to seek refuge from place to place on the mountains of asturias from the french army  at the close of 1821 she was married to general riego to whom she had been known and attached almost from infancy and in the spring of the following year became with her distinguished husband a resident in madrid  but the political confusion and continued alarm of the period having appeared to affect her health the general proceeded with her in the autumn to granada where he parted from his young and beloved wife never again to meet her in this world the convocation of the extraordinary cortes for october 1822 obliging him to return to the capital  accompanied by the canon riego brother to her husband and her attached sister donna lucie she removed in march to malaga from whence the advance of the french army into the south of spain obliged them to seek protection at gibraltar which under the advice of general riego they left for england on the 4th of july but owing to an unfavourable passage did not reach london until the 17th of august  here the visitation which impended over her was still more calamitous than all that had preceded it  within little more than two months after her arrival in london the account arrived of general riego’s execution 97  gerald griffin the irish novelist in a letter dated 22nd of november 1823 says—      “i have been lately negotiating with my host of 76 regent street     for lodgings for the widow and brother of poor general riego  they     are splendid

surprised to see her look much better     than i was prepared to expect as she is in a confirmed consumption”  mental grief which death only could terminate had at that moment “marked” madame riego “for his own” yet her look like that of all highminded spaniards to a stranger was calm—“much better than he was prepared to expect”  on the 18th of may exactly one month and a day before the termination of her sufferings griffin says—      “the canon riego brother to the poor martyr sent me the other day     a spanish poem of many cantos having for its subject the career of     the unhappy general and expressed a wish that i might find material     for an english one in it if i felt disposed to make anything of the     subject  apropos madame riego is almost dead  the fire is in

the estimable canon  in her will she directed her executor the canon to assure the british people of the gratitude she felt towards them for the sympathy and support which they extended to her in the hours of her adversity  but what makes the will peculiarly affecting is her solemn attestation to the purity and sincerity of the political life of general riego  she states that she esteems it to be the last act of justice and duty to the memory of her beloved husband solemnly to declare in the awful presence of her god before whose judgmentseat she feels she must soon appear that all his private

of the road stood until pulled down in 1856 to make room for the new one the additional workhouse to st george’s hanover square for which purpose shaftesbury house was purchased by that parish in 1787 and an act of parliament passed in that year declares it to be in “st george’s parish so long as it shall continue to be appropriated to its present use”  picture shaftesbury house picture back of shaftesbury house the parochial adjuncts to lord shaftesbury’s mansion which remained until the period of its demolition in nearly the same state as when disposed of have been considerable but the building as his lordship left it could be at once recognised through the iron gate by which you entered and which was surmounted by a lion rampant probably the crest of one of the subsequent possessors  it is surprising indeed that so little alteration externally as well as internally should have taken place  the appearance of the back of shaftesbury house as represented in an old print was unchanged with the exception of the flight of steps which led to the garden being transferred to the west or shaded side of the wing—an addition made by lord shaftesbury to the original house this was purchased by him in 1699 from the bovey family as heirs to the widow of sir james smith by whom there is reason to believe it was built in 1635 as picture stone was engraved on a stone which formed part of the pavement in front of one of the summerhouses in the garden  the right honourable sir james smith was buried at chelsea 18th of november 1681  he was probably the junior sheriff of london in 1672  picture summerhouse      “it does not appear” says lysons “that lord shaftesbury pulled down     sir james smith’s house but altered it and made considerable     additions by a building fifty feet in length which projected into     the garden  it was secured with an iron door the windowshutters     were of the same metal and there were iron plates between it and the     house to prevent all communication by fire of which this learned and     noble peer seems to have entertained great apprehensions  the whole     of the new building though divided into a gallery and two small     rooms one of which was his lordship’s bedchamber was fitted up as     a library  the earl was very fond of the culture of fruittrees and     his gardens were planted with the choicest sorts particularly every     kind of vine which would bear the open air of this climate  it     appears by lord shaftesbury’s letters to sir john cropley that he     dreaded the smoke of london as so prejudicial to his health that     whenever the wind was easterly he quitted little chelsea” where he     generally resided during the sitting of parliament  in 1710 the noble author of ‘characteristics’ then about to proceed to italy sold his residence at little chelsea to narcissus luttrell esq who as a bookcollector is described by dr dibdin as “ever ardent in his love of past learning and not less voracious in his bibliomaniacal appetites” than the duke of marlborough  sir walter scott acknowledges in his preface to the works of dryden the obligations he is under to the “valuable” and “curious collection of fugitive pieces of the reigns of charles ii james ii william iii and queen anne” “made by narcissus luttrell esq under whose name the editor quotes it  this industrious collector” continues sir walter “seems to have bought every poetical tract of whatever merit which was hawked through the streets in his time marking carefully the price and the date of the purchase  his collection contains the earliest editions of many of our most excellent poems bound up according to the order of time with the lowest trash of grub street  it was dispersed on mr luttrell’s death” adds sir walter scott and he then mentions mr james bindley and mr richard heber as having “obtained a great share of the luttrell collection and liberally furnished him with the loan of some of them in order to the more perfect editing of dryden’s works”  this is not exactly correct as mr luttrell’s library descended with shaftesbury house to mr sergeant wynne and from him to his eldest son after whose death it was sold by auction in 1786  on the titlepage of the salecatalogue the collection is described as “the valuable library of edward wynne esq lately deceased brought from his house at little chelsea  great part of it was formed by an eminent and curious collector in the last century”  at the sale of mr wynne’s library bindley purchased lot ’209 collection of poems various latin and english 5 vols 1626 c’ for seven guineas and ’211 collection of political poems dialogues funeral elegies lampoons c with various political prints and portraits 3 vols 1641 c’ for sixteen pounds and it is probable that these are the collections to which sir walter scott refers  dr dibdin in his enthusiastic mode of treating matters of bibliography endeavours to establish a pedigree for those who      “love a ballad in print a’ life”  from pepys placing mr luttrell the second in descent      “the opening of the eighteenth century” he observes “was     distinguished by the death of a bibliomaniac of the very first order     and celebrity of one who had no doubt frequently discoursed largely     and eloquently with luttrell upon the variety and value of certain     editions of old ballad poetry and between whom presents of curious     old blackletter volumes were in all probability passing i allude to     the famous samuel pepys secretary to the admiralty”  of narcissus luttrell he then says—      “nothing would seem to have escaped his lynxlike vigilance  let the     object be what it may especially if it related to poetry let the     volume be great or small or contain good bad or indifferent     warblings of the muse his insatiable craving had ‘stomach for all’     we may consider his collection the fountainhead of these copious     streams which after fructifying in the libraries of many     bibliomaniacs in the first half of the eighteenth century settled     for awhile more determinedly in the curious bookreservoir of a mr     wynne and hence breaking up and taking a different direction towards     the collections of farmer steevens and others they have almost     lost their identity in the innumerable rivulets which now inundate     the bookworld”  it is to the literary taste of mr edward wynne as asserted by dr dibdin that modern bookcollectors are indebted for the preservation of most of the choicest relics of the bibliotheca luttrelliana      “mr wynne” he continues “lived at little chelsea and built his     library in a room which had the reputation of having been locke’s     study  here he used to sit surrounded by innumerable books a great     part being formed by ‘an eminent and curious collector in the last     century’”  what dr dibdin says respecting mr wynne’s building a library and locke’s study is inaccurate as there can be no reasonable doubt that the room or rooms his library occupied were those built by lord shaftesbury which had and correctly the reputation of having been his lordship’s library and the study not of locke although of locke’s pupil and friend  it is not even probable that lord shaftesbury was ever visited by our great philosopher at little chelsea as from 1700 that illustrious man resided altogether at oates in essex where he died on the 28th of october 1704  whether to lord shaftesbury or to mr luttrell the embellishments of the garden of their residence are to be attributed can now be only matter for conjecture unless some curious autographcollector’s portfolio may by chance contain an old letter or other document to establish the claim their tastes however were very similar  they both loved their books and their fruits and flowers and enjoyed the study of them  picture summerhouse an account drawn up by mr luttrell of several pears which he cultivated at little chelsea with outlines of their longitudinal sections was communicated to the horticultural society by dr luttrell wynne one hundred years after the notes had been made and may be found printed in the second volume of the transactions of that society  in this account twentyfive varieties of pears are mentioned which had been obtained between the years 1712 and 1717 from mr duncan’s lord cheneys’s mr palmer’s and mr selwood’s nursery  until recently it was astounding to find amid the rage for alteration and improvement the formal oldfashioned shape of a trim garden of queen anne’s time carefully preserved its antique summerhouses respected and the little infant leaden hercules which spouted water to cool the air from a serpent’s throat still asserting its aquatic supremacy under the shade of a fine old medlartree and all this too in the garden of a london parish workhouse  picture hercules fountain not less surprising was the aspect of the interior  the grotesque workshop of the pauper artisans said to have been picture workshop lord shaftesbury’s dairy and over which was his fireproof library was then an apartment appropriated to a girls’ school  on the basement story of the original house the embellished mouldings of a doorway carried the mind back to picture doorway the days of charles i and standing within which imagination depicted the figure of a jolly cavalier retainer with his pipe and tankard or of a puritanical formal servant the expression of whose countenance was sufficient to turn the bestbrewed october into vinegar  the old carved door leading into this apartment is shown in the annexed sketch  nor should the apartment then occupied by the intelligent master of the workhouse be overlooked  the panelling of the room its chimneypiece and the painting and picture fireplace with painting above framework above it placed us completely in a chamber of the time of william iii and we only required a slight alteration in the furniture and lord shaftesbury to enter to feel that we were in the presence of the author of ‘characteristics’  the staircase too with its spiral balusters as seen through the doorway retained its ancient air                  picture staircase seen through doorway  narcissus luttrell died here on the 26th of june 1732 and was buried at chelsea on the 6th of july following where francis luttrell presumed to be his son was also buried on the 3rd of september 1740  shaftesbury house then passed into the occupation of mr sergeant wynne who died on the 17th of may 1765 and from him it descended to his eldest son mr edward wynne the author of ‘eunomus a dialogue concerning the law and constitution of england with an essay on dialogue’ 4 vols 8vo and other works chiefly of a legal nature  he died a bachelor at little chelsea on the 27th of december 1784 and his brother the rev luttrell wynne of all souls oxford inherited shaftesbury house and the valuable library which mr luttrell his father and brother had accumulated  the house he alienated to william virtue from whom as before mentioned it was purchased by the parish of st george’s hanover square in 1787 and the library formed a twelvedays’ sale by messrs leigh and sotheby commencing on the 6th of march 1786  the auctioncatalogue contained 2788 lots and some idea of the value may be formed from the circumstance that nine of the first seventeen lots sold for no less a sum than £32 7s and that four lots of old newspapers nos 25 26 27 and 28 were knocked down at £18 5s  no ‘376 a collection of old plays by gascoigne white windet decker c 21 vols’ brought £38 17s and no 644 milton’s ‘eiconoclastes’ with ms notes supposed to be written by milton was bought by waldron for 2s who afterwards gave it to dr farmer  dr dibdin declares that “never was a precious collection of english history and poetry so wretchedly detailed to the public in an auctioncatalogue” as that of mr wynne’s library and yet it will be seen that it must have realised a considerable sum of money  he mentions that “a great number of the poetical tracts were disposed of previous to the sale to dr farmer who gave not more than forty guineas for them”     chapter iii   from little chelsea to walham green  after what has been said respecting shaftesbury house it may be supposed that its associations with the memory of remarkable individuals are exhausted  this is very far from being the case and a long period in its history from 1635 to 1699 remains to be filled up which however must be done by conjecture although so many circumstances are upon record that it is not impossible others can be produced to complete a chain of evidence that may establish among those who have been inmates of the additional workhouse of st george’s hanover square—startling as the assertion may appear—two of the most illustrious individuals in the annals of this country of one of whom bishop burnet observed 110 that his “loss is lamented by all learned men” the other a man whose “great and distinguishing knowledge was the knowledge of human nature or the powers and operations of the mind in which he went further and spoke clearer than all other writers who preceded him and whose ‘essay on the human understanding’ is the best book of logic in the world”  after this i need scarcely add that boyle and locke are the illustrious individuals referred to  the amiable john evelyn in his ‘diary’ mentions his visiting mr boyle at chelsea on the 9th march 1661 in company “with that excellent person and philosopher sir robert murray” where they “saw divers effects of the eolipile for weighing air”  and in the same year m de monconys a french traveller in england says “l’après diné je fus avec m oldenburg 111 et mon fils à deux milles de londres en carosse pour cinq chelins à un village nommé le petit chelsey voir m boyle”  now at this period there probably was no other house at little chelsea of sufficient importance to be the residence of the hon robert boyle where he could receive strangers in his laboratory and show them his great telescope and moreover notwithstanding what has been said to prove the impossibility of locke having visited lord shaftesbury on this spot local tradition continues to assert that locke’s work on the ‘human understanding’ was commenced in the retirement of one of the summerhouses of lord shaftesbury’s residence  this certainly may have been the case if we regard locke as a visitor to his brother philosopher boyle and admit his tenancy of the mansion previous to that of lord shaftesbury to whom locke it is very probable communicated the circumstance and which might have indirectly led to his lordship’s purchase of the premises  be that as it may it is an interesting association with something more than mere fancy for its support to contemplate a communion between two of the masterminds of the age and the influence which their conversation possibly had upon that of the other  boyle’s sister the puritanical countess of warwick under date 27th november 1666 makes the following note “in the morning as soon as dressed i prayed then went with my lord to my house at chelsea which he had hired where i was all that day taken up with business about my house” 112  whether this refers to little chelsea or not is more than i can affirm although there are reasons for thinking that shaftesbury house or if not one which will be subsequently pointed out is the house alluded to  charles the fourth earl of orrery and grandnephew to boyle the philosopher was born at dr whittaker’s house at little chelsea on the 21st july 1674  it was his grandfather’s marriage with lady margaret howard daughter of the earl of suffolk that induced the witty sir john suckling to write his wellknown ‘ballad upon a wedding’ in which he so lusciously describes the bride—      “her cheeks so rare a white was on     no daisie makes comparison        who sees them is undone     for streaks of red were mingled there     such as are on the cath’rine pear—        the side that’s next the sun      “her lips were red and one was thin     compared to that was next her chin—        some bee had stung it newly     but dick her eyes so guard her face     i durst no more upon her gaze        than on the sun in july”  the second earl of orrery this lady’s son having married lady mary sackville daughter of the earl of dorset is stated to have led a secluded life at little chelsea and to have died in 1682  his eldest son the third earl died in 1703 and his brother mentioned above as born at little chelsea became the fourth earl and distinguished himself in the military scientific and literary proceedings of his times  in compliment to this lord orrery’s patronage graham an ingenious watchmaker named after his lordship a piece of mechanism which exhibits the movements of the heavenly bodies  with his brother’s death however in 1703 at earl’s court kensington the connection of the boyle family with this neighbourhood appears to terminate  doctor baldwin hamey an eminent medical practitioner during the time of the commonwealth and a considerable benefactor to the college of physicians died at little chelsea on the 14th of may 1676 after an honourable retirement from his professional duties of more than ten years  mr faulkner’s ‘history of kensington’ published in 1820 and in which parish the portion of little chelsea on the north side of the fulham road stands mentions the residence of sir bartholomew shower an eminent lawyer in 1693 sir edward ward lord chief baron of the exchequer in 1697 edward fowler lord bishop of gloucester in 1709 who died at his house here on the 26th august 1714 and sir william dawes lord bishop of chester in 1709 who i may add died archbishop of york in 1724 but in mr faulkner’s ‘history of chelsea’ published in 1829 nothing more is to be found respecting sir bartholomew shower than that he was engaged in some parochial law proceedings in 1691  sir edward ward’s residence is unnoticed  the bishop of gloucester who is said to have been a devout believer in fairies and witchcraft is enumerated among the inhabitants of paradise row chelsea near the hospital and full a mile distant from le petit chelsey and sir william dawes we find from various entries an inhabitant of the parish between the years 1696 and 1712 but without “a local habitation” being assigned to him  all this is very unsatisfactory to any one whose appetite craves after maplike accuracy in parish affairs  bowack in 1705 mentions that      “at little chelsea stands a regular handsome house with a noble     courtyard and good gardens built by mr mart now inhabited by sir     john cope bart a gentleman of an ancient and honourable family     who formerly was eminent in the service of his country abroad and     for many years of late in parliament till he voluntarily retired     here to end his days in peace”  and here sir john cope died in 1721  can he have been the father of the     “hey johnnie cope are ye wauking yet    or are ye sleeping i would wit    o haste ye get up for the drums do beat    o fye cope rise up in the morning”  —of the sir john cope who was forced to retreat from preston pans in “the ’45” and against whom all the shafts of jacobite ribaldry have been levelled  faulkner says that this house which was “subsequently occupied by the late mr duffield as a private madhouse has been pulled down and its site is now called odell’s place a little eastward of lord shaftesbury’s” that is to say opposite to manor hall and sir john cope’s house was not improbably the residence of two distinguished naval officers sir james wishart and sir john balchen  the former was made an admiral and knighted by queen anne in 1703 and appointed one of the lords of the admiralty but was dismissed from the naval service by george i for favouring the interests of the pretender and died at little chelsea on the 30th of may 1723  in the ‘daily courant’ monday july 15 1723 the following advertisement appears—      “to be sold by auction the household goods plate china ware     linen c of sir james wishart deceased on thursday the 18th     instant at his late dwellinghouse at little chelsea  the goods to     be seen this day tomorrow and wednesday before the sale from 9     to 12 in the

after sir james wishart’s death  in 1744 admiral balchen perished in the victory of 120 guns which had the reputation of being the most beautiful ship in the world but foundered with eleven hundred souls on board in the bay of biscay  on the 31st of march 1723 edward hyde the third earl of clarendon died “at his house little chelsea” but where the earl’s house stood i am unable to state  mrs robinson the fascinating “perdita” tells us in her autobiography that at the age of ten 1768 she was “placed for education in a school at chelsea”  and she then commences a most distressing narrative in which the last tragic scene she was witness to occurred at little chelsea      “the mistress of this seminary” mrs robinson describes as “perhaps     one of the most extraordinary women that ever graced or disgraced     society  her name was meribah lorrington  she was the most     extensively accomplished female that i ever remember to have met     with her mental powers were no less capable of cultivation than     superiorly cultivated  her father whose name was hull had from her     infancy been master of an academy at earl’s court near fulham and     early after his marriage losing his wife he resolved on giving this     daughter a masculine education  meribah was early instructed in all     the modern accomplishments as well as in classical knowledge  she     was mistress of the latin french and italian languages she was     said to be a perfect arithmetician and astronomer and possessed the     art of painting on silk to a degree of exquisite perfection  but     alas with all these advantages she was addicted to one vice which     at times so completely absorbed her faculties as to deprive her of     every power either mental or corporeal  thus daily and hourly her     superior acquirements her enlightened understanding yielded to the     intemperance of her ruling infatuation and every power of reflection     seemed absorbed in the unfeminine propensity      “all that i ever learned” adds mrs robinson “i acquired from this     extraordinary woman  in those hours when her senses were not     intoxicated she would delight in the task of instructing me  she     had only five or six pupils and it was my lot to be her particular     favourite  she always out of school called me her little friend     and made no scruple of conversing with me sometimes half the night     for i slept in her chamber on domestic and confidential affairs  i     felt for her very sincere affection and i listened with peculiar     attention to all the lessons she inculcated  once i recollect her     mentioning the particular failing which disgraced so intelligent a     being  she pleaded in excuse of it the unmitigable regret of a     widowed heart and with compunction declared that she flew to     intoxication as the only refuge from the pang of prevailing sorrow”  mrs robinson remained more than twelve months under the care of mrs lorrington      “when pecuniary derangements obliged her to give up her school  her     father’s manners were singularly disgusting as was his appearance     for he wore a silvery beard which reached to his breast and a kind     of persian robe which gave him the external appearance of a     necromancer  he was of the anabaptist persuasion and so stern in     his conversation that the young pupils were exposed to perpetual     terror added to these circumstances the failing of his daughter     became so evident that even during schoolhours she was frequently     in a state of confirmed intoxication”  in 1772 three years afterwards when mrs robinson was fourteen her mother mrs darby was obliged as a means of support to undertake the task of tuition      “for this purpose a convenient house was hired at little chelsea     and furnished for a ladies’ boardingschool  assistants of every     kind were engaged and i” says mrs robinson “was deemed worthy of     an occupation that flattered my selflove and impressed my mind with     a sort of domestic consequence  the english language was my     department in the seminary and i was permitted to select passages     both in prose and verse for the studies of my infant pupils it was     also my occupation to superintend their wardrobes to see them     dressed and undressed by the servants or halfboarders and to read     sacred and moral lessons on saints’ days and sunday evenings      “shortly after my mother had established herself at chelsea on a     summer’s evening as i was sitting at the window i heard a deep     sigh or rather groan of anguish which suddenly attracted my     attention  the night was approaching rapidly and i looked towards     the gate before the house where i observed a woman evidently     labouring under excessive affliction  i instantly descended and     approached her  she bursting into tears asked whether i did not     know her  her dress was torn and filthy she was almost naked and     an old bonnet which nearly hid her face so completely disfigured     her features that i had not the smallest idea of the person who was     then almost sinking before me  i gave her a small sum of money and     inquired the cause of her apparent agony  she took my hand and     pressed it to her lips  ‘sweet girl’ said she ‘you are still the     angel i ever knew you’  i was astonished  she raised her bonnet     her fine dark eyes met mine  it was mrs lorrington  i led her into     the house my mother was not at home  i took her to my chamber and     with the assistance of a lady who was our french teacher i clothed     and comforted her  she refused to say how she came to be in so     deplorable a situation and took her leave  it was in vain that i     entreated—that i conjured her to let me know where i might send to     her  she refused to give me her address but promised that in a few     days she would call on me again  it is impossible to describe the     wretched appearance of this accomplished woman  the failing to which     she had now yielded as to a monster that would destroy her was     evident even at the moment when she was speaking to me  i saw no     more of her but to my infinite regret i was informed some years     after that she had died the martyr of a premature decay brought on     by the indulgence of her propensity to intoxication—in the workhouse     of chelsea”  mrs robinson adds that—      “the number of my mother’s pupils in a few months amounted to ten or     twelve and just at a period when an honourable independence     promised to cheer the days of an unexampled parent my father     unexpectedly returned from america  the pride of his soul was deeply     wounded by the step which my mother had taken he was offended even     beyond the bounds of reason                                              “at the expiration of eight months my mother by my father’s     positive commands broke up her establishment and returned to     london”  nearly opposite to the workhouse is the west brompton brewery formerly called “holly wood brewery” and immediately beyond it an irregular row of six houses which stand a little way back from the road with small gardens before them  the first house is now divided into two occupied when the sketch was made in 1844 by miss read’s academy tavistock house and mrs corder’s preparatory school the latter bolton house to be distinguished by two ornamented stoneballs on the piers of the gateway was a celebrated military academy at which many distinguished soldiers have been educated  picture bolton house gateway the academy was established about the year 1770 by mr lewis lochee who died on the 5th of april 1787 and who in 1778 published an ‘essay on castrametation’  “the premises” says mr faulkner “which were laid out as a regular fortification and were open to view excited much attention at the time”  when balloons were novelties and it was supposed might be advantageously used in the operations of warfare they attracted considerable notice and on the 16th of october 1784 mr blanchard ascended from the grounds of the military academy near chelsea  the anxiety to witness this exhibition is thus described in a contemporary account—      “the fields for a considerable way round little chelsea were crowded     with horse and foot in consequence of which a general devastation     took place in the gardens the produce being either trampled down or     torn up  the turnip grounds were totally despoiled by the multitude     all the windows and houses round the academy were filled with people     of the first fashion  every roof within view was covered and each     tree filled with spectators”  mr blanchard upon this occasion ascended with some difficulty accompanied by a mr sheldon a surgeon whom he landed at sunbury from whence blanchard proceeded in his balloon to romsey in hampshire where he came down in safety after having been between three and four hours in the air  after mr lochee’s death his son mr lewis lochee continued the establishment which his father had formed but unfortunately for himself engaged in the revolutionary movements which agitated flanders in 1790 where “being taken prisoner by the austrians he was condemned to be hanged  he however obtained permission to come to england to settle his affairs upon condition of leaving his only son as a hostage and upon his return to the continent he suffered the punishment of death” 120  “his son a schoolfellow of mine” adds mr faulkner “afterwards married a daughter of the late mr king an eminent book auctioneer of king street covent garden and lamentable to relate fell by his own hands” 8th of december 1815  the residence beyond mr lochee’s military academy is named warwick house—why unless possibly the name has some reference to boyle’s brotherinlaw the earl of warwick i am at a loss to determine  the next house is amyot house  then comes mulberry house formerly the residence of mr denham a brother of the lamented african traveller colonel denham  the fifth house is called heckfield lodge an arbitrary name bestowed by its late occupant mr milton the author of two clever novels ‘rivalry’ and ‘lady cecilia farrencourt’ recently published and brother to the popular authoress mrs trollope  and the sixth and last house in the row on the west side of which is walnuttree walk leading to earl’s court and kensington is distinguished by the name of burleigh house which some one humorously observed 121 might possibly be a contraction of “hurley burley” the house being a ladies’ school and the unceasing work of education on the main fulham road appearing here for the first time to terminate  picture burleigh house 1844 the following entry however in the parish register of kensington respecting the birth of the fourth earl of exeter on the 21st of may 1674 may suggest a more probable derivation—“15 may  honble john cecill son and heir apparent of the rt honble john lord burleigh and the lady anne his wife born at mr sheffield’s”  william boscawen the amiable and accomplished translator of horace resided at burleigh house and here he died on the 6th of may 1811 at the age of fiftynine  he had been called to the bar but gave up that profession in 1786 on being appointed a commissioner for victualling the navy  an excellent classical scholar and warmly attached to literary pursuits mr boscawen published in 1793 the first volume of a new translation of horace containing the ‘odes’ ‘epodes’ and ‘carmen sæculare’  this being well received was followed up by mr boscawen in 1798 by his translation of the ‘satires epistles and art of poetry’—completing a work considered to be in many respects superior to francis’s translation  as an early patron and zealous friend of the literary fund mr boscawen’s memory will be regarded with respect within five days of his death he wrote a copy of verses for the anniversary meeting which he contemplated attending—     “relieved from toils behold the aged steed    contented crop the rich enamell’d mead    bask in the solar ray or court the shade    as vernal suns invite or summer heats invade    but should the horn or clarion from afar    call to the chase or summon to the war    roused to new vigour by the wellknown sound    he spurns the earth o’erleaps the opposing mound    feels youthful ardour in each swelling vein    darts through the rapid flood and scours the plain     “thus a lorn muse who worn by cares and woes    long sought retirement’s calm secure repose    with glad though feeble voice resumes her lay    waked by the call of this auspicious day”  alas the hand which on may morning had penned this introduction to an appeal in the cause of literary benevolence—that hand was cold and the lips by which on the following day the words that had flowed warmly from the heart were to have been uttered—those lips were mute in death within a week  on the 16th of april 1765 mr james house knight of walham green returning home from london was robbed and murdered on the highroad in the vicinity of little chelsea the record of his burial in the parish register of kensington is “shot in fulham road near brompton”  for the discovery of the murderers a reward of fifty pounds was offered and on the 7th of july following two chelsea pensioners were committed to prison charged with this murder on the testimony of their accomplice another chelsea pensioner whom they had threatened to kill upon some quarrel taking place between them  the accused were tried found guilty hanged and gibbeted one nearly opposite walnuttree walk close by the twomile stone the other at bull lane a passage about a quarter of a mile farther on which connects the main fulham road with the king’s road by the side of the kensington canal  in these positions for some years the bodies of the murderers hung in chains to the terror of benighted travellers and of marketgardeners who     “wended their way    in morning’s grey”  towards covent garden until a drunken frolic caused the removal of a painful and useless exhibition  a very interesting paper upon london life in the last century occurs in the second volume of knight’s ‘london’ in which it is observed that “a gibbet’s tassel” was one of the first sights which met the eye of a stranger approaching london from the sea      “about the middle of the last century similar objects met the gaze     of the traveller by whatever route he entered the metropolis  ‘all     the gibbets in the edgware road’ says an extract from the newspapers     of the day in the ‘annual register’ for 1763 ‘on which many     malefactors were being hung in chains were cut down by persons     unknown’  the all and the many of this cool matteroffact     announcement conjure up the image of a long avenue planted with     ‘gallowstrees’ instead of elms and poplars—an assemblage of     pendent criminals not exactly ‘thick as leaves that strew the brook     in valombrosa’ but frequent as those whose feet tickling sancho’s     nose when he essayed to sleep in the cork forest drove him from     tree to tree in search of an empty bough      “frequent mention is made in the books magazines and newspapers of     that period of the bodies of malefactors conveyed after execution to     blackheath finchley and kennington commons or hounslow heath for     the purpose of being there permanently suspended  in those days the     approach to london on all sides seems to have lain through serried     files of gibbets growing closer and more thronged as the distance     from the city diminished till they and their occupants arranged     themselves in rows of ghastly and grinning sentinels along both sides     of the principal avenues”  this picture is not overcoloured and it is to the following occurrence in the main fulham road that the removal of these offensive exhibitions is to be attributed  two or three fashionable parsons who had sacrificed superabundantly to the jolly god at fulham returning to london where they desired to arrive quickly had intellect enough to discover that the driver of their postchaise did not make his horses proceed at a pace equal to their wishes and after in vain urging him to more speed one of them declared that if he did not use his whip with better effect he should be made an example of for the public benefit and hanged up at the first gibbet  the correctness of the old saying that “when the head is hot the hand is ready” was soon verified by the postboy being desired to stop at the gibbet opposite walnuttree walk which order unluckily for himself he obeyed instead of proceeding at a quicker pace  out sprung the inmates of his chaise they seized him bound him hand and foot and throwing a rope which they had fastened round his body over the gibbet he soon found himself in spite of his cries and entreaties elevated in air beside the tarred remains of the chelsea pensioner  the reverend perpetrators of the deed drove off leaving the luckless postboy to protest loudly and vainly to “the dull cold ear of death” against the loathsome companionship  when the first marketgardener’s cart passed by most lustily did he call for help but every effort to get free only tended to prolong his suspense  what could the carters and other early travellers imagine upon hearing shouts proceeding from the gibbet but that the identical murderer of mr knight had by some miracle come to life and now called out “stop stop” with the intention of robbing and murdering them also  and they feeling that supernatural odds were against them ran forwards or backwards not daring to look behind as fast as their feet could carry alarmed and bewildered heads leaving the fate of their carts to the sagacity of the horses  finding that the louder he called for help the more alarm he excited the suspended postboy determined philosophically to endure the misery of his situation in dignified silence  but there he was suffered to hang unnoticed or if remarked it was only concluded that another criminal had been added to the gibbet as its second tassel  the circumstance however of a second body having been placed there speedily came to the knowledge of a magistrate in the neighbourhood who had taken an active part in the apprehension of mr knight’s murderers and he proceeded without delay to the spot that he might satisfy himself as to the correctness of the report  judge however his astonishment on hearing himself addressed by name from the gibbet and implored in the most piteous manner to deliver from bondage a poor postboy whose only offence was that he would not goad on two overworked horses to humour a pair of drunken gentlemen  these “drunken gentlemen” are said to have been men of rank and influence their names have never transpired but the outrage with which they were charged led to the immediate removal from the fulham road of the last pair of gibbets which disgraced it  upon the ground which was occupied by the gibbet where the kindhearted postboy was strung up a solitary cottage stood some years ago and tradition asserted that both the murderer and his gibbet were buried beneath it  picture solitary cottage this cottage is now pulled down lansdowne villas and hollywood place have been erected on the spot and villas and groves continue to the ‘gunter arms’ a publichouse that takes its name from richard gunter the wellknown confectioner by the side of which is gunter grove  this is now the startingpoint of the brompton omnibuses which formerly did not go beyond queen’s elm  edith grove a turning between lansdowne villas and gunter grove is in a direct line with cremorne gardens  proceeding on our road towards fulham the next point which claims attention is the extensive inclosure of the west of london and westminster cemetery company—a company incorporated by act of parliament 1st of victoria cap 180  the burialground was consecrated on the 12th of june 1840 and extends from the fulham road to what is called generally “sir john scott lillie’s road” and sometimes “brompton lane road” which in fact is a continuation to north end fulham of the line of the old brompton road—the point as the reader may recollect that we turned off from at the bell and horns in order to follow the main fulham road to little chelsea  the public way on the east of the burialground is called honey lane and on the west the boundary is the pathway by the side of the kensington canal  the architect of the chapel and catacombs is mr benjamin baud  the cemetery is open for public inspection free of charge from seven in the morning till sunset except on sundays when it is closed till halfpast one o’clock  the first interment took place on the 18th of june 1840 from which time to the 22nd of november there were thirtyfour burials the average number being then four per week  it is scarcely necessary to add that a considerable average increase has taken place but the first step in statistics is always curious  one of the most interesting instances of longevity which the annals of the west of london and westminster cemetery company present occurs on a stone in the northeast corner of the burialground where the age recorded of louis pouchée is 108 but this does not agree with the burial entry made by the rev stephen reid cattley—“louis pouchée of st martin’s in the fields viz 40 castle street leicester square buried feb 21 1843 aged 107”  this musical patriarch however according to a statement in the ‘medical times’ 128 was admitted as a patient to st george’s hospital november 24 1842  january 4 went out and died about three months afterwards of diarrhoea and dysentery  another instance of longevity though not so extraordinary is one which cannot be contemplated without feeling how much influence the consciousness of honest industry in the human mind has upon the health and happiness of the body  a gravestone near a public path on the southeast side of the burialground marks the last resting place of francis nicholson landscapepainter who died the 6th march 1844 aged 91 years  mr nicholson originally practised as a portraitpainter but the simplicity and uprightness of his heart did not permit him to tolerate or pander to the vanities of man and woman kind  to flatter was with him an utter impossibility and as he could not invariably consider the “human face divine” he was incapable of assuming the courtly manners so essential in that branch of the profession  he never indeed quite forgave himself for an approach to duplicity committed at this time upon an unfortunate gentleman who sat to him for his portrait and who squinted so desperately that in order to gain a likeness it was necessary to copy moderately the defect  the poor man it seemed perfectly unconscious of the same on being invited to inspect the performance looked in silence upon it a few moments and with rather a disappointed air said—  “i don’t know—it seems to me—does it squint”  “squint” replied nicholson “no more than you do”  “really well you know best of course but i declare i fancied there was a queer look about it”  the opening of the watercolour exhibition in 1805 may be dated as the commencement of mr nicholson’s fame and success in london  in conjunction with glover varley prout and others an advance in the art of watercolour painting was made such as to astonish and call forth the admiration of the public  in a manuscript autobiography which mr nicholson left behind him and which is full of curious anecdotes he gives the following account of the formation of that exhibition      “messrs hills and pyne asked me to join in the attempt to establish     such a society which i readily agreed to  it was a long time before     a number of members sufficient to produce so many works as would be     required to cover the walls of the exhibition room in brook street     could be brought to join it  artists were afraid they might suffer     loss by renting and fitting up the room the expense being certain     and the success very doubtful  after a great while the society was     formed and in the first and second exhibition the sale of drawings     was so considerable and the visitors so numerous that crowds of     those who had refused to join were eager to be admitted into the     society”  picture nicholson’s grave since the annexed sketch of mr nicholson’s grave was taken the stone bears the two additional melancholy inscriptions of thomas crofton croker soninlaw of francis nicholson who died 8th august 1854 and marianne widow of thomas crofton croker who died 6th october 1854 and an iron railing has been erected on either side of the grave  picture st mark’s chapel opposite to the cemetery gates is veitch’s royal exotic nursery  st mark’s chapel within the grounds of the college stands opposite to st mark’s terrace a row of modern houses immediately beyond the cemetery  the grounds extend to the king’s road and contain about eleven acres surrounded by a brick wall and the entrance to the national society’s training college is from that road  stanley house or stanley grove house which was purchased in 1840 for upwards of £9000 by the society stood upon the site of a house which sir arthur gorges the friend of spenser allegorically named by him alcyon 131 built for his own residence and upon the death of whose first wife a daughter of viscount bindon in 1590 the poet wrote a beautiful elegy entitled ‘daphnaida’  in the sydney papers mention is made under date 15th november 1599 that “as the queen passed by the faire new building sir arthur gorges presented her with a faire jewell”  he died in 1625 and by his widow the daughter of the earl of lincoln the house and adjacent land then called the “brickhills” was sold in 1637 to their only daughter elizabeth the widow of sir robert stanley which sale was confirmed by her mother’s will dated 18th july 1643  the stanley family continued to reside here until 1691 when by the death of william stanley esq that branch of this family became extinct in the male line  the present house a square mansion was built soon afterwards and the old wall propped by several buttresses inclosing the west side of the grounds existed on the bank of the kensington canal until it was washed down by a very high tide  this new or square mansion remained unfinished and unoccupied for several years  in 1724 it belonged to henry arundel esq and on the 24th may 1743 admiral sir charles wager a distinguished naval officer died here and was buried in westminster abbey  after passing through several hands stanley grove became the property of miss southwell afterwards the wife of sir james eyre lord chief justice of the common pleas who sold it in 1777 to the countess of strathmore  here her ladyship indulged her love for botany by building extensive hothouses and conservatories and collecting and introducing into england rare exotics      “she had purchased” says her biographer “a fine old mansion with     extensive grounds well walled in and there she had brought exotics     from the cape and was in a way of raising continually an increase to     her collection when by her fatal marriage the cruel spoiler came     and threw them like loathsome weeds away”  mr lochee before mentioned purchased stanley grove from the countess of strathmore and her husband mr bowes  it was afterwards occupied by dr richard warren the eminent physician who died in 1797 and who is said to have acquired by the honourable practice of his profession no less a sum than £150000  in january 1808 mr leonard morse of the war office died at his residence stanley house and about 1815 it was purchased by the late mr william richard hamilton who ranks as one of the first scholars and antiquaries of his day  between that year and 1840 mr hamilton resided here at various periods having occasionally let it  he made a considerable addition to the house by building a spacious room as a wing on the east side in the walls of which casts from the frieze and metopes of the elgin marbles were let in  when mr hamilton proceeded as envoy to the court of naples in 1821 stanley grove house became the residence of mrs gregor and is thus described by miss burney who was an inmate at this time in the following playful letter 133 to a friend dated 24th september 1821—      “whilst you have been traversing sea and land scrambling up rocks     and shuddering beside precipices i have been stationary with no     other variety than such as turning to the right instead of the left     when walking in the garden or sometimes driving into town through     westminster and at other times through piccadilly  poor miss     gregor continues to be a complete invalid and for her sake we give     up all society at home and all engagements abroad  luckily the     house rented by mrs gregor from william hamilton esq who     accompanied lord elgin into greece abounds with interesting     specimens in almost every branch of the fine arts  here are statues     casts from the frieze of the parthenon pictures prints books and

side of the house the national society added a quadrangle built in the italian style after the design of mr blore and in the grounds near the chapel an octagonal building as a practising school for

goodsized street called stamford road which has a publichouse the rising sun on one side and a bookseller’s shop on the other  here for a few years was a turnpike which has been recently removed and

stamford villas are not “wedded to each other” and in the garden of the one nearest london mr hampton who made an ascent in a balloon from cremorne on the 13th june 1839 with every reasonable prospect of breaking his neck for the amusement of the public came down by a parachute descent without injury to himself although he carried away a brick or two from the chimney of the house much to the annoyance of the person in charge who rushed out upon the aeronaut and told him that he had no business to come in contact with the chimney  his reply exhibited an extraordinary coolness for he assured the man it was quite unintentional upon his part  the milestone is opposite the entrance to no 20 stamford villas which informs the pedestrian that it is one mile to fulham and passing salem chapel which is on the right hand side of the main road we reach the village of walham green     chapter iv   walham green to fulham  the village of walham green which is distant from hyde park corner between two and a half and three miles appears to have been first so called soon after the revolution of 1688  before this it was known as wansdon green written also wandon and wandham all of which names according to lysons originated from the manor of wendon so was the local name written in 1449 which in 1565 was spelled wandowne  as the name of a low and marshy piece of land on the opposite side of the thames to wandsworth through which wandered the drainage from the higher grounds or through which the traveller had to wendon pendan his way to fulham it would not be difficult to enter into speculations as to the anglosaxon origin of the word but i refrain from placing before the reader my antiquarian ruminations while passing wansdown house for few things are more fascinating and deceptive than verbal associations indeed if indulged in to any extent they might lead an enthusiast to connect in thought the piers of fulham bridge with the piers of fulham who in the fourteenth or fifteenth century “compyled many praty conceytis in love under covert terms of ffyssyng and ffowlyng” and which curious poem may be found printed in a collection of ancient metrical tales edited by the rev charles henry hartshorne 138  two of “some ancient houses erected in 1595 as appeared by a date on the truss in the front of one of them” were pulled down at walham green in 1812 after which the important proceedings in the progress of this village in suburban advancement consisted in the establishment of numerous publichouses the filling up of a filthy pond upon the ground gained by which act a chapelofease to fulham dedicated to st john has been built after the design of mr taylor at the estimated expense of £9683 17s 9d  the first stone was laid on the 1st of january 1827 and it was consecrated by the bishop of london on the 14th of august 1828  this was followed by the building of a charityschool upon an angular patch of green or common land where donkeys had been wont to graze and the village children to play at cricket  then the parish pound was removed from a corner of the high road near a basketmaker’s to a back lane thereby destroying the travelling joke of “did you ever see the baskets sold by the pound”  and finally walham green has assumed a new aspect from the construction of the butchers’ almshouses the first stone of which was laid by the late lord ravensworth on the 1st of july 1840  since that time fancyfairs and bazaars with horticultural exhibitions have been fashionably patronised at walham green by omnibus companies for the support and enlargement of this institution     “hail happy isle and happier walham green    where all that’s fair and beautiful are seen    where wanton zephyrs court the ambient air    and sweets ambrosial banish every care    where thought nor trouble social joy molest    nor vain solicitude can banish rest    peaceful and happy here i reign serene    perplexity defy and smile at spleen    belles beaux and statesmen all around me shine    all own me their supreme me constitute divine    all wait my pleasure own my awful nod    and change the humble gardener to the god”  thus in the ‘london magazine’ for june 1749 did mr bartholomew rocque prophetically apostrophise walham green—the “belles beaux and statesmen” by which he was surrounded being new varieties of flowers dignified by distinguished names  in 1755 he printed a ‘treatise on the cultivation of the hyacinth translated from the dutch’ and in 1761 an ‘essay on lucerne grass’ of which an enlarged edition was published in 1764  mr rocque 139 resided in the house occupied by the late mr king opposite to the red lion where mr oliver pitts now carries on business as builder and carpenter  immediately after leaving walham green on the south or lefthand side of the main fulham road behind a pair of carriage gates connected by a brick wall stands the mansion of lord ravensworth in outward appearance small and unostentatious without the slightest attempt at architectural decoration but sufficiently spacious and attractive to have received the highest honour that can be conferred on the residence of a subject by her majesty and prince albert having visited the late lord here on the 26th of june 1840  the grounds at the back of the house though not extensive were planted with peculiar skill care and taste by the late mr ord and on that occasion recalled to memory the words of our old poet the author of ‘britannia’s pastorals’ william browne—     “there stood the elme whose shade so mildely dym    doth nourish all that groweth under him    cipresse that like piramides runne topping    and hurt the least of any by the dropping    the alder whose fat shadow nourisheth    each plant set neere to him long flourisheth    the heavieheaded planetree by whose shade    the grasse grows thickest men are fresher made    the oak that best endures the thundershocks    the everlasting ebene cedar boxe    the olive that in wainscot never cleaves    the amourous vine which in the elme still weaves    the lotus juniper where wormes ne’er enter    the pyne with whom men through the ocean venture    the warlike yewgh by which more than the lance    the strongarm’d english spirits conquer’d france    amongst the rest the tamarisks there stood    for housewives’ besomes only knowne most good    the

ivy date which hold    their leaves all winter be it ne’er so cold    the firre that oftentimes doth rosin drop    the beech that scales the welkin with his top    all these and thousand more within this grove    by all the industry of nature strove    to frame an arbour that might keepe within it    the best of beauties that the world hath in it”  since the royal visit lord ravensworth’s residence has been called percy cross but no reason has been assigned for the alteration of name from purser’s cross which is mentioned as a point “on the fulham road between parson’s green and walham green” so far back as 1602 and at which we shall presently arrive  picture view of percy cross no connection whatever that i am aware of exists between the locality and the percy family and it only affords another very recent local example of what has been as happily as quaintly termed “the curiosity of change” the most favourable aspect of the house is perhaps the view gained of it from a neighbouring garden across a piece of water called eel brook which ornaments an adjacent meadow  john ord esq the creator of lord ravensworth’s london residence is better known as “master ord”  he was the only son of robert ord chief baron of the court of exchequer in scotland  in 1746 mr ord entered trinity college cambridge and in 1762 vacated a lay fellowship by marriage with eleanor the second daughter of john simpson esq of bradley in the county of durham  after being called to the bar mr ord practised in the court of chancery and in 1774 was returned to parliament as member for midhurst  in 1778 he was appointed master of chancery and the next session when returned member for hastings was chosen chairman of “ways and means” in which situation his conduct gave much satisfaction  mr ord retired from parliament in 1790 and in 1809 resigned his office of master in chancery and that of attorneygeneral for lancaster the following year when “he retired to a small place at purser’s cross in the parish of fulham where he had early in life amused himself in horticultural pursuits and where there are several foreign trees of his own raising remarkable both for their beauty and size”  lysons in 1795 says—      “while i am speaking upon this subject” the trees planted by bishop     compton in the gardens of fulham palace “it would he unpardonable     to omit the mention of a very curious garden near walham green in     this parish planted since the year 1756 by its present proprietor     john ord esq master in chancery  it is not a little extraordinary     that this garden should within the space of forty years such have     been the effects of good management and a fertile soil have     produced trees which are now the finest of their respective kinds in     the kingdom  as a proof of this may be mentioned the sophora     japonica planted anno 1756 then about two feet high now eight     feet in girth and about forty in height a standard ginko tree     planted about the year 1767 two feet three inches in girth and an     illinois walnut two feet two inches in girth growing where it was     sown about the year 1760  among other trees very remarkable also     for their growth though not to be spoken of as the largest of their     kind are a black walnuttree sown anno 1757 about forty feet     high and five feet four inches in girth a cedar of libanus planted     in 1756 eight feet eight inches in girth a willowleaved oak sown     anno 1757 four feet in girth the rhus vernix or varnish sumach     four feet in girth and a stone pine of very singular growth  its     girth at one foot from the ground is six feet four inches at that     height it immediately begins to branch out and spreads at least     twentyone feet on each side forming a large bush of about fourteen     yards in diameter”  the second edition of lysons’ ‘environs of london’ appeared in 1810 when the measurement of these trees in june 1808 and december 1809 was placed in apposition  faulkner’s ‘history of fulham’ published in 1813 carries on the history of their growth for three years more but as from the marginal pencil note signed j m and dated january 1835 in lysons’ i am led to conclude that some of these interesting trees exist no longer the following tabular view compiled from these sources may not be unacceptable to the naturalist who is well aware that     “not small the praise the skilful planter claims    from his befriended country”  about the time of mr ord’s death 6th june 1814 his garden contained much that is remarkable in horticulture—      “there was” we are told “a good collection of american plants     amongst others a fine andromeda arborea planted about eight     inches high in march 1804 and now 1812 eleven feet eight inches     high      “the glastonbury thorn flowered here on christmas day 1793      “in the kitchen garden is 1812 a mossrose which has been much     admired  many years ago mr ord ordered his gardener to lay a     mossrose which when done he thought looked so well he would not     allow the layers to be taken off but laid them down year after year     till it covered the ground it does at present viz a

flowered in mr ord’s greenhouse in the summer of 1812 one of which was a beautiful striped variety  the plants had been there since the year 1756  amid all these delightful associations there is one melancholy event connected with the place  on the night of the 9th september 1807 a fire broke out in the gardenhouse of mr ord’s residence a cottage upon the site of the present stables the flame raged so furiously as to burn the principal gardener an old and valued servant almost to ashes before any help could be afforded to him  upon the following sunday 13th the rev john owen the then curate of fulham preached so effective a sermon upon the uncertainty of the morrow 145 that having printed a large impression “without any loss to himself” a second edition appeared on the 3rd of the following month  in the second volume of the ‘transactions of the horticultural society’ a beautifullycoloured representation of ‘ord’s apple’ may be found illustrative of mr salisbury’s communication respecting it which was read to the society on the 17th of january 1817  after acknowledging his obligations to mrs anne simpson the sister of mrs ord and who mr salisbury represents as “being as fond of gardening as her late brotherinlaw mr ord” it is stated that—      “about forty years ago the late john ord esq raised in his garden     at purser’s cross near fulham an appletree from the seed of the     newtown pippin imported from north america  when this tree began     to bear its fruit though without any external beauty proved     remarkably good and had a peculiar quality namely a melting     softness in eating so that it might be said almost to dissolve in     the mouth  the late mr lee of hammersmith often had grafts of     this tree and he sold the plant so raised first with the name of     ord’s apple and subsequently with the name of newtown pippin              “this seedling tree” continues mr salisbury “is now 1817 of     large dimensions its trunk being four feet four inches round at a     yard above the ground but it has of late years been very unhealthy     and scarcely borne any fruit worth gathering its roots having no     doubt penetrated into a stratum of unfavourable soil”  mrs anne simpson sowed some pippins from this remarkable tree—      “and two of the healthiest seedlings of this second generation were     planted out to remain in the kitchengarden which are now 1817     about twenty years old  one of these trees began to bear fruit very     soon which is not unlike that of its parent in shape with a thin     skin and being a very good apple grafts of it have been     distributed about the metropolis with the name of simpson’s pippin     the other seedling of the second generation was several years longer     in bearing fruit and when it did the apples were quite of a     different shape being long with a thick skin and poor flavour and     so numerous as to be all very small  of late years however they     have gradually improved so much in flavour as to become a remarkably     spirited juicy apple attaining a good size which has probably been     promoted by thinning them though a full crop has always been left     upon the tree and they are now greatly esteemed by all who taste     them”  this apple is in perfection for eating from christmas to the middle of march  the skin is thick and always of a green colour while on the tree but tinged with coppercoloured red and several darker spots on the sunny side after the fruit has been gathered some time the green colour changes to a yellowish cast  it may be mentioned that before the death of the late lord ravensworth the house was inhabited by those celebrated artistes madame grisi and signor mario  on the opposite side of the road to lord ravensworth’s and a few yards beyond it on the way to fulham is walham lodge formerly park cottage a modern wellbuilt house which stands within extensive grounds surrounded by a brick wall  this was for some years the residence of mr brand the eminent chemist who particularly distinguished himself by the course of lectures which he delivered on geology at the royal institution in 1816 and which may be dated as the popular starting point of that branch of scientific inquiry in this country  a house now divided into two and called dungannon house and albany lodge abuts upon the western boundary wall of the grounds of walham lodge  picture dungannon house—albany lodge tradition stoutly asserts that this united cottage and villa were previous to their division known by the name of bolingbroke lodge and that here pope did more than once      “awake my st john”  by an early morning visit  at albany lodge the farthest part of the old house in our view then heckfield villa resided mr milton beforementioned as having lived at heckfield lodge little chelsea both of which names were introduced on the fulham road from that gentleman’s attachment to the name of his reverend father’s living near basingstoke  dungannon house formerly went by the name of acacia cottage and was so called from a tree in the garden  it was for many years the country residence of mr joseph johnson of st paul’s churchyard a publisher worthy of literary regard and here he died on the 20th of december 1809  he was born at liverpool in 1738 and after serving an apprenticeship in london commenced business as a medical bookseller upon fish street hill “a situation he chose as being in the track of the medical students resorting to the hospitals in the borough and which probably was the foundation of his connexions with many eminent members of that profession”  having entered into partnership he removed to paternoster row where his house and stock were destroyed by fire in 1770 after which feeling the advantage of a peculiar locality he carried on business alone until the time of his death at the house which all juvenile readers who recollect the caterers for their amusement and instruction will remember as that of “harris and co corner of st paul’s churchyard”  this step was considered at the time by “the trade” as a bold and inconsiderate measure but it was successfully imitated by the late mr murray in his removal from fleet street to albemarle street and indeed john murray as a publisher seems only to have been a fearless copyist in many matters of joseph johnson  whether as a tradesman he was judicious or not in so doing is a question upon which there may be two opinions but there can be no hesitation about the perfect application of dr aikin’s words to both parties—      “the character mr johnson established by his integrity good sense     and honourable principles of dealing soon raised him to eminence as     a publisher and many of the most distinguished names in science and     literature during the last half century appear in works which he     ushered to the world”  the imprint of johnson is to be found upon the titlepages which first introduced cowper and darwin to notice—      “the former of these with the diffidence and perhaps the     despondency of his character had actually by means of a friend     made over to him johnson his two volumes of poems on no other     condition than that of securing him from expense but when the     public which neglected the first volume had discovered the rich     mine opened in the task and assigned the author his merited place     among the firstrate english poets mr johnson would not avail     himself of his advantage but displayed a liberality which has been     warmly acknowledged by that admirable though unfortunate person”  a score of equally generous anecdotes might be told of murray  in one particular however there was as publishers a decided difference between the views of johnson and murray  those of johnson are at present in the ascendancy but they may produce a revolution in favour of the opinion of john murray against cheap literature  johnson was the opponent of typographical luxury  murray on the contrary supported the aristocracy of the press until obliged “by the pressure from without” in some degree to compromise his views by the publication of the ‘family library’  in the wing comparatively speaking a modern addition attached to this house and in the room where mr johnson died is a remarkable chimneypiece of a monumental character but i can learn nothing respecting it  the history of dungannon house when acacia cottage could we procure a correct record of all the ideas which picture chimneypiece have passed through the human mind within its walls respecting literature and art would form a chronicle of singular interest  the late mr hullmandel well known as one of the most experienced and successful practitioners of lithography in england resided here in 1839 and 1840 when he discovered a new process in his favourite art by simple mental reasoning upon the application of the process of copperplate aquatint to lithographic purposes  for this discovery—and it is one of considerable importance—he subsequently took out a patent under the name of lithotint  ever since the infancy of lithography hundreds of persons connected with the art beginning with its inventor himself senefelder had endeavoured to produce impressions from stone of subjects executed with the brush in the same manner as drawings are made with sepia or indian ink  and it was natural enough that artists should have made every effort to supersede the tedious and elaborate process by which alone a liquid could be rendered available for the purpose of drawing on stone  the mode of drawing technically called “the ink style” consists merely of a series of lines some finer some thicker executed on the white surface of the stone with ink dissolved in water by means of a fine sable or a steel pen in imitation of an etching on copper  all attempts however at producing variety of tints by using the ink thicker or thinner failed—the fainter lines either disappearing altogether or printing as dark as thick ones  in every attempt made to use this ink as a wash the result was still more disastrous producing only one dirty mass of indistinctness amid which the original drawing was scarcely to be traced  for twenty years did mr hullmandel labour to attain some mode of printing drawings made by a series of washes with a brush on stone feeling this to be the great desideratum in the art lithographers in germany in france and in this country had pronounced it to be “utterly impossible” when the idea suddenly flashed upon him that if he could effect a minute granulation of the ink by treating it as a copperplate engraver would the ground of an aquatint plate the relative strength of the different washes might be preserved  he hastened from acacia cottage to his printingoffice in london to put his theory into practice and was rewarded by the most satisfactory results  since that period several prints by this process of lithotint were produced by mr hullmandel from drawings made by harding nash haghe walton and other clever artists in which all the raciness the smartness and the beauty of touch are apparent which hitherto could only be found in the original drawing  picture arundel house—front picture arundel house—back in fact lithotint was not a translation but a multiplication of the original and its discovery or rather the proper application of knowledge became an eventful era in the history of the fine arts  arundel house a few yards beyond dungannon house stands on the same side of the road opposite to parson’s green lane which leads to the king’s road  it is a house of considerable antiquity judging from the stone mullions brought to light by some repairs—probably as old as the time of henry viii although the brick front as shown above appears to be the work of the latter part of the seventeenth century  the back of arundel house is quite different in character and retains an old porch leading into the garden  at the farther end of the garden a venerable yewtree arbour exists and not picture arundel house porch and yew tree arbour far from it used to stand a picturesque old pump with the date 1758 close to the spout which pump is now removed and a new one put in its place  upon a leaden cistern at the back of arundel house the following monogram occurs beneath an earl’s coronet with the date 1703—picture old pump and monogram notwithstanding that this is obviously compounded of the letters l i c or c i l and at the first glance with the connexion of an earl’s coronet and a date would appear to present no difficulty respecting the correct appropriation i must confess my inability to state to whom the monogram belonged  for the name of arundel i am equally unable to account  no mention whatever is made of this house by mr faulkner nor does the name of arundel occur in the parish records of fulham although in 1724 as before mentioned stanley grove house appears to have been in the possession of henry arundel  in the midst of this obscurity the residence of the late mr hallam the historian who occupied arundel house in 1819 invests it with a literary association of interest  on the opposite side of the road is the carriage entrance to park house which stands in parson’s green lane  a stone tablet has been let into one of the piers of the gateway inscribed                                 purser’s cross                                  7th august                                     1738  this date has reference to an occurrence which the monthly chronologer in the ‘london magazine’ thus relates—      “an highwayman having committed several robberies on finchley common     was pursued to london when he thought himself safe but was in a     little time discovered at a publichouse in burlington gardens     refreshing himself and his horse however he had time to remount     and rode through hyde park in which there were several gentlemen’s     servants airing their horses who taking the alarm pursued him     closely as far as fulham fields where finding no probability of     escaping he threw money among some country people who were at work     in the field and told them they would soon see the end of an     unfortunate man  he had no sooner spoke these words but he pulled     out a pistol clapped it to his ear and shot himself directly     before his pursuers could prevent him  the coroner’s inquest brought     in their verdict and he was buried in a cross road with a stake     drove through him but ’twas not known who he was” 155a  in the ‘beauties of england and wales’ “purser’s cross” is said to have been corrupted from “parson’s cross” and the vicinity of parson’s green is mentioned in support of the conjecture  however that purser and not percy cross has been for many years the usual mode of writing the name of this locality is established by the ‘annual register’ for 1781 where the following remarkable coincidence is mentioned—      “died 30th december 1780 at purser’s cross fulham mrs elizabeth     and mrs frances turberville in the seventyseventh year of their     ages of ancient and respectable west country family they were twin     sisters and both died unmarried  what adds to the singularity of     this circumstance they were both born the same day never were known     to live separate died within a few days of each other and were     interred on the same day”  park house presents a facsimile of an old mansion which stood precisely on the same site and was known as quibus hall a name as is conjectured bestowed upon it in consequence of some dispute respecting possession between the coheirs of sir michael wharton who died about 1725 155b  when rebuilt by mr holland for the late mr powell it was called high elms house and was for some time occupied as a school conducted by the rev thomas bowen who published in 1798 ‘thoughts on the necessity of moral discipline in prisons’  after mr bowen’s death in the following year his widow with the assistance of the rev joshua ruddock carried on the establishment until 1825 since which time park house became the occasional residence of mr powell of quex in the isle of thanet until his death in 1849  a cottage opposite formerly “brunswick cottage” was called “rosamond’s bower” during the time the late mr crofton croker lived in it 1837–46  in a privately printed description of this cottage when the residence of mr croker of which but a very few copies were distributed to his friends mr croker himself writes—      “in what it may be asked originates the romantic name of     ‘rosamond’s bower’  a question i shall endeavour to answer  the     curious reader will find from lysons’ ‘environs of london’ ii 359     that the manor of rosamonds is an estate near parson’s green in the     picture old rosamond’s bower and park house from a sketch made     about 1750 parish of fulham  lysons adds ‘the site of the mansion     belonging to this estate now 1795 rented by a gardener is said     by tradition to have been a palace of fair rosamond’  there seems     to be however no foundation beyond the name for this tradition and     it is unnoticed by faulkner in his ‘history of fulham’ published in     1813  he merely mentions adjoining high elms or park house an old     dwelling which ‘ancient house’ continues faulkner ‘appears to be     of the age of elizabeth and is commonly called rosamond’s bower’     this ‘ancient house’ was taken down by mr powell in the year 1826     and the present stables of park house are built upon the site  but i     have recently learned that the name of ‘rosamond’s dairy’ is still     attached to an old house probably built between two and three hundred     years which stands a little way back from the highroad at the     northwest corner of parson’s green      “i have always felt with dr johnson that relics are venerable     things and are only not to be worshipped  when therefore i took     my cottage in 1837 and was told that the oak staircase in it had     belonged to the veritable ‘rosamond’s bower’ and was the only relic     of it that existed and when i found that the name had no longer a     precise ‘local habitation’ in fulham i ventured purely from motives     of respect for the memory of the past and not from any affectation     of romance to revive an ancient parochial name which had been     suffered to die out ‘like the snuff of a candle’  in changing its     precise situation in transferring it from one side of parson’s green     lane to the other a distance however not fifty yards from the     original site i trust when called upon to show cause for the     transfer to be reasonably supported by the history of the old oak     staircase  indeed i may here venture to assert that the change of     name from ‘brunswick cottage’—so was ‘rosamond’s bower’ called when     i took it—and the assumption of that name if contrasted with the     name changing and name travelling fashion of the district is a     proceeding in which i am fully borne out by numerous precedents      “miss edgeworth in her reply dated 31st january 1840 to the     letter of a juvenile correspondent then nine years of age inquires     ‘is rosamond’s bower a real name’  and i well remember the gestures     and even some of the jests which the omnibus passengers made when     ‘rosamond’s bower’ was first painted upon the stone caps of the gate     piers such as father prout’s ‘rosyman’s bower near the white     sheaf’ wheatsheaf  but the novelty wore off in a week or two and     the name has long since ceased to be an object of speculation to any     but the inquisitive  for their information i may state that in the     time of elizabeth all the gardeners’ cottages in this neighbourhood     were called bowers  it was the saxon term for a room and     therefore applied to the dwelling occupied by the labouring class     and rosamond or rosaman is said to have been the name of a family     of gardeners bestowed upon the district which they had long     cultivated—possibly a sobriquet derived from the fame of their roses     in times when that flower was a badge of party distinction     it     only remains for me to add that ‘rosamond’s bower’ stands 22 feet     back from the high road and has a small garden or court before it     measuring exclusive of the stableyard 63 feet  the garden behind     the house is of that form called a gore gradually narrowing from 63     to 22 feet in a distance of 550 feet or 183 yards—five turns up and     down which ‘long walk’ may be reckoned by exercise meters ‘a full     mile’ it being 73 yards over and above the distance an ample     allowance for ten short turnings  of the old ‘rosamond’s bower’     three representations have been preserved two of these are     penandink sketches by mr doherty made about the middle of the     last century one of which is an authority for the name of pershouse     cross  the third view appears in a wellexecuted aquatint plate of     ‘fulham park school taken from the play ground’      “the foundation of the present ‘rosamond’s bower’ judging from the     brickwork on the south side and the thickness of the walls is     probably as old as the time of elizabeth—i mean the original building     which consisted of two rooms one above the other 12 feet square     and 7 feet in height  on the north side of this primitive dwelling     was a deep drawwell  subsequently two similar rooms were attached     one of which the present hall was built over the well and two     attics were raised upon this very simple structure thus increasing     the number of rooms from two to six  then a kitchen was built the     present diningroom and another room over it the present     drawingroom at the back of the original building which thus from     a labourer’s hut assumed the air of an eightroomed cottage  it was     then discovered that the rooms were of very small dimensions and it     was considered necessary to enlarge four of them by the additional     space to be gained from bay windows in the diningroom drawingroom     blue bedchamber and dressingroom  but the spirit of improvement     seldom rests content and when it was found that the kitchen which     looked upon the garden was a more agreeable sittingroom both as to     aspect and quiet than the more ancient and smaller room which looked     upon the road it was determined to create another attachment on the     north side by building a kitchen of still larger dimensions with a     scullery and storeroom behind to replace the old scullery and     outoffices by a spacious staircase and over this new kitchen to     place a room of corresponding size or equal to that of the two     bedrooms upon the same line of building  thus in 1826 did     ‘rosamond’s bower’ become a cottage of ten rooms and as it was soon     afterwards presumed from the march of luxury that no one could live     in a decade cottage without requiring a coachhouse and stable an     excellent one was built not far from the north side making the     third though not the last addition in that direction      “parva domus nemorosa quies     sis tu quoque nostris hospitium laribus     subsidium diu postes tuas flora ornet     pomonaque mensas”                                   the garden      “it is much more difficult to describe the garden of rosamond’s bower     than its shape  i may however mention that by means of a sunk     fence 159 and a wenlike excrescence upon the original gore made     in the spring of 1842 the extensive meadow of park house with the     piece of water which adorns it appear to belong to my residence so     completely that so far as the eye questions the matter ‘i am     monarch of all i survey’  picture distant view of ‘rosamond’s     bower’ from the adjoining meadow the first lawn of the garden     rejoices in two very remarkable trees one a standard ayrshire rose     rising ten feet in height from a stem ten inches in circumference     and from which during sunny june ‘every breeze of red rose leaves     brings down a crimson rain’ 160  the other a weeping ash of     singularly beautiful proportions  it has been trained or rather     restrained to the measurement of fiftysix feet in circumference     the stem being two feet round and the branches shooting out at the     height of five feet with incredible luxuriance  under its branches i     had the pleasure of seeing no less than thirtyeight friends sit down     to breakfast on the 22nd june 1842 and

height but in breadth     intervenes between the first lawn and the flower garden where in     the centre of beds stands the ‘baylis vase’—a memorial i sincerely     trust of a more enduring friendship  miss aikin’s question—but a     very long acquaintance with that lady’s fame warrants me here writing     ‘lucy aikin’s question—to me one evening while walking down the     garden whether that urn had been placed over the remains of any     favourite was the occasion of the following lines being painted on     it—      think not that here was placed this urn     to mark a spot o’er which to mourn     should tender thoughts awake a tear     for fading flowers or waning year     remember that another spring     fresh flowers and brighter hopes will bring      two elevated strawberry beds facetiously termed ‘twin strawberry     hills’ rear themselves between the vase and the back lawn the     further corners of which are respectively protected from wheelbarrow     intrusion by an irish quern and a capsular stone venerated in irish     tradition—the former a remarkably perfect the latter an exceedingly     compact specimen having on one side a double and on the other a     single hollow     the remaining points of interest in my garden     may be noticed in a very few words  it gradually decreases in     breadth and is fenced off on one side from the garden of a very kind     neighbour which contains two of the finest walnut trees in the     parish by an oak paling partially covered with broad or irish and     embellished by the picturesque narrowleaved ivy      “on the other side a trim hedge kept breast high which runs beside     ‘the long walk’ separates it from the extensive meadow of park     house and at the termination the following inscription from one of     herrick’s poems has been placed—            thine own dear grounds     not envying others larger bounds     for well thou knowest ’tis not the extent     of land makes life but sweet content      “the garden produces plenty of strawberries an abundance of     raspberries and generally a good crop of apples and pears but few     vegetables the cultivation except of asparagus of which there are     two excellent beds having been abandoned as the bird monopoly of     peas caused every shilling’s worth that came to table to cost five     and the ingenuity of the slugs and snails having completely baffled     all amateur gardening schemes of defence against their slimy     invasions  picture rustic bench among many experiments i may     mention one  some vegetables were protected by a circumvallum of     salt but notwithstanding the slugs and snails contrived to pass     this supposed deadly line of demarcation by fixing themselves on dry     leaves which they could easily lift and thus they wriggled safely     over it  my greatest enjoyment in the garden has been derived from a     rustic bench at the north side of the shrubbery through the back and     arms of which a honeysuckle has luxuriantly interlaced itself there     particularly when recovering from illness i have sat and have     found or fancied that pain was soothed and depressed spirits     greatly elevated by the monotonous tone of the bees around me”  the pamphlet from which the above has been taken then enters into a minute description of the curiosities pictures c collected by mr croker at ‘rosamond’s bower’ which it is unnecessary further to refer to indeed although intended for private circulation only it was not completed as mr croker was led to believe it might appear but an egotistical description of an unimportant house  the following particulars connected with thomas moore’s visit to ‘rosamond’s bower’ may prove interesting—  on the 6th october 1838 moore wrote to mr crofton croker as follows—      “many thanks for your wish to have me at rosamond’s bower even     though i was unlucky enough not to profit by that wish—some other     time however you must for my sake try again and i shall then     be most ready for a rummage of your irish treasures  already     indeed i have been drawing a little upon your ‘researches in the     south of ireland’ and should be very glad to have more books of     yours to pilfer                                                 “yours my dear mr croker                                                               “very truly                                                            “thomas moore”  on the 18th november 1841 majorgeneral then colonel sir charles o’donnell lunched at rosamond’s bower before luncheon mr croker happened to point out to him the passage in the preface of the fourth volume of moore’s works p xxxv in which the poet says—      “with the melody entitled ‘love valour and wit’ an incident is     connected which awakened feelings in me of proud but sad pleasure     to think that my songs had reached the hearts of some of the     descendants of those great irish families who found themselves     forced in the dark days of persecution to seek in other lands a     refuge from the shame and ruin of their own—those whose story i have     associated with one of their country’s most characteristic airs—      ‘ye blakes and o’donnells whose fathers resign’d     the green hills of their youth among strangers to find     that repose which at home they had sigh’d for in vain’      “from a foreign lady of this ancient extraction—whose names could     i venture to mention them would lend to the incident an additional     irish charm—i received about two years since through the hands of a     gentleman to whom it had been intrusted a large portfolio adorned     inside with a beautiful drawing representing love wit and valour     as described in the song  in the border that surrounds the drawing     are introduced the favourite emblems of erin the harp the shamrock     the mitred head of st patrick together with scrolls containing     each inscribed in letters of gold the name of some favourite melody     of the fair artist      “this present was accompanied by the following letter from the lady     herself—”  it is unnecessary to quote this letter but the gentleman alluded to was sir charles o’donnell who had brought the parcel from the continent and being about to proceed to canada and personally unacquainted with moore requested mr croker to get it safely delivered who took the present opportunity of pointing out to sir charles this public acknowledgment that his commission had been executed  they had not been at luncheon many minutes when mr moore was announced and appeared to be no less pleased at meeting sir charles o’donnell than the latter was at being introduced to moore  a few days afterwards mr croker received the following note from mr moore—      “november 24 1841      “dear croker      “i was obliged to leave london much sooner than i originally     intended and thus lost the opportunity of paying you another visit         my next visit to london will i hope be sufficiently free     from other avocations to allow me to devote a good deal of time to     the examination of your various treasures  pray give my kind     remembrances to mrs croker—i constantly think of my great good luck     in lighting by chance on so agreeable a dinnerparty that day  the     only drawback was that it spoiled me—both mentally and physically     speaking—for the dinner that followed                                                          “yours very truly                                                            “thomas moore”  the name of moore was subsequently cut by mr croker on the back of a chair which the poet occupied during this visit  it produced the following epigram by the rev francis mahony father prout—     “this is to tell o’ days       when on this cathedra    he of the melodies       solemnly sat agrah”  mr thomas james bell the next tenant of ‘rosamond’s bower’ altered the name to ‘audley cottage’ which it now bears and the agreeable associations connected with the former title are in the recollection of many who may be unaware of the change and may regret the substitution of a name for which there appears to have been very little reason  parson’s green lane continues from rosamond’s bower to parson’s green it is for the most part composed of small cottages  on the lefthand corner of the green is the ‘white horse’ publichouse the sign of which was some few years ago supported by the quaint piece of ironwork shown in the annexed cut  it is now altered            picture ironwork sign and white horse publichouse  east end house on the east side of the green next the pond was originally built by sir francis child who was lord mayor of london in 1699  it was afterwards the residence of admiral sir charles wager and dr ekins dean of carlisle died here 20th november 1791  the house was subsequently modernized by the late john powell and became the residence of mrs fitzherbert who erected the porch in front of the house as a shelter for carriages  here the prince of wales afterwards george iv was a frequent visitor  piccolomini lived here for a short time lately  the celebrated sir thomas bodley lived at parson’s green from 1605 to 1609  the old mansion at the west side of the green was formerly the rectory house and is traditionally reported to have been the residence of adoniram byfield the noted presbyterian chaplain to colonel cholmondeley’s regiment in the earl of essex’s army who took so prominent a part in cromwellian politics that he became immortalized in hudibras  picture the rectory house an old stone building is noticed by bowack in 1705 as adjoining this house and presumed by him to be of three or four hundred years’ standing and in all probability a chapel for the rectors and their domestics  this building was pulled down according to lysons about the year 1742 and the house is now divided into two that at the corner being occupied by dr lauman’s academy  at the southwest side of the green is the old entrance to peterborough house a residence with the recollections of which the names of locke swift pope gay prior and a crowd of others are associated  the present peterborough house which is a little beyond the old brick gateway was built by mr j meyrick who died there in 1801  ho was the father of sir samuel meyrick the wellknown antiquary  ho purchased the house in 1794 of r heavyside esq and pulled down the old mansion that stood close to the site of the ancient maze which became converted into a lawn at the rear of the modern house  the place was originally picture old gate of peterborough house termed brightwells or rightwells and here in 1569 died john tarnworth esq one of elizabeth’s privy counsellors who lies buried at fulham  brightwells afterwards belonged to sir thomas knolles who in 1603 sold it to sir thomas smith who had been secretary to the unfortunate earl of essex and became under james i clerk of the council latin secretary and master of the requests and here he died in 1609 and was buried in the chancel of fulham church where a handsome monument is erected to his memory  after sir thomas smith’s death his widow married the first earl of exeter and continued to reside at brightwells until her death in 1633  sir thomas smith’s only daughter having married the honourable thomas carey the earl of monmouth’s second son he became possessed of the estate in right of his wife and after him the place was called villa carey which has led to the belief that old peterborough house was built by him  it stood facing the pond on parson’s green and at about the same distance from the road as the present house  francis cleyne who came over to england in the reign of charles i was certainly employed to decorate the rooms  mr carey died about 1635 and his widow about five years afterwards married sir edward herbert attorneygeneral to king charles  sir edward was a firm loyalist and resided at parson’s green till the death of his royal master when he accompanied charles ii in his exile who created him lord keeper of the great seal and he died abroad in 1657  his estate was ordered to be sold with the estates of other loyalists in 1653 but the sale does not appear to have taken place as villa carey in 1660 was in the possession of lord mordaunt who had married the daughter and heiress of mr carey  lord clarendon bears honourable testimony to the daring spirit and devoted zeal in the royal cause evinced by this “young gentleman” and to the no less chivalric conduct of his charming bride      “he was” says the historian “of great vigour of mind and newly     married to a young and beautiful lady of a very loyal spirit and     notable vivacity of wit and humour who concurred with him in all     honourable dedications of himself”  when her husband was arrested and brought to trial in 1658 as a partizan of charles ii by her contrivance one of the principal witnesses against him was kept out of the way and his judges being divided in their opinion of his guilt he was acquitted only by the casting vote of the president the notorious john lisle who had sat upon the trial of charles i by whom he was addressed in the following remarkable strain—      “and i have now to speak to you mr mordaunt god hath appeared in     justice and god doth appear in mercy as the lord is just to them     so the lord is exceeding merciful to you and i may say to you that     god appears to you at this time as he speaks to sinners in jesus     christ for sir he doth clear sinners in christ jesus even when they     are guilty and so god cleareth you  i will not say you are guilty     but ask your own conscience whether you are or no  sir bless god as     long as you live and bless my lord protector by whose authority you     are cleared  sir i speak no more but i beseech you to speak to     god”  the very active part which lord mordaunt had taken in effecting the restoration of charles ii in which service according to his epitaph he “encountered a thousand dangers provoking and also defeating the rage of cromwell” was not rewarded by any extraordinary marks of distinction or favour and he seems after that event to have quietly resided on his estate at parson’s green where he died in the fortyeighth year of his age on the 5th june 1675 and was buried in fulham church  the son of lord mordaunt who afterwards received the title of earl of peterborough married first carey daughter to sir alexander fraser of dover  his second wife was the accomplished singer anastasia robinson who survived him  the earl was visited at peterborough house by all the wits and literati of his time  bowack in 1706 describes the gardens of peterborough house as containing twenty acres of ground and mentions a tuliptree seventysix feet in height and five feet nine inches in girth  swift in one of his letters speaks of lord peterborough’s gardens as the finest he had ever seen about london  on the same side of the green as peterborough house stood the residence of samuel richardson who removed to parson’s green from north end in 1755 and in this house his second wife who survived him died in november 1773 aged seventyseven  formerly the same house belonged to sir edward saunders lord chief justice of the king’s bench in 1682  a sketch of the house will be found in chambers’ cyclopædia of english literature  drury lodge situated on the king’s road adjoining parson’s green and immediately opposite the malt house formerly known as ivy cottage was built by walsh porter in the gothic style and is now the residence of mr e t smith who has called the house after his theatre the name of the lane which runs down by the side of drury lodge has however not been altered to drury lane but still retains its old title of broom lane  it is said that on the site of what is now called drury lodge was formerly a house the residence of oliver cromwell which was called the old red ivy house  part of the old walls of that building form the west side of the present cottage  proceeding forward from purser’s cross on the main fulham road where st peter’s villa may be noticed as the residence of madame garcia in 1842 about a quarter of a mile brings us to munster house which is supposed to owe its name to melesina schulenberg created by george ii in 1716 duchess of munster  picture munster house 1844 according to faulkner it was also called mustow house—this was not improbably the duchess’s pronunciation and he adds that tradition makes it a huntingseat of charles ii and asserts that an extensive park was attached to it but faulkner also tells us that munster house “was during the greater part of the seventeenth century the residence and property of sir william powell bart who founded the almshouses”  how after this statement mr faulkner could have admitted the tradition requires some explanation as he seems to have followed without acknowledgment the particulars supplied to lysons from authentic documents by mr deere of the auditor’s office who appears merely to have informed that gentleman that among the titledeeds of this property there is one of sir edward powell’s dated 1640 and that sir william powell’s will bears date 1680  according to the same unquestionable records munster house came from the powells into the possession of sir john williams bart of pengethly monmouthshire  in 1795 lysons says that munster house was “occupied as a school” faulkner in 1813 states that it was “in the occupation of m sampayo a portuguese merchant”  and his successor in the tenancy was john wilson croker esq mp then secretary of the admiralty and afterwards the right hon mr croker 171 a gentleman who brilliantly retired into private life but whose character is so well known and has been so often discussed in political and literary circles that i shall only venture to remark the local coincidence of three indefatigable secretaries of the admiralty during the most critical periods of england’s history—namely sir philip stevens sir evan nepean and mr croker—having selected the quietude of fulham as the most convenient and attractive position in the neighbourhood of london where they might momentarily relax from the arduous strain of official duties  picture marble bust  about 1820 mr croker resigned munster house as a residence after having externally decorated it with various cockney embattlements of brick and collected there many curious works of art possibly with a view of reconstruction  in the garden were two marble busts one of which is figured on previous page  the other a female head not unlike that of queen anne  there was also a fragment of a group representing a woman with a child at her side obviously the decoration of a fountain and a rustic stone seat conjectured to have been the bed of a formidable piece of ordnance                 picture woman and child—rustic stone seat  a recent tenant of munster house the rev stephen reid cattley who is known to the reading public as the editor of an issue of fox’s ‘book of martyrs’ was unacquainted with the history of the relics in the garden and can only remember the removal of two composition lions from the gatepiers of munster house—not placed there it must be observed by mr croker but which had the popular effect for some time of changing the name to monster house  it is now a lunatic asylum  opposite munster house is dancer’s extensive garden for the supply of the london market by the side of which a road runs leading by a turning on the left direct back to parson’s green or if the straight road is kept the king’s road is reached opposite osborn’s nursery adjoining which nursery is churchfield house the residence of dr burchell the african traveller  picture fulham lodge fulham lodge stood on the opposite or south side of the road from munster house on the ground immediately beyond munster terrace which was built a short time prior to its demolition this cottage for it was no more was a favourite retirement of the late duke of york  an affecting story is told by george colman the younger connected with his own feelings while on a visit here  he had lost sight of an old college friend the rev robert lowth son of the bishop of london from the year 1781 to 1822 one and forty years when colman was surprised and pleased by the receipt of the following letter written and left upon his table by a gentleman who had called when he was not at home—                                                         “august 16 1822      “dear colman—it may be some fiveandthirty years since we met and     i believe as near forty years as may be since i was promoted from my     garret no 3 peckwater into your cidevant rooms in the old quad     on which occasion i bought your things  of all your household     furniture i possess but one article which i removed with myself to     my first house and castle in essex as a very befitting parsonage     sideboard viz a mahogany table with two side drawers and which     still ‘does the state some service’ though not of plate  but i have     an article of yours on a smaller scale a certain little flat     mahogany box furnished partially i should say with cakes of paint     which probably you overlooked or undervalued as a vademecum and     left  and as an exemplification of the great vanity of overanxious     care and the safe preservation per contra in which an article may     possibly be found without any care at all that paintbox is still     in statu quo at this present writing having run the gauntlet not     merely of my bachelor days but of the practical cruelties of my     thirteen children all alive and merry thank god albeit as unused     and as little disposed to preserve their own playthings or chattels     from damage as children usually are yet it survives  ‘the reason     why i cannot tell’ unless i kept it ‘for the dangers it had passed’      “though i have been well acquainted with you publicly nearly ever     since our christ church days our habits pursuits and callings     having cast us into different countries and tracts we have not i     think met since the date i speak of  i have a house at chiswick     where i rather think this ninelived box is and whether it is or     no i shall be very glad if you will give me a call to dine and take     a bed if convenient to you and if i cannot introduce you to your     old acquaintance and recollections i shall have great pleasure in     substituting new ones—mrs lowth and eleven of our baker’s dozen of     olivebranches our present complement in the house department my     eldest boy being in the west indies and my third having returned to     the military college last saturday his vacation furlough having     expired  as the summer begins to borrow now and then an autumn     evening the sooner you will favour me with your company the surer     you will be of finding me at grove house the expiration of other     holidays being the usual signal for weighing anchor and shifting our     moorings to parsonage point  i remember you or david curson had     among your phrases quondam one of anything being ‘dd     summerly’ i trust however having since tasted the delights of the     sweet shady side of pall mall that you have worn out that prejudice     and will catch the season before it flies us or give me a line     naming no distant day that i may not be elsewhere when you call and     you will much oblige yours sincerely                                                             “robert lowth”      “ps—in your address to me you must not name chiswick but grove     house turnham green as otherwise it goes into another postman’s     walk who walks it back again to the office and it does not reach     me per turnham green peripatetic till the next day which is     toute autre chose”  colman seems to have been sincerely delighted at the receipt of this letter he answered it immediately expressing to his old friend how much he had gratified him and how readily he accepted the invitation      “after refreshing my friend’s memory” says colman “by touching on     some particulars which have already been mentioned i informed him     that i was of late years in the habit of suburban rustication and     that i had passed a considerable part of my summers in a house where     i was intimate at fulham whither i desired him to direct to me as     much nearer chiswick than my own abode being within a few hundred     yards of his old family residence where we last parted  whenever i     was at this place i told him the avenue and bishop’s walk by the     river side the public precincts of the moated episcopal domain had     become my favourite morning and evening lounge  i told him indeed     merely the fact omitting all commentary attached to it for often     had i then and oftener have i since in a solitary stroll down the     avenue thought of him regretting the wide chasm in our intercourse     and musing upon human events”  there is a regret expressed by colman that he kept no copy of his answer “which” he adds “was written in the ‘flow of soul’ and at the impulse of the moment”  mr lowth wrote in reply to colman detailing in a most amusing manner his having in the pursuit of two cockneys who had made an attack upon a grove of orleans plumtrees in his grounds taken cold which confined him to his room      “but for this inter poculum et labra” continued mr lowth “it was     my intention to have made you my first post restante with     perhaps a walk down the old avenue in my way to town that     identical day and still hoping to accomplish three miles and back     i have hoped from day to day but i cannot get in travelling     condition even for so short a journey  therefore i hope you will     send me word by my new yorkshire groom lad that you will take     potluck with me on sunday as the most likely day for you to     suburbise”  colman accepted the invitation believing from the length of mr lowth’s letter three pages and the playfulness of his old friend’s communication that nothing more than an ordinary cold was the matter with him  a note however which followed from one of mr lowth’s daughters stated that the meeting proposed by her father must be postponed that he “had become extremely unwell that bleeding and cupping had been prescribed” and the most perfect quiet enjoined  on the day after the receipt of this note colman sent over to grove house chiswick to make inquiries as to mr lowth’s health when the reply given by an elderly female at the gate after considerable delay was that “her master was no more”  a letter from dr badeley to colman dated 22d august 1822 confirmed the melancholy intelligence which he had at first hesitated to believe it stated that “the decease of mr lowth took place on sunday evening” the very evening appointed by him for their anticipated happy reunion and that his remains were to be interred in the family vault at fulham on monday morning at ten o’clock      “i continued” said colman “at fulham lodge which is nearer in a     direct line to the church than to the bishop’s palace and the ‘old     avenue’  on monday the adjacent steeple gave early notice of the     approaching funeral religion and sorrow mingled within me while the     slow and mournful tolling of the bell smote upon my heart  selfish     feelings too though secondary might now and then obtrude for they     are implanted in our nature  my departed friend was about my own     age we had entered the field nearly at the same time we had fought     indeed our chief battles asunder but in our younger days he had     been my comrade close to me in the ranks he had fallen and my own     turn might speedily follow”  these are the ideas which george colman the younger records as having passed through his mind while an inmate of fulham lodge—      “my walk next morning” he says “was to the sepulchre of the lowths     to indulge in the mournful satisfaction of viewing the depository of     my poor friend’s remains  it stands in the churchyard a few paces     from the eastern end of the ancient church at fulham  the     surrounding earth trampled by recent footsteps and a slab of marble     which had been evidently taken out and replaced in the side of the     tomb too plainly presented traces of those rites which had been     performed on the previous day  for several mornings i repeated my     walk thither and no summer has since glided away except the last     when my sojournment at fulham was suspended without my visiting the     spot and heaving a sigh to the memory of robert lowth”  theodore hook’s manuscript diary contains the following entries with reference to visits made by him at fulham lodge—      “2nd january 1826—called  mrs carey’s luncheon      “thursday 5th january—drove over to fulham  mrs carey’s din     colman harris mrs g  good hits  mrs coutts ‘julius cæsar’ c     stayed very late and walked home”  fulham park road is now where fulham lodge stood and the ground is partly built on the rest is to be let for building  this walk is exactly three miles and a half from hyde park corner and what an irishman would call the iron milestone stood exactly opposite to ivy lodge until placed against the brick wall immediately beyond the railings  ivy lodge was for some years the residence of rudolph ackermann a name as a printseller known it is not using too broad a word to say throughout the world and whose representatives still carry on this business in regent street  ackermann was a remarkable man  he was born in 1764 at stollberg near schneeberg in saxony and having been bred a coachbuilder upon visiting england shortly before the french revolution found employment as a carriagedraughtsman which led to his forming the acquaintance of artists and becoming a printpublisher in london  the french refugees whose necessities obliged them to exercise their acquirements and talents as a means of support found in mr ackermann’s shop a repository for the exhibition and sale of decorative articles which elevated this branch of business to an importance that it had never before assumed in england ackermann’s name stands prominently forward in the early history of gas and lithography in england and he must be remembered as the introducer of a species of illustrated periodicals by the publication of the ‘forgetmenot’ to which or to similar works nearly every honoured contemporary name in the whole circle of british literature have contributed and which have produced a certain but advantageously a questionable influence upon the fine arts  after the battle of leipzig mr ackermann publicly advocated the cause of the starving population of many districts of germany in consequence of the calamities of war with so much zeal and success that a parliamentary grant of £100000 was more than doubled by a public subscription  in the spring of 1830 when residing at ivy lodge he experienced a sudden attack of paralysis and a change of air was recommended by his medical attendants  this led to mr ackermann’s removal to finchley where he died on the 30th of march 1834  having now arrived at fulham we will in the next chapter accompany the reader in a walk through that ancient village                   picture the entrance to fulham 1844     chapter v   fulham  in faulkner’s ‘history of fulham’ we learn that the earliest mention of that village occurs in a grant of the manor by tyrhtilus bishop of hereford to erkenwald bishop of london and his successors about the year 691 in which grant it is called fulanham  camden in his ‘britannia’ calls it fulham and derives its name from the saxon word fulanham volucrum domus the habitation of birds or place of fowls norden agrees with camden and adds “it may also be taken for volucrum amnis or the river of fowl for ham also in many places signifies amnis a river but it is most probable it should be of land fowl which usually haunt groves and clusters of trees whereof in this place it seemeth hath been plenty”  in somner’s and lye’s saxon dictionaries it is called fulanham or foulham supposed from the dirtiness of the place  the earliest historical event relating to fulham is the arrival of the danes there in the year 879  on the right hand side as we enter the village stands holcrofts’ hall formerly holcrofts’ built about 1708 which is worthy of mention as belonging to john laurie esq and as having been the residence of sir john burgoyne where he gave some clever dramatic performances distinguished not only for the considerable talent displayed by the actors but remarkable for the scenery and machinery considering the limited space the whole of which was superintended by the honourable mr wrottesley son of lord wrottesley who afterwards married miss burgoyne an admirable amateur actress here it was that the celebrated madame vestris died on the 8th august 1856 in her 59th year  during the time she lived there it was called gore lodge  the house has been since tenanted for a short time by mr charles mathews and his present wife  holcroft’s priory which is opposite was built upon the site of claybrooke house mentioned by faulkner  in the back lane burlington road fulham almshouses are situated opposite to burlington house formerly roy’s wellknown academy on the ground attached to which is now a reformatory school built about four years ago  this lane leads to the termination of the king’s road by the ship tavern  the almshouses were originally built and endowed by sir w powell bart and were rebuilt in 1793  the old workhouse built 1774 still stands on the lefthand side of the high street  it has been in a dilapidated condition for many years and is about to be pulled down the fulham and hammersmith union is now in fulham fields  cipriani lived in a house adjoining the workhouse  further on in fulham high street is the golden lion inn  there is a tradition that bishop bonner resided in the old golden lion and that it had a subterranean communication with the palace  the late mr crofton croker read the following paper at the meeting of the british archæological association at warwick in 1847—        on the probability of the golden lion inn at fulham having been            frequented by shakespeare about the years 1595 and 1596      it is certainly extraordinary that of the personal history of a man     whose writings are of so high an order of genius that they may almost     be considered as works of inspiration we should know so little and     that conjecture should have to supply so much as in the biography of     william shakespeare      pilgrims as are we at this moment to the birthplace and the tomb of     the highest name in the literature of this country we all feel that     we now tread the classic ground of england—ground too rich in     unquestionable memories of shakespeare to admit of any feeling of     jealousy in an attempt to connect his fame by circumstantial evidence     with any other locality  i therefore venture to call attention to     the two following entries in the parish records of fulham a village     in the county of middlesex on the thames about four miles west of     london and where the bishop of london has a seat      in an assessment made on the 12th october 1625 for the relief of     the poor of fulham side john florio esq was rated at six     shillings for his house in fulham street      and in the same assessment upon the “northend” of the parish the     name of robert burbage occurs      meagre as this appears to be and wide of the date at which i aim by     thirty years it is all that i can produce in the shape of novel     documentary evidence for an attempt to connect the name of     shakespeare with fulham the other points which i have to offer in     evidence being admitted facts although no result has been deduced     from them      in the high street of fulham stands a cleanlylooking brick house     square in form and newly built called the golden lion where any     suburban traveller requiring refreshment may be supplied with a mug     of excellent ale and bread and cheese in a parlour having a sanded     floor the room it must be confessed smelling rather strongly of     tobacco smoke—      “you may break you may ruin the vase if you will—     but the scent of the roses will hang round it still”—      and so it is to my mind with the tobacco smoke of the golden lion     which stands upon the site of an old hostelry or inn of the tudor     age which was pulled down in april 1836 and was described soon     afterwards in the ‘gentleman’s magazine’  while the work of     destruction picture ancient tobacco pipe was going on a tobacco     pipe of ancient and foreign fashion was found behind the old     wainscot  the stem was a crooked shoot of bamboo through which a     hole had been bored and a brass ornamental termination of an     elizabethan pattern formed the head of the pipe—why may not this     have been the pipe of that bishop of london who had risen into     elizabeth’s favour by attending mary on the scaffold at fotheringay     and who having fallen into disgrace in consequence of a second     marriage at an advanced period of his life sought we are told in     the retirement of his house at fulham “to lose his sorrow in a mist     of smoke”—and actually died there suddenly on the 15th june 1596     “while sitting in his chair and smoking tobacco”      could this have been the tobacco pipe produced at “crowner’s ’quest”     assembled at the golden lion to inquire into the cause of his     lordship’s sudden death  it is not even impossible that it may have     been produced there by his son john fletcher whose name is     associated with that of francis beaumont in our literature      mr charles knight has set the example of an imaginary biography of     shakespeare and has brought many probable and some improbable things     together on the subject—why then has he overlooked the golden lion     in fulham  the name of john fletcher naturally leads to this     question  at the time of his father’s death he was in his twentieth     year and who will doubt that at that period of his life his     father’s the bishop’s house was his home  that he may have     resorted to the golden lion and there have met with shakespeare is     therefore quite as probable as that our great dramatist associated     with fletcher at the falcon or the mermaid if good cause can only be     shown for shakespeare’s having had as much reason to frequent fulham     as the bankside—or borough of london      i have already stated that florio’s house was assessed for the     poorrate in fulham street on the 12th october 1625 the year of     florio’s death and be it remembered that florio was the translator     of montaigne’s essays of which a copy of the original edition     bearing shakespeare’s very rare autograph was not very long since     purchased by the british museum at what was considered to be a very     large price  when the genuineness of that autograph was keenly     discussed among antiquaries and the probable date at which the     ‘tempest’ was written became a question no one presumed to deny     that the coincidences between the passage in the 2nd act of the     ‘tempest’ where gonzalo says—      “i’ the commonwealth i would by contraries     execute all things for no kind of traffic     would i admit no name of magistrate     letters should not be known riches poverty     and use of service none contract succession     bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none     no use of metal corn or wine or oil     no occupation all men idle all     and women too but innocent and pure     no sovereignty”—      is but an echo of the following in florio’s translation of     montaigne—      —“it is a nation would i answer plato that hath no kind of     traffic no knowledge of letters no intelligence of numbers no     name of magistrate nor of politic superiority no use of service     of riches or of poverty no contracts no successions no     occupation but idle no respect of kindred but common no apparel     but natural no manuring of lands no use of wine corn or metal”     etc                                              there are other coincidences also free from the very great     difficulty of reconciling satisfactorily printed dates with an     imaginary career—which coincidences are too remarkable to have     escaped the host of ingenious commentators upon the supposed sources     of shakespeare’s information—of his observation what shall i say      the coincidence between passages in daniel’s “civil warres”     published in 1595 and passages in shakespeare’s richard ii induce     mr charles knight to observe that “we”—thereby meaning himself—“have     looked at this poem with some care and we cannot avoid coming to the     conclusion that with reference to parts of the conduct of the story     and in a few modes of expression each of which differs from the     general narrative and the particular language of the chroniclers     there are similarities betwixt shakespeare and daniel which would     lead to the conclusion either that the poem of daniel was known to     shakespeare or the play of shakespeare was known to daniel”      this position is indeed established by mr knight who arrives     satisfactorily enough for his own conclusion that of fixing the date     of the composition of shakespeare’s play to 1597 adding candidly     enough that “the exact date is really of very little importance and     we should not have dwelt upon it had it not been pleasant to trace     resemblances between contemporary poets who were themselves personal     friends”      now with regard to dates and the disputed dates of the composition     of the ‘tempest’ it is important to ascertain who john florio and     samuel daniel were      we know that florio was the italian scholar of his day and the court     favourite  we know that daniel whose name is now scarcely popularly     remembered was helped into the office of poetlaureat by his     connection with florio as his brotherinlaw by florio’s     recommendations to be the successor of “that poor poet edmund     spenser”  here at once by admitting shakespeare’s personal     intimacy with florio and daniel with his knowledge of their     writings there can be no question and supposing that he had seen     florio’s translation of montaigne in ms much difficulty about dates     is got rid of and we can account for shakespeare’s acquaintance with     italian literature      and allow me to add to this the fact noticed by mr collier in his     memoirs of the principal actors in the plays of shakespeare printed     for the shakespeare society that shakespeare’s fellowplayer henry     condell did some time sojourn at fulham for a tract printed in     1625 entitled ‘the runaway’s answer to a book “a rod for runaways”’     in reply to a pamphlet published by decker is inscribed “to our much     respected and very worthy friend mr h condell at his country     house at fulham”  again couple with the name of condell that of     burbadge in 1625 at fulham is not the association most     extraordinary although there is no further agreement in the     christian name than the first letter robert being that in the fulham     assessment of poorrates richard that of shakespeare’s fellowactor     the family name of burbadge however belongs not to middlesex but     to warwickshire  alas for the credit sake of ‘robert burbadge of     northend fulham’ in the place in the poorrate assessment of 1625     where the sum should have been inserted there is a blank although     twentytwo of his neighbours at north end are contributors of sums     varying from 6s 8d to 1s      joshua sylvester who was born in 1563 or 1564 and died in 1618     thus describes the village of north end fulham where his uncle     plumbe resided and he sylvester formed the attachment which is the     subject of his poem—      i was wont for my disport     often in the summer season     to a village to resort     famous for the rathe ripe peason     where beneath a plumbtree shade     many pleasant walks i made      and norden whom we consider as the father of english topography     dates the address “to all courteous gentlemen” prefixed to his     account of middlesex and hertfordshire from his “poore home near     fulham 4th november 1596”      here then we have a mass of facts which render it impossible for     us to doubt that the golden lion fulham must have been according     to the custom of the times frequented by florio and his     brotherinlaw daniel by fletcher by henry condell shakespeare’s     fellowplayer by some one of the name of burbadge by joshua     sylvester and john norden about the years 1595 and 1596  is there     not then every reasonable presumption that our immortal shakespeare     was also a member of this clique                 picture fireplaces in the old golden lion  on the pulling down of the old inn by mr powell the panelling was purchased by mr street of brewer street and was afterwards sold to lord ellenborough for the fitting up of his lordship’s residence southam house cheltenham  fulham high street which extends from the london road to church row appears to have been denominated bear street and is called in the more ancient parish books fulham street  the direct approach to fulham church is by church row which branches off to the right of the high street  on the left of the churchyard entrance is the vicarage  the present vicar is the rev r g baker  opposite the vicarage is a piece of ground which was consecrated in 1843 by bishop blomfield who is buried there upon this recent addition to the burialground formerly stood miss batsford’s seminary for young gentlemen  there are several curious old monuments in the church which have been described and engraved by faulkner to whose work the curious reader may be referred  in the churchyard are the tombs and monuments of several of the old bishops of london—compton robinson hayter gibson terrick lowth sherlock and randolph  the grave of that distinguished author and brilliant wit theodore hook is immediately opposite the chancel window  the stone bears the plain inscription “theodore edward hook died 24th august 1841 in the fiftythird year of his age”             picture old entrance to pryor’s bank 1844 188b  leaving the church by the other entrance we are in church lane  the first house opposite the gate of the churchyard is pryor’s bank to which a separate chapter of our little volume is devoted so that we can pass on immediately to the next house thames bank the present residence of mr baylis whose wellknown taste will no doubt soon change its present aspect  granville sharp’s 188a house stood opposite  it was pulled down about twentyfive years ago  john’s place erected 1844 is on the site  next to thames bank formerly stood egmont villa the residence of theodore hook and the house in which he died now pulled down the back of which is shown in the annexed sketch  this house though of the smallest dimensions was fitted up with much good taste  picture back of egmont villa there was a small boudoir on the side of the drawingroom which was very rich in articles of virtù more especially in some remarkably fine carvings attributed to cellini brustolini and others  these were left to hook by his brother the late dean of worcester  as an improvisatore hook was unapproachable  in regard to his literary merits let the following suffice taken from the late mr barham’s life of hook published in 1848—      “there can be no need” says the editor “at this day to enter upon     any lengthened criticism of theodore hook’s merits as a novelist     they have been discussed over and over again with little variety of     opinion by every reviewer of the kingdom  indeed both his faults     and his excellencies lie on the surface and are obvious and patent     to the most superficial reader his fables for the most part ill     knit and insufficient disappoint as they are unfolded repetitions     and omissions are frequent in short a general want of care and     finish is observable throughout which must be attributed to the     hurry in which he was compelled to write arising from the     multiplicity and distracting nature of his engagements  his tendency     to caricature was innate but even this would probably have been in a     great measure repressed had he allowed himself sufficient time for     correction while on the contrary in detached scenes which sprang     up as pictures in his mind replete with comic circumstance in     brilliant dialogue and portraiture of character not to mention those     flashes of sound wisdom with which ever and anon his pages are     lighted up his wit and genius had fair play revelling and rioting     in fun and achieving on the spur of the moment those lasting     triumphs which cast into the shade the minor and mechanical blemishes     to which we have adverted”  hook was a successful dramatist and an extensive journalist  of his novels ‘gilbert gurney’ may be considered to be the most remarkable  hook’s furniture was sold by george robins in september 1841  in 1855 the aqueduct was erected by the chelsea water works company for conveying the water from kingstonuponthames to the metropolis and it was necessary that the contractor mr brotherhood should get possession of egmont villa to enable them to erect the tower on the fulham side here the piles and timbers of the old bishop’s ferry used for the conveyance of passengers across the river from putney to fulham before the old bridge was built were discovered  it was subsequently considered desirable to pull the villa down and there now remains no trace of the house in which hook lived and died and which stood within a few paces of his grave  bowack mentions that robert limpany esq “whose estate was so considerable in the parish that he was commonly called the lord of fulham” resided in a neat house in church lane  he died at the age of ninetyfour  beyond the pryor’s bank on the right is the bishop’s walk which runs along the side of the thames for some little distance and from hence a view of the bishop’s palace is obtained  this palace has been from a very early period the summer residence of the bishops of london  the land consists of about 37 acres and the whole is surrounded by a moat over which are two bridges  following the course of the bishop’s walk we come to the road leading to craven cottage originally built by the margravine of anspach when countess of craven and since altered and improved by walsh porter who occasionally resided in it till his death in 1809  craven cottage was considered the prettiest specimen of cottage architecture then existing the three principal receptionrooms were equally remarkable for their structure as well as their furniture  the centre or principal saloon supported by large palmtrees of considerable size exceedingly well executed with their drooping foliage at the top supporting the cornice and architraves of the room  the other decorations were in corresponding taste  the furniture comprised a lion’s skin for a hearthrug for a sofa the back of a tiger the supports of the tables in most instances were four twisted serpents or hydras in fact the whole of the decorations of the room were of a character perfectly unique and uniform in their style  this room led to a large gothic diningroom of very considerable dimensions and on the front of the former apartment was a very large oval rustic balcony opposed to which was a large halfcircular library that became more celebrated afterwards as the room in which the highlygifted and talented author of ‘pelham’ wrote some of his most celebrated works  craven cottage was the residence of the right hon sir e bulwerlytton from whom it passed to mr baylis now of thames bank who parted with it to sir ralph howard its present occupant who removed the door shown in the annexed cut through which the library is seen              picture door of egyptian hall at craven cottage  returning to church lane we come out at the bridge built in 1729 and close to which is willow bank the late residence of mr delafield and general conyers  the ferry belonged to the see of london and it was necessary that the consent of the bishops should be had for the erection of the bridge and consequent destruction of their ferry it was therefore stipulated for the right of themselves their families and all their dependents that they should pass over the bridge toll free which right exists at the present time and passengers are often very much astonished at hearing the exclamation of “bishop” shouted out by the stentorian lungs of bricklayers carpenters or others who may be going to the palace that being the password for the privilege of going over  the architect of the bridge was the eminent surgeon w cheselden who died in 1752 and is buried in the graveyard attached to chelsea hospital  his tomb is close to the railings of the new road leading from sloane street to the suspension bridge at chelsea  cheselden was for many years surgeon of chelsea hospital                          picture the swan tavern  standing by the ferry is the swan tavern a characteristic old house with a garden attached looking on to the river and scarcely altered in any of its features since chatelaine published his views of “the most agreeable prospects near london” about 1740  it is a good specimen of a waterside inn and appears to have been erected about the time of william iii  at the foot of the bridge is ‘the eight bells’ publichouse where the fulham omnibuses leave for london                     picture approach to putney bridge  bridge street brings us to the point at which we turned off at the termination of the high street and on the righthand side as we look towards london is church street formerly windsor street according to faulkner leading up to the ship tavern and thence into the king’s road  the charity school is in church street  this building was erected in 1811  retracing our steps towards london we come to the george at walham green which turns off to the left  the church stands on the right hand side  opposite walham house near the church is north end lodge the residence of the late mr albert smith and where he died on the 23rd may 1860  as novelist dramatist and lecturer he had achieved considerable reputation and his unexpected death at the early age of fortyfour brought to a sudden close the most popular monologue entertainment of this or of any time  mr smith was an amusing writer and a most genial companion and was ever ready to assist a professional brother in the hour of need  against the brick wall close to the gate of north end lodge is a slab with the inscription “from hyde park corner 3 miles 17 yards”  we are now in north end where there are many houses of interest which deserve attention we will therefore go out of the direct road and return to london by way of north end     chapter vi       north end  north end may be described as a series of residences on each side the lane more than a mile in length which runs from the church at walham green to the main road from kensington to hammersmith  there were but few houses in it when faulkner published his map in 1813  market gardens were on both sides the road and the gardeners cottagers were very old picture panelled door the panelled door here represented was fitted to one of them and evidently was fashioned in the seventeenth century the celebrated bookseller jacob tonson lived for some time at north end  at york cottage which is on the right hand side of the road about a quarter of a mile from the church resided for many years mr j b pyne the landscape painter  at a short distance beyond the road from old brompton crosses into fulham fields  here at one corner is a house hermitage lodge which was originally constructed as stables to the residence of foote the dramatist and comedian 196 which still stands on the opposite side of the road leading to brompton and where he lived for many years expending large sums upon its improvement  it is now called “the hermitage” and is completely surrounded by a large garden enclosed by high walls             picture hermitage lodge 1844 and the hermitage  exactly opposite to this house in the angle of the road stands an old house in a moderatesized garden cambridge lodge  francis bartolozzi the celebrated engraver who arrived in england in 1764 came to reside here in 1777  he was born at florence in 1730 and died at lisbon in 1813  his son gaetano bartolozzi father to the late madame vestris was born in 1757 and died august 25th 1813  passing up the road beside market gardens is the old garden wall of normand house with some curious brick gates now closed in the house is very old the date 1661 is in the centre arch over the principal gateway and it is said to have been used as a hospital for persons recovering from the great plague in 1665  picture bartolozzi’s house sir e bulwer lytton has resided here  in 1813 “it was appropriated for the reception of insane ladies” faulkner and it is now a lunatic asylum for ladies with the name of “talfourd” on a brass plate  a little further on the road out of which we have turned is a cottage to the right named wentworth cottage  here mr and mrs s c hall once resided  the willow in front of the cottage was planted by them from a slip of that over the grave of napoleon at st helena  the land opposite this cottage is now to be let on building lease  this district now known as “fulham fields” was formerly called “no man’s land” and according to faulkner the local historian contained in 1813 “about six houses”  one of these was “an ancient house once the residence of the family of plumbe” which was pulled down about twentythree years ago and replaced by a cluster of dwellings for the labourers in the surrounding market gardens which extend from walham green nearly to the thames in a northwest direction “the north end road” as it is called forming the eastern boundary of “fulham fields”  to establish the connection of sylvester’s lines quoted in the late mr crofton croker’s paper on the “golden lion” with this locality the antiquary who pointed it out observed that—      “our poet had an uncle named william plumbe who resided at north     end fulham having married the widow of john gresham the second son     of sir john gresham who was lord mayor of london in 1547 and which     lady was the only daughter and heir of edward dormer of fulham  here     it was while visiting his uncle that sylvester formed the     attachment which is the subject of his poem see the folio edition of     his works 1621  uncle plumbe had been a widower and from     monuments which exist or existed in the parish church of fulham     appears to have departed this life on the 9th february 1593–4 aged     sixty  in the previous may his widow had lost her son edmund or     edward gresham at the age of sixteen and seriously touched by the     rapid proofs of mortality within her house from which the hand of     death had within twelve months removed both a husband and a child     made preparations for her own demise by recording her intention to     repose beside their remains and to her husband’s memory she raised     in fulham church a monument ‘of alabaster inlaid and ornamented     with variouscoloured marble’ leaving a space after her name for the     insertion of the date of her death and age which appear never to     have been supplied”  the arms of “dormer impaled with gresham” we are told remain “those of plumbe are gone”  sylvester’s “triumph of faith” is consecrated “to the grateful memory of the first kind fosterer of our tender muses by my never sufficiently honoured dear uncle w plumb esq”  it is not our intention to linger over the recollections connected with the age of elizabeth in fulham fields or at north end although there can be no doubt that a little research might bring some curious local particulars to light connected with the history of the literature the drama and the fine arts of that period  the gardens here provide the london markets with a large supply of vegetables  a very primitive form of drawwell was common here consisting of a pole balanced horizontally on an upright the bucket being affixed to a rope at one end  picture drawwell the pole is pulled downward for the bucket to descend the well and when filled is raised by the weight of wood attached to the opposite end of the pole this mode of raising water is still in use in the east and wilkinson in his ‘manners and customs of the ancient egyptians’ series i vol ii p 4 has engraved representations of this machine from paintings on the walls of thebes of the time of the pharaohs  picture cottage in fulham fields in “fulham fields” are still standing many old cottages inhabited by marketgardeners  a sketch taken in 1844 of one of the best examples then existing is here given as a specimen  a little beyond “wentworth cottage” the road branches off the turning to the right going to hammersmith and that to the left leading to fulham  hammersmith was a part of fulham until 1834 when it was formed into a separate parish by act of parliament  picture elm house returning to the lane at north end immediately beyond bartolozzi’s house is an old wall apparently of the time of charles ii enclosing a tall peculiarlooking house now called elm house once the residence of cheeseman the engraver of whom little is known except that he was a pupil of bartolozzi and lived in newman street about thirty years ago  he is said to have been very fond of music and having a small independence and less ambition he was content to engrave but little and with his violoncello and musical friends passed a very happy life  a little further on the opposite side of the road stood walnuttree cottage pulled down in 1846 once the residence of edmund kean and also of copley the artist which took its name from the tree in the forecourt  picture walnuttree cottage we then come to the north end sunday and day schools erected in 1857  the road here curves round by the wall of kensington hall a large mansion on the right built by slater the wellknown butcher of kensington and it has been called in consequence slater’s mansion  it is at present a school kept by mr and mrs johnson but it is to be let or sold  a little further to the left is deadman’s lane  here in the midst of garden grounds stands a venerable and isolated fabric which would appear to have been built in the reign of james i  this lane leads to hammersmith but a more agreeable way has been made opposite edith villas called edith road  the land is to be let on building lease and here once stood the house of cipriani the painter  picture cipriani’s house cipriani was born at florence in 1727 and died in london in 1785  he came to england in 1755 and he was one of the members of the royal academy at its foundation in 1769 when he was employed to make the design for the diploma given to academicians and associates on their admission which was engraved by bartolozzi  the character and works of this artist are thus described by fuseli “the fertility of his invention the graces of his composition and the seductive elegance of his forms were only surpassed by the probity of his character the simplicity of his manners and the benevolence of his heart”  a few plates were engraved by himself after his own designs  another curve of the road brings us to the site of dr crotch’s house where a row of houses called grove cottages have been built  picture dr crotch’s house dr crotch was in 1797 at the early age of twentytwo appointed professor of music in the university of oxford where he received the degree of doctor of music  in 1822 he was appointed principal of the royal academy of music  he performed for the last time in public in 1834 in westminster abbey during the royal festival and died 20th december 1847 while sitting at dinner  dr crotch has composed numerous pieces for the organ and pianoforte and published in 1812 ‘elements of musical composition and thorough bass’ and subsequently specimens of various styles of music of all ages  w wynne ryland the engraver lived in this house before dr crotch inhabited it  opposite where dr crotch’s house formerly stood facing a turning which is called on one side lawn terrace on the other ashton terrace is a large brick mansion inhabited by richardson the novelist before his removal to parson’s green  it is of the period of william iii the appearance of which may be recognized from the annexed sketch  in the garden was a summerhouse in which the novelist wrote before the family were up and he afterwards at the breakfast table communicated the progress of his story  picture house of richardson how little the exterior has been altered in the last fifty years a comparison of this sketch made in 1844 with the print prefixed to the 4th volume of richardson’s ‘correspondence’ will show at a glance  sir richard phillips’s print was published by him may 26 1804  then as now this mansion was divided into two houses and the half nearest to the eye was that occupied by the novelist the other half was the residence of a mr vanderplank a name which frequently occurs in ‘richardson’s correspondence’  richardson’s house has been subsequently inhabited by the late sir william and lady boothby the latter better known to the public as that charming actress mrs nisbett  a few extracts from ‘richardson’s correspondence’ may here prove interesting  one of the most romantic incidents in the businesslike and hospitable life of richardson was his correspondence with and introduction to lady bradshaigh the wife of a lancashire baronet whom he tried to prevail upon to visit him at north end  after the appearance of the fourth volume of clarissa harlowe a lady who signed herself belfour wrote to richardson stating a report that prevailed that the history of clarissa was to terminate in a most tragical manner and requesting that her entreaties may avert so dreadful a catastrophe  this correspondence with mrs belfour commenced in october 1748 and she thus concludes her letter to the novelist her ladyship taking care to mystify her identity by giving her address postoffice exeter although resident at haigh in lancashire  “if you disappoint me” she writes “attend to my curse”      “may the hatred of all the young beautiful and virtuous for ever be     your portion and may your eyes never behold anything but age and     deformity  may you meet with applause only from envious old maids     surly bachelors and tyrannical parents may you be doomed to the     company of such and after death may their ugly souls haunt you      “now make lovelace and clarissa unhappy if you dare      “perhaps you may think all this proceeds from a giddy girl of     sixteen but know i am past my romantic time of life though young     enough to wish two lovers happy in a married state  as i myself am     in that class it makes me still more anxious for the lovely pair  i     have a common understanding and middling judgment for one of my     sex which i tell you for fear you should not find it out”  the correspondence thus commenced goes on until the vanity of richardson induces him to describe to his unknown correspondent his private circumstances and to a hint given in the january following by lady bradshaigh of her intention to visit london before she is a year older when she “shall long to see” mr richardson and “perhaps may contrive that though unknown to him” he replies—      “but do not my dear correspondent still let me call you so say     that you will see me unknown to myself when you come to town     permit me to hope that you will not be personally a stranger to me     then”  this is followed by an acknowledgment from madame belfour that she is not his “devonshire lady” having but very little knowledge of the place though she has a friend there observing archly “lancashire if you please” adding an invitation if he is inclined to take a journey of two hundred miles with the promise of “a most friendly reception from two persons who have great reason to esteem” him “a very valuable acquaintance”  richardson responded to this invitation by another—      “but i will readily come into any proposal you shall make to answer     the purpose of your question and if you will be so cruel as to keep     yourself still incognito will acquiesce  i wish you would accept of     our invitation on your coming to town  but three little miles from     hyde park corner  i keep no vehicle”  this was before the age of omnibuses      —“but one should be at yours and at your dear man’s command as long     as you should both honour us with your presence  you shall be only     the sister the cousin the niece—the what you please of my     incognito and i will never address you as other than what you choose     to pass for  if you knew madam you would not question that i am in     earnest on this occasion the less question it as that at my little     habitation near hammersmith i have common conveniences though not     splendid ones to make my offer good”  richardson in the letter from which this passage has been extracted is again led away by his vanity into a description of his person and very plainly hints at a meeting in the park through which he goes “once or twice a week to” his “little retirement”  he describes himself as      “short rather plump than emaciated about five foot five inches     fair wig lightish cloth coat all black besides one hand generally     in his bosom the other a cane in it which he leans upon under the     skirts of his coat usually that it may imperceptibly serve him as a     support when attacked by sudden tremors or startings and dizziness”        “of a lightbrown complexion teeth not yet failing him     smoothish faced and ruddy cheeked at some times looking to be about     sixtyfive at other times much younger a regular even pace     stealing away ground rather than seeming to get rid of it a grey     eye too often overclouded by mistiness from the head by chance     lively—very lively it will be if he have hope of seeing a lady whom     he loves and honours his eye always on the ladies”—and so on  in return to this description lady bradshaigh on the 16th december 1749 half promises a meeting in an appointed place for she tells the elderly gentleman with “a grey eye too often overclouded by mistiness from the head” but “by chance lively” “that she will attend the park every fine warm day between the hours of one and two  i do not” adds this perfect specimen of a literary coquette      “say this to put you in the least out of your way or make you stay a     moment longer than your business requires for a walk in the park is     an excuse she uses for her health and as she designs staying some     months in town if she misses you one day she may have luck another”  and lady bradshaigh proceeds to present as if in ridicule of richardson’s portrait as drawn by himself her own      “in surprise or eagerness she is apt to think aloud and since you     have a mind to see her who has seen the king i give you the     advantage of knowing she is middle aged middle sized a degree above     plump brown as an oak wainscot a good deal of country red in her     cheeks altogether a plain woman but nothing remarkably forbidding”  any one might think that a meeting would immediately have followed these communications and that the novelwriter and the novelreader would have presented themselves to each other’s gaze for admiration at the time and place appointed and thus the affair which their letters have left upon record might have been satisfactorily wound up in one volume  but this did not accord with the sentimental typographical taste of the times which required the dilution of an idea into seven or eight volumes to make it palatable  for we are told that a young cantab who when asked if he had read clarissa replied “dn it i would not read it through to save my life” was set down as an incurable dunce  and that a lady reading to her maid whilst she curled her hair the seventh volume of clarissa the poor girl let fall such a shower of tears that they wetted her mistress’s head so much she had to send her out of the room to compose herself  upon the maid being asked the cause of her grief she said “oh madam to see such goodness and innocence in such distress” and her lady rewarded her with a crown for the answer  january the 9th 1749–50 has arrived—the tantalizing lady bradshaigh the unknown mrs belfour has been in london six weeks and the novelist begins “not to know what to think” of his fair correspondent’s wish to see him  “may be so” he writes      “but with such a desire to be in town three weeks on the 16th     december to be in sight of my dwelling and three weeks more to     elapse yet i neither to see or hear of the lady it cannot be that     she has so strong a desire”  let any one imagine the ridiculousness of the situation of “dear good excellent mr richardson” at this time  he had he confesses      “such a desire to see one who had seen the king that” he speaking     of himself says “though prevented by indisposition from going to my     little retirement on the saturday that i had the pleasure of your     letter i went into the park on sunday it being a very fine day in     hopes of seeing such a lady as you describe contenting myself with     dining as i walked on a sea biscuit which i had put in my pocket my     family at home all the time knowing not what was become of me—a     quixotte      “last saturday being a fine warm day in my way to north end i     walked backwards and forwards in the mall till past your friend’s     time of being there she preparing possibly for the court being     twelfth night and i again was disappointed”  on the 28th january nineteen days after this was written lady bradshaigh in a letter full of satirical banter which however it may be questionable if richardson did not receive as replete with the highest compliments to his genius says      “indeed sir i resolved if ever i came to town to find out your     haunts if possible and i have not ‘said anything that is not’ nor     am at all naughty in this respect for i give you my word endeavours     have not been wanting  you never go to public places  i knew not     where to look for you without making myself known except in the     park which place i have frequented most warm days  once i fancied i     met you i gave a sort of a fluttering start and surprised my     company but presently recollected you would not deceive me by     appearing in a grey instead of a whitish coat besides the cane was     wanting otherwise i might have supposed you in mourning”  could anything exceed this touch about “a grey instead of a whitish coat” except the finishing one of the “mole upon your left cheek”      “to be sure on the saturday you mention i was dressing for court as     you supposed and have never been in the park upon a sunday but you     cannot be sure that i have not seen you  how came i to know that you     have a mole upon your left cheek  but not to make myself appear more     knowing than i am i’ll tell you sir that i have only seen you in     effigy in company with your clarissa at mr highmore’s where i     design making you another visit shortly”  all this and much more is followed by a most tantalizing and puzzling ps to poor richardson  his fair or rather “brown as an oakwainscot with a good dealofcountryred in her cheeks” correspondent requests him “to direct only to c l and enclose it to miss j to be left at mrs g’s” etc etc previously observing that “whenever there happens to be a fine saturday i shall look for you in the park that being the day on which i suppose you are called that way”  roused into desperation richardson on the 2nd february writes to mrs belfour as follows—      “what pains does my unkind correspondent take to conceal herself     loveless thought himself at liberty to change names without act of     parliament  i wish madam that lovelace—‘a sad dog’ said a certain     lady once ‘why was he made so wicked yet so agreeable’      “disappointed and chagrined as i was on friday night with the return     of my letter directed to miss j rejected and refused to be taken     in at mrs g’s and with my servant’s bringing me word that the     little book i sent on thursday night with a note in it was also     rejected and the porter whom i have never since seen or heard of     nor of the book dismissed with an assurance that he must be wrong     my servant being sent from one mrs g to another mrs g at     millbank yet i resolved to try my fortune on saturday in the park in     my way to north end  the day indeed thought i is not promising     but where so great an earnestness is professed and the lady possibly     by this time made acquainted with the disappointment she has given     me who knows but she will be carried in a chair to the park to make     me amends and there reveal herself  three different chairs at     different views saw i  my hope therefore not so very much out of     the way but in none of them the lady i wished to see  up the mall     walked i down the mall and up again in my way to north end  o     this dear willo’wisp thought i when nearest furthest off  why     should i at this time of life  no bad story the consecrated rose     say what she will and all the spiteful things i could think of i     muttered to myself  and how madam can i banish them from my     memory when i see you so very careful to conceal yourself when i     see you so very apprehensive of my curiosity and so very little     confiding in my generosity  o madam you know me not you will not     know me      “yesterday at north end your billet apologizing for the     disappointment was given me  lud lud what a giddy appearance     thought i  o that i had half the life the spirit of anything worth     remembering i could make memorandums      “shall i say all i thought  i will not  but if these at last reach     your hands take them as written as they were by friday night and     believe me to be                                                                     “madam                                          “your admirer and humble servant                                                           “s richardson”  sir walter scott says that “the power of richardson’s painting of his deeper scenes of tragedy has never been and probably never will be excelled” and in mrs inchbald’s ‘life of richardson’ we read that “as a writer he possessed original genius and an unlimited command over the tender passions”  he carried on a foreign literary correspondence and was on terms of intimacy with many eminent and literary persons of his time particularly dr young dr johnson aaron hill and arthur onslow esq speaker of the house of commons  a short distance further on we enter the hammersmith road opposite a tavern called “the bell and anchor” which stands beside the turnpike and passing about twenty shops on the left towards hammersmith we notice in the forecourt of a house called “the cedars” two noble cedar trees of immense girth one of which is represented in the accompanying cut this was formerly the residence of sir james branscomb who according to faulkner “in his early days had been a servant to the earl of gainsborough and afterwards for upwards of forty years carried on a lottery office in holborn  he was a commoncouncilman of the ward of farringdon without and received the honour of knighthood during his shrievalty”  the house has been a ladies’ boardingschool for many years  from the kensington road we can return direct to london having in this chapter departed from our even course on the fulham road for the purpose of visiting the north end district              picture tree in the forecourt of “the cedars”     chapter vii   the pryor’s bank fulham  nestling in trees beneath the old tower of fulham church which has been judiciously restored by mr george godwin there may be seen from putney bridge a remarkable group of houses the most conspicuous of which will be conjectured from a passing glance to belong to the gothic tribe  this house which has been a pet kind of place of the strawberry hill class is called the pryor’s bank and its history can be told in much less than one hundredth part of the space that a mere catalogue of the objects of interest which it has contained would occupy  in fact the whole edifice from the kitchen to the bedrooms was a few years since a museum arranged with a view to pictorial effect and if it had been called “the museum of british antiquities” it would have been found worthy of the name  in a print published about forty years since by j edington 64 gracechurch street of fulham church as seen from the river the ancient aspect of the modern pryor’s bank is preserved  picture fulham church the situation of this humble residence having attracted the fancy of mr walsh porter he purchased it raised the building by an additional story replaced its latticed casements by windows of coloured glass and fitted the interior with grotesque embellishments and theatrical decorations  the entrance hall was called the robber’s cave for it was constructed of material made to look like large projecting rocks with a winding staircase and mysterious inandout passages  picture vine cottage one of the bedrooms was called not inaptly the lion’s den the diningroom represented on a small scale the ruins of tintern abbey and here mr porter had frequently the honour of receiving and entertaining george iv when prince of wales  it was then called vine cottage 213 and having been disposed of by mr porter became in 1813 the residence of lady hawarden and subsequently of william holmes esq mp who sold it to mr baylis and mr lechmere whitmore about 1834  by them a luxurious vine which covered the exterior was cut down and the cottage named after it replaced by a modern antique house  mr baylis being a zealous antiquary his good taste induced him to respect neglected things when remarkable as works of art and inspired him and his friend mr whitmore with the wish to collect and preserve some of the many fine specimens of ancient manufacture that had found their way into this country from the continent as well as to rescue from destruction relics of old england  in the monuments and carvings which had been removed from dilapidated churches and in the furniture which had been turned out of the noble mansions of england—the “halls” and “old places”—mr baylis saw the tangible records of the history of his country and desirous of upholding such memorials he gleaned a rich harvest from the lumber of brokers’ shops and saved from oblivion articles illustrative of various tastes and periods that were daily in the course of macadamisation or of being consumed for firewood  the materials thus acquired were freely used by him in the construction of a new building upon the site of vine cottage and adapted with considerable skill but when neither the vine nor the cottage were in existence it appeared to mr baylis ridiculous to allow a misnomer to attach itself to the spot  after due deliberation therefore respecting the situation upon a delightful bank of gravel and the association which an assemblage of ecclesiastic carvings and objects connected with “monkish memories” there collected were likely to produce upon the mind the new house was styled the “pryor’s bank”  as horace walpole’s villa was celebrated by the earl of bath so the charms of the pryor’s bank have been sung in “the last new ballad on the fulham regatta”—a jeu d’esprit circulated at an entertainment given by the hospitable owners in 1843—     “strawberry hill has pass’d away    every house must have its day    so in antiquarian rank    up sprung here the pryor’s bank    full of glorious tapestry—    full as well as house can be    and of carvings old and quaint    relics of some mitr’d saint    ’tis—i hate to be perfidious—    ’tis a house most sacrilegious     “glorious glowing painted glass    what its beauty can surpass    shrines bedeck’d with gems we see    overhung by canopy    of embroider’d curtains rare—    wondrous works of time and care    up stairs down stairs in the hall    there is something great or small    to attract the curious eye    into it to rudely pry     “here some niche or cabinet    full of rarities is set    here some picture—‘precious bit’—    there’s no time to dwell on it    bronzes china—all present    each their own sweet blandishment    but what makes our pleasure here    is our welcome and our cheer    so i’ll not say one bit more—    long live baylis and whitmore”  i would endeavour to convey some idea of the pryor’s bank and its now dispersed treasures as they were in 1840 in which year we will suppose the reader to accompany us through the house and grounds but before entering the house i would call attention to a quiet walk along the gardenterrace laved to its verdant slope by the brimming thames picture terrace at pryor’s bank suppose then we leave those beautiful climbing plants—they are chilian creepers that so profusely wanton on the sunny wall—and turning sharply round an angle of the river front cut at once by the most direct walk the parties who in luxurious idleness have assembled about the garden fountain and lest such folk should attempt to interrupt us in our sober purpose let us not stop to see or admire anything until we reach the baywindow summerhouse at the end of the terrace  “how magnificent are those chestnuttrees” i hear you exclaim “and this old baywindow”  ay this summerhouse which shelters us and those noble balusters which protect the northern termination of the terrace how many thoughts do they conjure up in the mind  picture fountain at pryor’s bank these balusters belonged to the main staircase of winchester house  do you remember winchester house in broad street in the good city of london the residence of “the loyal paulets”  perhaps not  there is however a print of its last appearance in the ‘gentleman’s magazine’ for april 1839 and by which you will at once identify this summerhouse as the baywindow of the principal apartment  indeed the editor tells you that “the greater part of the remaining ornamental woodwork has been purchased by thomas baylis esq fsa who is fitting up with it the kitchen and some of the new rooms of his house pryor’s bank fulham”  it is stated in the same magazine that in 1828 the motto of the paulets aymes loyaulte was to be seen in the windows of the principal apartment on the first floor in yellow letters disposed in diagonal stripes which motto it is added “was probably put there by the loyal marquis of winchester in the time of charles i by whom the same sentence was inscribed in every window of his residence at basing house in hants which he so gallantly defended against the parliamentarians” 218  now is it not more probable that the recollection of this motto in the windows of his paternal mansion conveyed through the medium of coloured glass indelibly stamped by sunshine or daguerreotyped as we might term it upon the youthful mind of the gallant marquis those feelings of devoted loyalty which influenced his after conduct and led him to inscribe with the point of his diamond ring the same motto upon the windows of basing house  picture turn buckle be this as it may it is gratifying to know that many of the panes of glass which bore that glorious yellow letter motto in winchester house at the period when it was doomed to be taken down are preserved having been with good taste presented to the present marquis of winchester and two or three which were overlooked have come into the possession of lord adolphus fitzclarence  but much of the diamondshaped glass in this baywindow as it stood upon the terrace of the pryor’s bank was ancient and very curious  you could not fail to remark the quaint windowlatch termed “a turn buckle”  had we time to linger here how amusing it might be to attempt to decipher the monograms and names and verses inscribed upon the various lozengeshaped panes of glass which practically exemplified the phrase of “diamond cut diamond”  the fragments of the old royal exchange with a burmese crosslegged idol perched thereon—the urn to the memory of “poor banquo” the greenhouse with its billiardtable and even an alcove the most charming spot in “the wide world” to talk sentiment in must not detain us from returning to another angle of the river front after picture alcove and angle of the river front glancing at which we enter the outer hall or passage wainscoted with oak and lined above with arras separated from the inner hall by an oak screen which was usually guarded upon gala nights by most respectable “beefeaters” who required the production of invitation picture inner hall with oak screen cards from all visitors  they permit us to pass without question and that is a very proper example for you to follow and a good reason why you should not question me too closely—           “do you think that i    came here to be the pryor’s bank directory”  you must use your own eyes and judge for yourself  i will tell you however all that i know as briefly as possible and point out whatever occurs to me in our scamper for a scamper it can only be termed just such a kind of run as a person makes through london who has come up by railroad to see all its wonders in a week  but i cannot allow you to examine so closely that curiously carved oak chimneypiece in the inner hall although i admit that it may be as early as henry viii’s time and those interesting old portraits  where shall we begin  you wish to inspect everything  suppose then we commence with the kitchen and steam it upstairs to the dormitories going at the rate of a highpressure engine  you are already aware that the kitchen was panelled with oak from the drawingroom of winchester house and now you see the whole style of fittingup accords with that of “bygone days”  look for instance towards the kitchen window and you will find that the various cupboards presses and dressers—even the cooking utensils—correspond but although modern improvements have not been lost sight of antique forms have been retained  let one example suffice that of an ancient gridiron of beautiful and elaborate workmanship               picture kitchen window and ancient gridiron  the history of the plates and dishes displayed in this kitchen would afford an opportunity for a dissertation on the rise and progress of the fine arts in this country as they present most curious and important specimens of early drawing painting and poetry  the old english plate was a square piece of wood which indeed is not quite obsolete at the present hour  the improvement upon this primitive plate was a circular platter with a raised edge but there were also thin circular flat plates of beechwood in use for the dessert or confection and they were gilt and painted upon one side and inscribed with pious or instructive or amorous mottoes suited to the taste of the society in which they were produced  such circular plates are now well known to antiquaries under the name of “roundels” and were at one time generally supposed by them to have been used as cards for fortunetelling or playing with at questions and answers  more sober research into their origin and use shows that they were painted and decorated with conventional patterns by nuns who left blank spaces for the mottoes to be supplied by the more learned monks and a set of these roundels generally consisted of twelve as specimens of the style of these mottoes about the time of henry vii or viii the following may be taken—     “wheresoever thou traveleste       este weste northe or southe    learne never to looke       a geven horsse in the mouthe”     “in friends ther ys flattery       in men lyttell trust    thoughe fayre they proffer       they be offten unjuste”  there are many sets of verses for roundels extant in manuscript and a few have been printed indeed it appears likely that to the love for this species of composition we owe tusser’s “five hundred points of good husbandry” and most of his other admonitory verses  after the reformation coloured prints superseded the painted and manuscript “poesies” of the nuns and monks and the elder de passe and other artists of the period of james i and charles i produced a variety of oval and circular engravings which were pasted upon roundels and varnished over  the subjects generally selected were those which naturally arranged themselves into a set of twelve as the months  by the puritans the beechen roundels thus decorated were regarded with especial dislike and they returned to the use of the unadorned trencher and “godly platter”  when the “merry monarch” was restored he brought over with him from holland plates and dishes manufactured at delft where the porcelain known as faenza faience majolica and fynlina ware made during the fifteenth century in the north of italy and upon the embellishments of which according to lamartinière the pencils of raffaelle giulio romano and the caracci were employed had been successfully although coarsely imitated  and it must be confessed that many of the old dutch plates dishes and bowls upon the kitchenshelves of the pryor’s bank deserved to be admired for boldness of design effective combinations of colour and the manual dexterity displayed in the execution of the patterns  the superior delicacy of the porcelain of china which about this time began to be imported freely into england from the east caused it to be preferred to the “dutch ware” and the consequence of international commerce was that the chinese imitated european devices and patterns upon their porcelain probably with the view of rendering the article more acceptable in the dutch and english markets  but while the chinese were imitating us we were copying their style of art in the potteries of staffordshire with the commercial manufacturing advantage given by the power of transferring a print to the clay over the production of the same effect by means of the pencil an idea no doubt suggested by our roundels of charles i’s time and which process became of the same relative importance as printing to manuscript this was the origin of our common blueandwhite plate or what is known as “the willow pattern” where     “walking through their groves of trees       blue bridges and blue rivers    little think those three chinese       they’ll soon be smash’d to shivers”  the popularity of this porcelain pattern must not be ascribed to superior beauty or cheapness for to the eye of taste surely a pure plain white plate is infinitely superior to an unfeeling copy of a chinese pagoda bridge and willowtree “in blue print”  the fact is that the bugbear of a vulgar mind—“fashion”—long rendered it imperative upon every good housewife and substantial householder to keep up a certain dinnerset of earthenware consisting of two souptureens and a relative proportion of dishes and vegetabledishes with covers soupplates dinnerplates and dessertplates which were all to correspond and should any accidental breakage of crockery take place it was a manufacturing trick to make it a matter of extraproportionate expense and difficulty readily to replace the same unless it happened to be of “the blue willow pattern”  the practice however of using for the dessertservice plates of worcester china painted by hand and the execution of many of which as works of art call for our admiration as much as any enamel created a taste for forming what are called harlequin sets among which if a few plates happen to be      “smash’d to shivers”  the value of the whole set is only proportionately depreciated and what has been broken may perhaps be advantageously replaced                           picture earl of essex  if you like we will return to the inner hall where is a portrait of the celebrated earl of essex an undoubted original picture dated 1598 three years previous to his being beheaded zucchero and from it at once enter

prohibited from theft”  we are told that henry v delayed his army for a whole day to discover the thief who had stolen one  you may admire the pictures as much as you please they are odd and hardlooking portraits to my eye but they are historically curious and clever too for their age  picture pix or holy box could you only patiently listen to a discussion upon the characters of the originals of the portraits that have hung upon these walls or the volumes that have filled these shelves you might gain a deeper insight into the workings of the human heart than perhaps you would

of charles i and we also know from strype’s annals of the reformation that elizabeth visited eltham and passed some days there in 1559 and that she made her favourite sir christopher hatton keeper of the royal palace there  you should not disturb those books you will look in vain for the publication of george iii’s ‘illustration of shakspeare’ and corrected in the autograph of the king for a

and those exquisitelywrought silver clasps and dear old horace walpole’s books  we must enter the diningroom  here sit down in this monastic chair and look around you for five minutes  this chair mr baylis picked up in lincoln and the curtains beside it they came from strawberry hill and are of genuine spitalfields damask  there is no such damask to be had now  eighty years ago were these curtains manufactured and yet they are in most excellent condition  the greater portion of the gothic oak panelling around us originally formed the back of the stalls in the beautiful chapel of magdalen college oxford during the late repairs this panelling was removed and sold  much of it was purchased by the marquess of salisbury for hatfield house and the remainder mr baylis bought  more of the oak panelling in the room especially the elaboratelywrought specimens and the rich tracery work have been obtained from canterbury cathedral york minster st mary’s coventry and other churches                       picture ornate chimneypiece  the chimneypiece is a rich composition of ancient carving the canopy came from st michael’s church coventry and in the niches are some fine figures of the kings and queens of england  picture knight’s armour the fireback is an interesting relic as it is the original one placed in the great dininghall of burghley house by elizabeth’s minister whose arms are upon it with the date 1575  the sideboard with its canopy of oak assimilates with the fitting of the room and had upon its shelves a glittering display of ancient glass and early plate  salvers and cups of singular forms and beautiful shapes arose proudly up one above the other with dishes of raffaelle ware beneath them  but i cannot help seeing that the steelclad knight who keeps guard in a recess by the sideboard attracts more of your attention  picture leathern black jack and iron jug the effigy is an excellent suit of fluted armour of henry viith’s time and in the opposite recess those huge drinkingvessels are only an honest old english leathern black jack and an iron jug the former from st cross winchester the latter from the castle of some german baron and full of feudal character  as for the other relics in the diningroom i will only particularise two or three more and they are a pair of round and solid wellcarved pendents from the chancel of the church of stratfordonavon which have been removed from their original station immediately over the tomb of shakspeare and are now as you see inverted and used here as footstools      “think of that master brooke”  the other relic is that matchless piece of sculptured oak picture effigy in oak of emperor rudolph ii which represents the emperor rudolph ii the size of life five feet six inches in height and which was brought from aixlachapelle by the late sir herbert taylor  what may have been its former history i cannot tell you but it resembles in execution the exquisite gothic figures in the chimneypiece of the townhall at bruges and is of about the same height and size  are you willing to forsake the thoughtful soberness of antique oakpanelling for the tinsel of venetian gold and the richness of genoa velvet florentine tapestry and persian arras  if so we will ascend to the drawingrooms and gallery  but stay a moment and permit this lady and oddlydressed gentleman to pass us on their exit from the gallery where they have been rehearsing some charming entertainment for the evening or getting up some piece of fanciful mummery to amuse the idle guests who have congregated around the garden fountain  picture couple exiting from gallery the light is not favourable for seeing all the pictures that deserve inspection on the staircase—you had better ascend and now having reached the head of the semistaircase our course is along this lobby to the opposite doorway which is that of the drawingroom  let us enter at once and in our tour of the pryor’s bank regard the antedrawingroom as a kind of middle or passageroom belonging either to the gallery or the drawingroom  i admit that the arrangement of the house which however is very simple appears puzzling at first the reason of this is that the senses are often deceived from mirrors here and there being so judiciously arranged that they reflect at happy angles objects which would otherwise escape observation  it is impossible to convey an idea of the whole effect of the pryor’s bank made up as it has been of carvings of unrivalled richness grace and variety solemn and grotesque  statues are there some of the highest class of art others which belong to an early gothic period and yet an harmonious effect has been produced  where will you take up your position for a general view  at the other end or in the oriel window looking on the bishop’s walk                   picture oriel window  venetian table  now if it were not for that richly gilt venetian table the companion to which is in the possession of the earl of harrington we might have an excellent view of that magnificently embellished recess upon the merits of which mr baylis is commenting to another oddly equipped gentleman there certainly is something going forward in the fancydress way  on this venetian table stands a french astronomical clock upon it are silver medallions of louis xiii and xiv and among its ornaments the monograms of these monarchs appear  here is a group in ivory of bacchanals with attendant boys a genuine piece of fiamingo’s work cut from solid ivory and formerly in the collection of the vatican  here picture group in ivory tapestried recess come this way we may as well pick up something of the history of this tapestried recess the canopy and seats of which and the three other recesses in the drawingroom are fashioned out of the remains of a large throne or dais brought from florence and which had belonged to the medici family  the materials are of the richest possible kind being flowers of floss silk upon a groundwork of gold thread interspersed with silver  the effect produced by this combination is gorgeous in the extreme  “and those figures”  that nearest the eye is a statue of the emperor rudolph of hapsburgh admirably carved in oak the armour is of silver damasked with gold  the other figure and a corresponding one on the opposite side of the room represent gothic queens whose robes have been restored in the illuminated style of decoration  “and the tapestry in the recess”  listen to what mr baylis is saying  “thinking over it” remarked sir bulwer lytton to me “i have very little doubt but that my guess was right—that the fisherman is meant for antony and the lady for cleopatra it was a favourite story in the middle ages how antony wishing to surprise cleopatra with his success in angling employed a diver to fix fishes on his hook  cleopatra found him out and in turn employed a diver of her own to put waggishly a salt sea fish on his hook”  the story is in plutarch and the popularity of the anecdote may be seen by the use shakspeare makes of it  charmian says—           “’twas merry when    you wagered on your angling when your diver    did hang a salt fish on his hook which he    with fervency drew up” 235  it is no doubt correctly conjectured by sir bulwer lytton that many subjects in tapestry not scriptural have their explanation in plutarch the fashionable classic source of tale and legend for our fathers of the middle ages  shakspeare it need scarcely be observed depends on him for all his classic plots and he was no less a favourite on the continent than with us  if you observe the attitude and expression of cleopatra for so we will consider her you will perceive that there is something impressive as well as smiling about her which would suit the words she is supposed to have uttered when she had laughed sufficiently at the trick she played him and which to the best of my recollection ran thus “leave fishing to us smaller potentates your angling should be for cities and kingdoms”  every article of the furniture merits your attention  here is a venetian chair 236 it is one of a set of twentysix with a sofa brought from the gradenigo palace and is carved and gilt all over—the back and seat and cushions for the arms being genoa red velvet  picture venetian chair fourteen of these chairs with the sofa are in this room the other twelve were purchased by the earl of lonsdale  vases of dresden china marqueterie tables and a shrine see page 237 of gilt carved work at one end of the room reflected in mirrors of gigantic dimensions dazzle the senses and its ceiling studded with blue and gold pendants and its walls all painted over with quaint devices like the pages of a missal  also a magnificent gothic chimneypiece see page 238 of carrara marble fitted with brasswork of ormolu and chimneyglass  the chimney was removed from the grand gothicroom at carlton house and cost george iv many hundred pounds  indeed the drawingroom of the pryor’s bank seems to be more like some scene in an enchanted palace than in an everyday residence upon the bank of the river thames                              picture shrine  the anteroom is not less splendidly furnished  its ceiling is even more elaborately embellished than that of the drawingroom for the heads of mitred abbots jolly monks and demure nuns look down upon us from each intersection of the groining  a florentine cabinet see page 239 of mosaic work in lapis lazuli pietra dura topaz agates etc one of the finest specimens of the kind ever seen—it eventually came into the possession of mr hurst who asked fifteen hundred picture gothic chimneypiece guineas for it—a magnificent carved oak chimneypiece see page 240 chairs which belonged to queen elizabeth and among other pictures an undoubted one by janssen of “charles ii dancing at the hague” must not detain us although it be a duplicate of the celebrated picture in the possession of her majesty with which the history of this is completely identical both having been purchased from the same individual at the same period                       picture a florentine cabinet  “and that portrait of elizabeth”  it was given by charles ii to judge twysden  “and that other portrait”  yes it is lord monteagle not of exchequer documentary fame but of gunpowder plot notoriety  and there are portraits of katharine of aragon and prince arthur from strawberry hill  i positively cannot allow you to dwell on that chimneypiece of raffaelle design carved in oak and coloured in ultramarine and gold  i entirely agree with you in thinking it a pity that the picture carved oak chimneypiece vast labours of our ancestors—things upon which they bestowed so much time and thought—should be blown into oblivion by the mere breath of fashion  how much nobler is the fashion to respect cherish and admire them  and now we are again within the gallery and look upon the anteroom through the private entrance and in another second we might be within the baywindow of the gallery for place these sketches together at a right angle side by side and the part of the sofa which appears in one is only the continuation of the same seat in the other  but this must not make you think that the pryor’s bank is but a miniature affair or give you a contemptible idea of the size  you should rather take your general notion of the proportions of the gallery from a glance at that lady who is studying with so much attention the part she has undertaken to enact and look up as to the comparative height of the window at the top compartments made up of ancient picture baywindow  private entrance painted glass charged with the arms of some of the medieval kings of england among which you cannot fail to notice those of richard iii  those two elaboratelywrought lanterns which depend from the groined ceiling formerly hung in the gothic conservatory of carlton house and the recesses of the walls are adorned with eleven fulllength portraits of kings and queens of spain painted upon leather  look at those ebony and ivory couches and this ebony chair from which justice was formerly meted out by the dutch and english rules to the cingalese and see here this great chair so profusely carved and cushioned with rich black velvet worked with gold  picture black velvet chair it is said to have been the electoral coronation chair of saxony and the date assigned to it in the ‘builder’ is 1620  the armorial bearings embroidered upon the back would probably settle the question but i know little of foreign heraldry beyond the fact that sufficient attention is not paid to it in this country  attached to the gallery at the opposite end of the lobby from which we entered the drawingroom there is a boudoir or robingroom—a perfect gem in its way  picture nell gwynne’s mirror you have only to touch this spring and that picture starts from the wall and affords us free egress  just take one peep into this fairy boudoir  there hangs against the wall nell gwynne’s mirror in its curious frame of needlework  oh  you wish to take a peep at yourself in nelly’s lookingglass  odds fish mind you do not overset that basset table of japan manufacture—another strawberry hill relic  now are you satisfied those beautiful enamels and that charming bermudian brainstone the wonderful network of which infinitely exceeds the finest lace  well i must admit that some philosophy is required to feel satisfied when revelling among the ornaments of palaces the treasures of monasteries and the decorations of some of the proudest mansions of antiquity and did we not turn our eyes and regard the infinitely superior works of nature alike bountifully spread before the poor and the rich man the heart might feel an inward sickening at the question  in the state carvedoak bedroom is a finely carved walnutwood german cabinet of the true elizabethan period                picture german cabinet eizabethan period  though within the walls of the pryor’s bank or any other human habitation all that is rich in art may be assembled yet without the wish to turn these objects to a beneficial purpose they become only a load of care but when used to exalt and refine the national taste they confer an immortality upon the possessor and render him a benefactor to his species when used also as accessories to the cultivation of kindly sympathies and the promotion of social enjoyment they are objects of public utility  the revival of oldfashioned english cordiality especially at christmas had been always a favourite idea with the owners of the pryor’s bank and in 1839 they gave an entertainment which like     “o’rourke’s noble feast will ne’er be forgot    by those who were there or those who were not”  they were fortunate in securing the aid of theodore hook of pleasant and alas of painful memory who was their neighbour with that of some other friends and acquaintances who thoroughly entered into the whim of recalling olden times by the enactment of masques and other mummeries  hook in his manuscript journal of thursday the 26th of december 1839 notes that he was engaged to dine with lady quentin at kew—      “weather dreadful so resolved to write her an excuse and came home     in coach early so up to baylis’s where i was asked to dine  they     came here and we walked up together so to rehearsal and then back     again to bed”  hook’s letter in a feigned hand to mr baylis upon this occasion ran thus—      “sir—circumstancis hoeing too the fox hand wether in lunnun as     indered me of goen two q  wherefor hif yew plese i ham reddy to cum     to reersal two nite in ten minnits hif yew wil lett the kalboy hof     yewer theeter bring me wud—if you kant reed mi riten ax mister     kroften kroker wich his a hanty queerun like yewerself honly hee as     bin longer hatit           yewers two kommand                                                              “tee hee ook”            “master bailies hesquire              manger hof thee     trpb and halso proper rioter thereof”  on saturday hook records in his ‘diary’ his having refused his “firmest friend’s command” that he should dine with him—“because” writes hook “i cannot on account of the things to be done at pryor’s bank”  of the memorable monday the 30th of december hook notes—      “today not to town up and to baylis’s saw preparations  so     back wrote a little then to dinner afterwards to dress so to     pryor’s bank there much people—sir george and lady whitmore mrs     stopford mrs nugent the bully’s and various others to the amount     of 150  i acted the ‘great frost’ with considerable effect  jerdan     planché nichols holmes and wife lane crofton croker giffard     barrow  the whitmore family sang beautifully all went off well”  the part of the great frost to which hook alludes was in a masque written for the occasion and printed and sold in the rooms for the benefit of the royal literary fund and among the record of miscellaneous benefactions to this most admirable charity are registered—“christmas masquers and mummers at the pryor’s bank fulham the seat of thomas baylis esq fsa and william lechmere whitmore fsa 1840 £3 12s 6d”  thus carrying out in deed as well as act the benevolent feelings of the season  what little plot there was in this production had reference to the season the house in which it was performed and temporary events egomet an imp most piquantly personified by mr john barrow opened the affair in a moralising strain prophetically applicable to the moment  after stating who and what he was he starts—           “but i’m all over wonder    surely the kitchen must be somewhere under    but where’s the room—the matchless little chamber    with its dark ceiling and its light of amber—    that fairy den by price’s pencil drawn    enchantment’s dwellingplace  ’tis gone—’tis gone    the times are changed i said and men grown frantic    some cross in steamboats o’er the vast atlantic    some whirl on railroads and some fools there are    who book their places in the pendant car    of the great nassau—monstrous big balloon    poor lunatics they think they’ll reach the moon    all onward rush in one perpetual ferment    no rest for mortals till they find interment    old england is not what it once has been    dogs have their days and we’ve had ours i ween    the country’s gone cut up by cruel railroads    they’ll prove to many nothing short of jailroads    the spirit vile of restless innovation    at fulham e’en has taken up his station    i landed here on father thames’s banks    to seek repose and rest my wearied shanks    here on the grass where once i could recline    like a huge mushroom springs this mansion fine    astounding work but yesterday ’twas building    and now what armour carving painting gilding    vexed as i am yet loth to be uncivil    i only wish the owner at the ”  father thames mr giffard who had been slumbering between two painted boards respectively inscribed “middlesex county bank” and “surrey bank” and surrounded by flowerpots filled with bulrushes and sedge roused by the intended imprecation upon their host here interrupted egomet and entered into a long dialogue with him in which he detailed all his grievances so far as gas and steam were concerned  at length he feels the influence of hook as “the great frost” who turns     “the old blackguard to solid ice”  upon which egomet’s remark was that—     “the scene to oxford shifted in a trice is    this rivergod—no longer thames but isis”  father christmas mr crofton croker then appeared with a long speech about eating drinking and making merry and the wondrous power that a good fire and a cheerful glass have upon the heart  beholding “poor thames acold”—“an icy heartless river”—the question follows what           “do i the matter see    i’ll thaw you soon—begone to battersea    there let thy icebergs float in chelsea reach”  the great frost too after much buffoonery turns himself into      “a pleasant fall of fleecy snow”  which he effected by the vigorous use of the kitchen dredgingbox and an ample supply of flour therewith bepowdering jolly christmas father thames and egomet so plentifully as to leave no doubt upon the minds of the audience respecting the transformation  another christmas revel followed and then came “a grand tournament” in which a contest between “the blue knight” mr lechmere whitmore and “the yellow knight” mr baylis each mounted upon hobbyhorses was most fiercely executed  nor was the giant cormoran fourteen feet in height nor the queen of beauty nor the dragon queen wanted to complete the chivalry of this burlesque upon the memorable meeting at eglinton  the fun which now became      “fast and furious”  and to which an impudent but most amusing jester mr jerdan mainly contributed was checked only by the announcement of supper and as the guests descended the stairs from the gallery or assembled on the lobby they beheld their cheer borne in procession from the kitchen headed by a military band and a heraldatarms  a cook with his cap and apron of snowy whiteness placed a boar’s head      “bedeck’d with bays and rosemary”  upon the table then came two ancient halberdiers followed by a servingman in olden livery carrying the wassailbowl then another herald in his tabard and servitors with christmaspie and brawn and soup and turkey and sirloin of beef and collared brawn whereof was an abundant supply and of the most magnificent dimensions  father christmas carvingknife in hand and belted with mincepies and his attendant egomet with followers bearing holly ivy and mistletoe brought up the rear  then was sung “beautifully” as hook notes by four voices the oxford chant of      “the boar’s head in hand bear i”  and here we must drop the curtain but not without stating that several of the guests felt the enjoyment of the evening so warmly that it was in long debate among them what suitable acknowledgment in recollection of it should be made to mr baylis and mr whitmore and that the actors in the masque presented these gentlemen with an ancient charter horn which had belonged to the pickard family and which they were fortunate enough to secure  the height of this horn which is supposed to be that of the highland buffalo—an animal said to be extinct nearly three hundred years—is one foot two inches its length is one foot six inches its width at the top five and a half inches and it is capable of containing one gallon  upon this most gratifying memorial to the owners of the pryor’s bank of the esteem created by their hospitality suitable inscriptions were placed by the donors with the motto—     “while thames doth flow or wine is drank    parhæl to all at pryor’s bank          unchæl”  the remembrance of the pleasant hours passed within the walls of the pryor’s bank will not easily be forgotten though the character of the interior is changed since this was written  the first sale took place on the 3rd may 1841 and five following days and there was a subsequent sale on the 25th may 1854 and four following days  both these sales took place on the premises and the auctioneer on both occasions was mr deacon  pryor’s bank is now let to mr e t smith of her majesty’s and drury lane theatres     index of places   acacia
