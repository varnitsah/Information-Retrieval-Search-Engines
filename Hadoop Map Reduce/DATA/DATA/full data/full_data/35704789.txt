                     312     mrs cliffs yacht  chapter i  alone with her wealth   on a beautiful september afternoon in a handsome room of one of the grand uptown hotels in new york sat mrs cliff widow and millionaire  widow of a village merchant mistress of an unpretending house in the little town of plainton maine and by strange vicissitudes of fortune the possessor of great wealth she was on her way from paris to the scene of that quiet domestic life to which for nearly thirty years she had been accustomed  she was alone in the hotel her friends captain horn and his wife edna who had crossed the ocean with her had stayed but a few days in new york and had left early that afternoon for niagara and she was here by herself in the hotel waiting until the hour should arrive when she would start on a night train for her home  her position was a peculiar one altogether new to her she was absolutely independentnot only could she do what she pleased but there was no one to tell her what it would be well for her to do wise for her to do or unwise everything she could possibly want was within her reach and there was no reason why she should not have everything she wanted  for many months she had been possessed of enormous wealth but never until this moment had she felt herself the absolute untrammelled possessor of it until now captain horn to whom she owed her gold and the power it gave her had been with her or had exercised an influence over her until the time had come when he could avow the possession of his vast treasures it had been impossible for her to make known her share in them and even after everything had been settled and they had all come home together in the finest staterooms of a great ocean liner she had still felt dependent upon the counsels and judgment of her friends  but now she was left absolutely free and independent untrammelled uncounselled alone with her wealth  she rose and looked out of the window and as she gazed upon the crowd which swept up and down the beautiful avenue she could not but smile as she thought that she a plain new england countrywoman with her gray hair brushed back from her brows with hands a little hardened and roughened with many a year of household duties which had been to her as much a pleasure as a labor was in all probability richer than most of the people who sat in the fine carriages or strolled in their fashionable clothes along the sidewalk  if i wanted to do it she thought i could have one of those carriages with prancing horses and a driver in knee breeches or i could buy that house opposite with its great front steps its balconies and everything in it but there is nobody on this earth who could tempt me to live there  now said mrs cliff to herself as she turned from the window and selected a fresh easy chair and sank down into its luxurious depths there is nothing in this world so delightful as to go back rich to plainton to be rich in paris or new york is nothing to me it would simply mean that i should be a common person there as i used to be at home and for the matter of that a little more common  as the good ladys thoughts wandered northward and spread themselves from the railroad station at plainton all over the little town she was filled with a great content and happiness to go to her old home with her new money this was a joy beyond anything she had dreamed of as possible in this world  but it was the conjunction of the two which produced this delightful effect upon her mind the money anywhere else or plainton without it would not have made mrs cliff the happy woman that she was  it pleased her to let her mind wander over the incidents of her recent visit to her old home the most unhappy visit she had ever made in all her life but everything that was unpleasant then would help to make everything more delightful in the present homecoming  she thought of the mental chains and fetters she had worn when she went to plainton with plenty of money in her purse and a beautiful pair of california blankets in her handsome trunk when she had been afraid to speak of the one or to show the other when she had sat quietly and received charity from people whose houses and land furniture horses and cows she could have bought and given away without feeling their loss when she had been publicly berated by nancy shott for spending money on luxuries which should have been used to pay her debts when she had been afraid to put her money in the bank for fear it would act as a dynamite bomb and blow up the fortunes of her friends and when she could find no refuge from the miseries brought upon her by the necessity of concealing her wealth except to go to bed and cover up her head so that she should not hear the knock of some inquiring neighbor upon her front door  then when she had made this background as dark and gloomy as it was possible to make it she placed before it the glittering picture of her new existence in plainton  but this new life bright as it now appeared to her was not to be begun without careful thought and earnest consideration ever since her portion of the golden treasure had been definitely assigned to her the mind of mrs cliff had been much occupied with plans for her future in her old home  it was not to be altogether a new life all the friends she had in the world excepting captain and mrs horn lived in plainton she did not wish to lose these friendsshe did not wish to be obliged to make new ones with simpleminded and honest willy croup who had long lived with her and for her with mrs perley the ministers wife with all her old neighbors and friends she wished to live as she had always lived but of course with a difference how to manage arrange and regulate that difference was the great problem in her mind  one thing she had determined upon her money should not come between her and those who loved her and who were loved by her no matter what she might do or what she might not do she would not look down upon people simply because she was rich and oh the blessed thought which followed that there would be nobody who could look down upon her because she was not rich  she did not intend to be a fine new woman she did not intend to build a fine new house she was going to be the same mrs cliff that she used to beshe was going to live in the same house to be sure she would add to it she would have a new diningroom and a guests chamber over it and she would do a great many other things which were needed but she would live in her old home where she and her husband had been so happy and where she hoped he would look down from heaven and see her happy until the end of her days  as she thought of the things she intended to do and of the manner in which she intended to do them mrs cliff rose and walked the floor she felt as if she were a bird a commonsized bird perhaps but with enormous wings which seemed to grow and grow the more she thought of them until they were able to carry her so far and so high that her mind lost its power of directing them  she determined to cease to think of the future of what was going to be and to let her mind rest and quiet itself with what really existed here she was in a great city full of wonders and delights of comforts conveniences luxuries necessities and all within her power almost anything she could think of she might have almost anything she wanted to do she might do a feeling of potentiality seemed to swell and throb within her veins she was possessed of an overpowering desire to do something now this moment to try the power of her wealth  near her on the richly papered wall was a little button she could touch this and orderwhat should she order a carriage and prancing pair to take her to drive she did not wish to drive a cab to take her to the shops or an order to merchants to send her samples of their wares that here in her own room like a queen or a princess she might choose what she wanted and think nothing of the cost but no she did not wish to buy anything she had purchased in paris everything that she cared to carry to plainton  she went and stood by the electric button she must touch it and must have something her gold must give her an instant proof that it could minister to her desires but what should she ask for her mind travelled over the whole field of the desirable and yet not one salient object presented itself there was absolutely nothing that she could think of that she wished to ask for at that moment she was like a poor girl in a fairy tale to whom the good fairy comes and asks her to make one wish and it shall be granted and who stands hesitating and trembling not being able to decide what is the one great thing for which she should ask  so stood mrs cliff there was a fairy a powerful fairy in her service who could give her anything she desired and with all her heart she wanted to want something that minute what should she want  in her agitation she touched the bell half frightened at what she had done she stepped back and sat down in a few minutes there was a knock the door opened a servant entered bring me a cup of tea said mrs cliff     chapter ii  willy croup doesnt know   the next afternoon as the train approached plainton mrs cliff found herself a great deal agitated as she thought of the platform at the station who would be therehow should she be met with all her heart she hoped that there would not be anything like a formal reception and yet this was not improbable everybody knew she was coming everybody knew by what train she would arrive she had written to willy croup and she was very sure that everybody knew everything that she had written more than this everybody knew that she was coming home rich how rich they were not aware because she had not gone into particulars on this subject but they knew that the wealthy mrs cliff would arrive at 520 that afternoon and what were they going to do about it  when she had gone home before all her friends and neighbors and even distant acquaintancesif such people were possible in such a little townhad come to her house to bid her welcome and many of them had met her at the station but then they had come to meet a poor shipwrecked widow pitied by most of them and loved by many even those who neither pitied nor loved her had a curiosity to see her for she had been shipwrecked and it was not known in plainton how people looked after they had been wrecked  but now the case was so different that mrs cliff did not expect the same sort of greeting and she greatly feared formality if mr perley should appear on the platform surrounded by some of the leading members of his congregation and should publicly take her by the hand and bid her welcome home and if those who felt themselves entitled to do so should come forward and shake hands with her while others who might feel that they belonged to a different station in life should keep in the background and wait until she came to speak to them she would be deeply hurt  after all plainton and the people in it were dearer to her than anything else in the world and it would be a great shock if she should meet formality where she looked for cordial love she wanted to see mr perleyhe was the first person she had seen when she came home beforebut now she hoped that he would not be there she was very much afraid that he would make a stiff speech to her and if he did that she would know that there had been a great change and that the friends she would meet were not the same friends she had left she was almost afraid to look out of the window as the train slowed up at the station  the minds of the people of plainton had been greatly exercised about this homecoming of mrs cliff that afternoon it was probable that no other subject of importance was thought about or talked about in the town and for some days before the whole matter had been so thoroughly considered and discussed that the good citizens without really coming to any fixed and general decision upon the subject had individually made up their minds that no matter what might happen afterward they would make no mistake upon this very important occasion which might subsequently have an influence upon their intercourse with their old respected neighbor now millionnaire each one for himself or herself decidedsome of them singly and some of them in groupsthat as they did not know what sort of a woman mrs cliff had become since the change in her circumstances they would not place themselves in false positions other people might go and meet her at the station but they would stay at home and see what happened even mr perley thought it wise under the circumstances to do this  therefore it was that when mrs cliff stepped down upon the platform she saw no one there but willy croup if mrs cliff was a little shocked and a good deal surprised to find no one to meet her but that simpleminded dependant and relative her emotions were excited in a greater degree by the manner in which she was greeted by this old friend and companion  instead of rushing toward her with open armsfor willy was an impulsive person and given to such emotional demonstrationsmiss croup came forward extending a loosely filled black cotton glove her large lightblue eyes showed a wondering interest and mrs cliff felt that every portion of her visible attire was being carefully scanned  for a moment mrs cliff hesitated and then she took the hand of willy croup and shook it but she did not speak she had no command of words at least for greeting  willy earnestly inquired after her health and said how glad she was to see her but mrs cliff did not listen she looked about her for an instant she thought that possibly the train had come in ahead of time but this of course was absurdtrains never did that  willy she said her voice a little shaken has anything happened is anybody sick  oh no said willy everybody is well so far as i know i guess you are wondering why there is nobody here to meet you and i have been wondering at that too they must have thought that you did not want to be bothered when you were attending to your baggage and things is anybody with you  with me exclaimed mrs cliff who could be with me  oh i didnt know replied the other i thought perhaps you might have a maidservant or some of those black people you wrote about  mrs cliff was on the point of telling willy she was a fool but she refrained  here is the baggageman said willy and he wants your checks  as mrs cliff took the little pieces of brass from her purse and handed them to the man willy looked on in amazement  good gracious she exclaimed seven i guess you had to pay for extra baggage shall i get you a carriage and where do you want to be driven toto your own house or the hotel  now mrs cliff could not restrain herself what is the matter with you willy have you gone crazy she exclaimed of course i am going to my own house and i do not want any carriage did i ever need a carriage to take me such a short distance as that tell the man to bring some one with him to carry the trunks upstairs and then come on  let me carry your bag said willy as the two walked away from the station at a much greater pace it may be remarked than willy was accustomed to walk  no you shall not carry my bag said mrs cliff and not another word did she speak until she had entered the hallway of her home then closing the door behind her and without looking around at any of the dear objects for a sight of which she had so long been yearning she turned to her companion  willy she cried what does this mean why do you treat me in this way when i come home after having been away so long and having suffered so much why do you greet me as if you took me for a tax collector why do you stand there like aa horrible clam  willy hesitated she looked up and she looked down  things are so altered she said and i didnt know  well know now said mrs cliff as she held out her arms in a moment the two women were clasped in a tight embrace kissing and sobbing  how should i know said poor willy as she was wiping her eyes chills went down me as i stood on that platform wondering what sort of a grand lady you would look like when you got out of the car with two servant women most likely and perhaps a butler and trying to think what i should say  mrs cliff laughed you were born addlepated and you cant help it now let us go through this house without wasting a minute willy gazed at her in amazement  youre just the same as you always was she cried indeed i am said mrs cliff did you clean this diningroom yourself willy it looks as spick and span as if i had just left it  indeed it does was the proud reply and you couldnt find a speck of dust from the ceiling to the floor  when mrs cliff had been upstairs and downstairs and in the front yard the side yard and the back yard and when her happy eyes had rested upon all her dear possessions she went into the kitchen  now willy she said let us go to work and get supper for i must say i am hungry  at this willy croup turned pale her chin dropped a horrible suspicion took possession of her could it be possible that it was all a mistake or that something dreadful had happened that the riches which everybody had been talking about had never existed or had disappeared she might want to go to her old home she might want to see her goods and chattels but that she should want to help get supperthat was incomprehensible at that moment the world looked very black to willy if mrs cliff had gone into the parlor and had sat down in the best rockingchair to rest herself and had said to her please get supper as soon as you can willy would have believed in everything but now  the grinding of heavy wheels was heard in front of the house and willy turned quickly and looked out of the window there was a wagon containing seven enormous trunks since the days when plainton was a little hamlet up to the present time when it contained a hotel a bank a lyceum and a weekly paper no one had ever arrived within its limits with seven such trunks instantly the blackness disappeared from before the mind of willy croup  now you tell the men where to carry them she cried and i will get the supper in no time betty handshall stayed here until this morning but she went away after dinner for she was afraid if she stayed she would be in the way not knowing how much help you would bring with you  i wonder if they are all crackbrained thought mrs cliff as she went to the front door to attend to her baggage  that evening nearly all plainton came to see mrs cliff no matter how she returnedas a purseproud bondholder as a lady of elegant wealth with her attendants as an old friend suddenly grown jolly and prosperousit would be all right for her neighbors to go in and see her in the evening there they might suit themselves to her new deportment whatever it might be and there would be no danger of any of them getting into false positions which would have been very likely indeed if they had gone to meet her at the station  her return to her own house gave her real friends a great deal of satisfaction for some of them had feared she would not go there it would have been difficult for them to know how to greet mrs cliff at a hotel even such an unpretentious one as that of plainton all these friends found her the same warmhearted cordial woman that she had ever been in fact if there was any change at all in her she was more cordial than they had yet known her as in the case of willy croup a cloud had risen before her she had been beset by the sudden fear that her money already threatened to come between her and her old friends not if i can help it said mrs cliff to herself as fervently as if she had been vowing a vow to seek the holy grail and she did help it the good people forgot what they had expected to think about her and only remembered what they had always thought of her no matter what had happened she was the same  but what had happened and how it had happened and all about it up and down to the right and the left above and below everybody wanted to know and mrs cliff with sparkling eyes was only too glad to tell them she had been obliged to be so reserved when she had come home before that she was all the more eager to be communicative now and it was past midnight before the first of that eager and delighted company thought of going home  there was one question however which mrs cliff successfully evaded and that wasthe amount of her wealth she would not give even an approximate idea of the value of her share of the golden treasure it was very soon plain to everybody that mrs cliff was the same woman she used to be in regard to keeping to herself that which she did not wish to tell to others and so everybody went away with imagination absolutely unfettered     chapter iii  miss nancy shott   the next morning mrs cliff sat alone in her parlor with her mind earnestly fixed upon her own circumstances out in the kitchen willy croup was dashing about like a domestic fanatic eager to get the mornings work done and everything put in order that she might go upstairs with mrs cliff and witness the opening of those wonderful trunks  she was a happy woman for she had a new dishpan which mrs cliff had authorized her to buy that very morning the holes in the bottom of the old one having been mended so often that she and mrs cliff both believed that it would be very well to get a new one and rid themselves of further trouble  willy also had had the proud satisfaction of stopping at the carpenter shop on her way to buy the dishpan and order him to come and do whatever was necessary to the backkitchen door sometimes it had been the hinges and sometimes it had been the lock which had been out of order on that door for at least a year and although they had been tinkering here and tinkering there the door had never worked properly and now mrs cliff had said that it must be put in perfect order even if a new door and a new frame were required and without any regard to what it might cost this to willy was the dawn of a new era and the thought of it excited her like wine  mrs cliffs mind was not excited it was disquieted she had been thinking of her investments and of her deposits all of which had been made under wise advice and it had suddenly occurred to her to calculate how much richer she was today than she had been yesterday when she appreciated the fact that the interest on her invested property had increased her wealth since the previous morning by some hundreds of dollars it frightened her she felt as if an irresistible flood of opulence was flowing in upon her and she shuddered to think of the responsibility of directing it into its proper courses and so preventing it from overwhelming her and sweeping her away  tomorrow there would be several hundred dollars more and the next day more and so on always and what was she doing or what had she planned to do to give proper direction to these tidal waves of wealth she had bought a new dishpan and ordered a door repaired  to be sure it was very soon to begin to think of the expenditure of her income but it was a question which could not be postponed the importance of it was increasing all the time every five minutes she was two dollars richer  for a moment she wished herself back in paris or new york there she might open some floodgate which would give instant relief from the pressure of her affluence and allow her time to think but what could she do in plainton at least how should she begin to do anything  she got up and walked about the room she was becoming annoyed and even a little angry she resented this intrusion of her wealth upon her she wanted to rest quietly for a time to enjoy her home and friends and not be obliged to think of anything which it was incumbent upon her to do from the bottom of her heart she wished that her possessions had all been solid gold or in some form in which they could not increase expand or change in any way until she gave them leave then she would live for a week or two as she used to live without thought of increment or responsibilities until she was ready to begin the life of a rich woman and to set in motion the currents of her exuberant income  but she could not change the state of affairs the system of interest had been set in motion and her income was flowing in upon her hour by hour day by day steadily and irresistibly and her mind could not be at rest until she had done somethingat least planned somethingwhich would not only prevent her from being overwhelmed and utterly discouraged but which would enable her to float proudly on this grand current of absolute power over the material interests of the world  mrs cliff was a woman of good sense no matter how much money she might possess she would have considered herself its unworthy possessor if she should spend any of it without proper value received she might spend it foolishly but she wanted the worth of her money she would consider it a silly thing for instance to pay a thousand dollars for an india shawl because few people wore india shawls and she did not care for them but if she had done so she would have been greatly mortified if she found that she had paid too much and that she might have bought as good a shawl for seven hundred and fifty dollars  since she had been in that room and thinking about these things enough interest had come to her to enable her to buy a good silver watch for some deserving person now who was there to whom she could give a plain silver watch willy croup would be glad to have it but then it would be better to wait a few hours and give her a gold one  now it was that willy came into the room with a disappointed expression upon her countenance  i was just coming in to tell you she said that i was ready now to go up and help you open the trunks but here comes that horrid miss shott and dear knows how long she will stay  nancy shott was the leading spinster of plainton in companies where there were married ladies she was sometimes obliged to take a second place but never among maidens old or young there were very few subjects upon which miss shott had not an opinion and whatever this opinion might be she considered it her first duty in life to express it as a rule the expression was more agreeable to her than to others  when mrs cliff heard that miss shott was approaching she instantly forgot her wealth and all her perplexities concerning it miss shott had not called upon her the previous evening but she had not expected her nor did she expect her now  on her previous visit to plainton mrs cliff had been shamefully insulted by miss shott who had accused her of extravagance and by implication of dishonesty and in return the indignant widow had opened upon her such a volley of justifiable retaliation that miss shott in great wrath had retired from the house followed figuratively by a small coin which she had brought as a present and which had been hurled after her  but mrs cliff knew that her acrimonious neighbor could never be depended upon to do anything which might be expected of her and she was not quite so much surprised as she was annoyed of course she had known she must meet nancy shott and she had intended to do nothing which would recall to the mind of any one that she remembered the disagreeable incident referred to but she had not expected that the meeting would be in private  she knew that nancy would do something decidedly unpleasant if she had stayed away because she wanted a chance to reopen the previous quarrel that would be bad enough but if she had determined to drop all resentment and had come prepared to offer honey and sugar and thus try to make a rich friend out of one she had considered as a poor enemy that would be still more disagreeable but by the time the visitor had entered the parlor mrs cliff had made up her mind to meet her as if nothing unpleasant had ever happened between them and then to await the course of events she was not at all pleased with the visit but notwithstanding this she had great curiosity to know what miss shott had to say about the change in her circumstances  nancy shott was different from other people she was capable of drawing the most astounding inferences and of coming to the most soulirritating conclusions even on subjects which could not be otherwise than pleasant to ordinary people  how do you do said miss shott offering her hand i am glad to see you back mrs cliff  mrs cliff replied that she was quite well and was glad to be back  you are not looking as hale as you did said the visitor as she seated herself you must have lost a good many pounds but that was to be expected from what i have heard south america must be about as unhealthy a place as any part of the world and then on top of that living in paris with water to drink which i am told is enough to make anybody sick to look at it is bound to have some sort of an effect upon a person  mrs cliff smiled she was used to this sort of talk from nancy shott i am better than i was two years ago she said and the last time i was weighed i found that i had gained seven pounds  well there is no accounting for that said her visitor except as we grow old we are bound to show it and sometimes aging looks like bad health and as to fat that often comes as years go on though as far as i am concerned i think it is a great misfortune to have more to carry as you get less and less able to carry it  mrs cliff might have said that that sort of thing would not be likely to trouble miss shott whose scantily furnished frame was sure to become thinner and thinner as she became older and weaker but she merely smiled and waited to hear what would come next  i do not want to worry you said miss shott but several people that were here last night said you was not looking as they had hoped to see you look and i will just say to you if it is anything connected with your appetite with a feeling of goneness in the mornings you ought to buy a quassia cup and drink the full of it at least three times a day  miss shott knew that mrs cliff absolutely detested the taste of quassia mrs cliff was not annoyed she hoped that her visitor would soon get through with these prefatory remarks and begin to take the stand whatever it might be which she had come there that morning to take  there has been sickness here since you last left said miss shott and it has been where it was least to be expected too barney thompsons little boy the second son has had the diphtheria and where he got it nobody knows for it was vacation time and he did not go to school and there was no other diphtheria anywhere in all this town and yet he had it and had it bad  he did not die said mrs cliff  oh no he got over it and perhaps it was a bad case and perhaps it was not but you may be sure i did not go near it for i considered it my duty to keep away and i did keep away but the trouble is  and did none of the other children take it asked mrs cliff  no they didnt but the trouble is that when diphtheria or anything like it comes up suddenly like this without any reason that nobody can see it is just as likely to come up again without any reason and i am expecting to hear every day of another of them thompson children being stricken down and i was very sorry indeed mrs cliff to see this very morning willy croup coming out of barney thompsons house and to hear from her afterwards that she had been to order him to come here to put up a new kitchen door which i do not suppose is absolutely needed and even if it is i am sure i would wait a good while before i would have barney thompson come into my house with diphtheria that very minute perhaps in the throats of one or maybe more of his children but of course if people choose to trifle with their own lives it is their own business  it was not real diphtheria said willy croup who happened to be passing the open door at this moment it was only a bad sore throat and the child was well in two days  i suppose of course said miss shott that if the disease did get into this house willy croup would be the first to take it because she is such a spongy person that she takes almost anything that is in the air and is not wholesome but then you would not want to lose her and after a funeral in the house no matter whose it may be things is always gloomy for a long time afterwards and nobody can feel easy if it was a catchin disease that the person died of  mrs cliff was naturally desirous to hear all the domestic news of the town but she would have liked to have had something pleasant thrown in among the gloomy tidings of which miss shott had made herself the bearer and so she made a little effort to turn the conversation  i shall be glad to go about and see my old friends and neighbors she said for i am interested in everything which has happened to them but i suppose it will be some days before i can settle down and feel ready to go on in the old way it seems to me as if i had been on the move ever since i left here although of course i was not travelling all the time  i suppose nobody has told you said miss shott that edward darley has ploughed up that little pasture of his and planted it with young apple trees now it does seem to me that for a man like edward darley who comes of a consumptive family and who has been coughin regularly to my certain knowledge for more than a year to go and plant apple trees which he cant expect to live to see bear fruit is nothing more or less than a wicked waste of money time and labor i suppose if i was to go and tell him so he would not like that but i do not know as i ought to consider it there are people in this world wholl never know anything if theyre not told  five other topics of the town each of a doleful nature and each indicating an evident depravity in a citizen of plainton were related by miss shott and then she arose to go  i hope youll remember what i told you about thompsons children she said as she walked to the front door and if i was you id have that kitchen fumigated after he has put the door in  there now said miss shott to herself as she proudly walked down the street the widow cliff cant say ive done any toadying and no matter what shes got and what she hasnt got she cant say to herself that i consider her any better able to give me twentyfive cents than she was when she was here before or that it makes any difference to me whether she has much or little     chapter iv  a launch into a new life   it required the greater part of two days for mrs cliff and willy to open the seven trunks and properly display and dispose of the various articles and goods astonishing in their variety and beauty and absolutely amazing when the difference between the price paid for them and what they would have cost in new york was considered  during these fascinating operations it so happened that at one time or another nearly all of mrs cliffs female friends dropped in and all were wonderfully impressed by what they saw and what they heard but although miss shott did not come there during the grand opening it was not long before she knew the price and something of the general appearance of nearly everything that mrs cliff had brought with her  among the contents of the trunks were a great many presents for mrs cliffs friends and whenever miss shott heard of one of these gifts she made a remark to the effect that she had not a doubt in the world that the widow cliff knew better than to bring her a present for she would not want the thing whatever it was whether a glass pitcher or a pincushion flung back at her after the fashion that she had set herself at a time when everybody was trying their best to be kind to her  it was clearly a fact that through the influence of the seven trunks mrs cliff was becoming a very popular woman and miss shott did not like it at all she had never had any faithat least she said soin those lumps of gold found in a hole in some part of the world that nobody had ever heard of and had not hesitated to say that fortunes founded on such wildgoose stories as these should not even be considered by people of good sense who worked for their living or had incomes which they could depend on but the dress goods the ribbons the gloves the little clocks the shoes the parasols the breastpins the portfolios of pictures the jewelry the rugs and table covers and hundreds of other beautiful and foreign things were a substantial evidence that mrs cliffs money was not all moonshine  it was very pleasant for mrs cliff to bring out her treasures to display them to her enthusiastic friends and to arrange them in her house and to behold the rapturous delight of willy croup from early morn until bedtime  but the seven empty trunks had been carried up into the garret and now mrs cliff set her mind to the solution of the questionhow was she to begin her new life in her old home it must be a new life for to live as she had lived even in the days of her highest prosperity during her husbands life would be absurd and even wicked with such an income she must endeavor as far as was possible to her to live in a manner worthy of it but one thing she was determined uponshe would not alienate her friends by climbing to the top of her money and looking down upon them none of them knew how high she would be if she were to perch herself on the very top of that money but even if she climbed up a little way they might still feel that they were very small in her sight  no the money should always be kept in the background it might be as high as the sky and as glorious as a sunset but she would be on the ground with the people of plainton and as far as was possible they should all enjoy the fine weather together  she could not repress a feeling of pride for she would be looked upon as one of the principal personsif not the principal personin plainton but she could not believe that any real friend could possibly object to that  if her husband had lived and prospered it was probable he would have been the principal man in plainton the minister always excepted but now there was no reason whatever why any one should object to her being a principal personage and in this case she could not see why the ministers wife should be excepted  but plainton was to be her home the plainton people were to be her friends how should she set about using her money in such a way that she should not be driven forth to some large city to live as ordinary wealthy people live in a fashion to which she was utterly unsuited and which possessed for her no attractions whatever  of course she had early determined to devote a large sum to charitable purposes for she would have thought herself a very unworthy woman if her wealth had not benefited others than herself but this was an easy matter to attend to the amount she had set aside for charity was not permanently invested and through the advice of mr perley there would be no difficulty in devoting this to suitable objects already she had confidentially spoken to her pastor on the subject and had found him enthusiastic in his desire to help her in every possible way in her benevolent purposes but who was there who could help her in regard to herself who was there who could tell her how she ought to live so as to gain all the good that her money should give her and yet not lose that which was to her the highest object of material existencea happy and prosperous life among her old friends in her native town  should she choose to elevate herself in the social circle by living as ordinary very rich people live she could not hope to elevate her friends in that way although she would be glad enough to do it in many cases and there would be a gap between them which would surely grow wider and wider and yet here was this money coming in upon her in a steady stream day by day and how was she going to make herself happier with it  she must do that or she believed it would be her duty to hand it over to somebody else who was better adapted by nature to use it  if i did not take so much pleasure in things which cost so little and which are so easy for me to buy said poor mrs cliff to herself or if i did not have so much money i am sure i should get on a great deal better  mrs cliffs belief that she must not long delay in selecting some sort of station in life and endeavoring to live up to it was soon strengthened by willy croup during the time of the trunk opening and for some days afterwards when all her leisure hours were occupied with the contemplation and consideration of her own presents willy had been perfectly contented to let things go on in the old way or any way but now the incongruity of mrs cliffs present mode of living and the probable amount of her fortune began to impress itself upon her  it does seem to me said she that its a sin and a shame that you should be goin about this house just as you used to do helpin me upstairs and downstairs as if you couldnt afford to hire nobody you ought to have a girl and a good one and for the matter of that you might have two of em i suppose and even if it wasnt too much for you to be workin about when theres no necessity for it the people are beginnin to talk and that ought to be stopped  what are they talking about asked mrs cliff  well its not everybody thats talkin returned willy and i guess that them that does gets their opinions from one quarter but ive heard people say that its pretty plain that all you got out of that gold mine you spent in buyin the things you brought home in your trunks for if you didnt you wouldnt be livin like this helpin to do your own housework and cookin  in consequence of this conversation a servantofallwork was employed for mrs cliff did not know what she would do with two women until she had made a change in her household arrangements and with this as a beginning our good widow determined to start out on her career as a rich woman who intended to enjoy herself in the fashion she liked best  she sent for mr thompson the carpenter and consulted with him in regard to the proposed additions to her house but when she had talked for a time she became disheartened she found that it would be necessary to dig a new cellar close to her present premises that there would be stones and gravel and lime and sand and carts and horses and men and dirt and that it would be some months before all the hammering and the sawing and the planing and the plastering and tinwork could be finished and all this would be going on under her eye and close to her ears during those first months in which she had proposed to be so happy in her home she could not bear to give the word to dig and pound and saw it was not like building a new house for that would not be near her and the hubbub of its construction would not annoy her  so she determined she would not begin a new diningroom at present she would wait a little while until she had had some good of her house as it was and then she would feel better satisfied to live in the midst of pounding banging and allpervading dust but she would do something she would have the fence which separated the sidewalk from her front yard newly painted she had long wanted to have that done but had not been able to afford it  but when mr thompson went to look at the fence he told her that it would be really a waste of money to paint it for in many places it was old and decayed and it would be much wiser to put up a new one and paint that  again mrs cliff hesitated if that fence had to be taken down and the posts dug up and new posts put in and the flowerbed which ran along the inside of it destroyed it would be just as well to wait until the other work began and have it all done at once so she told mr thompson he need not send a painter for she would make the old fence do for a while  mrs cliff sighed a little as the carpenter walked away but there were other things to do there was the pasture lot at the rear of her garden and she could have a cow and there was the little barn and she could have a horse the idea of the horse pleased her more than anything she had yet thought of in connection with her wealth  in her days of prosperity it had been her greatest pleasure to drive in her phaëton with her good brown horse generally with willy croup by her side to stop at shops or to make calls upon friends and to make those little excursions into the surrounding country in which she and willy both delighted they had sometimes gone a long distance and had taken their dinner with them and willy was really very good in unharnessing the horse and watering him at a brook and in giving him some oats  to return to these old joys was a delightful prospect and mrs cliff made inquiries about her horse which had been sold in the town but he was gone he had been sold to a drover and his whereabouts no one knew  so she went to mr williams the keeper of the hotel who knew more about horses than anybody else and consulted with him on the subject of a new steed she told him just what she wanted a gentle horse which she could drive herself and one which willy could hold when she went into a house or a shop  now it so happened that mr williams had just such a horse and when mrs cliff had seen it and when willy had come up to look at it and when the matter had been talked about in all the aspects in which it presented itself to mrs cliffs mind she bought the animal and it was taken to her stable where andrew marks a neighbor was engaged to take care of it  the next morning mrs cliff and willy took a drive a little way out of town and they both agreed that this horse which was gray was a great deal better traveller than the old brown and a much handsomer animal but both of them also agreed that they did not believe that they would ever learn to love him as they had their old horse  still he was very easy to drive and he went along so pleasantly without needing the whip in the least that mrs cliff said to herself that for the first time since her return she really felt herself a rich woman  if everything she thought should come to me as this horse came to me how delightful my life would be when i wanted him i found him i did not have to trouble myself in the least about the price i simply paid it and ordered him sent home now that sort of thing is what makes a person feel truly rich  when they had gone far enough and had reached a wide place in the road mrs cliff turned and started back to plainton but now the horse began to be a different kind of a horse with his face towards his home he set out to trot as fast as he could and when mrs cliff not liking such a rapid pace endeavored to pull him in she found it very hard to do and when she began to saw his mouth thinking that would restrain his ardor he ambled and capered and mrs cliff was obliged to let him resume his rapid gait  he was certainly a very hardmouthed horse going home and mrs cliffs arms ached and willy croups heart quaked long before they reached the town when they reached plainton mrs cliff began to be afraid that he would gallop through the streets and she told willy that if he did she must not scream but must sit quietly and she would endeavor to steer him clear of the vehicles and people  but although he did not gallop the ardent gray seemed to travel faster after he entered the town and mrs cliff who was getting very red in the face from her steady tugging at the reins thought it wise not to attempt to go home but to let her horse go straight to the hotel stables where he had lived  when mrs cliff had declared to mr williams that that horse would never suit her that she would not be willing to drive it and would not even think of going into a house and leaving willy croup to hold him he was very much surprised and said that he had not a gentler horse in his stable and he did not believe there was one in the town  all horses said he want to go home especially at dinnertime  but the old brown did not urged mrs cliff that is the sort of horse i want  some very old beast might please you better said he but really mrs cliff that is not the sort of horse you should have he would die or break down in a little while and then you would have to get another what you should do is to have a good horse and a driver you might get a twoseated carriage either open or closed and go anywhere and everywhere and never think of the horse  that was not the thing she longed for that would not bring back the happy days when she drove the brown through the verdant lanes if she must have a driver she might as well hire a cab and be driven about but she told mr williams to get her a suitable vehicle and she would have andrew marks to drive her and she and willy croup walked sadly home  as to the cow she succeeded better she bought a fairly good one and willy undertook to milk her and to make butter  now what have i done so far said mrs cliff on the evening of the day when the cow came home i have a woman to cook i have a new kitchen door and i have a cow i do not count the horse and the wagon for if i do not drive myself i shall not feel that they are mine in the way that i want them to be     chapter v  a furtrimmed overcoat and a silk hat   mrs cliff now began to try very hard to live as she ought to live without pretensions or snobbery but in a style becoming in some degree her great fortune  there was one thing she determined to do immediately and that was to begin a series of hospitalitiesand it made her feel proud to think that she could do this and do it handsomely and yet do it in the old home where everybody knew she had for years been obliged to practise the strictest economy  she gave a dinner to which she invited her most select friends mr and mrs perley were there and the misses thorpedyke two maiden ladies who constituted the family of the highest social pretension of plainton there were other people who were richer but miss eleanor thorpedyke now a lady of nearly seventy and her sister barbara some ten years younger belonged to the very best family in that part of the country and were truly the aristocrats of the place  but they had always been very friendly with mrs cliff and they were glad to come to her dinner the other guests were all good people and a dinnerparty of more distinction could not have been collected in that town  but this dinner did not go off altogether smoothly if the people had come merely to eat they must have been abundantly satisfied for everything was of the very best and well cooked mrs cliff and willy having seen to that but there were certain roughnesses and hitches in the management of the dinner which disturbed mrs cliff in her travels and at the hotels where she had lived she had seen a great deal of good service and she knew what it was  willy who being a relative should really have come to the table had decidedly declined to do so and had taken upon herself the principal part of the waiting assisted by the general servant and a small girl who had been called in but the diningroom was very small some of the chairs were but a little distance from the wall and it was evident that willy had not a true appreciation of the fact that in recent years she had grown considerably rounder and plumper than she used to be and it made mrs cliffs blood run cold to see how she bumped the back of mr perleys chair as she thrust herself between it and the wall  the small girl had to be told almost everything that she must do and the general servant who did not like to wait on table only came in when she was called and left immediately when she had done what she had been called for  when the guests had gone mrs cliff declared to willy that that was the last large dinner she would give in that house it was not a dinner which a woman of my means should offer to her friends willy was amazed  i dont see how it could have been better said she unless you had champagne and i know mr perley wouldnt have liked that everything on the table was just as good as it could be  but mrs cliff shook her head she knew that she had attempted something for which her present resources were insufficient after this she invited people to dinner once or twice a week but the company was always very small and suited to the resources of the house  i will go on this way for a while thought the good lady and after a time i will begin to spread out and do things in a different style  several times she drove over to harrington a large town some five miles away which contained a furniture factory and there she purchased many articles which would be suitable for the house always securing the best things for her purposes but frequently regretting that certain beautiful and imposing pieces of furniture were entirely unsuited to the capacity of her rooms and hallways but when her diningroom should be finished and the room above it she would have better opportunity of gratifying her taste for handsome wood in imposing designs then it might be that harrington would not be able to give her anything good enough  her daily mail was now much larger than it ever had been before business people sent her cards and circulars and every now and then she received letters calling her attention to charities or pressing personal needs of the writers but there were not very many of these for although it was generally known that mrs cliff had come into a fortune her manner of living seemed also a matter of public knowledge even the begging letters were couched in very moderate terms but all these mrs cliff took to mr perley and by his advice she paid attention to but very few of them  day by day mrs cliff endeavored to so shape and direct her fortunes that they might make her happy in the only ways in which she could be happy but her efforts to do so did not always gain for her the approval of her fellow townspeople there were some who thought that a woman who professed to have command of money should do a good many things which mrs cliff did not do and there were others who did not hesitate to assert that a woman who lived as mrs cliff should not do a great many things which she did do among which things some people included the keeping of a horse and carriage it was conceded of course that all this was mrs cliffs own business she had paid the money she had borrowed to go to south america she had been very kind to some of the poor people of the town and it was thought by some had been foolishly munificent to old mrs bradley who from being a very poor person threatened with the loss of her home was now an independent householder and enjoyed an annuity sufficient to support her  more than that mrs cliff had been very generous in regard to the church music it was not known exactly how much she had given towards this object but there were those who said that she must have given her means a considerable strain when she made her contribution that is if the things were to be done which mr perley talked about  when mrs cliff heard what had been said upon this subjectand willy croup was generally very well able to keep her informed in regard to what the people of the town said about hershe thought that the gossips would have been a good deal astonished if they had known how much she had really given to the church and that they would have been absolutely amazed if they knew how much mr perley had received for general charities and then she thought with a tinge of sadness how very much surprised mr perley would have been if he had known how much more she was able to give away without feeling its loss  weeks passed on the leaves turned red and yellow upon the trees the evenings and mornings grew colder and colder and mrs cliff did everything she could towards the accomplishment of what now appeared to her in the light of a great duty in her lifethe proper expenditure of her income and appropriation of her great fortune  her labors were not becoming more cheerful day after day she said to herself that she was not doing what she ought to do and that it was full time that she should begin to do something better but what that better thing was she could not make up her mind even the improvements she contemplated were after all such mere trifles  it was a very cold morning in october when mrs cliff went into her parlor and said to willy that there was one thing she could doshe could have a rousing comfortable fire without thinking whether wood was five ten or twenty dollars per cord when willy found that mrs cliff wanted to make herself comfortable before a fine blazing fire she seemed in doubt  i dont know about the safety of it she said that chimneys in a pretty bad condition the masons told us so years ago and nothin has ever been done to it there have been fires in it but they have been little ones and if i was you i wouldnt have too large a blaze in that fireplace until the chimney has been made all right  mrs cliff was annoyed well then willy i wish you would go for the mason immediately and tell him to come here and repair the chimney its perfectly ridiculous that i cant have a fire in my own parlor when i am able to have a chimney as high and as big as bunker hill monument if i wanted it  willy croup smiled she did not believe that mrs cliff really knew how much such a chimney would cost but she said you have got to remember you know that we cant have the cuthberts here to dinner tomorrow if the masons come to work at that chimney ten to one they will have to take the most part of it down and we shall be in a general mess here for a week  mrs cliff sat down with a sigh you need not mind to have the wood brought in she said just give me a few sticks and some kindling so that i can give things a little air of cheerfulness  as she sat before the gently blazing little fire mrs cliff felt that things needed an air of cheerfulness she had that morning been making calculations and notwithstanding all she had bought all she had done and even including with the most generous margin all she had planned to do her income was gaining upon her in a most discouraging way  i am not fit for it she said to herself i dont know how to live as i want to live and i wont live as i dont want to live the whole business is too big for me i dont know how to manage it i ought to give up my means to somebody who knows how to use them and stay here myself with just enough money to make me happy  for the fortieth time she considered the question of laying all her troubles before mr perley but she knew her pastor the great mass of her fortune would quickly be swallowed up in some grand missionary enterprise and this would not suit mrs cliff no matter how much she was discouraged no matter how difficult it was to see her way before her no matter how great a load she felt her wealth to be there was always before her a glimmering sense of grand possibilities what they were she could not now see or understand but she would not willingly give them up  illustration the gentleman raised his hat and asked if mrs cliff lived there  she was an elderly woman but she came of a longlived family all of whom had lived in good health until the end of their days and if there was any grand golden felicity which was possible to her she felt that there was reason to believe she would live long to enjoy it when she wanted it  one morning as mrs cliff sat thinking over these things there was a knock at the front door and of course willy croup ran to open it no matter where she was or no matter what she was doing willy always went to the door if she could because she had so great a desire to know who was there  this time it was a gentleman a very fine gentleman with a high silk hat and a handsome overcoat trimmed with furfur on the collar fur on the sleeves and fur down the front willy had never seen such a coat it was october and it was cool but there was no man in plainton who would have worn such a coat as that so early in the season even if he had one  the gentleman had dark eyes and a very large mustache and he carried a cane and wore rather bright tancolored gloves all these things willy observed in an instant for she was very quick in taking notice of peoples clothes and general appearance  the gentleman raised his hat and asked if mrs cliff lived there now willy thought he must be an extraordinary fine gentleman for how should he know that she was not a servant and in those parts gentlemen did not generally raise their hats to girls who opened front doors  the gentleman was admitted and was ushered into the parlor where sat mrs cliff she was a little surprised at the sight of this visitor who came in with his hat on but who took it off and made her a low bow as soon as he saw her but she thought she appreciated the situation and she hardened her heart  a strange man so finely dressed and with such manners must have come for money and mrs cliff had already learned to harden her heart towards strangers who solicited but the hardness of her heart utterly disappeared in her amazement when this gentleman having pulled off his right glove advanced toward her holding out his hand  you dont remember me mrs cliff he said in a loud clear voice no wonder for i am a good deal changed but it is not the same with you you are the same as everi declare you are  mrs cliff took the proffered hand and looked into the face of the speaker there was something there which seemed familiar but she had never known such a fine gentleman as this she thought over the people whom she had seen in france and in california but she could not recollect this face  its a mean thing to be puzzlin you mrs cliff said the stranger with a cheery smile im george burke seaman on the castor where i saw more of you mrs cliff than ive ever seen since for though we have both been a good deal jumbled up since we havent been jumbled up together so i dont wonder if you dont remember me especially as i didnt wear clothes like these on the castor not by any means mrs cliff  i remember you she said and she shook his hand warmly i remember you and you had a mate named edward shirley  yes indeed said mr burke and hes all right and im all right and how are you  the overcoat with the fur trimmings came off and with the hat the cane and the gloves was laid upon a chair and burke and mrs cliff sat down to talk over old times and old friends     chapter vi  a temperance lark   as mrs cliff sat and talked with george burke she forgot the calculations she had been making she forgot her perplexities and her anxieties concerning the rapid inroads which her income was making upon her ability to dispose of it in the recollection of the goodfellowships which the presence of her companion recalled  but mr burke could give her no recent news of captain horn and edna she having heard from them later than he had and the only one of the people of the castor of whom he could tell her was edward shirley who had gone into business  he had bought a share in a shipyard and as he was a man who had a great idea about the lines of a vessel and all that sort of thing he had determined to put his money into that business he was a longheaded fellow and burke had no doubt but that he would soon hear of some fine craft coming from the yard of his old shipmate  but how about yourself mr burke i want to know what has happened to you and what you intend doing and how you chanced to be coming this way  oh i will tell you everything that has happened to me said mr burke and it wont take long but first let me ask you something mrs cliff and as he spoke he quietly rose and shut the parlor door  now then said he as he seated himself we have all been in the same box or i should say in the same boxes of different kinds and although i may not have the right to call myself a friend i am just as friendly to you as if i was and feel as if people who have been through what we have ought to stand by each other even after theyve got through their hardest rubs  now mrs cliff has anything happened to you have you had any setbacks i know that this is a mighty queer world and that even the richest people can often come down with a sudden thump just as if they had slipped on the ice  mrs cliff smiled nothing has happened to me she said i have had no setbacks and i am just as rich todayi should say a great deal richer than i was on the day when captain horn made the division of the treasure but i know very well why you thought something had happened to me you did not expect to find me living in this little house  no by the lord harry i didnt exclaimed burke slapping his knee you must excuse me mrs cliff for speaking out in that way but really i never was so much surprised as when i came into your front yard i thought i would find you in the finest house in the place until you could have a stately mansion built somewhere in the outskirts of the town where there would be room enough for a park but when i came to this house i couldnt help thinking that perhaps some beastly bank had broke and that your share of the golden business had been swept away things like that do happen to women you know and i suppose they always will but i am mighty glad to hear you are all right  but as you have asked me to tell you my story i will make short work of it and then i would like to hear what has happened to you as much as you please to tell me about it  now when i got my money mrs cliff which when compared to what your share must have been was like a dory to a threemast schooner but still quite enough for me and perhaps more than enough if a public vote could be taken on the subject i was in paris a jolly place for a rich sailor and i said to myself  now mr burke said i for i might as well begin by using good manners the general disposition of a seafaring man with a lot of money is to go on a lark or perhaps a good many larks and so get rid of it and then ship again before the mast for fourteen dollars per month or thereabouts  but i made up my mind right there on the spot that that sort of thing wouldnt suit me the very idea of shipping again on a merchant vessel made the blood run cold inside of me and i swore to myself that i wouldnt do it  to be sure i wouldnt give up all notion of a lark a sailor with moneyand i dont believe there ever was an ablebodied seaman with more money than i hadwho doesnt lark at least to some degree has no right to call himself a wholesouled mariner so i made up my mind to have one lark and then stop  mrs cliffs countenance clouded i am sorry mr burke said she that you thought it necessary to do that i do hope you didnt go on one of those horriblesprees do they call them  oh no interrupted burke i didnt do anything of that kind if id begun with a bottle id have ended with nothing but a cork and a badly burnt one at that no maam drinking isnt in my line i dont take anything of that sort except at meals and then only the best wine in genteel quantities but i was bound to have one lark and then i would stop and begin to live like a merchanttailor with no family nor poor relations  but what did you do asked mrs cliff if it was a lark without liquor i want to hear about it  it was a temperance lark maam said burke and this is what it was  now though i have been to sea ever since i was a boy i never had command of any kind of craft and it struck me that i would like to finish up my life on the ocean wave by taking command of a vessel it is generally understood that riches will give you anything you want and i said to myself that my riches should give me that i didnt want a sailin vessel i was tired of sailin vessels i wanted a steamer and when i commanded a steamer for a little while i would stop short and be a landsman for the rest of my life  so i went up to brest where i thought i might find some sort of steamer which might suit me and in that harbor i did find an english steamer which had discharged her cargo and was expectin to sail again pretty much in ballast and brandy so far as i could make out i went to this vessel and i made an offer to her captain to charter her for an excursion of one weekthat was all i wanted  well im not going to bother you mrs cliff with all that was said and done about this little business which seemed simple enough but which wasnt there are people in this world who think that if you have money you can buy anything you want but such people might as well get ready to change their opinions if they ever expect to come into money  that is true said mrs cliff every word of it is true as i have found out for myself  well continued burke there had to be a lot of telegraphin to the owners in london and a general fuss with the officers of the port about papers and all that but i got the business through all right for if money wont get you everything its a great help in making things slip along easy and so one fine afternoon i found myself on board that steamer as commander for one week  of course i didnt want to give orders to the crew but i intended to give my orders to the captain and tell him what he was to do and what he was not to do for one week he didnt like that very much for he was inclined to bulldogism but i paid him extra wages and he agreed to knuckle under to me  so i gave him orders to sail out of the harbor and straight to the island of ushant some twentyfive miles to the west of northwest  theres no use going there said the captainhis name was dorktheres nothing on that blasted bit of rock for you to see theres no port i could run this steamer into  i had been studying out my business on the chart and this little island just suited my idea and though the name was ushant i said to him you shall and i ordered him to sail to that island and lay to a mile or two to the westward and as to the landing he neednt talk about that until i mentioned it myself  so when we got about a couple of miles to the west of ushant we lay to now i knew we were on the fortyeighth parallel of latitude for i had looked that out on the chart so i said to captain dork  now sir says i i want you to head your vessel sir due west and then to steam straight ahead for a hundred miles keepin your vessel just as near as you can on that line of latitude  i see said mrs cliff very much interested if he once got on that line of latitude and kept sailing west without turning one way or the other he would be bound to keep on it  thats exactly it said mr burke twas pretty near midnight when we started off to run along the fortyeighth parallel but i kept my eyes on the man at the wheel and on the compass and i let them know that that ship was under the command of an ablebodied seaman who knew what he was about and if they skipped to one side of that line or to the other he would find it out in no time  i went below once to take a nap but as i promised the fellow at the wheel ten shillings if he would keep her head due west and told him he would be sure to wake me up if he didnt i felt certain we wouldnt skip the line of latitude  well that steamer which was called the duke of dorchester and which was a vessel of not more than a thousand tons wasnt much of a sailer or perhaps they was saving coal i dont know which and not knowing how much coal ought to be used i kept my mouth shut on that point but i had the log thrown a good deal and i found that we never quite came up to ten knots an hour and when we took an observation at noon the next day we saw that we hadnt quite done the hundred miles but a little before one oclock we did it and then i ordered the captain to stop the engine and lay to  there was a brig about a mile away and when she saw us layin to she put about and made for us and when she was near enough she hailed to know if anything was the matter she was a french brig but captain dork understood her and i told him to bid her good morning and to tell her that nothin was the matter but that we were just stoppin to rest i dont know what he did tell her but she put about her helm and was off again on her own business  now said i to captain dork i want you to back this steamer due east to the island of ushant  he looked at me and began to swear he took me for a maniaca wild crazy man and told me the best thing i could do would be to go below and turn in and he would take me back to my friends if i had any  i didnt want to tell him what i was up to but i found i had to and so i explained to him that i was a rich sailor takin a lark and the lark i wanted to take was to sail on a parallel of latitude a hundred miles in a steamer and then to back that steamer along that same parallel to the place where she started from i didnt believe that there was ever a ship in the world that had done that and bein on a lark i wanted to do it and was willin to pay for it and if his engineers and his crew grumbled about backing the steamer for a hundred miles he could explain to them how the matter stood and tell them that bein on a lark i was willin to pay for all extra trouble i might put them to and for any disturbances in their minds which might rise from sailin a vessel in a way which didnt seem to be accordin to the ordinary rules of navigation  now when captain dork knew that i was a rich sailor on a lark he understood me and he made no more objections though he said he wouldnt have spent his money in that way and when he told his crew and his engineers and men about the extra pay they understood the matter and they agreed to back her along the fortyeighth parallel just as nigh as they could until they lay to two miles west of ushant  so back we went and they kept her due east just as nigh as they could and they seemed to take an interest in it as if all of them wanted me to have as good a lark as i could for my money and we didnt skip that parallel very much although it wasnt an easy job i can tell you to keep her head due west and her stern due east and steam backwards they had to rig up the compass abaft the wheel and do some other things that you wouldnt understand madam such as running a spar out to stern to take sight by  i declare said mrs cliff that sort of sailing must have astonished any ship that saw it did you meet any other vessels  oh yes said burke after daybreak we fell in with a good many sail and some steamers and most of them ran close and hailed us but there wasnt any answer to give them except that we were returning to port and didnt want no help but some of the skippers of the smaller crafts were so full of curiosity that they stuck to us and when we arrived off ushant which wasnt until nearly dark the next day the duke of dorchester had a convoy of five sloops two schooners a brig eight pilot boats and four tugs  although mr burke had said that he was going to make very short work with his story it had already occupied a good deal of time and he was not half through with it but mrs cliff listened with the greatest interest and the rich sailor went on with his recital of adventures  now when i had finished scoring that fortyeighth parallel backward and forward for a hundred miles i took out my purse and i paid that captain and all the crew what i promised to give them and then we steamed back to brest where i told him to drop anchor and make himself comfortable  i stayed on board for a day and a night just to get my fill feeling i was in command of a steamer before i gave up a seafaring life forever i threw up the rest of the week that i was entitled to and went ashore and my lark was over  i went to england and took passage for home and i had a firstclass stateroom and laid in a lot of good clothes before i started i dont think i ever had greater comfort in my life than sittin on deck smokin a good cigar and watchin the ablebodied seamen at their work  i hope im not tiring you madam but im trying to cut things as short as i can its often said that a sailor is all at sea when he is on shore but i was a country fellow before i was a sailor and land doings come naturally to me when i fix my mind on them  id made up my mind i was going to build my mother a house on cape cod but when i got home i thought it better to buy her one already built and thats what i did and i stayed there with her a little while but i didnt like it id had a notion of having another house near my mothers but i gave up that theres too much sea about cape cod  now she liked it for shes a regular sailors mother but i couldnt feel that i was really a rich fellow livin ashore until i got out of hearin of the ocean and out of smellin of salt and tar so i made up my mind that id go inland and settle somewhere on a place of my own where i might have command of some sort of farm  i didnt know just exactly what i wanted nor just exactly where i wanted to go so i thought it best to look around a little and hold council with somebody or other i couldnt hold council with my mother because she wanted me to buy a ship and take command of her and then i thought of captain horn and goin to ask him but the captain is a great man  indeed he is exclaimed mrs cliff we all know that  but he is off on his own business continued burke and what sort of a princely concern hes got on hand i dont know anyway he wouldnt want me followin him about and botherin him and so i thought of everybody i could and at last it struck me that there wasnt anybody better than you mrs cliff to give me the points i wanted for i always liked you mrs cliff and i consider you a woman of good sense down to the keel and as i heard you were livin in sort of a country place i thought youd be the very person that i could come and talk to and get points  i felt a hankerin anyway after some of the old people of the castor for after having had all that money divided among us it made me feel as if we belonged to the same family i suppose that was one reason why i felt a sort of drawing to you you know anyway i knew where you lived and i came right here and arrived this morning after id taken a room at the hotel i asked for your house and came straight here  and very glad am i to see you mr burke said mrs cliff speaking honestly from the bottom of her heart  she had not known burke very well but she had always looked upon him as a fine manly sailor and now that he had come to her she was conscious of the family feeling which he had spoken of and she was very glad to see him  she saw that burke was very anxious to know why she was living in a plain fashion in this unpretentious house but she found it would be very difficult to explain the matter to him hers was not a straightforward tale which she could simply sit and tell and moreover although she liked burke and thought it probable that he was a man of a very good heart she did not believe that he was capable of advising her in the perplexities which her wealth had thrown about her  still she talked to him and told him what she thought she could make him properly understand and so from one point to another she went on until she had given the exsailor a very good idea of the state of her mind in regard to what she was doing and what she thought she ought to do  when mrs cliff had finished speaking burke thrust his hands into his pockets leaned back in his chair and looked at the ceiling of the room the walls and the floor he wanted to say something but he was not prepared to do so his mind still nautical desired to take an observation and determine the latitude and longitude of mrs cliff but the skies were very much overcast  at this moment willy croup knocked at the parlor door and when mrs cliff went to her she asked if the gentleman was going to stay to dinner  mrs cliff was surprised she had no idea it was so late but she went back to mr burke and urged him to stay to dinner he consented instantly declaring that this was the first time that anybody not his mother had asked him to dinner since he came into his fortune  when mrs cliff had excused herself to give some directions about the meal burke walked about the parlor carefully examining everything in it when he had finished his survey he sat down and shook his head  the trouble with her is he said to himself that shes so dreadfully afraid of running ashore that she will never reach any port thats whats the matter  when mrs cliff returned she asked her visitor if he would like to see her house and she showed him over it with great satisfaction for she had filled every room with all the handsome and appropriate things she could get into it burke noticed everything and spoke with approbation of many things but as he walked behind his hostess he kept shaking his head  he went down to dinner and was introduced to willy croup who had been ordered to go and dress herself that she might appear at the meal he shook hands with her very cordially and then looked all around the little diningroom taking in every feature of its furnishing and adornment when he had finished he would have been glad to shake his head again but this would have been observed  when the dinner came on however mr burke had no desire to shake his head it was what might have been called a family dinner but there was such a variety such an abundance everything was so admirably cooked and the elderberry wine which was produced in his honor was so much more rich and fragrant to his taste than the wines he had had at hotels that mr burke was delighted  now he felt that in forming an opinion as to mrs cliffs manner of living he had some grounds to stand upon what she wants thought he is all the solid sensible comfort her money can give her and where she knows what she wants she gets it but the trouble seems to be that in most things she doesnt know what she wants  when mr burke that afternoon walked back to the hotel wrapped in his furtrimmed coat and carefully puffing a fine havana cigar he had entirely forgotten his own plans and purposes in life and was engrossed in those of mrs cliff     chapter vii  mr burke accepts a responsibility   willy croup was very much pleased with mr burke and she was glad that she had allowed herself to be persuaded to sit at table with such a fine gentleman  he treated her with extreme graciousness of manner and it was quite plain to her that if he recognized her in her silk gown as the person who in a calico dress had opened the front door for him he had determined to make her feel that he had not noticed the coincidence  he was a good deal younger than she was but willys childlike disposition had projected itself into her maturer years and in some respects there was a greater sympathy quickly perceived by both between her and mr burke than yet existed between him and mrs cliff after some of the amusing anecdotes which he told the visitor looked first towards willy to see how she appreciated them but it must not be supposed that he was not extremely attentive and deferential to his hostess  if willy had known what a brave gallant and daring sailor he was she would have made a hero of him but mrs cliff had never said much about burke and willy simply admired him as the best specimen of the urbane man of the world with whom she had yet met  the two women talked a good deal about their visitor that evening and mrs cliff said that she hoped he was not going to leave town very soon for it was possible that she might be of help to him if he wanted to settle down in that part of the country  the next morning soon after breakfast when willy opened the front gate of the yard and stepped out upon the street with a small covered basket in her hand she had gone but a very little distance when she met mr burke with his furs his cane and his silk hat the latter was lifted very high as its owner saluted miss croup  willy who was of a fair complexion reddened somewhat as she shook hands with the gentleman informed him in answer to his questions that mrs cliff was very well that she was very well that the former was at home and would be glad to see him and that she herself was going into the business part of the town to make some little purchases  she would have been better pleased if she had not been obliged to tell him where she was going but she could not do otherwise when he said he supposed she was walking for the benefit of the fresh morning air he added to her discomfiture by requesting to be allowed to walk with her and by offering to carry her basket this threw willys mind into a good deal of a flutter why could she not have met this handsomely dressed gentleman sometime when she was not going to the grocery store to buy such things as stoveblacking and borax  it seemed to her as if these commodities must suggest to the mind of any one rusty iron and obtrusive insects and as articles altogether outside the pale of allusion in hightoned social intercourse  it also struck her as a little odd that a gentleman should propose to accompany a lady when she was going on domestic errands but then this gentleman was different from any she had known and there were many ways of the world with which she was not at all acquainted  mr burke immediately began to speak of the visit of the day before he had enjoyed seeing mrs cliff again and he had never sat down to a better dinner  yes said willy she likes good eatin and she knows what it is and if she had a bigger diningroom she would often invite people to dinner and i expect the house would be quite lively as she seems more given to company than she used to be and thats all right considerin shes better able to afford it  mr burke took a deep satisfied breath the opportunity had already come to him to speak his mind  afford it said he i should think so mrs cliff must be very rich she is worth i should saywell i dont know what to say not knowing exactly and precisely what each person got when the grand division was made  willys loyalty to mrs cliff prompted her to put her in as good a light as possible before this man of the world and her own selfesteem prompted her to show that being a friend and relative of this rich lady she was not ignorant of her affairs in life  oh shes rich said willy i cant say of course just how much she has but im quite sure that she owns at least  willy wished to put the amount of the fortune at one hundred thousand dollars but she was a little afraid that this might be too much and yet she did not wish to make the amount any smaller than could possibly be helped so she thought of seventyfive and then eighty and finally remarked that mrs cliff must be worth at least ninety thousand dollars mr burke looked up at the sky and wanted to whistle  ninety thousand dollars he said to himself i know positively that it was at least four millions at the time of the division and she says shes richer now than she was then which is easy to be accounted for by the interest coming in i see her game she wants to keep shady about her big fortune because her neighbors would expect her to live up to it and she knows it isnt in her to live up to it now im beginning to see through the fog it seems to me said he that mrs cliff ought to have a bigger diningroom  this remark pulled up the floodgate to willys accumulated sentiments on the subject and they poured forth in a rushing stream  yes indeed mrs cliff ought to have a bigger diningroom and other rooms to the house and there was the front fence and no end of things she ought to have and it was soon made clear to mr burke that willy had been lying awake at night thinking and thinking and thinking about what mrs cliff ought to have and what she did not have she said she really and honestly believed that there was no reason at all why she did not have them except that she did not want to seem to be setting herself up above her neighbors in fact mrs cliff had told willy two or three times when there had been a discussion about prices that she was able to do anything she wanted and if she could do that why did she not do it people were all talking about it and they had talked and talked her fortune down until in some families it was not any more than ten thousand dollars  on and on talked willy while mr burke said scarcely a word but he listened with the greatest attention they had now walked on until they had reached the main street of the little town gone through the business part where the shops were and out into the suburbs suddenly willy stopped  oh dear she exclaimed ive gone too far i was so interested in talking that i didnt think  im sorry said mr burke that ive taken you out of your way cant i get you what you want and save you the trouble  now willy was in another flutter after the walk with the furtrimmed coat and the talk about dollars by thousands and tens of thousands she could not come down to mention borax and blacking  oh no thank you said she trying her best to think of some other errand than the one she had come upon i dont believe its finished yet and its hardly worth while to stop there was one of those big cushion covers that she brought from paris that was to be filled with down but i dont believe its ready yet and i neednt stop  mr burke could not but think it a little odd that such a small basket should be brought for the purpose of carrying home a large down cushion but he said nothing further on the subject he had had a most gratifying conversation with this communicative and agreeable person and his interest in mrs cliff was greatly increased  when he neared the hotel he took leave of his companion saying that he would call in the afternoon and willy after she had looked back and was sure he was out of sight slipped into the grocery store and got her borax and blacking  mr burke called on mrs cliff that afternoon and the next morning and two or three times the day after they came to be very much interested in each other and burke in his mind compared this elderly friend with his mother and not to the advantage of the latter burkes mother was a woman who would always have her own way and wanted advice and counsel from no one but mrs cliff was a very different woman  she was so willing to listen to what burke saidand his remarks were nearly always on the subject of the proper expenditure of moneyand appeared to attach so much importance to his opinions that he began to feel that a certain responsibility not at all an unpleasant one was forcing itself upon him  he did not think that he should try to constitute himself her director or even to assume the position of professional suggester but in an amateur way he suggested and she without any idea of depending upon him for suggestions found herself more and more inclined to accept them as he continued to offer them  she soon discovered that he was the only person in plainton who knew her real fortune and this was a bond of sympathy and union between them and she became aware that she had succeeded in impressing him with her desire to live upon her fortune in such a manner that it would not interfere with her friendships or associations and her lifelong ideas of comfort and pleasure  the people of the town talked a great deal about the fine gentleman at the hotel but they knew he was one of the people who had become rich in consequence of captain horns discovery and some of them good friends of mrs cliff felt sorry that she had not profited to as great a degree by that division as this gentleman of opulent taste who occupied two of the best rooms in the hotel and obliged mr williams to send to harrington and even to boston for provisions suitable to his epicurean tastes and who drove around the country with a carriage and pair at least once a day  when burke was ready to make his suggestions he thought he would begin in a mild fashion and see how mrs cliff would take them  if i was in your place madam said he the first thing i would do would be to have a lot of servants theres nothin money can give a person thats better than plenty of people to do things lots of them on hand all the time like the crew of a ship  but i couldnt do that mr burke said she my house is too small i havent any place for servants to sleep when i enlarge my house of course i may have more servants  oh i wouldnt wait for that said he until then you could board them at the hotel  this suggestion was strongly backed by willy croup and mrs cliff took the matter to heart she collected together a domestic establishment of as many servants as she thought her establishment could possibly provide with work and although she did not send them to be guests at the hotel she obtained lodging for them at the house of a poor woman in the neighborhood  when she had done this she felt that she had made a step in the direction of doing her duty by her money  mr burke made another suggestion if i was you said he i wouldnt wait for times or seasons for in these days people build in winter the same as in summer i would put up that addition just as soon as it could be done  mrs cliff sighed i suppose thats what i should do said she i feel that it is but you know how i hate to begin it  but you neednt hate it said he there isnt the least reason in the world for any objection to it ive a plan which will make it all clear sailin ive been thinkin it out and this is the way ive thought it mrs cliff listened with great attention  now then said burke next to you on the west is your own lot that youre going to put your new diningroom on am i right there  yes said mrs cliff you are right there  well next to that is the little house inhabited by a family named barnard im told and next to that theres a large corner lot with an old house on it thats for sale now then if i was you id buy that corner lot and clear away the old house and id build my diningroom right there id get a good architect and let him plan you a firstclass a number one diningroom with other rooms to it above it and below it and around it with porticos and piazzas and little balconies to the second story and everything that anybody might want attached to a firstclass diningroom  mrs cliff laughed but what good would it be to me away up there at the corner of the next street  the reason for putting it there said burke is to get clear of all the noise and dirt of building and the fuss and bother that you dislike so much and then when it was all finished and painted and papered and the carpets down if you like id have it moved right up here against your house just where you want it when everything was in order and you was ready you could cut a door right through into the new diningroom and there youd be theyve got so in the way of slidin buildings along on timbers now that they can travel about almost like the old stage coaches and you neednt have your cellar dug until youre ready to clap your new diningroom right over it  mrs cliff smiled and willy listened with open eyes but how about the barnard family and their house said she  oh id buy them a lot somewhere else said he and move their house they wouldnt object if you paid them extra what id have if i was in your place mrs cliff would be a clear lot down to the next street and id have a garden in it with flowers and gravel walks and greenhouses and all that sort of thing  all stretching itself out in the sunshine under the new diningroom windows cried willy croup with sparkling eyes  mrs cliff sat and considered a cheerful glow in her veins here really was an opportunity of stemming the current of her income without shocking any of her social instincts     chapter viii  mr burke begins to make things move in plainton   it was not long before mr burke began to be a very important personage in plainton it was generally known that he intended to buy land and settle in the neighborhood and as he was a rich man evidently inclined to be liberal in his expenditures this was a matter of great interest both in social and business circles  he often drove out to survey the surrounding country but when he was perceived several times standing in front of an old house at the corner of the street near mrs cliffs residence it was supposed that he might have changed his mind in regard to a country place and was thinking of building in the town  he was not long considered a stranger in the place mrs cliff frequently spoke of him as a valued friend and there was reason to believe that in the various adventures and dangers of which they had heard mr burke had been of great service to their old friend and neighbor and it was not unlikely that his influence had had a good deal to do with her receipt of a portion of the treasure discovered by the commander of the expedition  several persons had said more than once that they could not see why mrs cliff should have had any claim upon this treasure except perhaps to the extent of her losses but if she had had a friend in campand mr burke was certainly a friendit was easy to understand why he would do the best he could at a time when money was so plenty for the benefit of one whom he knew to be a widow in straitened circumstances  so mr burke was looked upon not only as a man of wealth and superior tastes in regard to food and personal comfort but as a man of a liberal and generous disposition furthermore there was no pride about him often on his return from his drives his barouche and pair which mr williams had obtained in harrington for his guests express benefit would stop in front of mrs cliffs modest residence and two or three times he had taken that good lady and willy croup to drive with him  but mrs cliff did not care very much for the barouche she would have preferred a little phaëton and a horse which she could drive herself as for her horse and the twoseated wagon that was declared by most of the ladies of the town to be a piece of absolute extravagance it was used almost exclusively by willy who was known to deal with shops in the most distant part of the town in order that she might have an excuse it was said to order out that wagon and have andrew marks to drive her  of course they did not know how often mrs cliff had said to herself that it was really not a waste of money to keep this horse for willy was no longer young and if she could save her any weary steps she ought to do it and at the same time relieve a little the congested state of her income  moreover mr burke was not of an unknown family he was quite willing to talk about himself especially to mr williams as they sat and smoked together in the evening and he said a good deal about his father who had owned two ships at nantucket and who according to his son was one of the most influential citizens of the place  mr williams had heard of the burkes of nantucket and he did not think any the less of the one who was now his guest because his fathers ships had come to grief during his boyhood and he had been obliged to give up a career on shore which he would have liked and go to sea which he did not like a brave spirit in poverty coupled with a liberal disposition in opulence was enough to place mr burke on a very high plane in the opinions of the people of plainton  half a mile outside the town upon a commanding eminence there was a handsome house which belonged to a family named buskirk these people were really not of plainton although their postoffice and railroad station were there they were rich city people who came to this country place for the summer and autumn and who had nothing to do with the town folks except in a limited degree to deal with some of them  this family lived in great style and their coachman and footman in knee breeches their handsome horses with docked tails the beautiful grounds about their house a feebly shooting fountain on the front lawn were a source of anxious disquietude in the mind of mrs cliff they were like the skeletons which were brought in at the feasts of the ancients  if i should ever be obliged to live like the buskirks on the hill the good lady would say to herself i would wish myself back to what i used to be asking only that my debts be paid  even the buskirks took notice of mr burke in him they thought it possible they might have a neighbor if he should buy a place and build a fine house somewhere in their vicinity which they thought the only vicinity in which any one should build a fine house it might be a very good thing and would certainly not depreciate the value of their property a wealthy bachelor might indeed be a more desirable neighbor than a large family  the buskirks had been called upon when they came to plainton a few years before by several families of course the clergyman mr perley and his wife paid them a visit and the two misses thorpedyke hired a carriage and drove to the house and although they did not see the family they left their cards  after some time these and other calls were returned but in the most ceremonious manner and there ended the social intercourse between the fine house on the hill and the town  as the buskirks drove to harrington to church they did not care about the perleys and although they seemed somewhat inclined to cultivate the thorpedykes who were known to be of such an excellent old family the thorpedykes did not reciprocate the feeling and having declined an invitation to tea received no more  but now mr buskirk who had come up on saturday to spend sunday with his family actually called on mr burke at the hotel the wealthy sailor was not at home and the city gentleman left his card  when mr burke showed this card to mrs cliff her face clouded are you going to return the visit said she  oh yes answered burke some of these days i will drive up and look in on them i expect they have got a fancy parlor and i would like to sit in it a while and think of the days when i used to swab the deck theres nothin more elevatin to my mind than just that sort of thing i do it sometime when i am eatin my meals at the hotel and the better i can bring to mind the bad coffee and hard tack the better i like whats set before me  mrs cliff sighed she wished mr buskirk had kept away from the hotel  as soon as mrs cliff had consented to the erection of the new diningroom on the corner lotand she did not hesitate after mr burke had explained to her how easy it would be to do the whole thing almost without her knowing anything about it if she did not want to bother herself in the matterthe enterprise was begun  burke who was of an active mind and who delighted in managing and directing undertook to arrange everything there was no agreement between mrs cliff and himself that he should do this but it pleased him so much to do it and it pleased her so much to have him do it that it was done as a thing which might be expected to happen naturally  sometimes she said he was giving her too much of his time but he scorned such an idea he had nothing to do for he did not believe that he should buy a place for himself until spring because he wanted to pick out a spot to live in when the leaves were coming out instead of when they were dropping off and the best fun he knew of would be to have command of a big crew and to keep them at work building mrs cliffs diningroom  i should be glad to have you attend to the contracts said mrs cliff and all i ask is that while you dont waste anythingfor i think it is a sin to waste money no matter how much you may havethat you will help me as much as you can to make me feel that i really am making use of my income  burke agreed to do all this always under her advice of course and very soon he had his crew and they were hard at work he sent to harrington and employed an architect to make plans and as soon as the general basis of these was agreed upon the building was put in charge of a contractor who under mr burke began to collect material and workmen from all available quarters  weve got to work sharp for the new building must be moored alongside mrs cliffs house before the first snowstorm  a lawyer of plainton undertook the purchase of the land and as the payments were to be made in cash and as there was no chaffering about prices this business was soon concluded  as to the barnard family mr burke himself undertook negotiations with them when he had told them of the handsome lot on another street which would be given them in exchange and how he would gently slide their house to the new location and put it down on any part of the lot which they might choose and guaranteed that it should be moved so gently that the clocks would not stop ticking nor the tea or coffee spill out of their cups if they chose to take their meals on board during the voyage and as furthermore he promised a handsome sum to recompense them for the necessity of leaving behind their well which he could not undertake to move and for any minor inconveniences and losses their consent to the change of location was soon obtained  four days after this burke started the barnard house on its travels as soon as he had made his agreement with the family he had brought a man down from harrington whose business it was to move houses and had put the job into his hands he stipulated that at one oclock pm on the day agreed upon the house was to begin to move and he arranged with the mason to whom he had given the contract for preparing the cellar on the new lot that he should begin operations at the same hour  he then offered a reward of two hundred dollars to be given to the mover if he got his house to its destination before the cellar was done or to the mason if he finished the cellar before the house arrived  the barnards had an early dinner which was cooked on a kerosene stove their chimney having been taken down but they had not finished washing the dishes when their house began to move  mrs cliff and willy ran to bid them goodbye and all the barnards old and young leaned out of a back window and shook hands  mr burke had arranged a sort of gangplank with a railing if any of them wanted to go on shorethat is step on terra firmaduring the voyage but samuel rolands the mover heedful of his special prize urged upon them not to get out any oftener than could be helped because when they wished to use the gangplank he would be obliged to stop  there were two boys in the family who were able to jump off and on whenever they pleased but boys are boys and very different from other people  houses had been moved in plainton before but never had any inhabitants of the place beheld a building glide along upon its timber course with speaking comparatively the rapidity of this travelling home  most of the citizens of the place who had leisure came at some time that afternoon to look at the moving house and many of them walked by its side talking to the barnards who as the sun was warm stood at an open window very much excited by the spirit of adventure and quite willing to converse  over and over they assured their neighbors that they would never know they were moving if they did not see the trees and things slowly passing by them  as they crossed the street and passed between two houses on the opposite side the inhabitants of these gathered at their windows and the conversation was very lively with the barnards as the house of the latter passed slowly by  all night that house moved on and the young people of the village accompanied it until eleven oclock when the barnards went to bed  mr burke divided his time between watching the moving house at which all the men who could be employed in any way and all the horses which could be conveniently attached to the windlasses were working in watches of four hours each in order to keep them fresh and vigorousand the lot where the new cellar was being constructed where the masons continued their labors at night by the light of lanterns and a blazing bonfire fed with resinous pine  the excitement caused by these two scenes of activity was such that it is probable that few of the people of the town went to bed sooner than the barnard family  early the next morning the two barnard boys looked out of the window of their bedroom and saw beneath them the hastings barnyard with the hastings boy milking they were so excited by this vision that they threw their shoes and stockings out at him having no other missiles convenient and for nearly half an hour he followed that house trying to toss the articles back through the open window while the cow stood waiting for the milking to be finished  on the evening of the third day after its departure from its original position the barnard house arrived on the new lot and to the disgust of samuel rolands he found the cellar entirely finished and ready for him to place the house upon it but mr burke who had been quite sure that this would be the result of the competition comforted him by telling him that as he had done his best he too should have a prize equal to that given to the mason this had been suggested by mrs cliff because she said that as they were both hardworking men with families and although the housemover was not a citizen of plainton he had once lived there she was very glad of this opportunity of helping them along  as soon as this important undertaking had been finished mr burke was able to give his sole attention to the new diningroom on the corner lot he and the architect had worked hard upon the plans and when they were finished they had been shown to mrs cliff she understood them in a general way and was very glad to see that such ample provisions had been made in regard to closets though she was not able to perceive with her minds eye the exact dimensions of a room nineteen by twentyseven nor to appreciate the difference between a ceiling twelve feet high and another which was nine  however having told mr burke and the architect what she wanted and both of them having told her what she ought to have she determined to leave the whole matter in their hands this resolution was greatly approved by her sailor friend for as the object of the plan of construction was to relieve her of all annoyance consequent upon building operations the more she left everything to those who delighted in the turmoil of construction the better it would be for all  everything had been done in the plans to prevent interference with the neatness and comfort of mrs cliffs present abode the door of the new diningroom was so arranged that when it was moved up to the old house it would exactly fit against a door in the latter which opened from a side hall upon a little porch this porch being removed the two doors would fit exactly to each other and there would be none of the dust and noise consequent upon the cutting away of walls  so mrs cliff and willy lived on in peace comfort and quiet in their old home while on the corner lot there was hammering and banging and sawing all day mr burke would have had this work go on by night but the contractor refused his men would work extra hours in consideration of extra inducements but good carpenter work he declared could not be done by lantern light  the people of plainton did not at all understand the operations on the corner lot mr burke did not tell them much about it and the contractor was not willing to talk he had some doubts in regard to the scheme but as he was well paid he would do his best it had been mentioned that the new building was to be mrs cliffs diningroom but this idea soon faded out of the plainton mind which was not adapted to grasp and hold it  consequently as mr burke had a great deal to do with the building and as mrs cliff did not appear to be concerned in it at all it was generally believed that the gentleman at the hotel was putting up a house for himself on the corner lot this knowledge was the only conclusion which would explain the fact that the house was built upon smooth horizontal timbers and not upon a stone or brick foundation a man who had been a sailor might fancy to build a house something as he would build a ship in a shipyard and not attach it permanently to the earth     chapter ix  a meeting of heirs   while the building operations were going on at such a rapid rate on the corner lot mrs cliff tried to make herself as happy as possible in her own home she liked having enough servants to do all the work and relieve both her and willy she liked to be able to drive out when she wanted to or to invite a few of her friends to dinner or to tea and to give them the very best the markets afforded of everything she thought they might like but she was not a satisfied woman  it was true that mr burke was doing all that he could with her money and doing it well she had not the slightest doubt but after all a new diningroom was a matter of small importance she had fears that even after it was all finished and paid for she would find that her income had gained upon her  as often as once a day the argument came to her that it would be wise for her to give away the bulk of her fortune in charity and thus rid herself of the necessity for this depressing struggle between her desire to live as she wanted to live and the obligations to herself under which her fortune placed her but she could not consent to thus part with her great fortune she would not turn her back upon her golden opportunities as soon as she had so determined her life that the assertion of her riches would not interfere with her domestic and social affairs she would be charitable enough she would do good works upon a large scale but she must first determine what she was to do for herself and so let her charities begin at home  this undecided state of mind did not have a good effect upon her general appearance and it was frequently remarked that her health was not what it used to be miss nancy shott thought there was nothing to wonder at in this mrs cliff had never been accustomed to spend money and it was easy to see from the things she had bought abroad and put into that little house that she had expended a good deal more than she could afford and no wonder she was troubled and no wonder she was looking thin and sick  other friends however did not entirely agree with miss shott they thought their old friend was entirely too sensible a woman to waste a fortune whether it had been large or small which had come to her in so wonderful a manner and they believed she had money enough to live on very comfortably if this were not the case she would never consent to keep a carriage almost for willy croups sole use  they thought perhaps that the example and companionship of mr burke might have had an effect upon her it was as likely as not that she had borne part of the expense of moving the barnard house so that there should be nothing between her and the new building but this as they said themselves was mere surmise mr burke might fancy large grounds and he was certainly able to have them if he wanted them whatever people said and thought about mrs cliff and her money it was generally believed that she was in comfortable circumstances still it had to be admitted that she was getting on in years  now arose a very important question among the gossips of plainton who was to be mrs cliffs heir  everybody knew that mrs cliff had but one blood relation living and that was willy croup and no one who had given any thought whatever to the subject believed that willy croup would be her heir her husband had some distant relatives but as they had had nothing to do with mrs cliff during the days of her adversity it was not likely that she would now have anything to do with them especially as any money she had to leave did not come through her husband  but although the simpleminded willy croup was a person who would not know how to take care of money if she had it and although everybody knew that if mrs cliff made a will she would never think of leaving her property to willy still everybody who thought or talked about the matter saw the appalling fact staring them in their facesthat if mrs cliff died without a will willy would inherit her possessions  the more it was considered the more did this unpleasant contingency trouble the minds of certain of the female citizens of plainton miss cushing the principal dressmaker of the place was greatly concerned upon this subject and as her parlor where she generally sat at her work was a favorite resort of certain ladies who sometimes had orders to give and always had a great deal to say it was natural that those good women who took most to heart mrs cliffs heirless condition should think of miss cushing whenever they were inclined to talk upon the subject  miss shott dropped in there one day with a very doleful countenance that very morning she had passed mrs cliffs house on the other side of the way and had seen that poor widow standing in her front yard with the most dejected and miserable countenance she had ever seen on a human being  people might talk as much as they pleased about mrs cliff being troubled because she had spent too much money that all might be or it might not be but it was not the reason for that woman looking as if she was just ready to drop into a sickbed when people go to the most unhealthy regions in the whole world and live in holes in the ground like hedgehogs they cannot expect to come home without seeds of disease in their system which are bound to come out and that those seeds were now coming out in mrs cliff no sensible person could look at her and deny  when miss cushing heard this she felt more strongly convinced than ever of the importance of the subject upon which she and some of her friends had been talking but she said nothing in regard to that subject to miss shott what she had to say and what she had already said about the future of mrs cliffs property and what her particular friends had said were matters which none of them wanted repeated and when a citizen of plainton did not wish anything repeated it was not told to miss shott  but after miss shott had gone there came in mrs ferguson a widow lady and shortly afterwards miss inchman a middleaged spinster accompanied by mrs wells and mrs archibald these latter both worthy matrons of the town mrs archibald really came to talk to miss cushing about a winter dress but during the subsequent conversation she made no reference to this errand  miss cushing was relating to mrs ferguson what nancy had told her when the other ladies came in but nancy shott had stopped in at each of their houses and had already given them the information  nancy always makes out things a good deal worse than they are said mrs archibald but theres truth in what she says mrs cliff is failing everybody can see that  of course they can said miss cushing and i say that if she has any friends in plaintonand everybody knows she hasits time for them to do something  the trouble is what to do and who is to do it remarked mrs ferguson  what to do is easy enough said miss cushing but who is to do it is another matter  and what would you do asked mrs wells if she feels she needs a doctor she has sense enough to send for one without waiting until her friends speak about it  the doctor is a different thing altogether said miss cushing if he comes and cures her thats neither here nor there it isnt the point but the danger is that whether he comes or not she is a woman well on in years with a constitution breaking down under herthat is as far as appearances go for of course i cant say anything positive about itand she has nobody to inherit her money and as far as anybody knows she has never made a will  oh she has never made a will said mrs wells because my john is in the office and if mrs cliff had ever come there on such business he would know about it  but she ought to make a will said miss cushing thats the long and short of it and she ought to have a friend who would tell her so that would be no more than a christian duty which any one of us would owe to another if cases were changed  i dont look upon mrs cliff as such a very old woman said miss inchman but i agree with you that this thing ought to be put before her willy croup will never do it and really if some one of us dont i dont know who will  theres mrs perley said mrs archibald  oh shed never do struck in miss cushing mrs perley is too timid she would throw it off on her husband and if he talks to mrs cliff about a will her money will all go to the church or to some charity i should say that one of us ought to take on herself this friendly duty of course it would not do to go to her and blurt out that we all thought she would not live very long and that she ought to make her will but conversation could be led to the matter and when mrs cliff got to consider her own case i havent a doubt but that she would be glad to have advice and help from an old friend  all agreed that this was a very correct view of the case but not one of them volunteered to go and talk to mrs cliff on the subject this was not from timidity nor from an unwillingness to meddle in other peoples business but from a desire on the part of each not to injure herself in mrs cliffs eyes by any action which might indicate that she had a personal interest in the matter  miss cushing voiced the opinion of the company when she said when a person has no heirs relatives ought to be considered first but if there are none of these or if they arent suitable then friends should come in of course i mean the oldest and best friends of the party without heirs  no remark immediately followed this for each lady was thinking that she probably more than any one else in plainton had a claim upon mrs cliffs attention if she were leaving her property to her friends as she certainly ought to do  in years gone by mrs cliff had been a very kind friend to miss cushing she had loaned her money and assisted her in various ways and since her return to plainton she had put a great deal of work into miss cushings hands dress after dress for willy croup had been made and material for others was still lying in the house and mrs cliff herself had ordered so much work that at this moment miss cushing had two girls upstairs sewing diligently upon it  having experienced all this kindness miss cushing felt that if mrs cliff left any of her money to her friends she would certainly remember her and that right handsomely if anybody spoke to mrs cliff upon the subject she would insist and she thought she had a right to insist that her name should be brought in prominently  mrs ferguson had also welldefined opinions upon the subject she had two daughters who were more than half grown had learned all that they could be taught in plainton and she was very anxious to send them away to school where their natural talents could be properly cultivated she felt that she owed a deep and solemn duty to these girls and she had already talked to mrs cliff about them  the latter had taken a great deal of interest in the matter and although she had not said she would help mrs ferguson to properly educate these girls for she had not asked her help she had taken so much interest in the matter that their mother had great hopes and if this widow without any children felt inclined to assist the children of others during her life how much more willing would she be likely to be to appropriate a portion of what she left behind her to such an object  mrs wells and mrs archibald had solid claims upon mrs cliff it was known that shortly after the death of her husband when she found it difficult to make collections and was very much in need of money for immediate expenses they had each made loans to her it is true that even before she started for south america she had repaid these loans with full legal interest but the two matrons could not forget that they had been kind to her nor did they believe that mrs cliff had forgotten what they had done for the presents she had brought them from france were generally considered as being more beautiful and more valuable than those given to anybody elseexcept the thorpedykes and the perleys this indicated a very gratifying gratitude upon which the two ladies each for herself had every right to build very favorable hopes  miss inchman and mrs cliff had been schoolfellows and when they were both grown young women there had been a good deal of doubt which one of them william cliff would marry he made his choice and susan inchman never showed by word or deed that she begrudged him to her friend to whom she had always endeavored to show just as much kindly feeling as if there had been two william cliffs and each of the young women had secured one of them if mrs cliff now a widow with money enough to live well upon and keep a carriage was making out her will and was thinking of her friends in plainton it would be impossible for her to forget one who was the oldest friend of all  so it is easy to see why she did not want to go to mrs cliff and prejudice her against herself by stating that she ought to make a will for the benefit of the old friends who had always loved and respected her  miss cushing now spoke she knew what each member of the little company was thinking about and she felt that it might as well be spoken of  it does seem to me said she and i never would have thought of it if it hadnt been for the talk we hadthat we five are the persons that mrs cliff would naturally mention in her will not perhaps regarding any money she might have to leave  i dont see why interrupted mrs ferguson  well thats neither here nor there continued miss cushing money is money and nobody knows what people will do with it when they die and if she leaves anything to the church or to charity its her money but im sure that mrs cliff has too much hard sense to order her executors to sell all the beautiful rugs and tablecovers and glass and china and the dear knows what besides is in her house at this moment they wouldnt bring anything at a sale and she would naturally think of leaving them to her friends some might get more and some might get less but we five in this room at this present moment are the old friends that mrs cliff would naturally remember and if any one of us ever sees fit to speak to her on the subject were the people who should be mentioned when the proper opportunity comes to make such mention  youre forgetting willy croup said mrs wells  no answered miss cushing a little sharply i dont forget her but ill have nothing to do with her i dont suppose shell be forgotten but whatever is done for her or whatever is not done for her is not our business its my private opinion however that shes had a good deal already  well said mrs ferguson i suppose that what you say is all rightat least ive no objections to any of it but whoevers going to speak to her it mustnt be me because she knows ive daughters to educate and shed naturally think that if i spoke i was principally speaking for myself and that would set her against me which i wouldnt do for the world and whatever other people may say i believe she will have money to leave  miss cushing hesitated for a moment and then spoke up boldly  its my opinion said she that miss inchman is the proper person to speak to mrs cliff on this important subject shes known her all her life from the time when they were little girls together and when they were both grown she made sacrifices for her which none of the rest of us had the chance to make  now for miss inchman to go and open the subject in a gradual and friendly way would be the right and proper thing no matter how you look at it and its my opinion that we who are now here should ask her to go and speak not in our names perhaps but out of goodwill and kindness to us as well as to mrs cliff  mrs wells was a lady who was in the habit of saying things at the wrong time and she now remarked weve forgotten the thorpedykes you know mrs cliff  miss cushing leaned forward her face reddened bother the thorpedykes she exclaimed theyre no more than acquaintances and ought not to be spoken of at all and as for mrs perley if any ones thinking of her shes only been here four years and that gives her no claim whatever considering that weve been lifelong friends and neighbors of sarah cliff  and now in behalf of all of us i ask you miss inchman will you speak to mrs cliff  miss inchman was rather a small woman spare in figure and she wore glasses which seemed to be of a peculiar kind for while they enabled her to see through them into surrounding space they did not allow people who looked at her to see through them into her eyes people often remarked that you could not tell the color of miss inchmans eyes when she had her spectacles on  thus it was that although her eyes were sometimes brighter than at other times and this could be noticed through her spectacles it was difficult to understand her expression and to discover whether she was angry or amused  now miss inchmans eyes behind her spectacles brightened very much as she looked from miss cushing to the other members of the little party who had constituted themselves the heirs of mrs cliff none of them could judge from her face what she was likely to say but they all waited to hear what she would say at this moment the door opened and mrs cliff entered the parlor     chapter x  the intellect of miss inchman   it was true that on that morning mrs cliff had been standing in her front yard looking as her best friends would not have liked her to look there was nothing physically the matter with her but she was dissatisfied and somewhat disturbed in her mind mr burke was so busy nowadays that when he stopped in to see her it was only for a few minutes and willy croup had developed a great facility in discovering things which ought to be attended to in various parts of the town and of going to attend to them with andrew marks to drive her  not only did mrs cliff feel that she was left more to herself than she liked but she had the novel experience of not being able to find interesting occupation she was was glad to have servants who could perform all the household duties and could have done more if they had had a chance still it was unpleasant to feel that she herself could do so little to fill up her unoccupied moments so she put on a shawl and went into her front yard simply to walk about and get a little of the fresh air but when she went out of the door she stood still contemplating the front fence  here was a fence which had been an eyesore to her for two or three years she believed she had money enough to fence in the whole state and yet those shabby palings and posts must offend her eye every time she came out of her door the flowers were nearly all dead now and she would have had a new fence immediately but mr burke had dissuaded her saying that when the new diningroom was brought over from the corner lot there would have to be a fence around the whole premises and it would be better to have it all done at once  there are so many things which i can afford just as well as not she said to herself and which i cannot do and it was the unmistakable doleful expression upon her countenance as she thought this which was the foundation of miss shotts remarks to her neighbors on the subject of mrs cliffs probable early demise  miss shott was passing on the other side of the street and she was walking rapidly but she could see more out of the corner of her eye than most people could see when they were looking straight before them at the same things  suddenly mrs cliff determined that she must do something she felt blueshe wanted to talk to somebody and feeling thus she naturally went into the house put on her bonnet and her wrap and walked down to see miss cushing there was not anything in particular that she wanted to see her about but there was work going on and she might talk about it or it might happen that she would be inclined to give some orders she was always glad to do anything she could to help that hardworking and kindhearted neighbor  when mrs cliff entered the parlor of miss cushing five women each gave a sudden start the dressmaker was so thrown off her balance that she dropped her sewing on the floor and rising went forward to shake her visitor by the hand a thing she was not in the habit of doing to anybody because as is well known to all the world a person who is sewing for a livelihood cannot get up to shake hands with the friends and acquaintances who may happen in upon her at this the other ladies rose and shook hands and it might have been supposed that the newcomer had just returned from a long absence then miss cushing gave mrs cliff a chair and they all sat down again  mrs cliff looked about her with a smile the sight of these old friends cheered her all her blues were beginning to fade as that color always fades in any kind of sunshine  im glad to see so many of you together she said it almost seems as if you were having some sort of meeting what is it aboutcant i join in  at this there was a momentary silence which threatened to become very embarrassing if it continued a few seconds more and miss cushing was on the point of telling the greatest lie of her career trusting that the other heirs would stand by her and support her in whatever statements she made feeling as they must the absolute necessity of saying something instantly but miss inchman spoke before any one else had a chance to do so  youre right mrs cliff said she we are considering something we didnt come here on purpose to talk about it but we happened in together and so we thought we would talk it over and we all came to the conclusion that it was something which ought to be mentioned to you and i was asked to speak to you about it  four simultaneous gasps were now heard in that little parlor and four chills ran down the backs of four selfconstituted heirs  i must say susan remarked mrs cliff with a goodhumored smile if you want me to do anything theres no need of being so wonderfully formal about it if any one of you or all of you together for that matter have anything to say to me all you had to do was to come and say it  they didnt seem to think that way said miss inchman they all thought that what was to be said would come better from me because id known you so long and we had grown up together  it must be something out of the common said mrs cliff what in the world can it be if you are to speak susan speak out at once lets have it  thats just what im going to do said miss inchman  if mrs cliff had looked around at the four heirs who were sitting upright in their chairs gazing in horror at miss inchman she would have been startled and perhaps frightened but she did not see them she was so much interested in what her old friend susan was saying that she gave to her her whole attention  but now that their appointed spokeswoman had announced her intention of immediately declaring the object of the meeting each one of them felt that this was no place for her but notwithstanding this feeling not one of them moved to go miss cushing of course had no excuse for leaving for this was her own house and although the others might have pleaded errands a power stronger than their disposition to flystronger even than their fears of what mrs cliff might say to them when she knew allkept them in their seats the spell of selfinterest was upon them and held them fast whatever was said and whatever was done they must be there at this supreme moment they could not leave the room they nerved themselves they breathed hard and listened  you see sarah said miss inchman we must all die  thats no new discovery answered mrs cliff and the remark seemed to her so odd that she looked around at the rest of the company to see how they took it and she was thereupon impressed with the idea that some of them had not thought of this great truth of late and that its sudden announcement had thrown them into a shocked solemnity  but the soul of miss cushing was more than shockedit was filled with fury if there had been in that room at that instant a loaded gun pointed towards miss inchman miss cushing would have pulled the trigger this would have been wicked she well knew and contrary to her every principle but never before had she been confronted by such treachery  well continued miss inchman as we must die we ought to make ourselves ready for it in every way that we can and weve been thinking  at this moment the endurance of mrs ferguson gave way the pace and the strain were too great for her each of the others had herself to think for but she had not only herself but two daughters she gave a groan her head fell back her eyes closed and with a considerable thump she slipped from her chair to the floor instantly every one screamed and sprang towards her  what in the world is the matter with her cried mrs cliff as she assisted the others to raise the head of the fainting woman and to loosen her dress  oh i suppose its the thought of her late husband promptly replied miss inchman who felt that it devolved on her to say something and that quickly mrs cliff looked up in amazement  and what has mr ferguson to do with anything she asked  oh its the new cemetery i was going to talk to you about said miss inchman it has been spoken of a good deal since you went away and we all thought that if youd agree to go into it  go into it cried mrs cliff in horror  i mean join with the people who are in favor of it said miss inchman i havent time to explainshes coming to now if youll all let her alone all ive time to say is that those who had husbands in the old graveyard and might perhaps be inclined to move them and put up monuments had the right to be first spoken to although of course its a subject which everybody doesnt care to speak about and as for mrs ferguson its no wonder knowing her as we do that she went off in this way when she knew what i was going to say although in fact i wasnt in the least thinking of mr ferguson  the speaker had barely time to finish before the unfortunate lady who had fainted opened her eyes looked about her and asked where she was and now that she had revived no further reference could be made to the unfortunate subject which had caused her to swoon  i dont see said mrs cliff as she stood outside with miss inchman a few minutes later why mr fergusons removalim sure it isnt necessary to make it if she doesnt want toshould trouble mrs ferguson any more than the thought of mr cliffs removal troubles me im perfectly willing to do what i can for the new cemetery and nobody need think im such a nervous hysterical person that im in danger of popping over if the subject is mentioned to me so when you all are ready to have another meeting i hope you will let me know  when mrs ferguson felt herself well enough to sit up and take a glass of water with something stimulating in it she was informed of the nature of the statements which had been finally made to mrs cliff  you know of course added miss cushing still pale from unappeased rage that that susan inchman began as she did just to spite us  its just like her said mrs archibald but i never could have believed that such a dried codfish of a woman could have so much intellect     chapter xi  the arrival of the new diningroom   the little meeting at the house of miss cushing resulted in something very different from the anticipations of those ladies who had consulted together for the purpose of constituting themselves the heirs of mrs cliff  that good lady being then very much in want of something to do was so pleased with the idea of a new cemetery that she entered into the scheme with great earnestness she was particularly pleased with this opportunity of making good use of her money because having been asked by others to join them in this work she was not obliged to pose as a selfappointed public benefactor  mrs cliff worked so well in behalf of the new cemetery and subscribed so much money towards it through mr perley that it was not many months before it became the successor to the little crowded graveyard near the centre of the town and the remains of mr cliff were removed to a handsome lot and overshadowed by a suitable monument  mrs ferguson however in speaking with mrs cliff upon the subject was happy to have an opportunity of assuring her that she thought it much better to devote her slender means to the education of her daughters than to the removal of her late husband to a more eligible restingplace  im sure hes done very well as he is for all these years she said and if he could have a voice in the matter im quite sure that he would prefer his daughters education to his own removal  mrs cliff did not wish to make any offer which might hurt mrs fergusons very sensitive feelings but she said that she had no doubt that arrangements could be made by which mr fergusons transfer could be effected without interfering with any plans which might have been made for the benefit of his daughters but although this remark did not satisfy mrs ferguson she was glad of even this slight opportunity of bringing the subject of her daughters education before the consideration of her friend  as to the other wouldbe heirs they did not immediately turn upon miss inchman and rend her in revenge for the way in which she had tricked and frightened them for there was no knowing what such a woman would do if she were exasperated and not for the world would they have mrs cliff find out the real subject of their discussion on that unlucky morning when she made herself decidedly one too many in miss cushings parlor  consequently all attempts at concerted action were dropped and each for herself determined that mrs cliff should know that she was a true friend and to trust to the good ladys wellknown gratitude and friendly feeling when the time should come for her to apportion her worldly goods among the dear ones she would leave behind her  there were certain articles in mrs cliffs house for which each of her friends had a decided admiration and remarks were often made which it was believed would render it impossible for mrs cliff to make a mistake when she should be planning her will and asking herself to whom she should give this and to whom that  it was about a week after the events in miss cushings parlor that something occurred which sent a thrill through the souls of a good many people in plainton affecting them more or less according to their degree of sensibility  willy croup who had been driven about the town attending to various matters of business and pleasure was informed by andrew marks as she alighted about four oclock in the afternoon at the house of an acquaintance that he hoped she would not stop very long because he had some business of his own to attend to that afternoon and he wanted to get the horse cared for and the cow milked as early as possible so that he might lock up the barn and go away to this willy answered that he need not wait for her for she could easily walk home when she had finished her visit  but when she left the house after a protracted call she did not walk very far for it so happened that mr burke who had found leisure that afternoon to take a drive in his barouche came up behind her and very naturally stopped and offered to take her home willy quite as naturally accepted the polite proposition and seated herself in the barouche by the side of the furtrimmed overcoat and the high silk hat  thus it was that the people of the town who were in the main street that afternoon or who happened to be at doors or windows that the very birds of the air hopping about on trees or housetops that the horses dogs and cats that even the insects whose constitutions were strong enough to enable them to buzz about in the autumn sunlight beheld the startling sight of willy croup and the fine gentleman at the hotel riding together side by side in broad daylight through the most public street of the town  once before these two had been seen together out of doors but then they had been walking and almost any two people who knew each other and who might be walking in the same direction could without impropriety walk side by side and converse as they went but now the incident was very different  it created a great impression not all to the advantage of mr burke for after the matter had been very thoroughly discussed it was generally conceded that he must be no better than a fortunehunter otherwise why should he be paying attention to willy croup who as everybody knew was not a day under fortyfive years old and therefore at least ten years older than the gentleman at the hotel  in regard to the fortune which he was hunting there was no difference of opinion whatever mrs cliffs fortune might be this mr burke wanted it of course he would not endeavor to gain his object by marrying the widow for she was entirely too old for him but if he married willy her only relative that would not be quite so bad as to age and there could be no doubt that these two would ultimately come into mrs cliffs fortune which was probably more than had been generally supposed she had always been very closemouthed about her affairs and there were some who said that even in her early days of widowhood she might have been more stingy than she was poor she must have considerable property or mr burke would not be so anxious to get it  thus it happened that the eventful drive in the barouche had a very different effect upon the reputations of the three persons concerned mr burke was lowered from his position as a man of means enjoying his fortune for even his building operations were probably undertaken for the purpose of settling himself in mrs cliffs neighborhood and so being able to marry willy as soon as possible  willy croup although everybody spoke of her conduct as absolutely ridiculous and even shameful rose in public estimation simply from the belief that she was about to marry a man who whatever else he might be was of imposing appearance and was likely to be rich  as to mrs cliff there could be no doubt that the general respect for her was on the increase if she were rich enough to attract mr burke to the town she was probably rich enough to do a good many other things and after all it might be that that new house at the corner was being built with her money  miss shott was very industrious and energetic in expressing her opinion of mr burke theres a chambermaid at the hotel she said whos told me a lot of things about him and its very plain to my mind that he isnt the gentleman that he makes himself out to be his handkerchiefs and his hairbrush arent the kind that go with fur overcoats and high hats and she has often seen him stop in the hall downstairs and black his own boots everybody knows he was a sailor but as to his ever having commanded a vessel i dont believe a word of it but willy croup and that man neednt count on their schemes coming out all right for sarah cliff isnt any older than i am and shes just as likely to outlive them as she is to die before them  the fact that nobody had ever said that burke had commanded a vessel and that miss shott had started the belief that mrs cliff was in a rapid decline entirely escaped the attention of her hearers so interested were they in the subject of the unworthiness of the fine gentleman at the hotel  winter had not yet really set in when george burke who had perceived no reason to imagine that he had made a drop in public estimation felt himself stirred by emotions of triumphant joy the new building on the corner lot was on the point of completion  workmen and masterworkmen mechanics and laborers had swarmed in over and about the new edifice in such numbers that sometimes they impeded each other close upon the heels of the masons came the carpenters and following them the plumbers and the plasterers while the painters impatiently restrained themselves in order to give their predecessors time to get out of their way  the walls and ceilings were covered with the plaster which would dry the quickest and the paperhangers entered the rooms almost before the plasterers could take away their trowels and their limebegrimed hats and coats cleaners with their brooms and pails jostled the mechanics as the latter left the various rooms and everywhere strode mr burke he had made up his mind that the building must be ready to move into the instant it arrived at its final destination  it was a very different building from what mrs cliff had proposed to herself when she decided to add a diningroom to her old house it was so different indeed that after having gone two or three times to look upon the piles of lumber and stone and the crowds of men digging and hammering and sawing on the corner lot she had decided to leave the whole matter in the hands of mr burke the architect and the contractor and when willy croup endeavored to explain to her what was going on she always stopped her saying that she would wait until it was done and then she would understand it  mr burke too had urged her especially as the building drew near to completion not to bother herself in the least about it but to give him the pleasure of presenting it to her entirely finished and ready for occupancy so even the painting and paperhanging had been left to a professional decorator and mrs cliff assured burke that she was perfectly willing to wait for the new diningroom until it was ready for her  this diningroom large and architecturally handsome was planned as has been said so that one of its doors should fit exactly against the side hall door of the little house but the other door of the diningroom opened into a wide and elegant hall at one end of which was a portico and spacious front steps on the other side of this hall was a handsome drawingroom and behind the drawingroom and opening into it an alcove library with a broad piazza at one side of it back of the diningroom was a spacious kitchen with pantries closets scullery and all necessary adjuncts  in the second and third stories of the edifice were large and beautiful bedrooms small and neat bedrooms bathrooms servants rooms trunkrooms and every kind of room that modern civilization demands  now that the building was finished mr burke almost regretted that he had not constructed it upon the top of a hill in order that he might have laid his smooth and slippery timbers from the eminence to the side of mrs cliffs house so that when all should be ready he could have knocked away the blocks which held the building so that he could have launched it as if it had been a ship and could have beheld it sliding gracefully and rapidly from its stocks into its appointed position but as this would probably have resulted in razing mrs cliffs old house to the level of the ground he did not long regret that he had not been able to afford himself the pleasure of this grand spectacle  the night before the day on which the new building was to be moved the lot next to mrs cliffs house was covered by masons laborers and wagons hauling stones and by breakfasttime the next morning the new cellar was completed  almost immediately the great timbers which polished and greased had been waiting for several days were put in their places and the great steam engines and windlasses which had been ready as long a time were set in motion and as the house began to move upon its course it almost missed a parting dab from the brush of a painter who was at work upon some final trimming  that afternoon as mrs cliff happened to be in her diningroom she remarked to willy that it was getting dark very early but she would not pull up the blind of the side window because she would then look out on the new cellar and she had promised mr burke not to look at anything until he had told her to do so willy who had looked out of the side door at least fifty times that day knew that the early darkness was caused by the shadows thrown by a large building slowly approaching from the west  when mrs cliff came downstairs the next morning she was met by willy very much excited who told her that mr burke wished to see her  where is he said she at the diningroom door answered willy and as mrs cliff turned towards the little room in which she had been accustomed to take her meals willy seized her hand and led her into the side hall there in the open doorway stood mr burke his high silk hat in one hand and the other outstretched towards her  welcome to your new diningroom madam said he as he took her hand and led her into the great room which seemed to her as she gazed in amazement about her like a beautiful public hall  we will not follow mrs cliff willy and the whole body of domestic servants as they passed through the halls and rooms of that grand addition to mrs cliffs little house  carpets and furniture is all that you want madam said burke and then youre at home  when mrs cliff had been upstairs and downstairs and into every chamber and when she had looked out of the window and had beheld hundreds of men at work upon the grounds and putting up fences and when mr burke had explained to her that the people at the back of the lot were beginning to erect a stable and carriage housefor no diningroom such as she had was complete he assured her without handsome quarters for horses and carriagesshe left him and went downstairs by herself  as she stood by the great front door and looked up at the wide staircase and into the lofty rooms upon each side there came to her rising above all sentiments of amazement delight and pride in her new possessions a feeling of animated and inspiring encouragement the mists of doubt and uncertainty which had hung over her began to clear away this noble edifice must have cost grandly and for the first time she began to feel that she might yet be equal to her fortune     chapter xii  the thorpedyke sisters   the new and grand addition to mrs cliffs house which had been so planned that the little house to which it had been joined appeared to be an architecturally harmonious adjunct to it caused a far greater sensation in plainton than the erection of any of the public buildings therein  its journey from the corner lot was watched by hundreds of spectators and now mrs cliff willy and mr burke spent day and evening in exhibiting and explaining this remarkable piece of building enterprise  mr burke was very jolly he took no credit to himself for the planning of the house which as he truthfully said had been the work of an architect who had suggested what was proper and had been allowed to do it but he did feel himself privileged to declare that if every crew building a house were commanded by a person of marine experience things would move along a good deal more briskly than they generally did and to this assertion he found no one to object  mrs cliff was very happy in wandering over her new rooms and in assuring herself that no matter how grand they might be when they were all furnished and fitted up nothing had been done which would interfere with the dear old home which she had loved so long it is true that one of the windows of the little diningroom was blocked up but that window was not needed  mr burke was not willing to give mrs cliff more than a day or two for the contemplation of her new possessions and urged upon her that while the chimneys were being erected and the heating apparatus was being put into the house she ought to attend to the selection and purchase of the carpets furniture pictures and everything which was needed in the new establishment  mrs cliff thought this good advice and proposed a trip to boston but burke did not think that would do at all and declared that new york was the only place where she could get everything she needed willy who was to accompany mrs cliff had been to boston but had never visited new york and she strongly urged the claims of the latter city and an immediate journey to the metropolis was agreed upon  but when mrs cliff considered the magnitude and difficulties of the work she was about to undertake she wished for the counsel and advice of some one besides willy this good little woman was energetic and enthusiastic but she had had no experience in regard to the furnishing of a really good house  when in her mind she was running over the names of those who might be able and willing to go with her and assist her mrs cliff suddenly thought of the thorpedyke ladies and there her mental category stopped as she announced to willy that she was going to ask these ladies to go with them to new york  willy thought well of this plan but she had her doubts about miss barbara who was so quiet domestic and unused to travel that she might be unwilling to cast herself into the din and whirl of the metropolis but when she and mrs cliff went to make a call upon the thorpedykes and put the question before them she was very much surprised to find that although the elder sister after carefully considering the subject announced her willingness to oblige mrs cliff miss barbara agreed to the plan with an alacrity which her visitors had never known her to exhibit before  as soon as the necessary preparations could be made a party of five left plainton for new york and a very wellassorted party it was mr burke who guided and commanded the expedition supplied the impelling energy mrs cliff had her check book with her willy was ready with any amount of enthusiasm and the past life of miss eleanor thorpedyke and her sister barbara had made them most excellent judges of what was appropriate for the worthy furnishing of a stately mansion  their youth and middle life had been spent near boston in a fine old house which had been the home of their ancestors and where they had been familiar with wealth distinguished society and noble hospitality but when they had been left the sole representatives of their family and when misfortune after misfortune had come down upon them and swept away their estates and nearly all of their income they had retired to the little town of plainton where they happened to own a house  there with nothing saved from the wreck of their prosperity but their family traditions and some of the old furniture and pictures they had settled down to spend in quiet the rest of their lives  for two weeks our party remained in new york living at one of the best hotels but spending nearly all their time in shops and streets  mrs cliff was rapidly becoming a different woman from the old mrs cliff of plainton at the time she stepped inside of the addition to her house the change had begun and now it showed itself more and more each day she had seen more beautiful things in paris but there she looked upon them with but little thought of purchasing in new york whatever she saw and desired she made her own  the difference between a mere possessor of wealth and one who uses it became very apparent to her not until now had she really known what it was to be a rich woman not only did this consciousness of power swell her veins with a proud delight but it warmed and invigorated all her better impulses she had always been of a generous disposition but now she felt an intense goodwill toward her fellowbeings and wished that other people could be as happy as she was  she thought of mrs ferguson and remembered what she had said about her daughters to be sure mrs ferguson was always trying to get people to do things for her and mrs cliff did not fancy that class of women but now her wealthwarmed soul inclined her to overlook this prejudice and she said to herself that when she got home she would make arrangements for those two girls to go to a good school and more than that she would see to it that mr ferguson was moved it seemed to her just then that it would be a very cheerful thing to make other people happy  the taste and artistic judgment of the elder miss thorpedyke which had been dormant for years simply because there was nothing upon which they could exercise themselves now awoke in their old vigor and with mrs cliffs good sense reinforced by her experience gained in wandering among the treasures of paris the results of the shopping expedition were eminently satisfactory and with the plan of the new building which mr burke carried always with him everything which was likely to be needed in each room hall or stairway was selected and purchased and as fast as this was done the things were shipped to plainton where people were ready to put them where they belonged  willy croup was not always of service in the purchasing expeditions for she liked everything that she saw and no sooner was an article produced than she went into ecstasies over it but as she had an intense desire to see everything which new york contained she did not at all confine herself to the shops and bazaars she went wherever she could and saw all that it was possible for her to see but in the midst of the sights and attractions of the metropolis she was still willy croup  one afternoon as she and miss barbara were passing along one of the side streets on their return from an attempt to see how the poorer people lived willy stopped in front of a blacksmiths shop where a man was shoeing a horse  there she exclaimed her eyes sparkling with delight thats the first thing ive seen that reminds me of home  it is nice isnt it said gentle miss barbara     chapter xiii  money hunger   during the latter part of their sojourn in the city willy went about a good deal with miss barbara because she thought this quiet softspoken lady was not happy and did not take the interest in handsome and costly articles which was shown by her sister she had been afraid that this noisy bustling place would be too much for miss barbara and now she was sure she had been right  the younger miss thorpedyke was unhappy and with reason for some months a little house in boston which had been their principal source of income had not been rented it needed repairs and there was no money with which to repair it the agent had written that some one might appear who would be willing to take it as it stood but that this was doubtful and the heart of miss barbara sank very low she was the business woman of the family she it was who had always balanced the income and the expenditures this adjustment had now become very difficult indeed and was only accomplished by adding a little debt to the weight on the income scale  she had said nothing to her sister about this sad change in their affairs because she hoped against hope that soon they might have a tenant and she knew that her sister eleanor was a woman of such strict and punctilious honor that she would insist upon living upon plain bread if their supply of ready money was insufficient to buy anything else to see this sister insufficiently nourished was something which miss barbara could not endure and so sorely against her disposition and her conscience she made some little debts and these grew and grew until at last they weighed her down until she felt as if she must always look upon the earth and could never raise her head to the sky and she was so plump and so white and gentle and quiet and peaceful looking that no one thought she had a care in the world until willy croup began to suspect in new york that something was the matter with her but did not in the least attribute her friends low spirits to the proper cause  when miss barbara had favored so willingly and promptly the invitation of mrs cliff she had done so because she saw in the new york visit a temporary abolition of expense and a consequent opportunity to lay up a little money by which she might be able to satisfy for a time one of her creditors who was beginning to suspect that she was not able to pay his bill and was therefore pressing her very hard even while she had been in new york this manytimes rendered bill had been forwarded to her with an urgent request that it be settled  it was not strange therefore that a tear should sometimes come to the eye of miss barbara when she stood by the side of her sister and mrs cliff and listened to them discussing the merits of some rich rugs or pieces of furniture and when she reflected that the difference in price between two articles one apparently as desirable as the other which was discussed so lightly by mrs cliff and eleanor would pay that bill which was eating into her soul and settle moreover every other claim against herself and her sister but the tears were always wiped away very quickly and neither mrs cliff nor the elder miss thorpedyke ever noticed them  but although willy croup was not at all a woman of acute perceptions she began to think that perhaps it was something more than the bustle and noise of new york which was troubling miss barbara and once when she saw her gazing with an earnest eager glareand whoever would have thought of any sort of a glare in miss barbaras eyesupon some banknotes which mrs cliff was paying out for a carved cabinet for which it was a little doubtful if a suitable place could be found but which was bought because miss eleanor thought it would give an air of distinction in whatever room it might be placed willy began to suspect the meaning of that unusual exhibition of emotion  shes money hungry she said to herself thats whats the matter with her willy had seen the signs of such hunger before and she understood what they meant  that night willy lay in her bed having the very unusual experience of thinking so much that she could not sleep her room adjoined miss barbaras and the door between them was partly open for the latter lady was timid perhaps it was because this door was not closed that willy was so wakeful and thoughtful for there was a bright light in the other room and she could not imagine why miss barbara should be sitting up so late it was a proceeding entirely at variance with her usual habits she was in some sort of trouble it was easy to see that but it would be a great deal better to go to sleep and try to forget it  so after a time willy rose and softly stepping over the thick carpet looked into the other room there was miss barbara in her day dress sitting at a table her arms upon the table her head upon her arms fast asleep upon her pale face there were a great many tear marks and willy knew that she must have cried herself to sleep a paper was spread out near her  willy was sure that it would be a very mean and contemptible thing for her to go and look at that paper and so perhaps find out what was troubling miss barbara but without the slightest hesitation she did it her bare feet made no sound upon the carpet and as she had very good eyes it was not necessary for her to approach close to the sleeper  it was a bill from william bullock a grocer and provision dealer of plainton it contained but one itemto bill rendered and at the bottom was a statement in mr bullocks own handwriting to the effect that if the bill was not immediately paid he would be obliged to put it into the hands of a collector  willy turned and slipped back into her room then after sitting down upon her bed and getting up again she stepped boldly to the door and knocked upon it instantly she heard miss barbara start and push back her chair  what are you doing up so late cried willy cheerfully dont you feel well  oh yes replied the other i accidentally fell asleep while reading but i will go to bed instantly  the mind of willy croup was a very small one and had room in it for but one idea at a time for a good while she lay putting ideas into this mind and then taking them out again having given place to the conviction that the thorpedykes were in a very bad way indeedfor if that bill should be collected they would not have much left but themselves and mr bullock was a man who did collect when he said he wouldshe was obliged to remove this conviction which made her cry in order to consider plans of relief and while she was considering these plans one at a time she dropped asleep  the first thing she thought of when she opened her eyes in the morning was poor miss barbara in the next room and that dreadful bill and then like a flash of lightning she thought of a good thing to do for the thorpedykes the project which now laid itself out detail after detail before her seemed so simple so sensible so absolutely wise and desirable in every way that she got up dressed herself with great rapidity and went in to see mrs cliff  that lady was still asleep but willy awakened her and sat on the side of the bed do you know what i think said willy  how in the world should i said mrs cliff is it after breakfasttime  no said willy but its this what are you going to do in that big house with all the bedrooms parlor library and so forth you say that you are going to have one room and that im to have another and that well go into the old house to feel at home whenever we want to but i believe well be like a couple of flies in a barrel youre going to furnish your new house with everything but people you ought to have more people you ought to have a family that house will look funny without people you cant ask mr burke because it would be too queer to have him come and live with us and besides hell want a house of his own why dont you ask the thorpedykes to come and live with us their roof is dreadfully out of repairs i know to my certain knowledge that they have to put tin washbasins on every bed in the second story when it rains on account of the holes in the shingles if they had money to mend those holes theyd mend them but as they dont mend them of course they havent the money and it strikes me that they arent as well off as they used to be and theyll have a hard time gettin through this winter now there isnt any piece of furniture that you can put in your house that will give it such an air of distinction as miss eleanor calls it as she herself will give it if you put her there if you could persuade miss eleanor to come and sit in your parlor when you are having company to see you it would set you up in plainton a good deal higher than any money can set you up  they would never agree to anything of the kind said mrs cliff and you know it willy  i dont believe it said willy i believe theyd come just see how willing they were to come here with you i tell you sarah that the older and older those thorpedyke ladies get the more timid they get and the more unwilling to live by themselves  if you make miss eleanor understand that it would be the greatest comfort and happiness to both of us if she would come and spend the winter with you and so help you to get used to your great big new house and more than that if theyd bring with them some of their candlesticks and pictures on ivory and that sort of thing which everybody knows cant be bought for money it would be the great accommodation to you and make your house look something like what you would like to have it i believe that oldfamily lady would come and stay with you this winter and think all the time that she was giving you something that you ought to have and which nobody in plainton could give you but herself and as to miss barbara shed come along as quick as lightning  willy said mrs cliff very earnestly have you any good reason to believe that the thorpedykes are in money trouble  yes i have said willy im positive of it and whats more its only miss barbara who knows it  mrs cliff sat for some minutes without answering and then she said willy you do sometimes get into your head an idea that absolutely sparkles     chapter xiv  willy croup as a philanthropic diplomatist   mrs cliff was late to breakfast that day and the reason was that thinking so much about what willy had said to her she had been very slow in dressing as soon as she had a chance mrs cliff took willy aside and told her that she had determined to adopt her advice about the thorpedykes  the more i think of the plan she said the better i like it but we must be very very careful about what we do if miss eleanor suspects that i invite them to come to my house because i think they are poor she will turn into solid stone and we will find we cannot move her an inchbut i think i can manage it when we go home i will tell them how pleasant we found it for us all to be together and speak of the loneliness of my new big house if i can get miss eleanor to believe that she is doing me a favor she may be willing to come but on no account willy do you say a word to either of them about this plan if you do you will spoil everything for thats your way willy and you know it  willy promised faithfully that she would not interfere in the least but although she was perfectly satisfied with this arrangement she was not happy how could she be happy knowing what she did about miss barbara that poor lady was looking sadder than ever and willy was very much afraid that she had had another letter from that horrid mr bullock with whom she was delighted to think mrs cliff had never dealt  it would be some days yet before they would go home and make the new arrangement and then there would be the bill and the collector and all that horrid business and if miss eleanor found out the condition of affairsand if the bill was not paid she must find outshe would never come to them she would probably stay at home and live on bread  now it so happened that willy had in her own possession more than enough money to pay that wretched bullock bill mrs cliff made her no regular allowance but she had given her all the money that she might reasonably expect to spend in new york and willy had spent but very little of it for she found it the most difficult thing in the world to select what it was she wanted out of all the desirable things she saw  it would rejoice her heart to transfer this money to miss barbara but how in the world could she do it she first thought that she might offer to buy something that was in the thorpedyke house but she knew this idea was absurd then she thought of mentioning in an offhand way that she would like to put some money out at interest and thus perhaps induce miss barbara to propose a business transaction but this would not do even miss barbara would suspect some concealed motive idea after idea came to her but she could think of no satisfactory plan of getting that money into miss barbaras possession  she did not go out with the party that morning but sat in her room trying in vain to solve this problem at last she gave it up and determined to do what she wanted to do without any plan whatever  she went into miss barbaras room and placed upon the table in the very spot where the bill had been lying some banknotes considerably more than sufficient to pay the amount of the bill which amount she well remembered it would not do to leave just money enough for that would excite suspicion and so placing miss barbaras hairbrush upon the banknotes so that she would be sure not to overlook them for she would not think of going down to luncheon without brushing her hair willy retired to her own room nearly closing the door leaving only a little crack through which she might see if any servant entered the room before miss barbara came back  then willy set herself industriously to work hemming a pocket handkerchief she could not do this very well because she was not at all proficient in fine sewing but she worked with great energy waiting and listening for miss barbaras entrance  at last after a long time willy heard the outer door of the other room open and glancing through the crack she saw miss barbara enter then she twisted herself around towards the window and began to sew savagely with a skill much better adapted to the binding of carpets than to any sort of work upon cambric handkerchiefs  in a few minutes she heard a little exclamation in the next room and then her door was opened suddenly without the customary knock and miss barbara marched in her face was flushed  willy croup said she what is the meaning of that money on my table  money said willy turning towards her with as innocent an expression as her burning cheeks and rapidly winking eyes would permit what do you mean bymoney  miss barbara stood silent for some moments while willy vainly endeavored to thread the point of her needle  willy said miss barbara did you come into my room last night and look at the bill which was on my table  now willy dropped her needle thread and handkerchief and stood up  yes i did said she miss barbara was now quite pale  and you read the note which mr bullock had put at the bottom of it  yes i read it said willy  and dont you know said the other that to do such a thing was most  yes i do interrupted willy i knew it then and i know it now but i dont care any more now than i did then i put it there because i wanted to and if youll take it miss barbara and pay it back to me any time when you feel like itand you can pay me interest at ten per cent if you want to and that will make it all right you know and oh miss barbara i know all about that sort of bill because they used to come when my father was alive and if youd only take it you dont know how happy i would be  at this she began to cry and then miss barbara burst into tears and the two sat down beside each other on a lounge and cried earnestly hand in hand for nearly ten minutes  im so glad youll take it said willy when miss barbara went into her room and you may be just as sure as youre sure of anything that nobody but our two selves will ever know anything about it  immediately after luncheon miss barbara went by herself to the postoffice and when she came back her sister said to her that new york must just be beginning to agree with her  it is astonishing said miss eleanor how long it takes some people to get used to a change but it often happens that if one stays long enough in the new place great benefit will be experienced whereas if the stay is short there may be no good result whatever  that afternoon mrs cliff actually laughed at miss barbaraa thing she had never done before they were in a large jewelry store where they were looking at clocks and miss barbara who had evinced a sudden interest in the beautiful things about her called mrs cliffs attention to a lovely necklace of pearls  if i were you said miss barbara i would buy something like that i should not want to wear it perhaps but it would be so delightful to sit and look at it  the idea of miss barbara thinking of buying necklaces of pearls no wonder mrs cliff laughed  when the party returned to plainton mrs cliff was amazed to find her new house almost completely furnished and no time was lost in proposing the thorpedyke project for mrs cliff felt that it would be wise to make the proposition while the sense of companionship was still fresh upon them all  miss thorpedyke was very much surprised when the plan was proposed to her but it produced a pleasant effect upon her she had much enjoyed the company she had been in she had always liked society and lately had had very little of it for no matter how good and lovable sisters may be they are sometimes a little tiresome when they are sole companions  as to barbara she trembled as she thought of mrs cliffs offer trembled with joy which she could not repress and trembled with fear that her sister might not accept it but it was of no use for her to say anythingand she said nothing eleanor always decided such questions as these  after a days consideration miss thorpedyke came to a conclusion and she sent miss barbara with a message to mrs cliff to the effect that as the winters were always lonely and as it would be very pleasant for them all to be together she would if mrs cliff thought it would be an advantage to her come with her sister and live in some portion of the new building which mrs cliff did not intend to be otherwise occupied and that they would pay whatever board mrs cliff thought reasonable and proper but in order to do this it would be necessary for them to rent their present home they would offer this house fully furnishedreserving the privilege of removing the most valuable heirlooms which it now contained and as soon as such an arrangement could be made they would be willing to come to mrs cliff and remain with her during the winter  when miss barbara had heard this decision her heart had fallen she knew that it would be almost impossible to find a tenant who would take that house especially for winter occupancy and that even if a tenant could be found the rent would be very little and she knew moreover that having come to a decision eleanor could not be moved from it  she found mr burke and willy with mrs cliff but as he knew all about the project and had taken great interest in it she did not hesitate to tell her message before him mrs cliff was very much disappointed  that ends the matter said she your house cannot be rented for the winter  i dont know about that exclaimed mr burke by george ill take the house myself i want a housei want just such a house i want it furnishedexcept i dont want to be responsible for old heirlooms and im willing to pay a fair and reasonable rent for it and im sure although i never had the pleasure of being in it it ought to bring rent enough to pay the board of any two ladies any winter wherever they might be  but mr burke miss barbara said her voice shaking as she spoke i must tell you that the roof is very much out of repair and  oh that doesnt matter at all said burke a tenant if hes the right sort of tenant is bound to put a house into repair to suit himself ill attend to the roof if it needs it you may be sure of that and if it doesnt need it ill leave it just as it is thatll be all right and you can tell your sister that youve found a tenant im getting dreadfully tired of living at that hotel and a house of my own is somethin that ive never had before but one thing i must ask of you miss thorpedyke dont say anything to your sister about tobacco smoke and perhaps she will never think of it     chapter xv  miss nancy makes a call   it was a day or two after the most satisfactory arrangement between the thorpedykes mrs cliff and mr burke had been concluded and before it had been made public that miss nancy shott came to call upon mrs cliff  as she walked stiff as a grenadier and almost as tall she passed by the new building without turning her head even to glance at it and going directly up to the front door of the old house she rang the bell  as mrs cliffs domestic household were all engaged in the new part of the building the bell was not heard and after waiting nearly a minute miss shott rang it again with such vigor that the door was soon opened by a maid who informed her that mrs cliff was not at home but that miss croup was in  very well said miss shott ill see her and passing the servant she entered the old parlor the maid followed her  theres no fire here she said wont you please walk into the other part of the house which is heated miss croup is over there  no said miss shott seating herself upon the sofa this suits me very well and willy croup can come to me here as well as anywhere else  presently willy arrived wishing very much that she also had been out  do come over to the other parlor miss shott said she theres no furnace heat here because mrs cliff didnt want the old house altered and we use this room so little that we havent made a fire  i thought you had the chimney put in order said miss shott without moving from her seat doesnt it work right  willy assured her visitor that the chimney was in good condition so far as she knew and repeated her invitation to come into a warmer room but to this miss shott paid no attention  its an old saying said she that a bad chimney saves fueli understand that youve all been to new york shopping  yes said willy laughing it was a kind of shopping but thats not exactly what id call it and perceiving that miss shott intended to remain where she was she took a seat  well of course said miss shott everybodys got to act according to their own judgments and consciences if i was going to buy winter things id do what i could to help the business of my own town and if i did happen to want anything i couldnt get here id surely go to harrington where the people might almost be called neighbors  willy laughed outright oh miss shott she said you couldnt buy the things we bought in harrington i dont believe they could be found in boston  i was speaking about myself said miss nancy i could find anything i wanted in harrington and if my wants went ahead of what they had there i should say that my wants were going too far and ought to be curbed and so you took those poor old thorpedyke women with you i expect they must be nearly fagged out i dont see how the oldest one ever stood being dragged from store to store all over new york as she must have been shes a pretty old woman and cant be expected to stand even what another woman younger than she is but old enough and excited by having money to spend can stand its a wonder to me that you brought her back alive  miss eleanor came back a great deal better than she was when she left exclaimed willy indignantly shell tell you if you ask her that that visit to new york did her a great deal of good  no she wont said miss shott for she dont speak to me its been two years since i had anything to do with her  willy knew all about the quarrel between the thorpedyke ladies and nancy and wished to change the subject  dont you want to go and look at the new part of the house she said perhaps youd like to see the things weve bought in new york and its cold here  to this invitation and the subsequent remark miss shott paid no attention she did not intend to give willy the pleasure of showing her over the house and it was not at all necessary for she had seen nearly everything in it  during the absence of mrs cliff she had made many visits to the house and as she was acquainted with the woman who had been left in charge she had examined every room from ground to roof and had scrutinized and criticised the carpets as they had been laid and the furniture as it had been put in place  she saw that willy was beginning to shiver a little and was well satisfied that she should feel cold it would help take the conceit out of her as for herself she wore a warm cloak and did not mind a cold room  im told she said that mrs cliffs putting up a new stable what was the matter with the old one  it wasnt big enough said willy  it holds two horses dont it and what could anybody want more than that id like to know  willy was now getting a little out of temper  thats not enough for mrs cliff she said shes going to have a nice carriage and a pair of horses and a regular coachman not andrew marks  well said miss shott and for a few moments she sat silent then she spoke i suppose mrs cliffs goin to take boarders  boarders cried willy what makes you say such a thing as that  if she isnt said miss shott i dont see what shell do with all the rooms in that new part of the house  shes goin to live in it said willy thats what shes goin to do with it  boarders are very uncertain remarked miss shott and just as likely to be a loss as a profit mr williams tried it at the hotel summer after summer and if he couldnt make anything i dont see how mrs cliff can expect to  she doesnt expect to take boarders and you know it said willy  miss shott folded her hands upon her lap  its goin to be a dreadful hard winter i never did see so many acorns and chestnuts and theres more cedar berries on the trees than ive ever known in all my life i expect therell be awful distress among the poor and when i say poor i dont mean people thats likely to suffer for food and a nights lodging but respectable people who have to work hard and calculate day and night how to make both ends meet thesere the folks thatre goin to suffer in body and mind this winter and if people thats got more money than they know what to do with and dont care to save up for old age and a rainy day would think sometimes of their deserving neighbors who have to pinch and suffer when theyre going round buyin rugs that must have cost at least as much as twenty dollars apiece and which they dont need at all there bein carpet already on the floor it would be more to their credit and benefit to their fellowbeings but of course one persons conscience isnt another persons and weve each got to judge for ourselves and be judged afterwards  now willy leaned forward in her chair and her eyes glistened as her body grew colder so did her temper grow warmer  if its mrs cliff youre thinkin about nancy shott said she ill just tell you that youre as wrong as you can be there isnt a more generous and a kinder person in this whole town than mrs cliff is and she isnt only that way today but shes always been so whether shes had little or whether shes had much  what did she ever do id like to know said miss nancy shes lined her own nest pretty well but whats she ever done for anybody else  now nancy shott said willy you know shes been doin for other people all her life whenever she could shes done for you more than once as i happen to knowand shes done for other neighbors and friends and more than that shes gone abroad to do good and thats more than anybody else in this towns done as i know of  she didnt go to south america to do good to anybody but herself coolly remarked the visitor  im not thinking of that said willy she went there on business as everybody knows but you remember well enough when she was in the city and i was with her when the dreadful cholera times came on everybody said that there wasnt a person who worked harder and did more for the poor people who were brought to the hospital than sarah did  she worked for them night and day before they were dead and after they were dead i did what i could but it wasnt nothin to what she did both of us had been buyin things and makin them up for ourselves for cotton and linen goods was so cheap then if it hadnt been for the troubles which came on wed had enough to last us for years but sarah cliff isnt the kind of woman to keep things for herself when theyre wanted by others and when she had given everything that she had to those poor creatures at the hospitals she took my things without as much as takin the trouble to ask me for in times like that she isnt the woman to hesitate when she thinks shes doin what ought to be done and at one time in that hospital there was eleven corpses in my nightgowns  horrible exclaimed miss shott rising to her feet it would have killed me to think of such a thing as that  well if it would have killed you said willy there was another nightgown left  if youre going to talk that way said miss shott i might as well go i supposed that when i came here i would at least have been treated civilly     chapter xvi  mr burke makes a call   mrs cliff now began her life as a rich woman the thorpedykes were established in the new building her carriage and horses with a coachman in plain livery were seen upon the streets of plainton she gave dinners and teas and subscribed in a modestly open way to appropriate charities she extended suitable aid to the members of mrs fergusons family both living and departed and the fact that she was willing to help in church work was made very plain by a remark of miss shott who upon a certain sunday morning at the conclusion of services happened to stop in front of mrs cliff who was going out of the church  oh said miss shott suddenly stepping very much to one side i wouldnt have got in your way if id remembered that it was you who pays the new choir  mr burke established himself in the thorpedyke house which he immediately repaired from top to bottom but although he frequently repeated to himself and to his acquaintances that he had now set up housekeeping in just the way that he had always wished for with plenty of servants to do everything just as he wanted it done he was not happy nevertheless he felt the loss of the stirring occupation which had so delighted him and his active mind continually looked right and left for something to do  he spoke with mrs cliff in regard to the propriety of proposing to the thorpedykes that he should build an addition to their house declaring that such an addition would make the old mansion ever so much more valuable and as to the cost he would arrange that so that they would never feel the payment of it but this suggestion met with no encouragement and poor burke was so hard put to it for something to occupy his mind that one day he asked mrs cliff if she had entirely given up her idea of employing some of her fortune for the benefit of the native peruvians stating that if she wanted an agent to go down there and to attend to that sort of thing he believed he would be glad to go himself  but mrs cliff did not intend to send anything to the native peruvians according to the arrangements that captain horn had made for their benefit they would have as large a share of the incas gold as they could possibly claim and therefore she did not feel herself called upon to do anything if we had kept it all she said that would have been a different thing  in fact mrs cliffs conscience was now in a very easy and satisfied condition she did not feel that she owed anything to her fellowbeings that she was not giving them or that she owed anything to herself that she was not giving to herself the expenses of building and of the improvements to her spacious grounds had been of so much assistance in removing the plethora of her income that she was greatly encouraged she felt that she now had her fortune under control and that she herself might be able to manage it for the future already she was making her plans for the next year  many schemes she had for the worthy disposition of her wealth and the more she thought of them and planned their details the less inclined she felt to leave for an hour or two her spacious and sumptuous apartments in the new building and go back to her little former home where she might think of old times and relieve her mind from the weight of the novelty and the richness of her new diningroom and its adjuncts  often as she sat in her stately drawingroom she longed for her old friend edna and wished that she and the captain might come and see how well she had used her share of the great fortune  but captain horn and his wife were far away mrs cliff had frequent letters from edna which described their leisurely and delightful travels in the south and west their minds and bodies had been so strained and tired by hard thinking and hard work that all they wanted now was an enjoyment of life and the world as restful and as tranquil as they could make it after a time they would choose some happy spot and make for themselves a home three of the negroes maka and cheditafa and mok were with them and the others had been left on a farm where they might study methods of american agriculture until the time should come when the captain should require their services on his estate  ralph was in boston where in spite of his independent ideas in regard to his education he was preparing himself to enter harvard  i know what the captain means when he speaks of settling down said burke when he heard of this hell buy a cañon and two or three counties and live out there like a lord and if he does that ill go out and see him i want to see this inca money sprouting and flourishing a good deal more than it has done yet  what do you mean asked mrs cliff dont you call this splendid house and everything in it a sign of sprouting and flourishing  oh my dear madam said burke rising from his seat and walking the floor if you could have looked through the hole in the top of the mound and have seen under you cartloads and cartloads of pure gold and had let your mind rest on what might have grown out of it a house like this would have seemed like an acorn on an oak tree  and you think the captain will have the oak tree she asked  yes said burke i think hes the sort of man to want it and if he wants it hell have it  there were days when the weather was very bad and time hung unusually heavy upon mr burkes hands when he thought it might be a good thing to get married he had a house and money enough to keep a wife as well as any woman who would have him had any reason to expect but there were two objections to this plan in the first place what would he do with his wife after he got tired of living in the thorpedyke house and secondly where could he find anybody he would like to marry  he had female acquaintances in plainton but not one of them seemed to have the qualifications he would desire in a wife willy croup was a goodnatured and pleasant woman and he always liked to talk to her but she was too old for him he might like to adopt her as a maiden aunt but then that would not be practicable for mrs cliff would not be willing to give her up  at this time burke would have gone to make a visit to his mother but there was also an objection to this he would not have dared to present himself before her in his furtrimmed overcoat and his high silk hat she was a true sailors mother and she would have laughed him to scorn and so habituated had he become to the dress of a fine gentleman that it would have seriously interfered with his personal satisfaction to put on the rough winter clothes in which his mother would expect to see him  the same reason prevented him from going to his old friend shirley he knew very well that shirley did not wear a high silk hat and carry a cane and he had a sufficient knowledge of human nature and of himself to know that if his present personal appearance were made the subject of ridicule or even inordinate surprise it would not afford him the same stimulating gratification which he now derived from it  fortunately the weather grew colder and there was snow and excellent sleighing and now burke sent for a fine double sleigh and with a fur cap a great fur collar over his overcoat fur gloves and an enormous laprobe of fur he jingled and glided over the country in great delight enjoying the sight of the furgarbed coachman in front of him almost as much as the glittering snow and the crisp fresh air  he invited the ladies of the cliff mansion to accompany him in these sleighrides but although the misses thorpedyke did not fancy such cold amusement mrs cliff and willy went with him a few times and once willy accompanied him alone  this positively decided the opinion of plainton in regard to his reason for living in that town but there were those who said that he might yet discover that his plans would not succeed mrs cliff now seemed to be in remarkably good health and as it was not likely that mr burke would actually propose marriage to willy until he saw some signs of failing in mrs cliff he might have to wait a long long time during which his intended victim would probably grow so wrinkled and old that even the most debased of fortunehunters would refuse to have her then of course the fine gentleman would find out that he had lost all the time he had spent scheming here in plainton  the buskirks were spending this winter in their country home and one afternoon mr burke thought he would drive up in his sleigh and make a call upon them he had been there before but had seen no one and some weeks afterward mr buskirk had dropped in at the hotel but had not found him this sort of visiting did not suit our friend burke and he determined to go and see what a buskirk was really like  having jingled and pranced up to the front of the handsome mansion on the hill and having been informed that the gentleman of the house was not at home he asked for his lady and as she was in he was ushered into a parlor here having thrown aside some of his superincumbent furs george burke sat and looked about him he had plenty of time for observation for it was long before mrs buskirk made her appearance  with the exception of mrs cliffs house with which he had had so much to do burke had never before been inside a dwelling belonging to a very rich person and the buskirk mansion interested him very much although he was so little familiar with fine furniture pictures and bricabrac he was a man of quick perceptions and good judgment and it did not take him long to discover that the internal furnishings of the buskirk house were far inferior to those of the addition to mrs cliffs old home  the room in which he sat was large and pretentious but when it had been furnished there had been no lady of good family accustomed to the furnishings of wealth and culture and with an artistic taste gained in travel at home and abroad to superintend the selection of these pictures this carpet and the coverings of this furniture  he laughed within himself as he sat his fur cape on his knees and his silk hat in his hand and he was so elated and pleased with the knowledge of the superiority of mrs cliffs home over this house of the proud city people who had so long looked down upon plainton that he entirely forgot his intention of recalling as he sat in the fine parlor of the buskirks the olden times when he used to get up early in the morning and swab the deck  these people ought to come down and see mrs cliffs house thought burke and ill make them do it if i can  when mrs buskirk a lady who had always found it necessary to place strong guards around her social position made her appearance she received her visitor with an attentive civility she had been impressed by his appearance when she had seen him grandly careering in his barouche or his sleigh and she was still more impressed as she saw him in her parlor with additional furs she had heard he had been a sailor but now as she talked to him the belief grew upon her that he might yet make a very good sailor he was courteous entirely at his ease and perhaps a little too bland and mrs buskirk thought that although her husband might like to sit and smoke with this welldressed sunburned man he was not a person very desirable for the society of herself and daughters  but she was willing to sit and talk to mr burke for she wanted to ask him some questions about mrs cliff she had heard about that ladys new house or rather the improvement to her old one and she had driven past it and she did not altogether understand the state of affairs  she had known that mrs cliff was a widow of a storekeeper of the town and that she had come into possession of a portion of a treasure which had been discovered somewhere in the west indies or south america but those portions of treasures which might be allotted to the widow of a storekeeper in a little country town were not likely to be very much and mrs buskirk was anxious to know something definite about mrs cliffs present circumstances  burke felt a little embarrassed in regard to his answers he knew that mrs cliff was very anxious not to appear as a millionnaire in the midst of the friends and associations of her native townat least that she did not desire to do so until her real financial position had been gradually understood and accepted nothing she would dislike so much as to be regarded as the people in her social circle regarded the buskirks on the hill  so burke did not blaze out as he would have liked to do with a true and faithful statement of mrs cliffs great wealthfar in excess he was very sure of that of the fine lady with whom he was talkingbut he said everything he could in a modest way or what seemed so to him in regard to his friends house and belongings  but it seems to me said mrs buskirk that its a very strange thing for any one to build a house such as the one you describe in such a neighborhood when there are so many desirable locations on the outskirts of the town the houses on the opposite side of the street are very small some of them even mean if i am not mistaken there is a little shop somewhere along there i should consider that that sort of thing would spoil any house no matter how good it might be in itself  oh that makes no difference whatever said burke with a wave of his hand and delighted to remember a proposition he had made to mrs cliff and which she had viewed with favor mrs cliff will soon settle all that shes going to buy that whole block opposite to her and make a park of it shell clear away all the houses and everything belonging to them and shell plant trees and lay out lawns and driveways and have a regular landscape gardener wholl superintend everything and shes going to have the water brought in pipes which will end in some great rocks which well have hauled from the woods and from under these rocks a brook will flow and meander through the park and therell be flowers and reeds and rushes and very likely a fountain with the spare water  and thatll be a public park for the use of the whole town and you can see for yourself madam that itll be a grand thing to look out from mrs cliffs windows on such a beautiful place it will be fitted up and railed off very much after the style of her own grounds so that the whole thing will be like a great estate right in the middle of the town shes thinkin of callin the park the grove of the incas that sounds nice dont you think so madam  it sounds very well indeed said mrs buskirk she had heard before of plans made by people who had suddenly come into possession of money  burke saw that he had not yet made the impression that he desired he wanted without actually saying so to let this somewhat supercilious lady know that if the possession of money was a reason for social positionand he knew of no other reason for the buskirks positionmrs cliff would be aft talking to the captain while the buskirks would be walking about by themselves amidship  but he did not know how to do this he knew it would be no use to talk about horses and carriages and all that sort of thing for these the buskirks possessed and their coachman wore top bootsa thing mrs cliff would never submit to he was almost on the point of relinquishing his attempt to make mrs buskirk call upon the widow of the storekeeper when the lady helped him by asking in a casual way if mrs cliff proposed living winter and summer in her new house  no said burke not in the summer i hear plainton is pretty hot in the summer and shell go oh a radiant thought came to him i expect shell cruise about in her yacht during the warm weather  her yacht exclaimed mrs buskirk for the first time exhibiting marks of actual interest has mrs cliff a yacht  shes going to have one said burke to himself and ill put her up to it before i go home this day  yes he said aloud that is she hasnt got it yet but shes going to have it as soon as the season opens i shall select it for her i know all about yachts and every other kind of craft and shell have one of the very finest on this coast shes a good sailor mrs cliff is for ive cruised with her and nothing will she enjoy better in hot weather than her noble yacht and the open sea  now this did make an impression upon mrs buskirk a citizen of plainton who possessed a yacht was not to be disregarded after this she was rather abstracted and the conversation fell off burke saw that it was time for him to go and as he had now said all he cared to say he was willing to do so  in parting with him mrs buskirk was rather more gracious than when she received him i hope when you call again she said that you may find my husband at home i know he will be glad to see you  as burke jingled and pranced away he grinned behind his great fur collar shell call said he to himself shell call on the yacht if she doesnt call on anything else     chapter xvii  mrs cliffs yacht   when the interview with mrs buskirk was reported that afternoon to mrs cliff the good lady sat aghast ive decided about the park she said and that is all very well but what do you mean by a yacht what could be more ridiculous than to talk about me and a yacht  ridiculous exclaimed burke its nothing of the kind the more i think of the idea the better i like it and if youll think of it soberly i believe youll like it just as much as i do in the first place youve got to do something to keep your money from being dammed up and running all over everything this house and furniture cleared away things for a time but the whole business will be just as much clogged up as it was before if you dont look out i dont want to give advice but it does strike me that anybody as rich as you are oughtnt to feel that they could afford to sit still here in plainton year in and year out no matter how fine a house they might have they ought to think of that great heap of gold in the mound and feel that it was their duty to get all the grand and glorious good out of it that they knew how  but it does seem to me said mrs cliff that a yacht would be an absolute extravagance and waste of money and you know i have firmly determined i will not waste my money  to call sittin in a beautiful craft on a rollin sea with a spankin breeze a waste of money is something i cant get into my brain said mr burke but you could do good with a yacht you could take people out on cruises who would never get out if you didnt take them and now ive an idea its just come to me you might get a really big yacht if i was you id have a steam yacht because youd have more control over that than youd have over a sailinvessel and besides a person can get tired of sailinvessels as ive found out myself and then you might start a sort of summer shelter for poor people not only very poor people but respectable people who never get a chance to sniff salt air and you might spend part of the summer in giving such people what would be the same as country weeks only youd take them out to sea instead of shipping them inland to dawdle around farms i tell you thats a splendid idea and nobodys done it  day after day the project of the yacht was discussed by mrs cliff and burke and she was beginning to view its benevolent features with a degree of favor when mrs buskirk called that ladys visit was prompted partly by a curiosity to see what sort of a woman was the widow of the plainton storekeeper who would cruise the next summer in her yacht and partly by a feeling that to such a person a certain amount of respect was due even from a buskirk  but when she entered the house passed through the great hall and seated herself in the drawingroom she saw more than she had expected to see she saw a house immeasurably better fitted out and furnished than her own she knew the value of the rugs which miss shott had declared must have cost at least twenty dollars each and she felt although she did not thoroughly appreciate the difference in artistic merit between the pictures upon her walls and the masterly paintings which had been selected by the ladies thorpedyke for the drawingroom of mrs cliff  the discovery startled her she must talk to her husband about it as soon as he reached home it was not only money but a vast deal of money and something more which had done all this  she had asked for the ladies knowing that mrs cliff did not live alone and all the ladies were at home amid those surroundings the elder miss thorpedyke most carefully arrayed made an impression upon mrs buskirk very different from that she had produced on the occasion of their single former interview in the darkened little parlor of the thorpedyke house  mrs cliff in a costume quite simple but as rich as her conscience would allow felt within herself all the uplifting influence of her wealth as she stepped forward to salute this lady who had always been so uplifted by her wealth  in the course of the conversation the yacht was mentioned the visitor would not go away without being authoritatively informed upon this subject  oh yes said mrs cliff promptly i shall have a yacht next summer mr burke will select one for me and i know it will be a good one for he thoroughly understands such matters  before she left mrs buskirk invited mrs cliff the misses thorpedyke and miss croup to take luncheon with her quite informally on the following tuesday she would have made it a dinner but in that case her husband would have been at home and it would have been necessary to invite mr burke and she was not yet quite sure about mr burke  this invitation which soon became known throughout the town decided the position of mrs cliff at plainton when that lady and her family had gone with her carriage and pair to the mansion of the buskirks on the hill and had there partaken of luncheon very informally in company with three of the most distinguished ladies of harrington who had also been invited very informally and when the news of the magnificent repast which had been served on the occasion with flowers from the greenhouse nearly covering the table with everything tied up with ribbons which could possibly be so decorated and with a present for each guest ingeniously concealed under her napkin floated down into the town there was no woman in that place who could put her hand upon her heart and honestly declare that hereafter mrs cliff could look up to anybody in plainton  this recognition which soon became obvious to mrs cliff was a source of genuine gratification to that good lady she had never been inclined to put herself above her neighbors on account of her fortune and would have been extremely grieved if she had been convinced that her wealth would oblige her to assume a superior position but when that wealth gradually and easily without creating any disturbance or commotion in her circle raised her of itself without any action on her part to the peak of social eminence in her native place her genuine satisfaction was not interfered with in the least degree by her conscience her position had come to her and she had assumed it as if she had been born to it  but whenever she thought of her preëminenceand she did not think of it nearly so often as other people thought of itshe determined that it should make no difference to her and when next she gave a high teanot the grand repast to which she intended to invite the buskirks on the hillshe invited miss cushing now there were people in plainton who did not invite the dressmaker to their table but mrs cliff had asked her when they were all poor together and she would have her now again when they were not all poor together  as the winter went on burke became more and more interested in mrs cliffs yacht and if he had not had this subject to talk about and plan about and to go at all hours to see mrs cliff about it is likely that he would have been absolutely obliged to leave plainton for want of occupation but the idea of commanding a steam yacht was attraction enough to keep him where he could continually consider it  he assured mrs cliff that it was not at all necessary to wait until pleasant weather before undertaking this great enterprise as soon as the harbors were reasonably free of ice it would be well for him to go and look at yachts and then when he found one which suited him mrs cliff could go and look at it and if it suited her it could be immediately put into commission they could steam down into southern waters and cruise about there the spring up here in the north was more disagreeable than any other season of the year and why should they not go and spend that season in the tranquil and beautiful waters of florida or the west indies  mrs cliff had now fully determined to become the owner of a yacht but she would not do so unless she saw her way clear to carry out the benevolent features of the plan which mr burke had suggested  what i want said mrs cliff is to have the whole thing understood i am perfectly willing to spend some of the pleasant months sailing about the coast and feeling that im giving health and pleasure to poor and deserving people especially children but i am not willing to consider myself a rich woman who keeps an expensive yacht just for the pleasure of cruising around when she feels like it but i do like the plan of giving country weeks at sea  very good madam he said and we can fix that thing so that nobody can possibly make any mistake about it what do you say to calling your yacht the summer shelter well paint the name in white letters on the bows and stern and nobody can take us for idle sealoafers with more money than we know what to do with  i like that said mrs cliff her face brightening you may buy me a yacht as soon as you please and well call her the summer shelter  in consequence of this order mr burke departed from plainton the next day and began a series of expeditions to the seaport towns on the atlantic coast in search of a steam yacht for sale  the winter grew colder and the weather was very bad there were heavy snows and drifts and many hardships there were cases of privations and suffering and never did she hear of one of these cases that a thankful glow did not warm the heart of mrs cliff as she thought that she was able to relieve it  but mrs cliff knew and if she had not known she would have soon found out that it was often very difficult to relieve distress of body without causing distress of mind but she and willy and the misses thorpedyke had known all phases of the evil which has its root in the want of money and they always considered peoples sensibilities when they held charitable councils there was one case in which mrs cliff felt that she must be very careful indeed  old nancy shott was not standing the winter well she had a bad cold and was confined to her bed and one day miss inchman mentioned during a call on mrs cliff that she did not believe the poor old thing was able to keep herself warm she had been to see her and the coverings on her bed were very insufficient she thought  the shotts never did keep a warm house nor did they care to spend their money upon warm clothes but although that sort of thing might do very well while they were in health and were constantly on the move it did not do when they were sick in bed when miss inchman had gone mrs cliff called willy  where are we using those california blankets which i brought home with me she asked  using them exclaimed willy we arent using them anywhere im sure nobody would think of using such blankets as those except when some extra company might happen to come it ought to be a long time before those blankets would have to go into the wash and ive kept them covered up on the top shelf of the linen closet  well i wish you would go and get them said mrs cliff and then wrap them up and take them to miss shott as a present from me  take them to nancy shott cried willy i never heard of such a thing in my life shes able to buy blankets dozens of them if she wants them and to take to her such blankets as the ones you brought from californiawhy it takes my breath away to think of it  but you must take them to her said mrs cliff she may be stingy but she is suffering and i want her to have those blankets because they are the very best that i could possibly send her you can get andrew marks to drive you there but stop two or three doors from the house she will think you are putting on airs if you drive up to the door and i wish you would give her the blankets just as if it was a matter of course that anybody would send things to a sick person  oh yes said willy as if you hadnt a pot of jelly to spare and so sent her these blankets fit for an emperor on his throne  that very evening the reluctant willy took the blankets to miss shott for mrs cliff knew it was going to be a very cold night and she wanted her to have them as soon as possible  when nancy shott beheld the heavy and beautiful fabrics of fine wool which willy spread out upon her bed in order that she might better examine them the eyes of the poor old woman flashed with admiring delight  well said she sarah cliff has got a memory  what do you mean asked willy  why she remembers said miss shott that i once joined in to give her a pair of blankets  good gracious exclaimed willy and she was on the point of speaking her mind in regard to the salient points in the two transactions but she refrained the poor old thing was sick and she must not say anything to excite her  i suppose said miss shott after lifting a corner of a blanket and rubbing and pinching it that these are all wool  then willy thought herself privileged to speak and for some minutes she dilated on the merits of those superb blankets the like of which were not to be found in the whole state and perhaps not in any state east of the rocky mountains  well said miss shott you may tell her that i will not throw her present back at her as she once threw one back at me and now that youre here willy croup i may as well say to you what ive intended to say to you the next time i saw you and that is that when i was at your house you told me an out and out falsehoodi wont use any stronger word than thatand how you could sleep after having done it im sure i dont know  falsehood cried willy what do you mean  you told me said nancy that mrs cliff wasnt goin to take boardersand now look at those thorpedykes not two days after you tried to deceive me they went there to board and now what have you got to say to that  willy had not a word to say she sprang to her feet she glared at the triumphant woman in the bed and turning went downstairs     chapter xviii  the dawn of the grove of the incas   a man may have command of all the money necessary and he may have plenty of knowledge and experience in regard to the various qualities of seagoing vessels but even with these great advantages he may find it a very difficult thing to buy ready to his hand a suitable steam yacht the truth of this statement was acknowledged by mr burke after he had spent nearly a month in boston new york and various points between these cities and after advertising inquiring and investigating the subject in all possible ways found nothing which he could recommend mrs cliff to purchase  he wrote to her a great many letters during this period all of which were interesting although there were portions of many of them which she did not quite understand being expressed in a somewhat technical fashion burke liked to write letters it was a novel experience for him to have time to write and something to write about he had been better educated than the ordinary sailor and his intelligence and habits of observation enabled him to supplement to a considerable extent what he had learned at school his spelling and grammar were sometimes at fault but his handwriting was extremely plain and distinct and willy croup who always read his letters declared that it was much better to write plainly than to be always correct in other respects for what was the good of proper spelling and grammar if people could not make out what was written  mrs cliff was not at all disturbed by the delay in the purchase of a yacht for according to her idea it would be a long time yet before it was pleasant to sail upon the sea and if it was interesting to mr burke to go from place to place and have interviews with shipowners and seafaring people she was glad that she was able to give him an opportunity to do so  as for herself she was in a pleasant state of feminine satisfaction without any sort of presumption or even effort on her part she had attained a high and unquestioned position among her fellowcitizens and her mind was not set upon maintaining that position by worthy and unoffensive methods of using her riches  she now had a definite purpose in life if she could make herself happy and a great many other people happy and only a few people envious or jealous and at the same time feel that she was living and doing things as a person of good common sense and great wealth ought to live and do things what more could be expected of her in this life  thus backed up by her conscience and her checkbook she sat morning after morning before a cheerful fire of hickory logs and outlined her career this was in the parlor of her old house which she now determined to use as an office or businessroom she could afford the warmest fire of the best seasoned wood her chimney was in perfect order and she was but fiftyfive years old and in excellent healthwhy should she not enjoy the exhilarating blaze and plan for years of exhilarating occupation  soon after mr burke left plainton mrs cliff began work upon the new park this she could do without his assistance and it was work the mere contemplation of which delighted her she had legal assistance in regard to the purchase of the grounds and buildings of the opposite block and while this was in the hands of her lawyers she was in daily consultation with an eminent landscapeconstructor who had come to plainton for the purpose he lodged at the hotel and drew most beautiful plans of the proposed park  in the happy morning hours during which mrs cliffs mind wandered over the beautiful drives or stood upon the rustic bridges which crossed the stream dashing among its rocks and spreading itself out into placid pools or when mentally she sat in the shade of the great trees and looked out upon the wide stretches of verdant lawn relieved by the brilliant colors of the flowerbeds she often felt it was almost the same thing as if it were actually summer and that she really saw the beautiful grass and flowers heard the babbling of the stream and felt the refreshing breezes which rustled the great limbs of the trees  she did not selfishly keep these pleasures to herself but often on the stormy evenings she and willy and the misses thorpedyke would go over the brilliantly colored plans of the incas grove admire what had been proposed and suggest things which they thought would be desirable miss thorpedyke who had a vivid recollection of the gardens of luxemburg spoke of many of their beautiful and classic features which she would recommend for the new park if it were not that they would cost so much money all these were noted down with great care by mrs cliff and mentioned to the landscapeconstructor the next day  thus at home in church circles in the society of the town and in the mental contemplation of the charming landscape which in consequence of her own will and command would soon spread itself out before her windows mrs cliff was very happy but among all her sources of enjoyment there was nothing perhaps which pleased her better than to think on a cold winters night when the piercing winds were roaring about the house that poor old nancy shott was lying warm and comfortable under two of the finest blankets which ever came from californian looms  the great object of willy croups thoughts at this time was not the parkfor she could not properly appreciate trees and grass in this shivery weatherbut the entertainment the grand lunch or the very high tea which was to be given to mrs buskirk and daughters on the hill this important event had been postponed because the sleighing had become rather bad and the buskirks had gone to the city  but as soon as they returned willy hoped with all her heart that mrs cliff would be able to show them what may be done in the line of hospitable entertainment by people who had not only money but something more there had been a time when willy thought that when people wished to entertain there was nothing needed but money but then she had not lived in the house with the misses thorpedyke and had not heard them and mrs cliff discuss such matters  the peace of mind of mrs cliff was disturbed one day by the receipt of a letter from mr burke who wrote from new york and informed her that he had found a yacht which he believed would suit her and he wished very much that she would come and look at it before he completed the purchase  mrs cliff did not wish to go to new york and look at yachts she had then under consideration the plan of a semicircular marble terrace which was to overlook one end of a shaded lakelet which mr humphreys her professional adviser assured her she could have just as well as not by means of a dam and she did not wish to interrupt this most interesting occupation mr humphreys had procured photographs of some of the romantic spots of the luxemburg and mrs cliff felt within herself the gladdening impulses of a good magician as she planned the imitation of all this classic beauty  besides it was the middle of march and cold and not at all the season in which she would be able to properly appreciate the merits of a yacht still as mr burke had found the vessel and wanted her to see it and as there was a possibility he had written that delay might cause her to lose the opportunity of getting what she wanted and as she was very desirous of pleasing him she decided that she and willy would go to new york and look at the vessel  it would not take long because of course mr burke had already found out everything that was necessary in regard to its seagoing qualities and a great many other things of which she would not be a judge in fact it was not necessary for her to go at all but as she was to pay for it mr burke would be better satisfied if first she saw it  it was very pleasant to think that she could go away whenever she pleased and leave her house in the care of two such ladies as miss eleanor thorpedyke and her sister     chapter xix  the summer shelter   when mrs cliff and willy as well wrapped up in handsome furs as mr burke himself who accompanied them left their new york hotel to drive over to brooklyn and examine the yacht which had been selected willys mind vainly endeavored to form within itself an image of the object of the expedition  she was so thoroughly an inland woman and had so little knowledge of matters connected with the sea that when she first heard the mention of the yacht it had brought into her mind the idea of an asiatic animal with long hair and used as a beast of burden which she had read about in her schoolbooks but when she had discovered that the object in question was a vessel and not a bovine ruminant her mind carried her no farther than to a pleasure boat with a sail to it  even mrs cliff who had travelled had inadequate ideas concerning a steam yacht she had seen the small steamers which ran upon the seine and she had taken little trips upon them and if she had given the subject careful consideration she might have thought that the yacht intended for the use of a private individual would be somewhat smaller than one of these  it would be difficult therefore to imagine the surprise and even amazement of mrs cliff and willy croup when they beheld the vessel to which mr burke conducted them it was in fact a seagoing steamer of small comparative size it is true but of towering proportions when compared with the ideals in the minds of the two female citizens of plainton who had come the one to view it and the other to buy it  before we go on board said mr burke as he proudly stood upon the pier holding fast to his silk hat in the cold breeze which swept along the water front i want you to take a general look at her i dont suppose you know anything about her lines and build but i can tell you theyre all right but you can see for yourselves that shes likely to be a fine solid comfortable craft and wont go pitchin and tossin around like the crafts that some people go to sea in  why the name is on it cried willy summer shelter how did you happen to find one with that name mr burke  oh i didnt said he she had another name but i wanted you to see her just as shed look if she really belonged to youso i had the other name painted out and this put on in good big white letters that can be seen for a long distance if you dont buy her mrs cliff of course ill have the old name put back again now what do you think of her mrs cliff lookin at her from this point of view  the good lady stood silent she gazed at the long high hull of the steamer she looked up at the black smokestack and at the masts which ran up so shapely and so far and her soul rose higher than it had been uplifted even by the visions of the future grove of the incas  i think it is absolutely splendid said she let us go in  on board madam said burke gently correcting her this way to the gangplank  for nearly two hours mrs cliff and willy wandered over the upper and lower decks of the yacht examined its pretty little staterooms sat excitedly upon the sofas of its handsomely decorated saloon examined the folding tables and all the other wonderful things which shut themselves up out of the way when they were not needed tapped the keys of the piano investigated the storerooms lockers and all the marine domestic conveniences and forgot it was winter forgot that the keen wind nearly blew their bonnets off as they walked the upper deck and felt what a grand thing it would be to sail upon the sea upon such a noble vessel  to all this there was added in mrs cliffs mind the proud feeling that it would be her own and in it she could go wherever she pleased and come back again when it suited her  willy who had never been to sea was perfectly free to form an idea of an ocean voyage as delightful and charming as she pleased and this she did with great enthusiasm even had it been necessary that this perfectly lovely vessel should remain moored at the pier it would have given joy to her soul to live in it to sleep in one of those sweet little rooms and to eat and read and sew in that beautiful saloon  mr burke said mrs cliff i dont believe you could find any vessel better suited to our purpose than this one and i wish you would buy it  madam said burke ill do it immediately and i tell you madam that this is a wonderful chance for this time of the year when yachts and pleasure crafts in this part of the world are generally laid up and cant be seen properly and whats more would have to be docked and overhauled generally before they would be ready for sea but here is a yacht thats been cruising down south and in the west indies and has just come up here and is all ready to go to sea again whenever you like it if you dont mind going home by yourselves ill go to the office of the agent of the owner and settle the business at once  it would have been impossible for any purchase or any possession of palace pyramid or principality to make prouder the heart of mrs cliff than did the consciousness that she was the owner of a fine sea vessel worked by steam she acknowledged to herself that if she had been at home she could not have prevented herself from putting on those airs which she had been so anxious to avoid but these would wear off very soon she knew and so long as there was no one except willy to notice a possible change of manner it did not matter  now that mrs cliff and willy were in new york they both agreed that it would be well for them to attend to some shopping for which they had intended coming to the city later in the spring it had been found that there were many things wanted to supplement the furnishing of the new house and to the purchase of these the two ladies now devoted their mornings  but every afternoon in company with mr burke they went on board the summer shelter to see what he had been doing and to consult with him about what he was going to do it was astonishing how many little things were needed to be done to a yacht just returned from a cruise and how interesting all these things were to mrs cliff and willy considering that they knew so little about them  the engineer and fireman had not been discharged but were acting as watchmen and burke strongly recommended that they should be engaged immediately because as he said if mrs cliff were to let them go it would be difficult to get such men again it was a little expensive to be sure but when a yacht is not laid up he said there should always be men aboard of her and so the painting and the cleaning and the necessary fitting up went on and mr burke was very happy and mrs cliff was very proud although the external manifestation of this feeling was gradually wearing off  i dont want to give advice madam said burke one evening as the little party sat together discussing nautical matters but if i was in your place i wouldnt go back to plainton before i had taken a little trial trip on the yacht it doesnt matter a bit about the weather after we get out to sea it will be only a few days before we find were in real spring weather and the warm water of the gulf stream we can touch at savannah and cruise along the florida coast and then go over to the bahamas and look around as long as we feel like and when we get back here it will be beginning to be milder and then you can go home and arrange for the voyages youre goin to make in her during the summer  mrs cliff considered this was a tempting proposition and while she considered willy sat and looked at her with glowing cheeks and halfopen mouth it would not have required one second for her to decide such a question  you know said mr burke it wouldnt take me long to get her ready for sea i could soon coal her and put her stores aboard and as to a crew i can get one in no time we could leave port in a week just as well as not  lets go said willy seizing the hand of her friend it need only be a little trip just to see how it would all feel  mrs cliff smiled very good said she well take a little trial trip just as soon as you are ready captain burke that is if you have not made any plans which will prevent you from accepting the position  madam said burke springing to his feet and standing proudly before mrs cliff id throw up the command of the finest liner on the atlantic to be captain of the summer shelter for this summer i see far more fun ahead in the cruises that youre going to make than in any voyage ive looked forward to yet and when people have a chance to mix fun and charity as were goin to mix them i say such people ought to call themselves lucky this is wednesday well now madam by next wednesday the summer shelter will be all fitted out for the cruise and shell be ready to sail out of the harbor at whatever hour you name for the tide wont make any difference to her  there is only one thing i dont like about the arrangement said mrs cliff when the captain had left them and that is that we will have to take this trip by ourselves it seems a pity for three people to go sailing around in a big vessel like that with most of the staterooms empty but of course people are not prepared yet for country weeks at sea and it will take some time to make my plans known in the proper quarters  i dont suppose said willy that theres anybody in plainton that we could send for on short notice people there want so much time to get ready to do anything  but there is nobody in the town that i would care to take on a first voyage said mrs cliff you know something might go wrong and we would have to come back and if it is found necessary to do that i dont want any plainton people on board  no indeed exclaimed willy her mind involuntarily running towards nancy shott to whom a voyage to the west indies would doubtless be of great service dont lets bother about anything of that kind lets make the first trip by ourselves i think that will be glorious     chapter xx  the synod   as most of mrs cliffs business in new york was now finished and as she and willy were waiting there only for the yacht to be made ready for sea she had a good deal of time on her hands  on the saturday following her decision to make a trial trip on the summer shelter when returning from the daily visit to the yacht mrs cliff stopped in at a brooklyn church in which a synod was at that time convened she had read of the proceedings of this body in the papers and as the deliberations concerned her own denomination she thought she would be interested in them willy however preferred to go on by herself to new york as she had something to do there which she thought would be more to her taste than the proceedings of a synod  it was not long after she had been seated in the church that mrs cliff began to regret that she had not attended some of the earlier meetings for the questions debated were those in which she took an interest  after a time she saw near her mrs arkwright a lady who had visited mrs perley some years before and with whom she had then become acquainted joining her mrs cliff found mrs arkwright able to give her a great deal of information in regard to the members of the synod and as the two sat and talked together in whispers a desire arose in the mind of mrs cliff that she and her wealth might in some way join in the work in which all these people were engaged as her mind rested upon this subject there came into it a plan which pleased her here were all these delegates many of them looking tired and pale as if they had been hardworked during the winter and here was she the mistress of the summer shelter about to take a trip to warm and sunny regions with an almost empty vessel  as soon as the meeting adjourned mrs cliff accompanied by mrs arkwright made her way to the front where many of the members were standing together and was introduced by her friend to several clergymen with whom mrs arkwright was acquainted as soon as possible mrs cliff referred to the subject which was upon her mind and informed the gentlemen with whom she had just been made acquainted that if they thought well of it she would like to invite a party of such of the delegates who would care for such an excursion at this season to accompany her on a short trip to the west indies her vessel would easily accommodate twelve or fifteen of the gentlemen and she would prefer to offer her invitation first to the clerical members of the synod  the reverend gentlemen to whom this offer was made were a little surprised by it but they could not help considering it was a most generous and attractive proposition and one of them undertook to convey the invitation to some of his brethren of the synod  illustration mrs cliffs invitation was discussed with lively appreciation  although the synod had adjourned many of the delegates remained for a considerable time during which mrs cliffs invitation was discussed with lively appreciation some of the speakers informing her that if they could make the arrangements necessary for their pulpits and their families during a short absence they would be delighted to accept her invitation the synod would finally adjourn on the next tuesday and she was promised that before that time she would be informed of the exact number of guests she might expect  the next morning when mr burke appeared to accompany the ladies to the yacht he found willy croup alone in their parlor  do you know whats happened cried willy springing towards him as he entered of course you dont for mrs cliff is going to give the first country week on the summer shelter to a synod  to a what cried burke  a synod explained willy its a congregation i mean a meeting mostly of ministers come together to settle church matters she invited the whole lot of them but of course they all cant comefor there are more than a hundred of thembut there will be about a dozen who can sail with us next wednesday  mr burkes jaw dropped a dozen ministers he exclaimed sail with us by george miss croup will you excuse me if i sit down  you know said willy that the summer shelter was bought for this sort of thing that is to do good to people who cant get that sort of good in other ways and if mrs cliff takes out poor children from the slums and hardworking shopgirls and seamstresses why shouldnt she take hardworking ministers and give them some fresh air and pleasure  a dozen ministers groaned mr burke i tell you miss croup i cant take them in  oh therell be room enough said willy mistaking his meaning for mrs cliff says that each of those little rooms will easily hold two  oh it isnt that said burke his eyes fixed steadfastly upon a chair near him as if it had been something to look at but twelve ministers coming down on me so sudden rather takes me aback miss croup  i dont wonder said willy for i dont believe that a synod ever went out yachting before in a bunch  mr burke rose and looked out of the window miss croup said he do you remember what i said about mixin fun and charity in these cruises well i guess well have to take our charity straight this time  but when mrs cliff had come in and had talked with animation and enthusiasm in regard to her plan the effects of the shock which mr burke had received began to wear off  all right madam said he youre owner and im captain and ill stand by you and if you take it into your head to ship a dozen popes on the summer shelter ill take them where you want them to go to and ill bring them back safe i suppose well have all sorts of customers on the yacht this season and if weve got to get used to queer passengers a synod will do very well to begin with if youll find out whos goin and will write to them to be on hand tuesday night ill see that theyre taken care of  mrs cliffs whole heart was now in the projected cruise of the summer shelter when she had thought of it with only willy and herself as passengers she could not help considering it was a great extravagance now she was going to begin her series of seatrips in a fashion far superior and more dignified than anything yet thought of to be able to give such an invitation to a synod was something of which she might well be proud and she was proud     chapter xxi  a telegram from captain horn   it was early tuesday morning and mrs cliff and willy having just finished their breakfast were busily engaged in packing the two trunks they proposed taking with them and the elder lady was stating that although she was perfectly willing to dress in the blue flannel suit which had been ordered she was not willing to wear a white cap although willy urged that this was the proper thing as they had been told by the people where they had bought their yachting suits and mrs cliff was still insisting that although it would do very well for willy to wear a white cap she would wear a hoodthe same kind of a hood which she had worn on all her other voyages which was more like a bonnet and more suitable to her on that account than any other kind of head covering when mr burke burstactually burstwithout knocking into the room his silk hat was on the back of his head and he wore no overcoat  mrs cliff he exclaimed ive just seen shirley you remember shirley  indeed i do said mrs cliff i remember him very well and i always thought him to be a remarkably nice man but where did you see him and what in the world did he tell you to throw you into such a flurry  he said a lot to me replied burke and ill try to make as straight a tale of it as i can you see about a week ago shirley got a telegraphic message from captain horn  captain horn exclaimed mrs cliff where is he and what did he say  hes in mexico said burke and the telegram was as long as a letterthats one advantage in not being obliged to think of what things costand he told shirley a lot  how did they say they were asked mrs cliff eagerly or did he say anything about mrs horn are they well  oh i expect theyre all right said burke but i dont think he treated that subject it was all about that gold and the part of it that was to go to peru  when the business of dividing up the treasure was settled in london in the way we know all about word was sent to the peruvian government to tell them what had happened and to see what they said about it and when they heard the news they were a good deal more than satisfiedas they ought to have been im sureand they made no bones about the share we took all they wanted was to have their part sent to them just as soon as could be and i dont wonder at it for all those south american countries are as poor as beggars and if any one of them got a sum of money like that it could buy up all the others if it felt like spending the money in that way  those peruvians were in such a hurry to get the treasure that they wouldnt agree to have the gold coined into money or to be sent a part at a time or to take drafts for it but they wanted it just as it was as soon as they could get it and as it was their own nobody could hinder them from doing what they pleased with it shirley and i have made up our minds that most likely the present government thought that they wouldnt be in office when the money arrived if they didnt have it on hand in pretty short order and of course if they got their fingers on that treasure they could stay in power as long as they pleased  it is hard to believe that any government could be such foolsfor they ordered it all shipped on an ordinary merchant vessel an english steamer the dunkery beacon which was pretty nigh ready to sail for lima now any other government in this world would have sent a manofwar for that gold or some sort of an armed vessel to convoy it but that wasnt the way with the peruvians they wanted their money and they wanted it by the first steamer which could be got ready to sail they werent going to wait until they got one of their cruisers over to englandnot they  the quickest way of course would have been to ship it to aspinwall and then take it by rail to panama and from there ship it to lima but i suppose they were afraid to do that if that sort of freight had been carried overland they couldnt have hindered people from finding out what it was and pretty nearly everybody in central america would have turned trainrobber anyway the agents over there got the dunkery beacon to sail a little before her regular time  now here comes the point they actually shipped a hundred and sixty million dollars worth of pure gold on a merchant steamer that was going on a regular voyage and would actually touch at jamaica and rio janeiro on account of her other freight instead of buying her outright or sending her on the straightest cruise she could make for lima just think of that more than that this business was so talked about by the peruvian agents while they were trying to get the earliest steamer possible for it that it was heard of in a good many more ports than one  well this steamer with all the gold on board sailed just as soon as it could and the very next day our london bankers got a telegram from paris from the head of a detective bureau there to tell them that no less than three vessels were fitting out in the biggest kind of hurry to go after that slow merchant steamer with the millions on board  mrs cliff and willy uttered a simultaneous cry of horror do you mean theyre pirates and are going to steal the gold cried mrs cliff  of course they are continued burke and i dont wonder at it why i dont believe such a cargo of gold ever left a port since the beginning of the world for such a thing as that is enough to tempt anybody with the smallest streak of rascal blood in him and who could get hold of a ship  well these three vessels were fitting out hard as they couldtwo in france at toulon and marseilles and one in genoa and although the detectives were almost positive what their business was they were not sure that they could get proof enough to stop them if the dunkery beacon had been going on a straight voyage even to rio janeiro she might have got away from them but you see she was goin to touch at jamaica  and now nowthis very minutethat slow old steamer and those three pirates are on the atlantic ocean together why it makes your blood creep to think of it  indeed it does its awful cried mrs cliff and what are the london people going to do  theyre not going to do anything so far as i know said burke if they could get through with the redtape business necessary to send any sort of a cruiser or warvessel after the dunkery beacon to protect herand im not sure that they could do it at allit would be a precious long time before such a vessel would leave the english channel but i dont think that theyll try anything of the sort all i know is that the london people sent a cable message to captain horn i suppose that they thought he ought to know what was likely to happen considerin that he was the head man in the whole business  and what did the captain do cried mrs cliff what could he do  i dont know answered burke i expect he did everything that could be done in the way of sending messages and among other things he sent that telegram about a thousand words more or less to shirley he might have telegraphed to me perhaps but he didnt know my address as i was wandering around but shirley you know is a fixture in his shipyardand so he sent it to him  i havent a doubt said mrs cliff that he would have telegraphed to you if he had known where you were  i hope so said burke and when he had told shirley all that had happened he asked him to pull up stakes and sail by the first steamer he could catch for jamaica there was a chance that he might get there before the dunkery beacon arrived or while she was in port and then he could tell everything to make her captain understand that he neednt be afraid to lose anything on account of his ship stopping in kingston harbor until arrangements could be made for his carrying his gold in safety to lima captain horn didnt think that the pirates would try to do anything before the dunkery beacon left kingston they would just follow her until she got into the south atlantic and then board her most likely  captain horn said that he was going to jamaica too but as he didnt know how soon he would be able to sail from vera cruz he wanted shirley to go ahead without losing a minute and then shirley he telegraphed to me up at plaintonthinking i was there and that i ought to know all about it and the women at my house took so long forwarding it that i did not get it until yesterday evening and then i rushed around to where shirley was staying and got there just in time to catch him for the next steamer to jamaica sailed early this morning but he had plenty of time to tell me everything  the minute he got the captains telegram he just dropped everything and started for new york and i can tell you mrs cliff id have done the same for i dont know what i wouldnt do to get the chance to see captain horn again  and you wanted to go with mr shirley said mrs cliff with an eager light in her eyes  indeed i did said burke but of course i wouldnt think of such a thing as going off and leaving you here with that yacht on your hands and no knowing what you would do with the people on board and everything else so i saw shirley off about seven oclock this morning and then i came to report to you  that was too much to expect mr burke said mrs cliff but it was just like you and i shall never forget it but now tell me one thingis mrs horn going to jamaica with the captain  i dont know said burke but of course she must behe wouldnt leave her alone in mexico  of course she is cried mrs cliff and mr shirley will see them and oh mr burke why cant we see them of all things in the world i want to see edna and the captain too and why cant we go straight to jamaica in the summer shelter instead of going anywhere else we may get there before they all leave dont you think we could do that  the eyes of captain burke fairly blazed do it he cried springing to his feet i believe we can do it at any rate we can try the same to you madam i would do anything in the world to see captain horn and nobody knows when we will have the chance well madam its all the plainest kind of sailing we can get off at daylight tomorrow morning and if that yacht sails as they told me she sails i believe we may overhaul shirley and perhaps we will get to kingston before any of them and now ive got to bounce around for theres a good deal to be done before nightfall  but what about the synod asked willy croup  bless my soul exclaimed mr burke stopping suddenly on his way to the door i forgot the synod  mrs cliff hesitated for a moment i dont think it need make any difference it would be a great shame to disappoint all those good men why couldnt we take them along all the same their weight wouldnt make the yacht go any slower would it mr burke  not a bit of it said he but they may not want to go so far besides if we find the captain at kingston we maynt feel like going back in a hurry ill tell you what we could do mrs cliff we wouldnt lose any time worth speaking of if we touched at nassauthats in the bahamas and a jolly place to go to then we might discharge our cargo of ministers and if you paid their board until the next steamer sailed for new york and their passage home i should think they would be just as well satisfied as if they came back with us  mrs cliff reflected thats true said she presently i can explain the case to them and i dont see why they should not be satisfied and as for me nobody could be more willing than i am to give pleasure to these ministers but i dont believe that i could give up seeing edna and captain horn for the sake of any members of any synod  all right madam cried the impatient burke you settle the matter with the parsons and i havent a doubt you can make it all right and ill be off everything has got to be on board tonight ill come after you early this evening with this he departed  when mr burke had gone mrs cliff very much excited by what she had heard and by the thought of what she was going to do told willy that she could go on with the packing while she herself went over to the church in brooklyn and explained matters to the members of the synod who intended to go with her and give them a chance to decide whether or not the plan proposed by mr burke would suit them  she carried out this intention and drove to brooklyn in a carriage but having been delayed by many things which willy wanted to know about the packing and having forgotten in what street the church was situated she lost a good deal of time and when she reached her destination she found that the synod had adjourned sine die  mrs cliff sighed it was a great pity to have taken so much trouble especially when time was so precious but she had done what she could it would be impossible for her to find the members in their temporary places of abode and the only thing she could do now was to tell them the change in her plans when they came on board that evening and then if they did not care to sail with her they would have plenty of time to go on shore again     chapter xxii  the summer shelter goes to sea   mr burke did not arrive to escort mrs cliff and willy croup to the yacht until nearly nine oclock in the evening they had sent their baggage to the vessel in the afternoon and had now been expecting him with great impatience for nearly an hour but when mr burke arrived it was impossible to find fault with him for he had been busy he said every minute of the day  he had made up a full crew he had a good sailingmaster and the first mate who had been on the yacht before everything that he could think of in the way of provisions and stores were on board and there was nothing to prevent their getting out of the harbor early in the morning  when mrs cliff stepped on board her yacht the summer shelter her first thought was directed towards her guests of the synod and when the mate mr burdette had advanced and been introduced to her she asked him if any of the clergymen had yet appeared  theyre all aboard madam said hefourteen of them they came aboard about seven oclock and they stayed in the saloon until about halfpast nine and one of them came to me and said that as they were very tired they thought theyd go to bed thinking most likely as it was then so late you wouldnt come aboard until morning so the steward showed them their staterooms and we had to get one more ready than we expected to and theyre now all fast asleep but i suppose i could arouse some of them up if you want to see them  mrs cliff turned to burke with an expression of despair on her face what in the world shall i do said she i wanted to tell them all about it and let them decide but it would be horrible to make any of them who didnt care to go to get up and dress and go out into this damp night air to look for a hotel  well said burke all thats going ashore has got to go ashore tonight well sail as soon as it is daylight if i was you mrs cliff i wouldnt bother about them you invited them to go to the bahamas and youre going to take them there and youre going to send them back the best way you can and im willing to bet a clipper ship against your yacht that they will be just as well satisfied to come back in a regular steamer as to come back in this you might offer to send them over to savannah and let them come up by railthey might like that for a change the way the thing looks to me madam youre proposing to give them a good deal more than you promised  well said mrs cliff one thing is certain im not going to turn any of them out of their warm beds this night and we might as well go to our rooms for it must be a good deal after ten  when willy croup beheld her little stateroom she stood at the door and looked in at it with rapture she had a beautiful chamber in mrs cliffs new house fully and elegantly furnished but there was something about this little bit of a bedroom with all its nautical conveniences its hooks and shelves and racks its dear little window and its two pretty berthseach just big enough and not a bit too bigwhich charmed her as no room she had ever seen had charmed her  the summer shelter must have started mrs cliff thought before daylight the next morning for when she was awakened by the motion of the engine it was not light enough to distinguish objects in the room but she lay quietly in her berth and let her proud thoughts mount high and spread wide as far as the possession of wealth and the sense of power could elevate the soul of woman it now elevated the soul of mrs cliff  this was her own ship which was going out upon the ocean this was her engine which was making everything shake and tremble the great screw which was dashing the water at the stern and forcing the vessel through the waves belonged to her everythingthe smokestacks the tall masts the nautical instrumentswas her property the crew and stewards the engineers were all in her service she was going to the beautiful island of the sunny tropics because she herself had chosen to go there  it was with great satisfaction too that she thought of the cost of all this a great deal of money had been paid for that yacht and it had relieved as scarcely any other expenditure she would be likely to make could have relieved the strain upon her mind occasioned by the pressure of her income even after the building of her new apartments her money had been getting the better of her now she felt that she was getting the better of her money  by the way the yacht rolled and at the same time pitched and tossed mrs cliff thought it likely that they must be out upon the open sea or at least well down the outer bay she liked the motion and the feeling that her property moving according to her will was riding dominant over the waves of the sea sent a genial glow through every vein it was now quite light and when mrs cliff got up and looked out of her round window she could see far away to the right the towering lighthouses of sandy hook  about eight oclock she dressed and went out on deck she was proud of her good sailing qualities as she went up the companionway holding firmly to the bright brass rail she felt no more fear of falling than if she had been one of the crew when she came out on the upper deck she had scarcely time to look about her when a man whom at first sight she took for a stranger came forward with outstretched hand but in an instant she saw it was not a strangerit was captain burke but not as she had ever seen him before he was dressed in a complete suit of white duck with gold buttons and he wore a white cap trimmed with goldan attire so different from his high silk hat and the furs that it was no wonder that at first she did not recognize their wearer  why captain burke she cried i didnt know you  no wonder said he this is a considerable change from my ordinary toggery but its the uniform of a captain of a yacht you see thats different from what it would be if i commanded a merchant vessel or a liner or a manofwar  it looks awfully cool for such weather said she  yes said the captain but its the proper thing and yachts you know generally cruise around in warmish weather however were getting south as fast as we can i tell you madam this yacht is a good one weve just cast the log and shes doing better than fourteen knots an hour and we havent got full steam on either it seems funny madam for me to command a steamer but ill get used to it in no time if it was a sailingvessel it wouldnt be anything out of the way because ive studied navigation and i know more about a ship than many a skipper but a steam yacht is different however ive got men under me who know how to do what i order them to do and if necessary theyre ready to tell me what i ought to order  i dont believe there could be a better captain said mrs cliff and i do hope you wont take cold and now i want to see the ministers as soon as they are ready i think it will be well for me to receive them up here i am not sure that i remember properly the names of all of them but i shall not hesitate to ask them and then i shall present each one of them to you it will be a sort of a reception you know after that we can all go on pleasantly like one family we will have to have a pretty big table in the saloon but i suppose we can manage that  oh yes said mr burke and now ill see the steward and tell him to let the parsons know that youre ready to receive them  about a quarter of an hour after this the steward appeared on deck and approaching mrs cliff and the captain touched his hat come to report sir said he the ministers are all seasick there aint none of them wants to get out of their berths but some of them want tea  mrs cliff and the captain could not help laughing although she declared it was not a laughing matter  but it isnt surprising said the captain its pretty rough and i suppose theyre all thoroughbred landsmen but theyll get over it before long and when they come on deck its likely it will be pleasanter weather were having a considerable blow just now and it will be worse when we get farther out so i should say that you and miss croup and myself had better have our breakfast  the steward was still standing by and he touched his hat again this time to mrs cliff  the other lady is very seasick i heard her groaning fearfully as i passed her door  oh i must go down to willy said mrs cliff and captain you and i will have to breakfast together  as mrs cliff opened the door of willy croups stateroom a pale white face in the lower berth was turned towards her and a weak and trembling voice said to her oh sarah you have come at last is there any way of getting me out of this horrible little hole  for two days mrs cliff and captain burke breakfasted dined and supped by themselves they had headwinds and the sea was very rough and although the yacht did not make the time that might have been expected of her in fair weather she did very well and burke was satisfied the two stewards were kept very busy with the prostrate and dejected members of the synod and mrs cliff and the stewardess devoted their best efforts to the alleviation of the woes of willy which they were glad to see were daily dwindling  they had rounded cape hatteras the sea was smoother the cold wind had gone down and willy croup warmly wrapped up was sitting in a steamer chair on deck the desire that she might suddenly be transferred to plainton or to heaven was gradually fading out of her mind and the blue sky the distant waves and the thought of the approaching meal were exercising a somewhat pleasurable influence upon her dreamy feeling when captain burke who stood near with a telescope announced that the steamer over there on the horizon line was heading south and that he had a notion she was the antonina the vessel on which shirley had sailed  i believed that we could overhaul her said he to mrs cliff i didnt know much about her sailing qualities but i had no reason to believe she has the speed of this yacht and as were on the same course i thought it likely we would sight her and whats more pass her well change our course a little so that we will be closer to her when we pass  mrs cliff who had taken the glass but could not see through it very well returned it to the captain and remarked if we can go so much faster than she does why cant we take mr shirley on board when we catch up to her  i dont know about that said burke to do that both vessels would have to lay to and lose time and she might not want to do it as shes a regular steamer and carries the mail and besides if shirleys under ordersthat is the same thing as ordersto go straight to jamaica i dont know that we have any right to take him off his steamer and carry him to nassau of course he might get to jamaica just as soon and perhaps sooner if he sailed with us but we dont know it we may be delayed in some way therere lots of things that might happen and anyway i dont believe in interfering with orders and i know shirley doesnt either i believe he would want to keep on besides we dont really know yet that thats the antonina  a couple of hours however proved that captain burkes surmise had been correct and it was not long before the two vessels were abreast of each other the yacht had put on all steam and had proved herself capable of lively speed as the two vessels approached within hailing distance captain burke went up on the little bridge with a speakingtrumpet and it was not long before shirley was on the bridge of the other steamer with another trumpet  to the roaring conversation which now took place everybody on each vessel who was not too sick who had no duties or could be spared from them listened with the most lively interest a colloquy upon the lonely sea between two persons one upon one vessel and the other upon another must always be an incident of absorbing importance  very naturally shirley was amazed to find it was his friend burke who was roaring at him and delighted when he was informed that the yacht was also on its way to jamaica to meet captain horn after a quarter of an hour of highsounding talk during which shirley was informed of burkes intention to touch at nassau the interview terminated the summer shelter shaping her course a little more to the south by nightfall the antonina had faded out of sight on the northeast horizon  i shouldnt wonder said captain burke at dinner if we got to jamaica before her anyway although were bound to lose time in the harbor at nassau  the company at the dinnertable was larger than it had yet been five members of the synod had appeared on deck during the speakingtrumpet conversation and feeling well enough to stay there had been warmly greeted and congratulated by mrs cliff the idea of a formal reception had of course been given up and there was no need of presenting these gentlemen to the captain for he had previously visited all of his clerical passengers in their berths and was thus qualified to present them to mrs cliff as fast as they should make their appearance at dinnertime two more came into the saloon and the next morning at breakfast the delegation from the synod were all present with the exception of two whose minds were not yet quite capable of properly appreciating the subject of nutrition  when at last the summer shelter found herself in the smoother waters and the warmer air of the gulf stream when the nautilus spread its gaycolored sail in the sunlight by the side of the yacht when the porpoises flashed their shining black bodies out of the water and plunged in again as they raced with the swiftly moving vessel when great flocks of flyingfish would rise into the air skim high above the water and then all fall back again with a patter as of big raindrops and the people on the deck of the summer shelter took off their heavy wraps and unbuttoned their coats it was a happy company which sailed with mrs cliff among the beautiful isles of the west indies     chapter xxiii  willy croup comes to the front   the pleasant rays of the semitropical sun so warmed and subsequently melted the varied dispositions of the company on board the summer shelter that in spite of their very different natures they became fused as it were into a happy party of friends  willy croup actually felt as if she were a young woman in a large party of gentlemen with no rivals she was not young but many of her youthful qualities still remained with her and under the influence of her surroundings they all budded out and blossomed bravely at the end of a day of fine weather there was not a clergyman on board who did not wish that miss croup belonged to his congregation  as for the members of the synod there could be no doubt that they were thoroughly enjoying themselves tired with the long winters work and rejoiced almost amazed to be so suddenly freed from the cold wintry weather of their homes all of their spirits rose and most of their hearts were merry  there were but few gray heads among these clergymen and the majority of them were under middle age some of them had been almost strangers to each other when they came on board but now there were no strangers on the summer shelter some of them had crossed the atlantic but not one had ever taken a coastwise voyage on a comparatively small vessel and although the consequence of this new experience their involuntary seclusion of the first days of the trip and their consequent unconventional and irregular acceptance of mrs cliffs hospitality had caused a little stiffness in their demeanor at first this speedily disappeared hand in hand with the recollection of that most easily forgotten of human ills which had so rudely interfered with their good manners  as far as the resources of their portmanteaus would allow these reverend clergymen dressed themselves simply and in seminautical costumes some played quoits upon the upper deck in which sport willy joined others climbed up the shrouds preferably on the insidethis method of exercise although very difficult being considered safer in case of a sudden lurch of the vessel and the many other sportive things they did and the many pleasant anecdotes they told nearly all relating to the discomfiture of clergymen under various embarrassing circumstances caused captain burke to say to mrs cliff that he had never imagined that parsons were such jolly fellows and so far as he was concerned he would be glad to take out another party of them  but if we do he said i think wed better ship them on a tug and let them cruise around the lightship for two or three days then when they hoisted a signal that they were all well on board we could go out and take them off in that way you see theyd really enjoy a cruise on the summer shelter  as the sun went down behind the distant coast of florida they were boarded by a negro pilot and in the morning they awoke to find themselves fast to a pier of the city of nassau lying white in the early daylight  the members of the synod had readily agreed to mrs cliffs plan to leave them at nassau and let them return by a regular passenger steamer and they all preferred to go by sea to savannah and then to their homes by rail with expenses paid none but the most unreasonable of men could have objected to such a plan  as captain burke announced that he would stop at nassau for a day to take in some fresh stores especially of fruit and vegetables and to give mrs cliff and willy croup an opportunity to see the place the summer shelter was soon deserted but in the evening everybody returned on board as the company wished to keep together as long as possible and there would be plenty of time in the morning for the members of the synod to disembark and go to the hotel  very early in the morning captain burke was aroused by the entrance of the sailingmaster mr portman into his stateroom morning sir said mr portman i want you to come out here and look at something  perceiving by the manner and tones of the other that there was something important to be looked at captain burke jumped up quickly dressed himself and went out on deck there fastened against the foremast was a large piece of paper on which were written these words       we dont intend to sail on a filibustering cruise we know what it      means when you take on arms in new york and discharge your      respectable passengers in nassau we dont want nothing to do      with your next lot of passengers and dont intend to get into no      scrapes so goodbye         signed the crew  illustration there fastened against the foremast was a large piece of paper  you dont mean to say cried burke that the crew has deserted the vessel  thats what it is sir said mr burdette the first mate who had just joined them the crew has cleared out to a man mr portman and i are left the engineers left and his assistantthey belonged to the yacht and dont have much to do with the crewbut the rests all gone deckhands stewards and even the cook the stewardess must have gone too for i havent seen her  whats the meaning of all this shouted burke his face getting very red when did they go and why did they go  its the second mates watch and he is off with them said mr burdette i expect hes at the bottom of it hes a mighty wary fellow just as like as not he spread the report that we were going on a filibustering expedition to cuba and the ground for it in my opinion is those cases of arms you opened the other day  i think that is it sir said mr portman you know theres a rising in cuba and there was lots of talk about filibustering before we left i expect the people thought that the ladies were going on shore the same as the parsons  burke was confounded he knew not what to say or what to think but seeing mrs cliff appearing at the head of the companionway he thought it his first duty to go and report the state of affairs to her which he did that ladys astonishment and dismay were very great  what are we going to do she asked and what do you mean by the cases of arms  im afraid that was a piece of folly on my part said burke  i didnt know we had arms on board  well what we have dont amount to much said burke but this was the way of it after i heard the message from captain horn about the pirates and everything and as i didnt know exactly what sort of craft we would meet round about jamaica i thought we would feel a good deal safer especially on account of you and miss croup if we had some firearms aboard so i put in some repeating rifles and ammunition and i paid for them out of my own pocket such things always come in useful and while i was commanding the vessel on which you were sailing mrs cliff i didnt want to feel that id left anything undone which ought to be done of course there was no reason to suppose that we would ever have to use them but i knew i would feel better if i had them but there was one thing i neednt have done and that wasi neednt have opened them which i did the other day in company with mr burdette because i hadnt had time before to examine them and i wanted to see what they were some of the crew must have noticed the guns and as they couldnt think why we wanted them unless we were going on a filibustering expedition they got that notion into their heads and so cut the ship it was easy enough to do it for we were moored to a pier and the second mate whose watch they went away in was most likely at the head of the whole business  but what are we going to do asked mrs cliff  i must get another crew just as soon as i can said he and there isnt a minute to be lost i was stretching a point when i agreed to stop over a day but i thought we could afford that and reach kingston as soon as shirley does but when he gets there with his message to the captain of the dunkery beacon i want to be on hand theres no knowing what will have to be done or what will have to be said i dont want shirley to think that hes got nobody to stand by him  indeed said mrs cliff we ought to lose no time for captain horn may be there it is a most dreadful misfortune to lose the crew this way cant you find them again cant you make them come back  if they dont want to be found said burke it will take a good while to find them but im going on shore this minute and i wish you would be good enough to tell miss croup and the ministers how matters stand  the news of the desertion of the crew when told by mrs cliff to those of the passengers who had come on deck and speedily communicated by these to their companions created a great sensation willy croup was so affected that she began to cry is there any danger she said and hadnt we better go on shore suppose some other vessel wanted to come up to this wharf and we had to move awaytheres nobody to move us and suppose we were to get loose in some way theres nobody to stop us  you are very practical miss croup remarked the reverend mr hodgson the youngest clergyman on board but i am sure you need not have the least fear we are moored firm and fast and i have no doubt captain burke will soon arrive with the necessary men to take you to jamaica  willy dried her eyes and then she said theres another practical thing im thinking ofthere isnt any breakfast and the cooks gone but i believe we can arrange that i could cook the breakfast myself if i had anybody to help me ill go speak to mrs cliff  mrs cliff was decidedly of the opinion that they all ought to have breakfast and that she and willy could at least make coffee and serve the passengers with bread and butter and preserved meats but she remarked to mr hodgson that perhaps the gentlemen would rather go to their hotels and get their breakfast  no indeed said mr hodgson a stout sunbrowned fellow who looked more like a hunter than a clergyman we have been talking over the matter and we are not going to desert you until the new men come and as to breakfast here are mr litchfield and myself ready to serve as stewards assistants cooks or in any culinary capacity we both have camped out and are not green hands so you must let us help you and we shall consider it good fun  it will be funny said willy to see a minister cook so lets go down to the kitchen i know where it is for ive been in it  i think miss croup said mr litchfield a tall young man with black hair and side whiskers and a good deal of manner that you should say galley or caboose now that we are all nautical together  well i cant cook nautical said willy and i dont intend to try but i guess you can eat the food if it isnt strictly naval  in a few minutes the volunteer cooks were all at work and willys familiarity with household affairs even when exhibited under the present novel conditions shone out brightly she found some cold boiled potatoes and soon set mr hodgson to work frying them mrs cliff took the coffee in hand with all her antemillionnaire skill and willy skipped from one thing to another as happy as most people are whose ability has suddenly forced them to the front  oh you ought to see the synod setting the table she cried bursting into the galley theyre getting things all wrong but it doesnt matter and they seem to be enjoying it now then mr litchfield i think you have cut all the bread that can possibly be eaten  mr burdette had gone on shore with the captain and mr portman considered it his duty to remain on deck but the volunteer corps of cooks and stewards did their work with hearty goodwill and the breakfast would have been the most jolly meal that they had yet enjoyed together if it had not been for the uncertainty and uneasiness naturally occasioned by the desertion of the crew  it was after ten oclock when captain burke and mr burdette returned were in a bad fix said the former approaching mrs cliff who with all the passengers had been standing together watching them come down the pier there was a steamer cleared from here the day before yesterday which was shorthanded and seems to have carried off all the available able seamen in the port but i believe that is all stuff and nonsense the real fact seems to beand mr burdette and ive agreed on that pointthat the report has got out that were filibusters and nobody wants to ship with us everything looks like it you see here we come from new york with a regular lot of passengers but weve got arms on board and we drop the passengers here and let them go home some other way and we sail on saying were bound for jamaicafor cuba is a good deal nearer you know but the worst thing is this and im bound to tell it so that you can all know how the case stands and take care of yourselves as you think best theres reason to believe that if the government of this place has not already had its eye on us it will have its eye on us before very long and for my part id give a good deal of money to be able to get away before they do but without a crew we cant do it  mrs cliff and burke now retired to consult madam said he im bound to ask you as owner what do you think we ought to do if you take my advice the first thing to be done is to get rid of the ministers you can settle with them about their travelling and let them go to their hotels then perhaps i can rake up a few loafers landsmen or anybody who can shovel coal or push on a capstan bar and by offering them double wages get them to ship with us once in jamaica we shall be all right  but dont you think it will be dangerous said mrs cliff to go around offering extra pay in this way  that may be he answered but what else is there to do  at this moment mr litchfield approached madam said he we have been discussing the unfortunate circumstances in which you find yourself placed and we now ask if you have made any plans in regard to your future action  the circumstances are truly unfortunate replied mrs cliff for we are anxious to get to jamaica as soon as possible on account of very important business and i dont see how we are to do it we have made no plans except that we feel it will be well for you gentlemen to leave us and go to your hotel where you can stay until the steamer will sail for savannah day after tomorrow as for ourselves we dont know what we are going to do unless indeed some sort of a vessel may be starting for jamaica and in that case we could leave the summer shelter here and go on her  no said burke i thought of that and inquired nothing will sail under a week and in that time everybody we want to see may have left jamaica  will you excuse me for a few minutes said mr litchfield and with that he returned to his companions  captain said willy wont you come down and have your breakfast i dont believe you have eaten a thing and you look as if you needed it  captain burke really did look as if he needed a good many thingsamong others a comb and a brush his goldtrimmed cap was pushed on the back of his head his white coat was unbuttoned and the collar turned in and his countenance was troubled by the belief that his want of prudence had brought mrs cliff and her property into a very serious predicament  thank you said he but i cant eat breakfast is the last thing i can think of just now  now approached mr litchfield followed by all his clerical brethren madam said he we have had a final consultation and have come to make a proposition to you and the captain we do not feel that we would be the kind of men we would like to think we are if after all your kindness and great consideration we should step on shore and continue the very delightful programme you have laid out for us while you are left in doubt perplexity and perhaps danger on your yacht there are five of us who feel that they cannot join in the offer which i am about to make to you and the captain but the rest of us wish most earnestly and heartily to offer you our servicesif you think they are worth anythingto work this vessel to jamaica it is but a trip of a few days i am told and i have no doubt that we can return to new york from kingston almost as conveniently as we can from here we can all write home and arrange for any contingencies which may arise on account of the delay in our return in fact it will not be difficult for most of us to consider this excursion as a part or even the whole of our annual vacation those of us who can go with you are all ablebodied fellows and if you say so captain we will turn in and go to work this moment we have not any nautical experience but we all have powers of observation and so far as i am able to judge i believe i can do most of the things i have seen done on this vessel by your common seamen if that is what you call them  mrs cliff looked at captain burke and he looked at her if it was a sailinvessel he exclaimed id say she couldnt be worked by parsons but a steamers different by george madam lets take them and get away while we can     chapter xxiv  changes on the summer shelter   when captain burke communicated to mr portman and mr burdette the news that nine of their passengers had offered to ship as a crew the sailingmaster and the first mate shook their heads they did not believe that the vessel could be worked by parsons  but there isnt anybody else exclaimed burke weve got to get away and theyre all ablebodied and they have more sense than most landsmen we can ship and besides here are five experienced seamen on board and i say lets try the parsons  all right said mr burdette if youre willing to risk it i am  mr portman also said he was willing and the engineer and his assistant who were getting very nervous agreed to the plan as soon as they heard of it  captain burke shook himself pulled his cap to the front of his head arranged his coat properly and buttoned it up and began to give orders now then said he all passengers going ashore please step lively and while this lively stepping was going on and during the leavetaking and rapid writing of notes to be sent to the homes of the clerical crew he ordered mr burdette to secure a pilot attend to the clearance business and make everything ready to cast off and get out of the harbor as soon as possible  when the five reverend gentlemen who had decided not to accompany the summer shelter in her further voyaging had departed for the hotel portmanteaus in hand and amply furnished by mrs cliff with funds for their return to their homes the volunteer crew most of them without coats or waistcoats and all in a high picnic spirit set to work with enthusiasm doing more things than they knew how to do and embarrassing mr burdette a good deal by their overwillingness to make themselves useful but this untrained alacrity was soon toned down and early in the afternoon the hawsers of the summer shelter were cast off and she steamed out of the eastern passage of the harbor  there were remarks made in the town after the departure of the yacht but when the passengers who had been left behind all clergymen of high repute had related the facts of the case and had made it understood that the yacht whose filibustering purpose had been suspected by its former crew was now manned by nine members of the synod recently convened in brooklyn and under the personal direction of mrs cliff an elderly and charitable resident of plainton maine all distrust was dropped and was succeeded in some instances by the hope that the yacht might not be wrecked before it reached jamaica  the pilot left the summer shelter three of the clergymen shovelled coal four of them served as deck hands and two others ran around as assistant cooks and stewards mr portman and mr burdette lent their hands to things which were not at all in their line of duty mrs cliff and willy pared the vegetables and cooked without ever thinking of stopping to fan themselves while captain burke flew around like halfadozen men with a good word for everybody and a hand to help wherever needed it was truly a jolly voyage from nassau to kingston  the new crew was divided into messes and mrs cliff insisted that they should come to the table in the saloon no matter how they looked or what they had been doing on her vessel a coalheaver off duty was as good as a captainwhile the clergymen goodhumoredly endeavored to preserve the relative lowliness of their positions each actuated by a zealous desire to show what a good deck hand or steward he could make when circumstances demanded it  working hard laughing much eating most heartily and sleeping well the busy and hilarious little party on board the summer shelter steamed into the harbor of kingston after a much shorter voyage than is generally made from nassau to that port  if i could get a crew of jolly parsons cried captain burke and could give them a months training on board this yacht id rather have them than any crew that could be got together from cape horn to the north pole  and by the time you had made able seamen of them said mr burdette who was of a conventional turn of mind theyd all go back to their pulpits and preach  and preach better said mr litchfield who was standing by yes sir i believe they would all preach better  when the anchor was dropped not quite so promptly as it would have been done if the clerical crew had had any previous practice in this operation mr burke was about to give orders to lower a boatfor he was anxious to get on shore as soon as possiblewhen he perceived a large boat rowed by six men and with a man in the stern rapidly approaching the yacht if they were port officials he thought they were extremely prompt but he soon saw that the man in the stern who stood up and waved a handkerchief was his old friend shirley  he must have been watching for us said captain burke to mrs cliff and he put out from one of the wharves as soon as we hove in sight shirley is a good fellow you can trust to him to look out for his friends  in a very short time the six powerful negro oarsmen had shirleys boat alongside and in a few seconds after that he stood upon the deck of the summer shelter burke was about to spring forward to greet his old comrade but he stepped back to give way to mrs cliff who seized the hand of shirley and bade him a most hearty welcome although had she met him by herself elsewhere she would not have recognized him in the neat travelling suit which he now wore  shirley was delighted to meet burke and mrs cliff he expressed pleasure in making the acquaintance of miss croup who standing by mrs cliffs side was quickly introduced and he looked with astonishment at the body of queerlooking men who were gathered on the deck and who appeared to be the crew of the yacht but he wasted no time in friendly greetings nor in asking questions but quickly informed burke that they were all too late and that the dunkery beacon had sailed two days before  and werent you here to board her cried burke  no said shirley our steamer didnt arrive until last night  burke and mrs cliff looked at each other in dismay tears began to come into willy croups eyes as they nearly always did when anything unusual suddenly happened and all the members of the synod together with mr portman and mr burdette and even the two engineers who had come up from below pressed close around shirley eager to hear what next should be said  everybody on board had been informed during the trip from nassau of the errand of the yacht for mrs cliff thought she would be treating those generous and kindhearted clergymen very badly if she did not let them know the nature of the good work in which they were engaged and so it had happened that everybody who had sailed from nassau on the yacht had hopedmore than that had even expectedfor the dunkery beacon was known to be a very slow steamerto find her in the harbor of kingston taking on goods or perhaps coaling and now all knew that even shirley had been too late  this is dreadful exclaimed mrs cliff who was almost on the point of imitating willy in the matter of tears and they havent any idea of course of the dangers which await them  i dont see how they could know said shirley for of course if they had known they wouldnt have sailed  did you hear anything about her asked burke was she all right when she arrived  i have no doubt of that was the answer i made inquiries last night about the people who would most likely be consignees here and this morning i went to a house on harbor streetbeaver  hughes this house in a way is the jamaica agent of the owners i got there before the office was open but i didnt find out much she delivered some cargo to them and had sailed on time  by george cried burke captain horn was right they could hardly get a chance to safely interfere with her until she had sailed from kingston and now i bet they are waiting for her outside the caribbees  thats just what i thought said shirley but of course i didnt say anything to these people and i soon found out they didnt know much except so far as their own business was concerned its pretty certain from what i have heard that she didnt find any letters here that would make her change her course or do anything out of the waybut i did find something while i was talking with one of the heads of the house the mail from new york which had come over in my steamer too late to be delivered the night before was brought in and one of the letters was a cable message from london to new york to be forwarded by mail to jamaica and it was directed to captain hagar of the dunkery beacon care of beaver  hughes as i had been asking about the steamer beaver or hughes whichever it was mentioned the message i told him on the spot that i thought it was his duty to open it for i was very sure it was on important business he considered for a while saying that perhaps the proper thing was to send it on after captain hagar by mail but when he had thought about it a little he said perhaps he had better open it and he did the words were just these  on no account leave kingston harbor until further ordersblackburn blackburn is the head owner  what did you say then asked mrs cliff very earnestly and what did he say  i didnt say anything about her being a treasure ship replied shirley if it was not known in jamaica that she was carrying that gold i wasnt going to tell it for there are as many blackhearted scoundrels here as in any other part of the world but i told the beaver  hughes people that i also had a message for captain hagar and that a friend of mine was coming to kingston in a yacht and that if he arrived soon i hadnt a doubt that we could overhaul the dunkery beacon and give the captain my message and the one from london besides and that wed try to do it for it was very important but they didnt know me and they said they would wait until my friends yacht should arrive and then they would see about sending the message to captain hagar now ive done enough talking and we must do something  what do you think we ought to do asked burke  well i say answered shirley if you have any passengers to put ashore here put them ashore and then lets go after the dunkery beacon and deliver the message a stern chase is a long chase but if im to judge by the way this yacht caught up to the antonina and passed her i believe theres a good chance of overhauling the dunkery beacon before the pirates get hold of her then all shes got to do is to steam back to kingston  but suppose the pirates come before she gets back said mrs cliff  well they wont fool with her if she is in company replied shirley now and what do you say he asked addressing burke but glancing around at the others i dont know how this ships company is made up or how long a stop you are thinking of making here or anything about it but youre the owner mrs cliff and if you lend burke and me your yacht i reckon hell be ready enough to steam after the dunkery beacon and deliver the messages its a thing which captain horn has set his heart upon and its a thing which ought to be done if it can be done and this yacht i believe is the vessel that can do it  during this speech mr burke generally so eager to speak and to act had stood silent and troubled he agreed with shirley that the thing to do was to go after the dunkery beacon at the best speed the yacht could make he did not believe that mrs cliff would object to his sailing away with her yacht on this most important errandbut he remembered that he had no crew these parsons must be put off at kingston and although he had had no doubt whatever that he could get a crew in this port he had expected to have a week and perhaps more in which to do it to collect in an hour or two a crew which he could trust with the knowledge which would most likely come to them in some way or other that the steamer they were chasing carried untold wealth was hardly to be thought of  as far as i am concerned cried mrs cliff my yacht may go after that steamer just as soon as she can be started away  and what do you say burke exclaimed shirley  burke did not answer he was trying to decide whether or not he and shirley with burdette and portman and the two engineers could work the yacht but before he had even a chance to speak mr hodgson stepped forward and exclaimed  ill stick to the yacht until she has accomplished her business id just as soon make my vacation a week longer as not i can cut it off somewhere else if you are thinking about your crew captain i want to say that so far as i am concerned i am one volunteer  and i am another said mr litchfield now that i know how absolutely essential it is that the dunkery beacon should be overtaken i would not for a moment even consider the surrender of my position upon this vessel which i assure you madam i consider as an honor  mr shirley stared in amazement at the speaker what sort of a seaman was this his face and hands were dirty but he had been shovelling coal but such speech shirley had never heard from mariners lips the rest of the crew seemed very odd and now he noticed for the first time that although many of them were in their shirt sleeves nearly all wore black trousers he could not understand it  mr litchfield sir said a large heavy man with a nose burned very red a travelling cap upon his head and wearing a stiffly starched shirt which had once been white no collar and a waistcoat cut very straight in front now opened but intended to be buttoned up very high i believe mr litchfield has voiced the sentiments of us all as he was speaking i looked from one brother to another and i think i am right  you are right cried every one of the sturdy fellows who had so recently stepped from synod to yacht  i knew it exultingly exclaimed the speaker i felt it in my heart of hearts madam and captain knowing what we do we are not the men to desert you when it is found necessary to continue the voyage for a little  and what would happen to us if we did leave the yacht said another we might simply have to remain at kingston until you returned oh no we wouldnt think of it  burke said shirley in a low tone who are these people  cant tell you now said burke his eyes glistening you might tumble overboard backwards if i did gentlemen he cried turning to his crew youre a royal lot and if any of you ever ask me to stand by you ill do it while theres breath in my body and now madam said he his doubt and perplexity gone and his face animated by the necessity of immediate action i cant now say anything about your kindness in lending us your yacht but if you and miss croup want to go ashore here is a boat alongside  go ashore screamed mrs cliff what are you talking about if anybody stays on this yacht i do i wouldnt think of such a thing as going ashore  nor i cried willy whats got into your head mr burkedo you intend to go without eating  ladies cried burke you are truly trumps and thats all ive got to say and well get out of this harbor just as fast as we can  look here cried shirley running after burke to the captains room ive got to go ashore again and get that cable message we must have authority to turn that steamer back if we overhaul her and ive got to have somebody to go with me but before we do anything you must take time to tell me who these queerlooking customers are that youve got on board  burke shut the door of his room and in as few words as possible he explained how some of the members of the recent synod happened to be acting as crew of the yacht shirley was a quiet and rather a sedate man but when he heard this tale he dropped into a chair leaned back stretched out his legs and laughed until his voice failed him  oh its all funny enough said burke almost as merry as his friend but theyre good ones i can tell you that you couldnt get together a better set of landsmen and i tell you what ill do if you want anybody to go with you to certify that you are all right ill send a couple of parsons  just what i want cried shirley  burke quickly stepped out on deck and calling the mate mr burdette he said i want you to detail the reverend charles attlebury and reverend mr gillingham to go ashore with mr shirley tell them to put on their parsons toggery long coats high hats and white cravats and let each man take with him the address of his church on a card they are to certify to mr shirley tell them to step round livelywe have no time to lose  soon after the boat with shirley and the clergymen had pulled away from the yacht two of the clerical crew came to mrs cliff and told her that they were very sorry indeed to say that having consulted the sailingmaster and having been told by him that it was not at all probable that the yacht would be able to return to kingston in a week they had been forced to the conclusion that they would not be able to offer her their services during the voyage she was about to make important affairs at home would make it impossible for them to prolong their most delightful vacation and as they had been informed that the antonina would return to new york in a few days it would be advisable for them to leave the yacht and take passage to new york in her they felt however that this apparent desertion would be of less importance than it would have been if it had occurred in the port of nassau because now the crew would have the assistance of mr shirley who was certainly worth more than both of them together  when burke heard this he said to mrs cliff that he was not sure but what the parsons were quite correct and although everybody was sorry to lose two members of the party it could not be helped and all who had letters to send to new york went to work to scribble them as fast as they could mrs cliff also wrote a note to captain horn informing him of the state of affairs and of their reasons for not waiting for him and this the departing clergymen undertook to leave with beaver  hughes where captain horn would be sure to call  when shirley reached the countinghouse of beaver  hughes he found that it was a great advantage to be backed up by a pair of reverend clergymen who had come to kingston in a handsome yacht the message for captain hagar was delivered without hesitation and the best wishes were expressed that they might be able to overtake the dunkery beacon  her course will be south of tobago island said mr beaver and then if your yacht is the vessel you say it is i should say you ought to overtake her before she gets very far down the coast i dont know that captain hagar will turn back when he gets this message having gone so far but of course if it is important i am glad there is a vessel here to take it to him  what sort of a looking vessel is the dunkery beacon asked shirley  she is about two thousand tons said the other has two masts which do not rake much and her funnel is painted black and white the stripes running up and down there are three steamers on the line and all their funnels are painted that way  well be apt to know her when we see her said shirley and with a hurried leave he and his companions hastened back to the wharves  but on the way a thought struck shirley and he determined to take time to go to the postoffice there might be something for him and he had not thought of it before there he found a telegraphic message addressed to him and sent from vera cruz to new york and thence forwarded by mail it was from captain horn and was as long as an ordinary business note and informed shirley that the captain expected to be in jamaica not long after this message reached kingston there was no regular steamer which would reach there in good time but he had chartered a steamer the monterey which was then being made ready for sea as rapidly as possible and would probably clear for kingston in a few days it urged shirley not to fail to keep the dunkery beacon in port until he arrived  shirley stood speechless for some minutes after he had read this message this telegram had come with him on the antonina from new york what a fool he had been not to think sooner of the postofficebut what difference would it have made what could he have done that he had not done if the captain sailed in a few days from the time he sent the message he would be here very soon for the distance between kingston and vera cruz was less than that from new york the captain must have counted on shirley reaching jamaica very much sooner than he really did arrive puzzled annoyed and disgusted with himself shirley explained the message to his companions and they all hastened back to the yacht there a brief but very hurried consultation was held in which nearly everybody joined the question to be decided was should they wait for captain horn  a great deal was said in a very short time and in the midst of the confused opinions mrs cliff spoke out loudly and clearly it is my opinion said she that we should not stop if fitting out a steamer is like fitting out anything else in this world that i know of it is almost certain to take more time than people expect it to take if captain horn telegraphed to us this minute i believe he would tell us to go after that ship with the gold on board just as fast as we can and tell them to turn back  this speech was received with favor by all who heard it and without a word in answer to mrs cliff captain burke told mr burdette that they would clear for a cruise and get away just as soon as they could do it  when the yacht had been made ready to start the two clergymen descended into the boat which was waiting alongside and the summer shelter steamed out of the harbor of kingston and headed away for tobago island     chapter xxv  a note for captain burke   notwithstanding the fact that the summer shelter made very good time that she had coaled at nassau and was therefore ready for an extended cruise it was impossible for any of those on board of her to conceal from themselves the very strong improbability of sighting the dunkery beacon after she had got out upon the wide atlantic and that she would pass the comparatively narrow channel south of tobago island before the yacht reached it was almost a foregone conclusion  mr burke assured mrs cliff and his passengers that although their chase after the steamer might reasonably suggest a needle and a haystack still if the dunkery beacon kept down the coast in as straight a line as she could for cape st roque and if the summer shelter also kept the same line and if the yacht steamed a great deal faster than the other vessel it stood to reason that it could not be very long before the summer shelter overhauled the dunkery beacon  but those who consulted with mr portman were not so well encouraged as those who pinned their faith upon the captain the sailingmaster had very strong doubts about ever sighting the steamer that had sailed away two days before they left kingston the ocean being so very large and any steamer being so very small comparatively if they did not pass her miles out of sight and if they never caught up to her he would not be in the least surprised  four days had passed since they left kingston when burke and shirley stood together upon the deck scanning the horizon with a glass dont you think it begins to look like a wild goose chase said the latter  burke thrust his hands into the pockets of his jacket  yes said he it does look like that i did believe that we were going to overhaul her before she got outside the caribbees but she must be a faster vessel than i thought she was  i dont believe shes fast at all said shirley shes had two days start and thats enough to spoil our business im afraid  but well keep on said burke were not going to turn back until our coal bunkers tell us weve got to do it  steamers they saw sometimes two in an hoursailingvessels were sighted near by or far awayschooners ships or brigs and these were steaming and sailing this way and that but never did they see a steamer with a single funnel painted black and white with the stripes running up and down  it was very early next morning after the conversation between burke and shirley that the latter saw a long line of smoke just above the horizon which he thought might give him reason for looking out for the steamer of which they were in quest but when he got his glass and the masts appeared above the horizon he saw that this vessel was heading eastward perhaps a little northeast and therefore was not likely to be the dunkery beacon but in half an hour his glass showed him that there were stripes on the funnel of this steamer which ran up and down and in a moment burke was called and was soon at his side  i believe thats the dunkery cried the captain with the glass to his eye but shes on the wrong course it wont take us long to overhaul her well head the yacht a few points to the east dont say anything to anybodywe dont want to disappoint them  oh we can overhaul her said shirley who now had the glass for it isnt a stern chase by any means  in less than half an hour everybody on board the summer shelter knew that the large steamer which they could plainly see on the rolling waves to the south must be the dunkery beacon unless indeed they should find that this was one of her sister ships coming north there was great excitement on board the yacht the breakfast which was in course of preparation was almost entirely forgotten by those who had it in charge and everybody who could possibly leave duty crowded to the rail peering across the waves to the southward it was not long before shirley who had the best eyes on board declared that he could read with his glass the name dunkery beacon on the port bow  thats not where we ought to see it cried burke we ought to see it on the stern but weve got her boysand then he remembered himself and addedladies and now lets give three good cheers  three rousing cheers were given by all on board with such goodwill that they would have been heard on the other steamer had not the wind been pretty strong from the west  the summer shelter gained upon the larger vessel and burke now ran up signals for her to lay to as he wished to speak with her to these signals however the dunkery paid no immediate attention keeping steadily on although altering her course towards the southeast  what does that mean mr shirley asked mrs cliff mr burke wants her to stop doesnt he  yes said shirley that is what the signal is for  but she doesnt stop said mrs cliff do you think there is any chance of her not stopping at all  cant say madam he answered but shes got good reason for keeping on her way a vessel with all that treasure on board could hardly be expected to lay to because a strange vessel that she knows nothing about asked her to shut off steam  that seems to me very reasonable indeed said mr litchfield who was standing by but it would be very bad fortune if after all the trouble and anxiety you have had in overtaking this vessel she should decline to stop and hear the news we have to tell  there was a strong breeze and a good deal of sea but burke determined to get near enough to hail the dunkery beacon and speak to her so he got round on her weather quarter and easily overtaking her he brought the summer shelter as near to the other vessel as he considered it safe to do then he hailed her dunkery beacon ahoy is that captain hagar  the wind was too strong for the captain of the other vessel to answer through his trumpet but he signalled assent then burke informed him that he wished him to lay to in order that he might send a boat on board that he had very important orders to captain hagar from his owners and that he had followed him from jamaica in order to deliver them for some time there was no answer whatever to these loudly bellowed remarks and the two vessels kept on side by side  anyway said burke to mr burdette she can see that were a lot faster than she is and that she cant get away from us  it may be that shes afraid of us said the mate and thinks were one of the pirates  that cant be said burke for she doesnt know anything about the pirates ill hail her again and tell her what we are and what our business is i think it wont be long before she lays to just to see what we want  sure enough in less than fifteen minutes the dunkery beacon signalled that she would lay to and before long the two vessels their engines stopped and their heads to the wind lay rising and falling on the waves and near enough to speak to each other  now then what do you want shouted the captain of the dunkery  i want to send a boat aboard with an important message from blackburn  after a few minutes the answer came send a boat  orders were given to lower one of the yachts boats and it was agreed that shirley ought to be the man to go over to the dunkery beacon who do you want to go with you asked burke  nobody but the boats crew he answered i can explain things better by myself captain hagar seems to be an obstinate fellow and it wont be easy to turn him back on his course but if i want anybody to stand by me and back me up in what i say you might let some of the clergymen come over he might believe them and wouldnt me but ill talk to him first by myself  every member of the synod declared that he was perfectly willing to go to the other vessel if he should be needed and mrs cliff assured burke that if she could be of any good in making the captain of the dunkery beacon understand that he ought to turn back she would be perfectly willing to be rowed over to his vessel  i dont think it will be necessary to put a lady into a boat on such a sea as this said burke but when he hears what shirley has to tell him that captain will most likely be glad enough to turn back  captain burke was afraid to trust any of his clerical crew to row a ships boat on such a heavy sea and although he would be perfectly willing to go himself as one of the oarsmen he would not leave the yacht so long as mrs cliff was on board but mr burdette the sailingmaster and the assistant engineer volunteered as crew of the boat while shirley himself pulled an oar  when the boat reached the dunkery beacon shirley was soon on board while the three men in the boat holding to a line which had been thrown them kept their little craft from bumping against the side of the big steamer by pushing her off with their oars on board the summer shelter everybody stood and gazed over the rail staring at the other steamer as if they could hear with their eyes what was being said on board of her after waiting about twenty minutes a note was passed down to the men in the boat who pushed off and rowed back with it to the summer shelter  the note which captain burke opened and read as soon as he could lay hold of it ran as follows       to captain burke of the summer shelter       its my opinion that youre trying to play a beastly trick on me      it isnt like my owners to send a message to me off the coast of      south america if they wanted to send me a message it would have      been waiting for me at kingston i dont know what sort of a trick      you are trying to play on me but you cant do it i know my      duties and im going to keep on to my port and whats more im      not going to send back the man you sent aboard of me ill take him      with me to rio janeiro and hand him over to the authorities      theyll know what to do with him but i dont intend to send him      back to report to you whatever he was sent aboard my vessel to find      out       i dont know how you came to think i had treasure on board but      its none of your business anyway you must think im a fool to      turn back to kingston because you tell me to anybody can write a      telegram so im going to get under way and you can steam back to      kingston or wherever you came from         captain hagar  captain burke had hardly finished reading this extraordinary letter when he heard a cry from the boat lying by the side of the yacht in which the three men were waiting expecting to go back to the other vessel with an answer hello cried mr burdette shes getting under way that steamers off  and at this a shout arose from everybody on board the summer shelter the propeller of the dunkery beacon was stirring the water at her stern and she was moving away her bow turned southward burke leaned over the rail shouted to his men to get on board and haul up the boat and then he gave orders to go ahead full speed  what does all this mean cried mrs cliff whats in that letter mr burke are they running away with mr shirley  thats what it looks like he cried but heres the letter you can all read it for yourselves and with that he dashed away to take charge of his vessel  all now was wild excitement on board the summer shelter but what was to be done or with what intention they were pursuing the dunkery beacon and rapidly gaining upon her no one could say not even captain burke himself the yacht was keeping on the weather quarter of the other vessel and when she was near enough he began again to yell at her through his speakingtrumpet but no answer or signal came back and everybody on board the larger vessel seemed to be attending to his duties as if nothing had happened while mr shirley was not visible  while the captain was roaring himself red in the face both mrs cliff and willy croup were crying and the face of each clergyman showed great anxiety and trouble presently mrs cliff was approached by the reverend mr arbuckle the oldest of the members of the late synod who had shipped with her  this is a most unfortunate and totally unexpected outcome of our expedition said he if mr shirley is taken to rio janeiro and charges made against him his case may be very serious but i cannot see what we are to do dont you believe it would be well to call a consultation of those on board  mrs cliff wiped her eyes and said they ought to consult if anything could be done it should be done immediately  captain burke put the yacht in charge of the mate and came aft where five of the clergymen the sailingmaster and mrs cliff and willy were gathered together im willing to hold council said he but at this minute i cant give any advice as to what ought to be done the only thing i can say is that i dont want to desert shirley if i could do it i would board that vessel and take him off but i dont see my way clear to that just yet im not owner of this yacht but if mrs cliff will give the word ill follow that steamer to rio janeiro and if shirley is put on shore and charges made against him ill be there to stand by him  of course we will not desert mr shirley cried mrs cliff this yacht shall follow that vessel until we can take him on board again i cant feel it in my heart gentlemen to say to you that im willing to turn back and take you home if you want to go it may be very hard to keep you longer but it will be a great deal harder if we are to let the captain of that ship take poor mr shirley to rio janeiro and put him into prison with nobody to say a word for him  madam said mr arbuckle i beg that you will not speak of the question of an immediate return on our account this is in every way a most unfortunate affair but we all see what ought to be done what it is our duty to do and we will do it can you give me an idea mr portman of the length of time it would probably require for us to reach rio janeiro  i think this yacht could get there in a week said the sailingmaster but if were to keep company with that hulk over there it will take us ten days we may have trouble about coal but if we have good winds like these we can keep up with the dunkery beacon with half steam and our sails  mr litchfield said mrs cliff the captain is up in the pilot house i cant climb up there but wont you go and tell him that i say that we must stand by mr shirley no matter what happens nor where we have to go to     chapter xxvi  well stick to shirley   when night began to fall the dunkery beacon was still keeping on her coursea little too much to the eastward mr portman thoughtand the summer shelter was still accompanying her almost abreast and less than half a mile away during the day it had been seldom that the glasses of the yacht had not been directed upon the deck of the larger vessel several times mr shirley had been seen on the main deck and he had frequently waved his hat it was encouraging to know that their friend was in good condition but there were many hearts on board the summer shelter which grew heavier and heavier as the night came on  burke and burdette stood together in the pilot house suppose she gets away from us in the night said the mate  i dont intend to let her do it replied his captain even if she douses every glim on board ill keep her in sight it will be starlight and im not afraid with a vessel as easily managed as this yacht to lie pretty close to her  then theres another thing said burdette  youre thinking they may get rid of him asked burke  yes said the other i was thinking of that  the captain did not reply immediately that came across my mind too said he but its all nonsense in the first place they havent got any reason for wanting to get rid of him that way and besides they know that if they went into rio janeiro without shirley we could make it very hot for them  but hes a queer onethat captain hagar said burdette what was he doing on that easterly course i think hes a scaly customer thats what i think  cant say anything about that answered burke but one thing i knowim going to stick to him like a thrasher to a whale  very early the next morning mr hodgson came aft where captain burke was standing with the sailingmaster sir said he i am a clergyman and a man of peace but i declare sir that i do not think any one no matter what his profession should feel himself called upon to submit to the outrageous conduct of the captain of that vessel is there no way in which we could approach her and make fast to her and then boldly press our way on board in spite of objection or resistance and by force if it should be necessary bring away mr shirley whose misfortune has made us all feel as if he were not only our friend but our brother then sir i should let that vessel go on to destruction if she chooses to go  burke shook his head you may be sure if i considered it safe to run the two vessels together i would have been on board that craft long ago but we couldnt do itcertainly not with mrs cliff on the yacht  no indeed added mr portman nobody knows what damage they might do us for my part i havent any faith in that vessel i believe shes no better than a pirate herself  hold on exclaimed burke dont talk like that it wouldnt do for the women to get any such notions into their heads  but it is in your head isnt it sir said mr hodgson  yes said burke something of the sort i dont mind saying that to you  and i will also say to you replied the young clergyman that we talked it over last night and we all agreed that the actions of the dunkery beacon are very suspicious it does not seem at all unlikely that the great treasure she carries has been too much of a temptation for the captain and that she is trying to get away with it  of course i dont know anything about that captain said burke or what he is after but im pretty sure that he wont dare to do anything to shirley as long as i keep him in sight and now im going to bear down on him again to hail him  the summer shelter bore down upon the other steamer and her captain hailed and hailed for half an hour but no answer came from the dunkery beacon  willy croup was so troubled by what had happened and even more by what was not happeningfor she could not see any good which might come out of this persistent following of the one vessel by the otherthat her nerves disordered and tangled themselves to such a degree that she was scarcely able to cook  but mrs cliff kept up a strong heart she felt that a great deal depended upon her at any moment an emergency might arise when she would be called upon as owner of the yacht to decide what should be done she hoped very earnestly that if the captain of the dunkery beacon saw that the summer shelter was determined to follow him wherever he went and whatever he might do he would at last get tired of being nagged in that way and consent to give up mr shirley  about eight oclock in the morning all belief in the minds of the men on board the yacht that the dunkery beacon intended to sail to rio janeiro entirely disappeared for that steamer changed her course to one considerably north of east a little after that a steamer was seen on the horizon to the north and she was bearing southward in the course of half an hour it seemed as if this new steamer was not only likely to run across the course of the dunkery beacon but was trying to do it  captain exclaimed mrs cliff grasping burke by the arm dont you think it looks very much as if that captain hagar was trying to run away with the treasure which has been entrusted to him  i didnt intend to say anything to you about that he replied but it looks like it most decidedly  if that should be the case said mrs cliff dont you think mr shirleys situation is very dangerous  nobody knows anything about that madam said he but until we get him back on this yacht ill stick to her  burke could not make out the newcomer very well but he knew her to be a mediterranean steamer she was of moderate size and making good headway i havent the least bit of a doubt said he to burdette that thats the pirate vessel from genoa  i shouldnt wonder if youre right said the mate taking the glass i think i can see a lot of heads in her bow and now i wonder what is going to happen next  that nobody knows said burke but if i had shirley on board here id steam away and let them have it out we have done all were called upon to do to keep those peruvian fools from losing that cargo of gold  the strange vessel drew nearer and nearer to the dunkery beacon and the two steamers much to the amazement of the watchers on the yacht now lay to and seemed prepared to hail each other they did hail and after a short time a boat was lowered from the stranger and pulled to the dunkery beacon there were but few men in the boat although there were many heads on the decks from which they had come  this beats me ejaculated burke they seem willing enough to lay to for her  it looks to me said mr burdette as if she wanted to be captured  id like to know said the captain whats the meaning of that queer bit of blotched bunting thats been run up on the dunkery  cant tell said the other but theres another one like it on the other steamer  my friends said mr arbuckle standing in a group of his fellowclergymen on the main deck it is my earnest opinion that those two ships are accomplices in a great crime  if that be so said another we are here in the position of utterly helpless witnesses but we should not allow ourselves to look on this business from one point of view only it may be that the intentions of that recently arrived vessel are perfectly honorable she may bring later orders from the owners of the dunkery beacon and bring them too with more authority than did mr shirley who after all was only a volunteer  the yacht was lying to and at this moment the lookout announced a sail on the starboard quarter glancing in that direction nearly everybody could see that another steamer her hull well up in view was coming down from the north  by george cried burke most likely thats another of the pirates  and if it is said his mate i think well have to trust to our heels  burke answered quietly yes well do that when weve got shirley on board or when its dead sure we cant get him  the people from the mediterranean steamer did not remain on board the dunkery beacon more than half an hour and when they returned to their vessel she immediately started her engines and began to move away making a short circuit she turned and steamed in the direction of the distant vessel approaching from the northward  there cried burke that steamer off there is another of the pirates and these scoundrels here are going to meet her theyve got the whole thing cut and dried and ill bet my head that the dunkery beacon will cruise around here until theyre ready to come down and do what they please with her  the actions of the treasure ship now seemed to indicate that mr burke was correct in his surmises she steamed away slowly towards the south and then making a wide sweep she steered northward directing her course toward the yacht as if she would speak with it     chapter xxvii  on board the dunkery beacon   when edward shirley stepped on board the big steamer which he had so earnestly and anxiously followed from kingston and was received by her captain it did not take him long to form the opinion that captain hagar belonged to a disagreeable class of mariners he was gruff curt and wanted to know in the shortest space of time why in the name of his satanic majesty he had been asked to lay to and what message that yacht had for him  shirley asked for a private interview and when they were in the captains room he put the whole matter into as few words as possible showed the cablegram from blackburn and also exhibited his message from captain horn the other scrutinized the papers very carefully asked many questions but made few remarks in regard to his own opinion or intentions  when he had heard all that shirley had to tell him and had listened to some very earnest advice that he should immediately turn back to kingston or at least run into georgetown where he might safely lie in harbor until measures had been taken for the safe conveyance of the treasure to peru the captain of the dunkery beacon arose and asking shirley to remain where he was until he should go and consult with his first mate he went out closing the door of the room behind him  during this absence he did not see the first mate but he went to a room where there was pen ink and paper and there he wrote a note to captain burke of the summer shelter which note as soon as he had signed it he gave to the men in the small boat waiting alongside telling them that it was from their mate who had come on board and that he wanted an answer just as soon as possible  mr burdette mr portman and the assistant engineer having no reason whatever to suspect treachery under circumstances like these immediately rowed back to the summer shelter and as we already know it was not long before the dunkery beacon was steaming away from the yacht  the moment that shirley who was getting a little tired of waiting felt the movement of the engines he sprang to the door but found it locked now he began to kick but in a very few moments the captain appeared  you neednt make a row said he nobodys going to hurt you i have sent a note to your skipper telling him im going to keep you on board a little while until i can consider this matter my duty to my owners wouldnt allow me to be alayin to herebut ill think over the business and do what i consider right but ive got to keep on my courseive got no right to lose time whether this is all a piece of foolin or not  theres no fooling about it said shirley warmly if you dont turn back you will be very likely to lose a good deal more than time you may lose everything on board and your lives too for all you know  the captain laughed pirates said he what stuff there are no pirates in these days and then he laughed again well i cant talk any more now said he but ill keep your business in my mind and settle it pretty soon then you can go back and tell your people what ill do you had better go on deck and make yourself comfortable if youll take my advice you wont do any talking the people on this vessel dont know what she carries and i dont want them to know so if i see you talking to anybody ill consider that you want to make troubleand i can tell you if some of these people on board knew what was in them boxes in the hold there would be the worst kind of trouble you can bet your head on that so you can go on and show yourself your friends wont be worried about youive explained it all to them in my note  when shirley went on deck he was very much pleased to see that the summer shelter was not far away and was steaming close after the larger vessel he waved his hat and then he turned to look about him there seemed to be a good many men on the steamer a very large crew in fact and after noticing the number of sailors who were at work not far away from him shirley came to the conclusion that there were more reasons than one why he would not hold conversation with them  from their speech he thought that they must all be foreignersfrench or italians he could scarcely tell which it did not seem to him that these belonged to the class of seamen which a careful captain of a british merchantman would wish to ship when carrying a cargo of treasure to a distant land but then all sorts of crews were picked up in english ports her captain in fact surprised shirley more than did the seamen he had noticed this captain must of course be an englishman for the house of blackburn brothers would not be likely to trust one of their vessels and such an important one to the charge of any one but an englishman but he had a somewhat foreign look about him his eyes and hair were very black and there was a certain peculiarity in his pronunciation that made shirley think at first that he might be a welshman  while shirley was considering these matters the summer shelter was rapidly gaining on the other steamer and was now alongside and within hailing distance and burke was on the bridge with a trumpet in his hand at this moment shirley was accosted by the captain ive got something to say to you said he step in my room perhaps we can give your friend an answer at once  illustration when shirley went on deck he was much pleased to see the summer shelter  shirley followed the other the door was shut and the captain of the dunkery beacon began to tell how extremely injudicious it would be in his opinion to turn back for if pirates really were following himalthough he did not believe a word of ithe might run right into their teeth whereas by keeping on his course he would most likely sail away from them and when he reached rio janeiro he could make arrangements there for some sort of a convoy or whatever else was considered necessary  ill go and hail my skipper said shirley if youll let me have a speakingtrumpet  no said the other i dont want you to do that i dont mind tellin you that i dont trust you ive got very heavy responsibility on me and i dont know who you are no more than if you was a porpoise come abouncin up out of the sea i dont want you and your skipper holdin no conversation with each other until ive got this matter settled to my satisfaction and then i can put you on board your vessel and go ahead on my course or i can turn back just whichever i make up my mind to do but until i make up my mind i dont want no reports made from this vessel to any other and no matter what you say when you are hailin how do i know what you mean and what sort of signals youve agreed on between you  shirley was obliged to accept the situation and when burke had ceased to hail he was allowed to go on deck then after waving his hat to the yachtwhich was now at a considerable distance although within easy range of a glassshirley lighted his pipe and walked up and down the deck he saw a good many things to interest him but he spoke to no one and endeavored to assume the demeanor of one who was much interested in his own affairs and very little in what was going on about him  but shirley noticed a great many things which made a deep impression upon him the crew seemed to be composed of men not very well disciplined but exceedingly talkative and although shirley did not understand french he was now pretty sure that all the conversation he heard was in that tongue then again the men did not appear to be very well acquainted with the vesselthey frequently seemed to be looking for things the position of which they should have known he could not understand how men who had sailed on a vessel from southampton should show such a spirit of inquiry in regard to the internal arrangements of the steamer a boatswain who was giving the orders to a number of men seemed more as if he were instructing a class in the nautical management of a vessel than in giving the ordinary everyday orders which might be expected on such a voyage as this once he saw the captain come on deck with a book in his hand apparently a logbook and he showed it to one of the mates these two stood turning over the leaves of the book as if they had never seen it before and wanted to find something which they supposed to be in it  it was not long after this that shirley said to himself that he could not understand how such a vessel with such a cargo could have been sent out from southampton in charge of such a captain and such a crew as this and then almost immediately the idea came to him in a flash that perhaps this was not the crew with which the dunkery beacon had sailed now he seemed to see the whole state of affairs as if it had been printed on paper the dunkery beacon had been captured by one of the pirates probably not long after she got outside the caribbees and that instead of trying to take the treasure on board their own vessel the scoundrels had rid the dunkery of her captain and crew and had taken possession of the steamer and everything in it this would explain her course when she was first sighted from the yacht she was not going at all to rio janeiroshe was on her way across the atlantic  now everything that he had seen and everything that he had heard confirmed this new belief of course the pirate captain did not wish to lay to when he was first hailed and he probably did so at last simply because he found he need not be afraid of the yacht and that he could not rid himself of her unless he stopped to see what she wanted of course this fellow would not have him go back to the yacht and make a report of course this crew did not understand how things were placed and stored on board the vessel for they themselves had been on board of her but a very short time the captain spoke english but he was not an englishman  shirley saw plainer and plainer every second that the dunkery beacon had been captured by pirates that probably not a man of her former crew was on board and that he was here a prisoner in the hands of these wretchescutthroats for all he knew and yet he did not reproach himself for having run into such a trap he had done the proper thing in a proper orderly and seamanlike way he had had the most unexpected bad luck but he did not in the least see any reason to blame himself  he saw however a great deal of reason to fear for himself especially as the evening drew on that blackheaded villain of a captain did not want him on board and while he might not care to toss him into the sea in view of a vessel which was fast enough to follow him wherever he might go there was no reason why he should not do what he pleased if under cover of the night he got away from that vessel  the fact that he was allowed to go where he pleased and see what he pleased gave much uneasiness to shirley it looked to him as if they did not care what he might say hear or see for the reason that it was not intended that he should have an opportunity of making reports of any sort shirley had his supper to himself and the captain showed him a bunk they cant do much talkin to you he said i had to sail ahead of time and couldnt ship many englishmen  you liar thought shirley you didnt ship any  shirley was a brave man but as he lay awake in his bunk that night cold shivers ran down his back many times if violence were offered to him of course he could not make any defence but he was resolved that if an attack should be made upon him there was one thing he would try to do he had carefully noted the location of the companionways and he had taken off only such clothes as would interfere with swimming if he were attacked he would make a bolt for the upper deck and then overboard if the yacht should be near enough to hear or see him he might have a chance if not he would prefer the ocean to the dunkery beacon and her crew  but the night passed on and he was not molested he did not know down there below decks that all night the summer shelter kept so close to the dunkery beacon that the people in charge of the latter cursed and swore dreadfully at times when the yacht looking bigger and blacker by night than she did by day rose on the waves in their wake so near that it seemed as if a sudden squall might drive the two vessels together  but there was really no reason for any such fear burke had vowed he would stick to shirley and he also stuck to the wheel all night with burdette or the sailingmaster by his side and there was not an hour when somebody either a mariner or a clergyman did not scan the deck of the dunkery beacon with a marine glass  shirley was not allowed to go on deck until quite late the next morning after burke had given up his desperate attempt to communicate with the dunkery beacon and when he did come up and had assured himself at a glance that the summer shelter still hung upon the heels of the larger steamer and had frantically waved his hat the next thing he saw was the small mediterranean steamer which was rapidly coming down from the north while the dunkery beacon was steaming northeast he also noticed that some men near him were running up a queer little flag or signal colored irregularly red and yellow and then he saw upon the approaching steamer a bit of bunting which seemed to resemble the one now floating from the dunkery of course under the circumstances there was nothing for him to believe but that this approaching vessel was one of the pirate ships and that she was coming down not to capture the dunkery beacon but to join her  now matters were getting to be worse and worse and as shirley glanced over at the yachtstill hovering on the weather quarter of the dunkery ready at any time to swoop down and hail her if there should be occasionhe trembled for the fate of his friends to be sure these two pirate vesselsfor sure the dunkery beacon now belonged to that classwere nothing but merchantmen there was no cannon on this steamer and as the other was now near enough for him to see her decks as she rolled to windward there was no reason to suppose that she carried guns if these rascals wished to attack or capture a vessel they must board her but before they could do that they must catch her and he knew well enough that there were few ordinary steamers which could overhaul the summer shelter if it were not for his own most unfortunate position the yacht could steam away in safety and leave these wretches to their own devices but he did not believe that his old friend would desert him more than that there was no reason to suppose that the people on the summer shelter knew that the dunkery beacon was now manned by pirates although it was likely that they would suspect the character of the newcomer  but shirley could only stand and watch and wait once he thought that it might be well for him to jump overboard and strike out to the yacht if he should be seen by his friendsand this he believed would happenand if he should be picked up his report would turn back into safer waters this peaceful pleasure vessel with its two ladies and its seven clergymen if he should be struck by a ball in the back of the head before he got out of gunshot of the dunkerys crew then his friends would most likely see him sink the reason for their remaining in the vicinity of these pirates would be at an end and they might steam northward as fast as they pleased  the strange vessel came on and on and soon showed herself to be a steamer of about nine hundred tons of a model with which shirley was not familiar and a great many men on board the dunkery beacon lay to and it was not long before this stranger had followed her example and had lowered a boat when three or four men from this boat had scrambled to the deck of the dunkery beacon they were gladly welcomed by the blackheaded fellow who had passed himself off as captain hagar and a most animated conversation now took place shirley could not understand anything that was said and he had sense enough not to appear to be trying to do so but no one paid any attention to him nor seemed to care whether he knew what was going on or not  at first the manner of the speakers indicated that they were wildly congratulating each other but very soon it was evident that the summer shelter was the subject of their discourse they all looked over at the yacht some of them even shook their fists at her and although shirley did not understand their language he knew very well that curses loud and savage were pouring over the bulwarks in the direction of his friends and their yacht  then the subject of the conference changed the fellows began to gaze northward a glass was turned in that direction the exclamations became more violent than before and when shirley turned he saw for the first time the other vessel which was coming down from the north this was now far away but she was heading south and it could not be long before she would arrive on the scene  now shirleys heart sank about as far down as it would go he had no doubt that this very vessel was another of the pirates if she carried a gun even if it were not a heavy one he might as well bid goodbye to the summer shelter the pirates would not allow her to go to any port to tell her tale  the noisy conference now broke up the boat with its crew returned to the other vessel which almost immediately started turned and steamed away to the north in the direction of the approaching steamer this settled the matter she was off to join her pirate consort now the dunkery beacon started her engines and steamed slowly in the direction of the yacht as if she wished to hail her shirleys heart rose a little if there was to be a parley perhaps the pirates had decided to warn the yacht to stop meddling and to take herself away and if by any happy fortune it should be decided to send him to his friends he would implore them with all his heart and soul to take the advice without the loss of a second     chapter xxviii  the people on the monterey   the vessel which had last appeared upon the scene and which was now steaming down towards the dunkery beacon and the summer shelter while the small steamer from the mediterranean was making her way northward to meet her was the monterey of vera cruz and carried captain philip horn and his wife edna  as soon as captain horn had heard of the danger which threatened the treasure which was on its way from london to the peruvian governmenttreasure which had cost him such toil anxiety and suffering and in the final just disposition of which he felt the deepest interest and even responsibilityalthough in fact the care and charge of which had passed entirely out of his handshe determined not only to write to shirley to go to jamaica but to go there himself without loss of time believing from what he had heard that he could surely reach kingston before the arrival there of the dunkery beacon  but that steamer started before her time and when he reached vera cruz he found it impossible to leave immediately for his destination and when at last he bought a steamer and arrived at kingston the dunkery beacon and the yacht summer shelter had both departed but the captain found the letter from mrs cliff and while this explained a great deal it also puzzled him greatly  his wife and mrs cliff had corresponded with some regularity but the latter had never mentioned the fact that she was the owner of a yacht mrs cliff had intended to tell edna all about this new piece of property but when she looked at the matter from an outside point of view it seemed to her such a ridiculous thing that she should own a yacht that she did not want to write anything about it until her plans were perfected and she could tell just what she was going to do but when she suddenly decided to sail for jamaica her mind was so occupied with the plans of the moment that she had no time to write  therefore it was that captain and mrs horn wondered greatly what in the name of common sense mrs cliff was doing with a yacht but they knew that shirley and burke were on board and that they had sailed on the track of the dunkery beacon hoping to overtake her and deliver the message which shirley carried the captain decided that it was his duty to follow these two vessels down the coast of south america  the monterey was a large steamer sailing in ballast and of moderate speed and the captain had with himbesides his wife and her maidthe three negro men whom he had brought up from south america and who were now his devoted personal attendants and a goodsized crew captain horn had little hope of overhauling the two steamers for even the yacht which he had heard was a fastsailing vessel had had twentyfour hours start of him but he had reason to hope that he might meet one or both of them on their return for if the yacht should fail to overhaul the dunkery beacon she would certainly turn back to kingston  edna was as enthusiastic and interested in this voyage as her husband she sympathized in all his anxiety in regard to the safety of the treasure but even stronger than this was her desire to see once more her dear friend whom she had come to look upon almost as an elder sister  during each day the captain and his wife were almost constantly on deck their glasses sweeping the southeastern horizon hoping for the sight of two steamers coming back to kingston they saw vessels coming and going but they were not the craft they looked for and after they left the caribbean sea the sail became fewer and fewer on the second day after they left tobago island they fell in with a small steamer apparently in distress for she was working her way under sail and against headwinds towards the coast  when the captain spoke this steamer he received a request to lower a boat and go on board of her there he found an astonishing state of affairs the steamer was from a french port she carried no cargo and she was commanded and manned by captain hagar and the crew of the english ship dunkery beacon captain hagars story was not a long one and he told it as readily to captain horn as he would to any other friendly mariner who might have boarded him  he had left kingston with his vessel as he left it many times before and the caribbees were not half a day behind him when he was hailed by a steamerthe one he was now on which had been following him for some time he was told that this steamer carried a message from his owners and without suspecting anything he lay to and a boat came to him from the other ship this boat had in it a good many more men than was necessary but he suspected no evil until halfadozen men were on his deck and halfadozen pistols were pointed at the heads of himself and those around him then two more boats came over more men boarded him and without a struggle or hardly a cross wordas he expressed itthe dunkery beacon was in the hands of searobbers  captain hagar was a mildmannered man an excellent seaman and of good common sense he had before found orders waiting for him at jamaica and had not thought it surprising that orders should now have been sent after him he had firearms on board and might have defended himself to a certain extent but he had suspected no evil and when the pirates had boarded him it was useless to think of arms or defence  the men who had captured the dunkery beacon made very short work of their business they simply exchanged vessels they commanded captain hagar and all his men to go over to the french steamer while they all came on board the dunkery beacon bringing with them whatever they cared for captain hagar was told that he could work his new vessel to any port in the world which suited him best and then the dunkery beacon was headed southward and steamed away  when captain hagars engineers attempted to start the engines of their vessel they found it impossible to do so several important pieces of the machinery had been taken out hoisted on deck and dropped overboard whatever port they might make they must make it under sail  a brokenhearted and dejected man was captain hagar he had lost a vast treasure which had been entrusted to him and he had not ceased to wonder why the pirates had not murdered him and all his crew and thrown them overboard he hoped that in time he and his men might reach georgetown or some other port but it would be slow and disheartening work under the circumstances  captain horn was also greatly cast down by the news he had received with the least possible amount of trouble the pirates had carried off not only the treasure but the ship which conveyed it and now in all probability were far away with their booty he could understand very well why they would not undertake such wholesale crime as the murder of all the people on the dunkery for it is probable that there were men among them who could not be trusted even had the leaders been willing to undertake such useless bloodshed if captain hagar and his men were set adrift on a steamer without machinery it would be long before they could reach any port and even if they should soon speak a vessel and report their misfortune where was the policeman of the sea who would have authority to sail after the stolen vessel or if he had would know on what course to follow her  captain horn gave up the treasure as lost the dunkery beacon was probably shaping her course for the coast of africa and even if he had a swifter vessel and could overhaul her what could he do  but now he almost forgot his trouble about the treasure in his deep concern in the fate of mrs cliff and her yacht he had made up his mind that his friends on board that little vesselhe had very shadowy ideas as to what sort of a yacht it washad embarked upon this cruise entirely for his sake they knew that he took such a deep personal interest in the safety of the dunkery beacon they knew that he had done everything possible to detain that vessel at jamaica and that now for his peace of mind for the gratification of his feelings of honorno matter how exaggerated they might consider themthey were following in a little pleasure craft a steamer which they supposed to be a peaceful merchantman but which was in fact a pirate ship manned by miscreants without conscience  his plan was soon decided upon he told captain hagar that he would take him and his men on his own vessel and that he would carry them with him on his search for the yacht on which his friends had sailed captain hagar agreed in part to this proposition he would be glad to go with captain horn for it was possible he might hear news of his lost vessel but he did not wish to give up the french steamer she was worth money and if she could be got into port he felt it his duty to get her there so he left on board a crew sufficient to work her to georgetown but with the majority of his crew came on board the monterey and captain horn continued on his southern course  when on the following morning captain horn perceived far away to the south a steamer which captain hagar standing by with a glass to his eye declared to be none other than his old vessel the dunkery beacon and when not long afterwards he made out a smaller vessel apparently keeping company with the dunkery beacon with another steamer lying off to the eastward he was absolutely amazed and confounded he could not comprehend the state of affairs what was the dunkery beacon doing down south when by this time she ought to be far away to the east if she were running away with the treasure and what were those two other vessels keeping so close to her  he could not imagine what they could be unless indeed they were her pirate consorts if thats the case thought captain horn but saying no word to any one this is not a part of the sea for my wife to sail upon  still he knew nothing and he could decide upon nothing he could not be sure that one of those vessels was not the yacht which had sailed from kingston with mrs cliff and burke and shirley on board and so the monterey did not turn back but steamed on slowly towards the distant steamers     chapter xxix  the vittorio from genoa   when captain horn on the monterey perceived that one of the vessels he had sighted was steaming northward with the apparent intention of meeting him his anxieties greatly increased he could think of no righteous reason why that vessel should come to meet him he had made out that this vessel with the two others had been lying to why should it not wait for him if it wished to speak with him the course of this stranger looked like mischief of some sort and the captain could think of no other probable mischief than that which had been practised upon the dunkery beacon  the steamer which he now commanded carried a treasure far more valuable than that which lay in the hold of the dunkery and if she had been a swifter vessel he would have turned and headed away for safety at the top of her speed but he did not believe she could outsail the steamer which was now approaching and safety by flight was not to be considered  there was another reason which determined him not to change his course the observers on the monterey had now decided that the small vessel to the westward of the dunkery beacon was very like a yacht and the captain thought that if there was to be trouble of any sort he would like to be as near shirley and burke as possible why that rapidly approaching steamer should desire to board him as the dunkery beacon had been boarded he could not imagine unless it was supposed that he carried part of the treasure but he did not waste any time on conjectures it was not likely that this steamer carried a cannon and if she intended to attack the monterey it must be by boarding her probably by the same stratagem which had been practised before  but captain horn determined that no man upon any mission whatever should put his foot upon the deck of the monterey if he could prevent it since he had taken on board captain hagar and his men he had an extraordinarily large crew and on the number of his men he depended for defence for it was impossible to arm them as well as the attacking party would probably be armed if there should be an attacking party  captain horn now went to edna and told her of the approaching danger and for the second time in his life he gave her a pistol and requested her to use it in any way she thought proper if the need should come he asked her to stay for the present in the cabin with her maid promising to come to her again very shortly  then he called all the available men together and addressed them very briefly it was not necessary to tell the crew of the dunkery beacon what dangers might befall them if the pirates should come upon them a second time and the men he had brought with him from vera cruz now knew all about the previous affair and that it would probably be necessary for them to stand up boldly for their own defence  the captain told his men that the only thing to be done was to keep the fellows on that approaching steamer from boarding the monterey whether they tried to do so by what might look like fair means or by foul means all the firearms of every kind which could be collected were distributed around among those who it was thought could best use them while the rest of the men were armed with belaying pins handspikes hatchets axes or anything with which a blow could be struck and they were ranged along the bulwarks on each side of the ship from bow to stern  the other steamer was now near enough for her name vittorio to be read upon her bow this and her build made the captain quite sure that she was from the mediterranean and without doubt one of the pirates of whom he had heard he could see heads all along her rail and he thought it possible that she might not care to practise any trick upon him but might intend a bold and undisguised attack she had made no signal she carried no colors or flag of any kind and he thought it not unlikely that when she should be near enough she would begin operations by a volley of rifle shots from her deck to provide against this danger he made most of his men crouch down behind the bulwarks and ordered all the others to be ready to screen themselves a demand to lie to and a sharp fusillade might be enough to insure the immediate submission of an ordinary merchantman but captain horn did not consider the monterey a vessel of this sort  he now ran down to edna and was met by her at the cabin door she had had ideas very like his own i shouldnt wonder if they would fire upon us she said her face very pale and i want you to remember that you are most likely the tallest man on board no matter what happens you must take care of yourselfyou must never forget that  i will take care of you he said with his arms about her and i will not forget myself and now keep close and watch sharply i dont believe they can ever board uswere too many for them  the instant the captain had gone edna called maka and cheditafa the two elderly negroes who were the devoted adherents of herself and her husband i want you to watch the captain all the time she said if the people on that ship fire guns you pull him back if he shows himself if any one comes near him to harm him use your hatchets never let him out of your sight follow him close keep all danger from him  the negroes answered in the african tongue they were too much excited to use english but she knew what they meant and trusted them to mok the other negro she gave no orders even now he could speak but little english and he was in the party simply because her brother ralphwhose servant mok had beenhad earnestly desired her to take care of him until he should want him again for this coalblack and agile native of africa was not a creature who could be left to take care of himself  the vittorio which was now not more than a quarter of a mile away and which had slightly changed her course so that she was apparently intending to pass the monterey and continue northward contented with an observation of the larger vessel was a very dangerous pirate ship far more so than the one which had captured the dunkery beacon she was not more dangerous because she was larger or swifter or carried a more numerous or betterarmed crew but for the reason that she had on board a certain mr banker who had once belonged to a famous band of desperadoes called the rackbirds wellknown along the pacific coast of south america he had escaped destruction when the rest of his band were drowned in a raging torrent and he had made himself extremely obnoxious and even dangerous to mrs horn and to captain horn when they were in paris at a very critical time of their fortunes  this exrackbird banker had had but a very cloudy understanding of the state of affairs when he was endeavoring to blackmail mrs horn and making stupid charges against her husband he knew that the three negroes he had met in paris in the service of mrs horn had once been his own slaves held not by any right of law but by brutal force and he knew that the people with whom they were then travelling must have been in some way connected with his old comrades the rackbirds he had made bold attempts to turn this scanty knowledge to his own benefit but had mournfully failed  in the course of time however he had come to know everything the news of captain horns great discovery of treasure on the coast of peru had gone forth to the public and bankers soul had writhed in disappointed rage as he thought that he and his fellows had lived and rioted like fools for months and months and months but a short distance from all these vast hoards of gold this knowledge almost maddened him as he brooded over it by night and by day when he had been set free from the french prison to which his knavery had consigned him banker gave himself up body and soul to the consideration of the treasure which captain horn had brought to france from peru he considered it from every possible point of view and when at last he heard of the final disposition which it had been determined to make of the gold he considered it from the point of his own cupidity and innate rascality  he it was who devised the plan of sending out a swift steamer to overhaul the merchantman which was to carry the gold to peru and who after consultation with the many miscreants whom he was obliged to take into his confidence and to depend upon for assistance decided that it would be well to fit out two ships so that if one should fail in her errand the other might succeed the steamers from genoa and toulon were fitted out and manned under the direction of banker but with the one which sailed from marseilles he had nothing to do this expedition was organized by men who had quarrelled with him and his associates and it was through the dissension of the opposing parties in this intended piracy that the detectives came to know of it  banker had sailed from genoa but the toulon vessel had got ahead of him it had sighted the dunkery beacon before she reached kingston it had cruised in the caribbean sea until she came sailing down towards tobago island it had followed her out into the atlantic and when the proper time came it had taken herhull engine gold and everything which belonged to her except her captain and her crew and had steamed away with her  banker did not command the vittorio for he was not a seaman but he commanded her captain and through him everybody on board he directed her course and her policy he was her leading spirit and her blackest devil  it had been no part of bankers intentions to cruise about the south atlantic and search for a steamer with black and white stripes running up and down her funnel his plan of action was to be the same as that of the other pirate and the vittorio therefore steamed for kingston as soon as she could manage to clear from genoa his calculations were very good ones but there was a flaw in them for he did not know that the dunkery beacon sailed three days before her regular time consequently the vittorio was the last of the four steamers which reached jamaica on business connected with the incas treasure  the vittorio did not go into kingston harbor but banker got himself put on shore and visited the town there he not only discovered that the dunkery beacon had sailed that an american yacht had sailed after her but that a steamer from vera cruz commanded by captain horn now well known as the discoverer of the wonderful treasure had touched here expecting to find the dunkery beacon in port and had then scarcely twelve hours before cleared for jamaica  the american yacht was a mystery to banker it might be a pirate from the united states for all he knew but he was very certain that captain horn had not left kingston for any reason except to accompany and protect the dunkery beacon if a steamer commanded by this man whom banker now hated more than he hated anybody else in the world should fall in and keep company with the steamer which was conveying the treasure to peru it might be a very hard piece of work for him or his partner in command of the vessel from toulon to get possession of that treasure no matter what means they might employ but all banker could do was to swear at his archenemy and his bad luck and to get away south with all speed possible if he could do nothing he might hear of something he would never give up until he was positive there was no chance for him  so he took the course that the dunkery beacon must have taken and sailed down the coast under full head of steam when at last he discovered the flag of his private consort hoisted over the steamer which carried the golden prize and had gone on board the dunkery beacon and had heard everything his satanic delight blazed high and wild he cared nothing for the yacht which hung upon the heels of the captured steamerit would not be difficult to dispose of that vesselbut his turbulent ecstasies were a little dampened by the discovery of a large steamer bearing down from the north this he instantly suspected to be the monterey which must have taken a more westerly course than that which he had followed and which he had therefore passed without sighting  the exrackbird did not hesitate a moment as to what ought to be done that everlastingly condemned meddler horn must never be allowed to put his oar into this business if he were not content with the gold which he had for himself he should curse the day that he had tried to keep other people from getting the gold that they wanted for themselves no matter what had to be done he must never reach the dunkery beaconhe must never know what had happened to her here was a piece of work for the vittorio to attend to without the loss of a minute  when banker gave orders to head for the approaching steamer he immediately began to make ready for an attack upon her and as this was to be a battle between merchant ships neither of them provided with any of the ordinary engines of naval warfare his plan was of a straightforward oldfashioned kind he would run his ship alongside the other he would make fast and then his men each one with a cutlass and a pistol should swarm over the side of the larger vessel and cut down and fire until the beastly hounds were all dead or on their knees if he caught sight of captain hornand he was sure he would recognize him for such a fellow would be sure to push himself forward no matter what was going onhe would take his business into his own hands he would give no signal no warning if they wanted to know what he came for they would soon find out  before he left genoa he had thought that it was possible that he might make this sort of an attack upon the dunkery beacon and he had therefore provided for it he had shipped a number of grapplingirons with long chains attached which were run through ringbolts on his deck with these and other appliances for making fast to a vessel alongside banker was sure he could stick to an enemy or a prize as long as he wanted to lie by her  everything was now made ready for the proposed attack and all along the starboard side of the vittorio mattresses were hung in order to break the force of the shock when the two vessels should come together every man who could be spared was ordered on deck and fully armed the men who were to make fast to the other steamer were posted in their proper places and the rest of his miscreants were given the very simple orders to get on board the monterey the best way they could and as soon as they could and to cut down or shoot every man they met without asking questions or saying a word whether or not it would be necessary to dispose of all the crew which captain horn might have on board banker had not determined but of one thing he was certain he would leave no one on board of her to work her to the nearest port and give news of what had happened one mistake of that kind was enough to make and his stupid partner who had commanded the vessel from toulon had made it     chapter xxx  the battle of the merchant ships   when the vittorio showed that in veering away from the monterey she had done so only in order to make a sweep around to the west and when she had headed south and the mattresses lowered along her starboard side showed plainly to captain horn that she was about to attack him and how she was going to do it his first thought was to embarrass her by reversing his course and steering this way and that but he instantly dismissed this idea the pirate vessel was smaller and faster than his own and probably much more easily managed and apart from the danger of a collision fatal to his ship he would only protract the conflict by trying to elude her he was so sure that he had men enough to beat down the scoundrels when they tried to board that he thought the quicker the fight began the better if only he had shirley and burke with him he thought but although they were not here he had edna to fight for and that made three men of himself  with most of his men crouching behind his port bulwarks and others protected by deck houses smokestack and any other available devices against gunshots captain horn awaited the coming of the pirate steamer which was steaming towards him as if it intended to run him down as she came near the vittorio slowed up and the monterey veered to starboard but notwithstanding this precaution and the fact that they sailed side by side for nearly a minute without touching the two vessels came together with such force that the monterey high out of water rolled over as if a great wave had struck her as she rolled back grapplingirons were thrown over her rail and cables and lines were made fast to every available place which could be reached by eager hands and active arms some of the grapplingirons were immediately thrown off by the crew of the monterey but the chains of others had been so tightened as the vessel rolled back to an even keel that it was impossible to move them  the montereys rail was considerably higher than that of the vittorio and as none of the crew of the former vessel had shown themselves no shots had yet been fired but with the activity of apes the pirates tried to scramble over the side of the larger vessel now followed a furious handtohand combat blows rained down on the heads and shoulders of the assailants some of whom dropped back to the deck of their ship while others drew their pistols and fired right and left at the heads and arms they saw over the rail of the monterey  the pirate leaders were amazed at the resistance they met with they had not imagined that captain horn had so large a crew or that it was a crew which would fight but these pirates had their blood up and not one of them had any thought of giving up their enterprise on account of this unexpected resistance dozens of them at a time sprang upon the rail of their own vessel and with cutlass or pistol in one hand endeavored to scramble up the side of the monterey but although the few who succeeded in crossing her bulwarks soon fell beneath the blows and shots of her crew the attack was vigorously kept up especially by pistol shots  whenever there was a chance a pirate hand would be raised above the rail of the monterey and a revolver discharged upon her rail and every few minutes there would be a rush to one point or another and a desperate fight upon the rail the engines of both vessels had been stopped and the screaming and roaring of the escaping steam gave additional horror to this fearful battle not a word could be heard from any one no matter how loudly it might be shouted  whatever firearms were possessed by the men on the monterey were used with good effect but in this respect they were vastly inferior to the enemy when they had fired their pistols and their guns some of them had no more ammunition and others had no opportunity to reload the men of the vittorio had firearms in abundance and pockets full of cartridges consequently it was not long before captain horns men were obliged to rely upon their hatchets their handspikes their belayingpins and their numbers  banker was in a very furious state of mind he had expected to board the monterey without opposition and now he had been fighting long and hard and not a man of his crew was on board the other vessel he had soon discovered that there were a great many men on board the monterey but he believed that the real reason for the so far successful resistance was the fact that captain horn commanded them  several times he mounted the upper deck of the vittorio and with a rifle in hand endeavored to get a chance to aim at the tall figure of which he now and then caught sight and who he saw was directing everything that was going on but every time he stood out with his rifle a pistol ball whizzed by him and made him jump back whoever fired at him was not a good shot but banker did not wish to expose himself to any kind of a shot once he got a chance of taking aim at the captain from behind the smokestack but at that moment the captain stepped back hurriedly out of view as if somebody had been pulling him by the coat and a ball rang against the funnel high above his own head it was plain he was watched and would not expose himself  but that devil horn must be killed and he swore between his grinding teeth that he himself would do it his men many of them with bloody heads were still fighting swearing climbing and firing none of them had been killed except those who had gained the deck of the other vessel but banker did not believe that they would be able to board the monterey until its captain had been disposed of if he could put a ball into that fellow the fight would be over  banker now determined to lead a fresh attack instead of simply ordering one if he could call to his men from the deck of the monterey they would follow him the vittorio lay so that her bow was somewhat forward of that of the monterey and as the rails at the bows of the two vessels were some distance apart there was no fighting forward the long boom of the foremast of the vittorio stretched over her upper deck and crouching low banker cut all the lines which secured it then with a quick run he seized the long spar near its outer end and thus swinging it out until it struck the shrouds he found himself dangling over the forward deck of the monterey upon which he quickly dropped  it so happened that the fight was now raging aft and for a moment banker stood alone looking about him he believed his rapid transit through the air had not been noticed he would not call upon his men to follow as he had intended without much fear of detection he would slip quietly behind the crew of the monterey and take a shot at captain horn the moment he laid eyes on him then he could shout out to his men to some purpose  banker moved on a few steps not too cautiously for he did not wish to provoke suspicion when suddenly a hand was placed upon his chest there was nobody in front of him but there was the hand and a very big one it was and very black like a flash banker turned and beheld himself face to face with the man mok the same chimpanzeelike negro who had been his slave and with whom in the streets of paris he had once had a terrible struggle which had resulted in his capture by the police and his imprisonment here was that same black devil again his arms about him as if they had been chaincables on a windlass  banker had two pistols but he had put them in his pockets when he made his swing upon the boom and he had not yet drawn them and now his arms were held so tightly to his sides that he could not get at his weapons there was no one near banker was wise enough not to call out or even to swear an oath and mok had apparently relapsed into the condition of the speechless savage beast with a wrench which might have torn an ordinary limb from its socket banker freed his left arm but a black hand had grasped it before he could reach his pistol  then there was a strugglequick hard silent and furious as if two great cobras were writhing together seeking each others death mok was not armed banker could not use knife or pistol they stumbled they went down on their knees they rose and fell together against the rail instantly banker with his left arm and the strength of his whole body raised the negro to the rail and pushed him outward the action was so sudden the effort of the maddened pirate was so great that mok could not resist ithe went over the side but his hold upon banker did not relax even in the moment when he felt himself falling and his weight was so great and the impetus was so tremendous that banker could not hold back and followed him over the rail still clutching each other tightly the two disappeared with a splash into the sea  fears were beginning to steal into the valiant heart of captain horn the pirates were so well armed they kept up such a savage fire upon his decks that although their shots were sent at random several men had been killed and othershe knew not how manywounded that he feared his crew ordinary sailors and not accustomed to such savage work as this might consider the contest too unequal and so lose heart if that should be the case the affair would be finished  but there was still one means of defence on which he thought he might rely to drive off the scoundrels the monterey had been a cotton ship and she was provided with hose by which steam could be thrown upon her cargo in case of fire and captain hagar had undertaken to try to get this into condition to use upon the scoundrels who were endeavoring to board the vessel by this time two heavy lines of hose had been rigged and attached to the boiler and the other ends brought out on deckone forward and the other amidships  illustration banker could not hold back  captain hagar was a quiet man and in no way a fighter but now he seemed imbued with a reckless courage and without thinking of the danger of exposing himself to pistol or to rifle he laid the nozzle of his hose over the rail and directed it down upon the deck below as soon as the hot steam began to pour upon the astonished pirates there were yells and execrations and when another scalding jet came in upon them over the forward bulwarks of the monterey the confusion became greater on the pirate ship  it was at this moment as edna her face pale and her bright eyes fixed upon the upper deck of the vittorio stood with a revolver in her hand at the window of her cabin which was on deck that her swedish maid trembling so much that she could scarcely stand approached her and gave her notice that she must quit her service edna did not hear what she said are you there she cried look outtell me if you can see captain horn  the frightened girl scarcely knowing what she did rushed from the cabin to look for captain horn not so much because her mistress wanted information of him as because she thought to throw herself upon his protection she believed that the captain could do anything for anybody and she ran madly along the deck on the other side from that on which the battle was raging and meeting no one did not stop until she had nearly reached the bow then she stopped looked about her and in a moment was startled by hearing herself called by her name there was no one near her she looked up she looked around  then again she heard her name sophee sophee now it seemed to come from the water and looking over the low rail she beheld a black head on the surface of the sea its owner was swimming about endeavoring to find something on which he could lay hold and he had seen the white cap of the maid above the ships side sophia and mok were very good friends for the latter had always been glad to wait upon her in every way possible and now she forgot her own danger in her solicitude for the poor black man  oh mok mok she cried cant you get out of the water can i help you  mok shouted out one of his few english words rope rope he said but sophia could see no rope except those which were fast to something and in her terror she ran aft to call for assistance  there was now not so much noise and din the steam was not escaping from the boilers of the monterey for it was needed for the hose and there were no more shots fired from the vittorio the officers of the pirate ship were running here and there looking for banker that they might ask for orders while the men were crowding together behind every possible protection and rushing below to escape the terrible streams of scalding steam  now that they could work in safety the montereys men got their handspikes under the grapplingirons and wrenched them from their holes and leaning over the side they cut the ropes which held them to the pirate ship the two vessels now swung apart and captain horn was on the point of giving orders to start the engines and steam ahead when the maid sophia seized him by the arm mrs horn wants you she said and moks in the water  mok exclaimed the captain  yes here here cried sophia and running to the side she pointed to where moks black head and waving arms were still circling about on the surface of the sea  when a rope had been cast to mok and he had been hauled up the side the captain gave orders to start ahead and rushed to the cabin where he had left edna but it was not during that brief interval of thankfulness that he heard how she had recognized the rackbird banker on the pirate ship and how she had fired at him every time he had shown himself  the monterey started southward towards the point where they had last seen the yacht and the dunkery beacon and the pirate ship veering off to the southeast steamed slowly away the people on board of her were looking everywhere for banker for without him they knew not what they ought to do but if their leader ever came up from the great depth to which he had sunk with moks black hands upon his throat his comrades were not near the spot where dead or alive he floated to the surface     chapter xxxi  she backed   when captain burke observed the dunkery beacon steaming in his direction and soon afterwards perceived a signal on this steamer to the effect that she wished to speak with the yacht he began to hope that he was going to get out of his difficulties the natural surmise was that as one of the pirates had gone to join another just arriving upon the scene the dunkery beaconthe captain and crew of which must have turned traitorswas now coming to propose some arrangement probably to give up shirley if the yacht would agree to go its way and cease its harassing interference  if this proposition should be made burke and mrs cliff in conference decided to accept it they had done all they could and would return to kingston to report to captain horn what they had done and what they had discovered but it was not long before the people on the yacht began to wonder very much at the conduct of the great steamer which was now rapidly approaching them apparently under full head of steam  the yacht was lying to her engines motionless and the dunkery beacon was coming ahead like a furious ram on a course which if not quickly changed would cause her to strike the smaller vessel almost amidships it became plainer and plainer every second that the dunkery did not intend to change her course and that her object was to run down the yacht  why the dunkery beacon should wish to ram the summer shelter nobody on board the yacht considered for a moment but every one even willy croup perceived the immediate necessity of getting out of the way burke sprang to the wheel and began to roar his orders in every direction his object was to put the yacht around so that he could get out of the course of the dunkery beacon and pass her in the opposite direction to which she was going but nobody on board seemed to be sufficiently alive to the threatening situation or to be alert enough to do what was ordered at the very instant of command and burke excited to the highest pitch began to swear after a fashion entirely unknown to the two ladies and the members of the synod his cursing and swearing was of such a cyclonic and allpervading character that some of those on board shuddered almost as much on account of his language as for fear of the terrible crash which was impending  this is dreadful said one of the clergymen advancing as if he would mount to the pilot house  stop said mr arbuckle excitedly placing his hand upon the shoulder of the other dont interfere at such a moment the ship must be managed  in a very short time although it seemed like long weary minutes to the people on the yacht her engines moved her screw revolved and she slowly moved around to leeward if she could have done this half a minute sooner she would have steamed out of the course of the dunkery beacon so that that vessel must have passed her but she did not do it soon enough the large steamer came on at what seemed amazing speed and would have struck the yacht a little abaft the bow had not burke seeing that a collision could not be avoided quickly reversed his helm almost in the next second the two vessels came together but it was the stem of the yacht which struck the larger steamer abaft the bow  the shock to the summer shelter was terrific and having but little headway at the moment of collision she was driven backward by the tremendous momentum of the larger vessel as if she had been a ball struck by a bat every person on board was thrown down and hurled forward mrs cliff extended herself flat upon the deck her arms outspread and every clergyman was stretched out at full length or curled up against some obstacle the engineer had been thrown among his levers and cranks bruising himself badly about the head and shoulders while his assistant and mr hodgson who were at work below were jammed among the ashes of the furnace as if they were trying to stop the draught with their bodies  mr burdette was on the forward deck and if he had not tripped and fallen would probably have been shot overboard and the sailingmaster was thrown against the smokestack with such violence that for a few moments he was insensible  burke who was at the wheel saw what was coming and tried to brace himself so that he should not be impaled upon one of the handles but the shock was too much for him and he pitched forward with such force that he came near going over the wheel and out of the window of the pilot house as soon as captain burke could recover himself he scrambled back to his position behind the wheel he had been dazed and bruised but his senses quickly came to him and he comprehended the present condition of affairs  the yacht had not only been forced violently backward but had been veered around so that it now lay with its broadside towards the bow of the other steamer in some way either unwittingly by the engineer or by the violence of the shock her engine had been stopped and she was without motion except the slight pitching and rolling occasioned by the collision the dunkery beacon was not far away and burke saw to his horror that she was again moving forward she was coming slowly but if she reached the yacht in the latters present position she would have weight and force enough to turn over the smaller vessel  immediately burke attempted to give the order to back the yacht the instant performance of this order was the only chance of safety but he had been thrown against the speakingtube with such violence that he had jammed it and made it useless if he pulled a bell the engineer might misunderstand she must back she could not pass the other vessel if she went ahead he leaned out of the door of the pilot house and yelled downward to the engineer to back her he yelled to somebody to tell the engineer to back her he shouted until his shouts became screams but nobody obeyed his orders no one seemed to hear or to heed but one person did hear  willy croup had been impelled out of the door of the saloon and had slid forward on her knees and elbows until she was nearly under the pilot house at the sound of burkes voice she looked up she comprehended that orders were being given to which no attention was paid the wild excitement of the shouting captain filled her with an excitement quite as wild she heard the name of the engineer she heard the order and without taking time to rise to her feet she made a bound in the direction of the engine room  thrusting her body half through the doorway she yelled to the engineer who scarcely conscious of where he was or what he was doing was pushing himself away from among his bars and rods back her screamed willy and without knowing what she said or did she repeated this order over and over again in a roaring voice which no one would have supposed her capable of and accompanied by all the oaths which at that moment were being hurled down from the pilot house  the engineer did not look up he did not consider himself nor the situation there was but one impression upon his mind made by the electric flash of the order backed by the following crash of oaths instinctively he seized his lever reversed the engine and started the summer shelter backward slowly very slowly she moved burke held his breath  but the great steamer was coming on slowly her motion was increasing but so was that of the yacht and when after some moments of almost paralyzing terror during which willy croup continued to hurl her furious orders into the engine room not knowing they had been obeyed the two vessels drew near each other the dunkery beacon crossed the bow of the summer shelter a very long biscuittoss ahead  miss croup said mr litchfield his hand upon her shoulder that will do the yacht is out of immediate danger  willy started up her wild eyes were raised to the face of the young clergyman the roar of her own invectives sounded in her ears tears poured from her eyes  mercy on me mr litchfield she exclaimed what have i been saying  never mind now miss croup said he dont think of what you said she backed     chapter xxxii  a head on the water   with her engines in motion and her wheel in the hands of captain burke the summer shelter was in no danger of being run into by the dunkery beacon for she was much the more easily managed vessel  as soon as they had recovered a moderate command of their senses burdette and portman hurried below to find out what damage had been sustained by the yacht but although she must have been greatly strained and might be leaking through some open seams the tough keelson of the wellbuilt vessel running her length like a stiff backbone had received and distributed the shock and although her bowsprit was shivered to pieces and her cutwater splintered her sides were apparently uninjured furniture baggage coils of rope and everything movable had been pitched forward and heaped in disordered piles all over the vessel a great part of the china had been broken books papers and ornaments littered the floors and even the coal was heaped up in the forward part of the bunkers  burke gave the wheel to burdette and came down when mrs cliff immediately rushed to him she was not hurt but had been dreadfully shaken in body and mind oh what are we going to do she cried they are wretched murderers will they keep on trying to sink us cant we get away  we can get away whenever we please said burke his voice husky and cracked if it wasnt for shirley id sail out of their sight in half an hour  but we cant sail away and leave mr shirley said she we cant go away and leave him  but little effort was made to get anything into order bruised heads and shoulders were rubbed a little and all on board seemed trying to get themselves ready for whatever would happen next burke followed by portman ran to the cases containing the rifles and taking them out they distributed them giving one to every man on board some of the clergymen objected to receiving them and expostulated earnestly and even piteously against connecting themselves with any bloodshed cannot we leave this scene of contention some of them said not with shirley on that steamer said burke and to this there was no reply  burke had no definite reason for thus arming his crew but with such an enemy as the dunkery beacon had proved herself to be lying to a short distance away two other vessels probably pirates in the vicinity and the strong bond of shirleys detention holding the yacht where she was he felt that he should be prepared for every possible emergency but what to do he did not know it would be of no use to hail the dunkery and demand shirley he had done that over and over again before that vessel had proved herself an open enemy he stood with brows contracted rifle in hand and his eyes fixed on the big steamer ahead the two other vessels he did not now consider for they were still some miles away  willy croup was sitting on the floor of the saloon sobbing and groaning and mrs cliff did not know what in the world was the matter with her but mr litchfield knew and he knew also that it would be of no use to try to comfort her with any ordinary words of consolation he was certain that she had not understood anything that she had said not even perhaps the order to back the yacht but the assertion of this would have made but little impression upon her agitated mind but a thought struck him and he hurried to burke and told him quickly what had happened burke listened and could not even now restrain a smile its just like that dear willy croup said he shes an angel  will you be willing said mr litchfield to come and tell her that your orders could not have been forcibly and quickly enough impressed upon the engineers mind in any other way  without answering burke ran to where willy was still groaning miss croup he exclaimed we owe our lives to you if you hadnt sworn at the engineer he never would have backed her in time and we would all have been at the bottom of the sea  mrs cliff looked aghast and willy sprang to her feet do you mean that mr burke she cried  yes said he in such desperate danger you had to do it its like a crack on the back when youre choking you were the only person able to repeat my orders and you were bound to do it  yes said mr litchfield and you saved the ship  willy looked at him a few moments in silence then wiping her eyes she said well you know more about managing a ship than i do and i hope and trust ill never be called upon to back one again  burke and most of the other men now gathered on deck watching the dunkery beacon she was still lying to blowing off steam and there seemed to be a good deal of confusion on her deck suddenly burke saw a black object in the water near her starboard quarter gazing at it intently his eyes began to glisten in a few moments he exclaimed look there its shirley hes swimming to the yacht  now everybody on deck was straining his eyes over the water and mrs cliff and willy who had heard burkes cry stood with the others is it shirley really exclaimed mrs cliff are you sure thats his head in the water  yes replied burke theres no mistake about it hes taking his last chance and has slipped over the rail without nobody knowing it  and can he swim so far gasped willy  oh he can do that answered burke id steam up closer if i wasnt afraid of attracting attention if theyd get sight of him theyd fire at him but he can do it if hes let alone  not a word was now said scarcely a breath seemed to come or go everybody was gazing steadfastly and rigidly at the swimmer who with steady powerful strokes was making a straight line over the gently rolling waves towards the yacht although they did not so express it to themselves the coming of that swimmer meant everything to the pale expectant people on the summer shelter if he should reach them not only would he be saved but they could steam away to peace and safety  on swam shirley evenly and steadily until he had nearly passed half the distance between the two vessels when suddenly a knot of men were seen looking over the rail of the dunkery then there was a commotion then a man was seen standing up high a gun in his hand willy uttered a stifled scream and mrs cliff seized her companion by the arm with such force that her nails nearly entered the flesh and almost in the same instant there rang out from the yacht the report of eight rifles  every man had fired at the fellow with the gun even burdette in the pilot house some of the balls had gone high up into the rigging and some had rattled against the hull of the steamer but the man with the gun disappeared in a flash whether he had been hit or frightened nobody knew shirley startled at this tremendous volley turned a quick backward glance and then dived but soon reappeared again striking out as before for the yacht  now then shouted burke keep your eyes on the rail of that steamer if a man shows his head fire at it  if this action had been necessary very few of the rifles in the hands of the members of the late synod would have been fired for most of them did not know how to recharge their weapons but there was no need even for burke to draw a bead on a pirate head for now not a man could be seen on the dunkery beacon they had evidently been so surprised and astounded by a volley of rifle shots from this pleasure yacht which they had supposed to be as harmless as a floating log that every man on deck had crouched behind the bulwarks  now burke gave orders to steam slowly forward and for everybody to keep covered as much as possible and when in a few minutes the yachts engine stopped and shirley swam slowly around her stern there was a rush to the other side of the deck a life preserver was dropped to the swimmer steps were let down and the next minute shirley was on deck burkes strong arm fairly lifting him in over the rail in a few moments the deck of the yacht was the scene of wild and excited welcome and delight each person on board felt as if a brother had suddenly been snatched from fearful danger and returned to their midst  i cant tell you anything now said shirley give me a dram and let me get on some dry clothes and now all of you go and attend to what youve got to do dont bother about that steamershell go down in half an hour shes got a big hole stove in her bow  with a cry of surprise burke turned and looked out at the dunkery beacon even now she had keeled over to starboard so much that her deck was visible and her head was already lower than her stern shell sink he cried with all that gold on board  yes said shirley turning with a weak smile as he made his way to the cabin accompanied by mr hodgson shell go down with every bar of it  there was great commotion now on the dunkery beacon it was plain that the people on board of her had discovered that it was of no use to try to save the vessel and they were lowering her boats burke and his companions stood and watched for some minutes what shall we do exclaimed mr arbuckle approaching burke can we offer those unfortunate wretches any assistance  all we can do said burke is to keep out of their way i wouldnt trust one of them within pistol shot now shirley reappeared on deckhe had had his dram and had changed his clothes youre right said he theyre a set of piratesevery man of them if we should take them on board theyd cut all our throats theyve got boats enough and the other pirates can pick them up keep her off burke thats what i say  there was no time now for explanations or for any story to be told and burke gave orders that the yacht should be kept away from the sinking steamer and her boats suddenly burdette from the pilot house sung out that there was a steamer astern and the eyes which had been so steadfastly fixed upon the dunkery beacon now turned in that direction there they saw less than a mile away a large steamer coming down from the north  burkes impulse was to give orders to go ahead at full speed but he hesitated and raised his glass to his eye then in a few moments he put down his glass turned around and shouted thats the monterey the monterey and captain horn     chapter xxxiii  11° 30 19 n lat by 56° 10 49 w long   the announcement of the approach of captain horn created a sensation upon the summer shelter almost equal to that occasioned by any of the extraordinary incidents which had occurred upon that vessel burke and shirley were wild with delight at the idea of meeting their old friend and commander willy croup had never seen captain horn but she had heard so much about him that she considered him in her mind as a being of the nature of a heathen deity who rained gold upon those of whom he approved and utterly annihilated the unfortunates who incurred his displeasure  as for mrs cliff her delight in the thought of meeting captain horn great as it was was overshadowed by her almost frantic desire to clasp once more in her arms her dear friend edna the clergymen had heard everything that the summer shelter people could tell them about captain horn and his exploits and each man of them was anxious to look into the face and shake the hand of the brave sailor whom they had learned to look upon as a hero and one or two of them thought that it might be proper under the circumstances to resume their clerical attire before the interview but this proposition when mentioned was discountenanced they were here as sailors to work the yacht and they ought not to be ashamed to look like sailors the yacht was now put about and got under headway and slowly moved in the direction of the approaching steamer  when captain horn had finished the fight in which he was engaged with the vittorio and had steamed down in the direction of the two other vessels in the vicinity it was not long before he discovered that one of them was an american yacht why it and the dunkery beacon should be lying there together he could not even imagine but he was quite sure that this must be the vessel owned by mrs cliff and commanded by his old shipmate burke  when at last the monterey and the summer shelter were lying side by side within hailing distance and captain horn had heard the stentorian voice of burke roaring through his trumpet he determined that he and edna would go on board the yacht for there were dead men and wounded men on his own vessel and the condition of his deck was not such as he would wish to be seen by mrs cliff and whatever ladies might be with her  when captain horn and his wife with captain hagar rowed by four men reached the side of the summer shelter they were received with greater honor and joy than had ever been accorded to an admiral and his suite the meeting of the five friends was as full of excited affection as if they were not now standing in the midst of strange circumstances and perhaps many dangers of which none of them understood but a part  captain horn seized the first opportunity which came to him to ask the question whats the matter with your yacht you seem to have had a smashup forward  yes said burke theres been a collision those beastly hounds tried to run us down but we caught her squarely on her bow  at this moment the conversation was interrupted by a shout from captain hagar who had taken notice of nobody on the yacht but stood looking over the water at his old ship whats the matter he cried with the dunkery beacon has she sprung a leak are those the pirates still on board  captain horn and the others quickly joined him sprung a leak cried shirley shes got a hole in her bow as big as a barrel ive been on board of her but i cant tell you about that now theres no use to think of doing anything those are bloody pirates that are lowering the boats and we cant go near them besides you can see for yourself that that steamer is settling down by the head as fast as she can  captain horn was now almost as much excited as the unfortunate commander of the dunkery beacon wheres that gold he cried where is it stowed  it is in the forward hold with a lot of cargo on top of it groaned captain hagar  shirley now spoke again dont think about the gold he said i kept my eyes opened and my ears sharpened when i was on board and although i didnt understand all their lingo i knew what they were at when they found there was no use pumping or trying to stop the leak they tried to get at that gold but they couldnt do it the water was coming in right there and the men would not rig up the tackle to move the cargo they were all wild when i left  captain horn said no more but stood with the others gazing at the dunkery beacon but captain hagar beat his hands upon the rail and declared over and over again that he would rather never have seen the ship again than to see her sink there before his eyes with all that treasure on board the yacht lay near enough to the dunkery beacon for captain hagar to see plainly what was going on on his old ship without the aid of a glass with eyes glaring madly over the water he stood leaning upon the rail his face pale his whole form shaking as if he had a chill every one on the deck of the yacht gathered around him but no one said anything this was no time for asking questions or making explanations  the men on the dunkery beacon were hurrying to leave the vessel one of the starboard boats was already in the water with too many men in her the vessel had keeled over so much that there seemed to be difficulty in lowering the boats on the port side everybody seemed rushing to starboard and two other boats were swinging out on their davits every time the bow of the steamer rose and fell upon the swell it seemed to go down a little more and up a little less and the deck was slanted so much that the men appeared to slide down to the starboard bulwarks  now the first boat pushed off from the sinking ship and the two others both crowded were soon pulling after her it was not difficult to divine their intentions the three boats headed immediately for the northeast where less than two miles away the vittorio could be plainly seen  at this moment captain hagar gave a yell he sprang back from the rail and his eyes fell upon a rifle which had been laid on a bench by one of the clergymen he seized it and raised it to his shoulder but in an instant captain horn took hold of it pointing it upward what are you going to do he said captain you dont mean to fire at them  of course i mean it cried captain hagar weve got them in a bunch we must follow them up and shoot them down like rats  illustration he seized it and raised it to his shoulder  well get up steam and run them down shouted burke we ought to sink them one boat after another the rascally pirates they tried to sink us  no no said captain horn taking the gun from captain hagar we cant do that thats a little too coldblooded if they attack us well fight them but we cant take capital punishment into our own hands  now the excited thoughts of captain hagar took another turn lower a boat lower a boat he cried let me be pulled to the dunkery everything i own is on that ship the pirates wouldnt let me take anything away lower a boat i can get into my cabin  shirley now stepped to the other side of captain hagar its no use to think of that captain he said it would be regular suicide to go on board that vessel those fellows were afraid to stay another minute shell go down before you know it look at her bows now  captain hagar said no more and the little company on the deck of the yacht stood pale and silent gazing out over the water at the dunkery beacon willy croup was crying and there were tears in the eyes of mrs cliff and edna in the heart of the latter was deep deep pain for she knew what her husband was feeling at that moment she knew it had been the high aim of his sensitive and honorable soul that the gold for which he had labored so hard and dared so much should safely reach in every case those to whom it had been legally adjudged if it should fail to reach them where was the good of all that toil and suffering he had in a measure taken upon himself the responsibility of the safe delivery of that treasure and now here he was standing and there was the treasure sinking before his eyes as she stood close by him edna seized her husbands hand and pressed it he returned the pressure but no word was said  now the dunkery beacon rolled more heavily than she had done yet and as she went down in the swell it seemed as if the water might easily flow over her forward bulwarks and her bow came up with difficulty as if it were sticking fast in the water her masts and funnel were slanting far over to starboard and when after rising once more she put her head again into the water she dipped it in so deep that her rail went under and did not come up again her stern seemed to rise in the air and at the same time the sea appeared to lift itself up along her whole length then with a dip forward of her funnel and masts she suddenly went down out of sight and the water churned and foamed and eddied about the place where she had been the gold of the incas was on its way to the bottom of the unsounded sea  captain hagar sat down upon the deck and covered his face with his hands no one said anything to himthere was nothing to say the first to speak was mrs cliff captain horn said she her voice so shaken by her emotion that she scarcely spoke above a whisper we did everything we could and this is what has come of it  everything exclaimed captain horn suddenly turning towards her you have done far more than could be expected by mortals and now said he turning to the little party dont let one of us grieve another minute for the sinking of that gold if anybody has a right to grieve its captain hagar here hes lost his ship but many a good sailor has lost his ship and lived and died a happy man after it and as to the cargo you carried my mate said he you would have done your duty by it just the same if it had been pig lead or gold and when you have done your duty theres the end of it  captain hagar looked up rose to his feet and after gazing for a second in the face of captain horn he took his extended hand youre a good one said he but youre bound to agree that its tough theres no getting around that its allfired tough  burke said captain horn quickly glancing up at the noonday sun put her out there near the wreckage and take an observation  it was shortly after this that mr portman the sailingmaster came aft and reported the position of the yacht to be eleven degrees thirty minutes nineteen seconds north latitude by fiftysix degrees ten minutes fortynine seconds west longitude  whats the idea said burke to captain horn of steering right to the spot do you think therell ever be a chance of getting at it  captain horn was marking the latitude and longitude in his notebook cant say what future ages may do in the way of deepsea work said he but id like to put a dot on my chart that will show where the gold went down  nothing could be more unprofitable for the shaken and disturbed spirits of the people on the summer shelter than to stand gazing at the few pieces of wood and the halfsubmerged hencoop which floated above the spot where the dunkery beacon had gone down or to look out at the three boats which the pirates were vigorously rowing towards the steamer in the distance and this fact strongly impressed itself upon the practical mind of mrs cliff captain horn said she is there any reason why we should not go away  none in the world said he and theres every reason why your vessel and mine should get under headway as soon as possible where are you bound for now  wherever you say captain she answered this is my ship and mr burke is my captain but we want you to take care of us and you must tell us where we should go  well talk it over said he and calling burke and captain hagar a consultation was immediately held and it did not take long to come to a decision when all concerned were of the same mind  it was decided to set sail immediately for kingston for each vessel had coal enough with the assistance of her sails to reach that port mrs cliff insisted that edna should not go back to the monterey and captain horn agreed to this plan for he did not at all wish any womankind on the monterey in her present condition the yacht had been found to be perfectly seaworthy and although a little water was coming in her steam pump kept her easily disposed of it edna accepted mrs cliffs invitation provided her husband would agree to remain on the yacht and somewhat to her surprise he was perfectly willing to do this the idea had come to him that the best thing for all parties and especially for the comfort and relief of the mind of captain hagar was to put him in command of a ship and give him something to think about other than the loss of his vessel  while they were talking over these matters and making arrangements to send to the monterey for ednas maid and some of her baggage captain horn sought burke in his room i want to know said he what sort of a crew youve got on board this yacht one of thema very intelligentlooking man by the way with black trousers oncame up to me just now and shook hands with me and said he was ever so much pleased to make my acquaintance and hoped he would soon have some opportunities of conversation with me that isnt the kind of seaman im accustomed to  burke laughed its the jolliest hightoned upperten crew that ever swabbed a deck or shoveled coal theyre all ministers  ministers ejaculated captain horn absolutely aghast then burke told the story of the synod captain horn sank into a chair leaned back and laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks  i didnt suppose he said presently that anything could make me laugh on a day like this but the story of those synod gentlemen has done it but burke theres no use of their serving as seamen any longer let them put on their black clothes and be comfortable and happy ive got a double crew on board the monterey and can bring over just as many men as are needed to work this yacht ill go over myself and detail a crew and then when everything is made ready ill come on board here myself and after that i want you to remember that im a passenger and havent anything to do with the sailing of this ship youre captain and must attend to your own vessel and im going to make it my business to get acquainted with all these clergymen and that lady i see with mrs cliff who is she  by george exclaimed burke shes the leading trump of the world thats willy croup  there was no time then to explain why willy was a leading trump but captain horn afterwards heard the story of how she backed the ship and he did not wonder at burkes opinion  when the summer shelter accompanied by the monterey had started northward burke stood by shirley on the bridge mr burdette had a complete crew of able seamen under his command there was a cook in the kitchen and stewards in the saloons and there was a carpenter with some men at work at a spare spar which was to be rigged as a bowsprit  im mighty glad to lay her course for home said burke for ive had enough of it as things are but if things were not exactly as they are i wouldnt have enough of it  what do you mean said shirley  i mean this was the answer if this was my yacht and there was no women on board and no ministers i would have put on a full head of steam and i would have gone after those boats and i would have run them down one after another and drowned every bloody pirate on board of them it makes my blood boil to think of those scoundrels getting away after trying to run us down and to shoot you  it would have served them right to run them down you know said shirley but you couldnt do it and theres no use talking about it it would have been a coldblooded piece of business to run down a small boat with a heavy steamer and i dont believe you would have been willing to do it yourself when you got close on to them but the captain says if we get to kingston in good time we may be able to get a cable message to london and set the authorities at every likely port on the lookout for the vittorio  the voyage of the summer shelter to kingston was uneventful but in many respects a very pleasant one there had been a great disappointment there had been a great loss and to the spirits of some of the party there had been a great shock but every one now seemed determined to forget everything which had been unfortunate and to remember only that they were all alive all safe all together and all on their way home  the clergymen relieved of their nautical duties shone out brightly as goodhumored and agreeable companions their hardships and their dangers had made them so well acquainted with each other and with everybody else on board and they had found it so easy to become acquainted with captain and mrs horn and they all felt so much relieved from the load of anxiety which had been lifted from them that they performed well their parts in making up one of the jolliest companies which ever sailed over the south atlantic  at kingston the summer shelter and the monterey were both leftthe former to be completely repaired and brought home by mr portman and the other to be coaled and sent back to vera cruz with her officers and her crewand our whole party including captain hagar sailed in the next mail steamer for new york     chapter xxxiv  plainton maine   it was late in the summer and mrs cliff dwelt happy and serene in her native town of plainton maine she had been there during the whole warm season for plainton was a place to which people came to be cool and comfortable in summertime and if she left her home at all it would not be in the months of foliage and flowers it might well be believed by any one who would look out of one of the tall windows of her drawingroom that mrs cliff did not need to leave home for the mere sake of rural beauty on the other side of the street where once stretched a block of poor little houses and shops now lay a beautiful park the grove of the incas  the zeal of mr burke and the money of mrs cliff had had a powerful influence upon the minds of the contractors and landscapegardeners who had this great work in hand and the park which really covered a very large space in the village now appeared from certain points of view to extend for miles so artfully had been arranged its masses of obstructing foliage and its open vistas of uninterrupted view the surface of the ground which had been a little rolling had been made more unequal and diversified and over all the little hills and dells and upon the wide smooth stretches there was a covering of bright green turf it had been a season of genial rains and there had been a special corps of workmen to attend to the grass of the new park  great trees were scattered here and there and many people wondered when they saw them but these trees oaks and chestnuts tall hickories and bright cheerful maples had been growing where they stood since they were little saplings the people of plainton had always been fond of trees and they had them in their side yards and in their back yards and at the front of their houses and when within the limits of the new park all these yards and houses and sheds and fences had been cleared away there stood the trees hundreds of other trees evergreens and deciduous many of them of good size had been brought from the adjacent country on great wheels which had excited the amazement of the people in the town and planted in the park  through the middle of the grounds ran a wide and turbulent brook whirling around its rocks and spreading out into its deep and beautiful pools and where once stood the widow caseys little housewhich was built on the side of a bank so that the caseys went into the second story when they entered by the frontnow leaped a beautiful cataract over that very bank scattering its spray upon the trunks of the two big chestnuts one of which used to stand by the side of mrs caseys house and the other at the front  in the shade of the four great oak trees which had stood in william hamiltons back yard and which he intended to cut down as soon as he had money enough to build a long cowstablefor it was his desire to go into the dairy businessnow spread a wide transparent pool half surrounded at its upper end by marble terraces on the edges of which stood tall statues with their white reflections stretching far down into the depths beneath here were marble benches and steps down to the water and sometimes the bright gleams of sunshine came flittering through the leaves and sometimes the leaves themselves came fluttering down and floated on the surface of the pool and when the young people had stood upon the terraces or had sat together upon the wide marble steps they could walk away if they chose through masses of evergreen shrubbery whose quiet paths seemed to shut them out from the world  on a little hill which had once led up to parsons barn but now ended quite abruptly in a little precipice with a broad railing on its edge and a summerhouse a little back one could sit and look out over the stretch of bright green lawns between two clumps of hemlocks and over a hedge which concealed the ground beyond along the whole length of the vista made by becker street which obligingly descended slightly from the edge of the park so that its houses were concealed by the hemlocks and then out upon the country beyond and to the beautiful hills against the sky and such a one might well imagine should he be a stranger that all he saw was in the grove of the incas upon all the outer edges of this park there were masses of shrubbery or little lines of hedge irregularly disposed with bits of grass opening upon the street and here and there a line of slender iron railing with a group of statuary back of it and so the people when they walked that way scarcely knew when they entered the park or when they left it  the home of mrs cliff itself had seemed to her to be casting off its newness and ripening into the matured home much of this was due to work which had been done upon the garden and surrounding grounds but much more was due to the imperceptible influence of the misses thorpedyke these ladies had not only taken with them to the house so many of the timehonored objects which they had saved from their old home but they had brought to bear upon everything around them the courtly tastes of the olden time  willy croup had declared as she stood in the hall gazing up at the staircase that it often seemed to her since she came back as if her grandfather had been in the habit of coming down those stairs i never saw him she said and i dont know what sort of stairs he used to come down but theres something about all this which makes me think of things far back and grand and i know from what ive heard of him that he would have liked to come down such stairs  mrs horn and her husband had made a long visit to mrs cliff and they had departed early in the summer for a great property they had bought in the west which included mountains valleys a cañon and such far extending groves of golden fruit that edna already called the captain the prince of orange  ednas brother ralph had also been in plainton he had come there to see his sister and captain horn and that splendid old woman mrs cliff but soon after he reached the town it might well be supposed it was mr burke whom he came to visit this worthy mariner and builder still lived in plainton his passion for an inland residence had again grown upon him and he seemed to have given up all thoughts of the sea he and ralph had royal times together and if the boy had not felt that he must go with captain horn and his sister to view the wonders of the far west he and burke would have concocted some grand expedition intended for some sort of an effect upon the civilization of the world  but although mrs cliff for many reasons had no present desire to leave her home she did not relinquish the enterprise for which the summer shelter had been designed when captain hagar had gone to london and had reported to his owners the details of his dire and disastrous misfortune he had been made the subject of censure and severe criticism but while no reason could be found why he should be legally punished for what had happened he was made to understand that there was no ship for him in the gift of the house he had so long served  when mrs cliff heard of thisand she heard of it very soon through captain hornshe immediately offered captain hagar the command of the summer shelter assuring him that her designs included cruises of charity in the north in summer and in tropical waters in the wintertime and that of all men she knew of he was the captain who should command her yacht he was indeed admirably adapted to this service for he was of a kind and gentle nature and loved children and he had such an observing mind that it frequently happened when he had looked over a new set of passengers and had observed their physical tendencies that he did not take a trip to sea at all but cruised up the smooth quiet waters of the hudson  as soon as it could possibly be done captain horn caused messages to be sent to many ports on the french and spanish coast and along the mediterranean in order that if the vittorio arrived in any of these harbors her officers and men might be seized and held but it was a long time before there was any news of the pirate ship and then she was heard of at mogador a port on the western coast of morocco where she had been sold under very peculiar circumstances and for a very small price by the men who had come there in her and who had departed north at different times on tradingvessels which were bound for marseilles and gibraltar  more definite information was received of the third of the pirate vessels which had been fitted out to capture the peruvians treasure for as this vessel approached the west indies she was overhauled by a spanish cruiser who finding her manned by a suspicious crew and well supplied with firearms had seized her as a filibuster and had taken her into a cuban port where she still remained with her crew in prison awaiting trial or a tardy release in case it became inconvenient to detain them longer  the other pirate vessel on which captain hagar and his men had been placed when they were forced to leave the dunkery beacon finally reached georgetown british guiana where after a long course of legal action it was condemned and sold and as much of the price as was left after costs had been paid was handed over to the owners of the dunkery beacon  among the reasons which made mrs cliff very glad to remain at plainton was one of paramount importance she was now engaged in a great work which satisfied all her aspirations and desires to make herself able to worthily and conscientiously cope with her income  when after the party on the summer shelter had separated at new york and the exmembers of the synod had gone to their homes mrs cliff and her party which included shirley as well as captain horn and his wife had reached plainton their minds were greatly occupied with the subject of the loss of the peruvians share of the incas treasures it was delightful for mrs cliff and willy to reach again their charming home and their friends were filled with a pleasure which they could scarcely express to see and enjoy the beauties and the comforts with which mrs cliff had surrounded herself but there was still upon them all the shadow of that great misfortune which had happened off the eastern coast of south america  news came to them of what had been said and done in london and of what had been said and done not only in peru but in other states of south america in regard to the loss of the treasure but nothing was said of done in any quarter which tended to invalidate their right to the share of the gold which had been adjudged to them the portion of the treasure allotted to the peruvian government had been duly delivered to its agents and it was the fault of those agents acting under the feverish orders of their superiors which had been the reason of its injudicious and hasty transportation and consequent loss  but although the ownership of the treasure which was now in the safe possession of those to whom it had been adjudged was not considered a matter to be questioned or discussed mrs cliff was not satisfied with the case as it stood and her dissatisfaction rapidly spread to the other members of the party it pained her to think that the native peruvians those who might be considered the descendants of the incas would now derive no benefit from the discovery of the treasure of their ancestors and she announced her intention to devote a portion of her wealth to the interests and advantage of these natives  captain horn was much impressed with this idea and agreed that if mrs cliff would take the management of the enterprise into her own hands he would contribute largely to any plan which she might adopt for the benefit of the peruvians edna who now held a large portion of the treasure in her own right insisted upon being allowed to contribute her share to this object and burke and shirley declared that they would become partners according to their means in the good work  there was of course a great deal of talk and discussion in regard to the best way of using the very large amount of money which had been contributed by the various members of the party but before captain horn and his wife left plainton everything was arranged and mrs cliff found herself at the head of an important and wellendowed private mission to the native inhabitants of peru she did not make immediately a definite plan of action but her first steps in the direction of her great object showed that she was a woman well qualified to organize and carry on the great work in the cause of civilization and enlightenment which she had undertaken she engaged the reverend mr hodgson and the reverend mr litchfield both young men whose dispositions led them to prefer earnest work in new and foreign lands to the ordinary labors of a domestic parish to go to peru to survey the scene of the proposed work and to report what in their opinion ought to be done and how it should be undertaken  mrs cliff now in the very maturity of her mental and physical powers felt that this great work was the most congenial task that she could possibly have undertaken and her future life now seemed open before her in a series of worthy endeavors in which her conscientious feelings in regard to her responsibilities and her desire to benefit her fellowbeings should be fully satisfied as to her fellowworkers and those of her friends who thoroughly comprehended the nature of the case there was a general belief that those inhabitants of peru who were rightfully entitled to the benefits of the discovered treasure would under her management and direction of the funds in her hands receive far more good and advantage than they could possibly have expected had the treasure gone to the peruvian government in fact there were those who said that had the dunkery beacon safely arrived in the port of callao the whole of the continent of south america might have been disturbed and disrupted by the immense overbalance of wealth thrown into the treasury of one of its states  it is true that mrs cliffs plans and purposes did not entirely pass without criticism its all very well said miss nancy shott to mrs ferguson one morning when the latter had called upon her with a little basket of cake and preserves for mrs cliff to be sending her money to the colored poor of south america but a person who has lived as she has lived in days gone by ought to remember that there are poor people who are not colored and who live a great deal nearer than south america miss shott was at work as she said this but she could always talk when she was working she was busy packing the california blankets which mrs cliff had given her in a box for the summer putting pieces of camphor rolled up in paper between their folds if she wanted to find people to give money to she neednt hire ministers to go out and hunt for them there are plenty of them here right under her nose and if she doesnt see them its because she shuts her eyes wilfully and wont look  but it seems to me miss shott said mrs ferguson that mrs cliff has done ever so much for the people of plainton for instance there are those blankets what perfectly splendid things they areso soft and light and yet so thick and warm theyre all wool every thread of them i have no doubt  all wool said miss shott of course they are and thats the trouble with them some of these days theyll have to be washed and then theyll shrink up so short that i suppose ill have to freeze either my chin or my toes and as to her giving them to me turn abouts fair play i once joined in to give her a pair  oh said mrs ferguson  mr george burke was now the only member of our little party of friends who did not seem entirely satisfied with his condition and prospects he made no complaints but he was restless and discontented he did not want to go to sea for he vowed he had had enough of it and he did not seem to find any satisfaction in a life on shore he paid a visit to his mother but he did not stay with her very long for plainton seemed to suit him better but when he returned to his house in that town he soon left it to go and spend a few days with shirley  when he came back mrs cliff who believed that his uneasy state of mind was the result of want of occupation and the monotonous life of a small town advised him to go out west and visit captain horn there was so much in that grand country to interest him and to occupy him body and mind but to this advice mr burke stoutly objected  im not going out there he said ive seen enough of captain horn and his wife to tell you the truth mrs cliff thats whats the matter with me  i dont understand you said she  its simply this said burke since ive seen so much of the captain and his wife and the happiness they get out of each other ive found out that the kind of happiness theyve got is exactly the kind of happiness i want and there isnt anything elsemoney or land or orange groves or steamshipsthat can take the place of it  in other words said mrs cliff with a smile you want to get married  youve hit it exactly said he i want a wife of course i dont expect to get exactly such a wife as captain horn hastheyre about as scarce as buried treasure i take itbut i want one who will suit me and who is suited to me thats what i want and i shall never be happy until i get her  i should think it would be easy enough for you to get a wife mr burke said mrs cliff you are in the prime of life you have plenty of money and i dont believe it would be at all hard to find a good woman who would be glad to have you  thats what my mother said said he when i was there she bored me from morning until night by telling me i ought to get married and mentioning girls on cape cod who would be glad to have me but there isnt any girl on cape cod that i want to get rid of them i came away sooner than i intended  well then said mrs cliff perhaps there is some one in particular that you would like to have  thats it exactly said burke there is some one in particular  and do you mind telling me who it is she asked  since you ask me i dont mind a bit said he its miss croup  mrs cliff started back astonished willy croup she exclaimed you amaze me i dont think she would suit you  id like to know why not he asked quickly  in the first place said she its a long time since willy was a girl  thats the kind i want he answered i dont want to adopt a daughter i want to marry a grown woman  well said mrs cliff willy is certainly grown but then it doesnt seem to me that she would be adapted to a married life i am sure she has made up her mind to live single and she hasnt been accustomed to manage a house and conduct domestic affairs she has always had some one to depend upon  thats what i like said he let her depend on me and as to management you neednt say anything to me about that mrs cliff i saw her bouncing to the galley of the summer shelter and if she manages other things as well as she managed the cooking business there shell suit me  it seems so strange to me mr burke said mrs cliff after a few moments silence i never imagined that you would care for willy croup  mr burke drew himself forward to the edge of the chair on which he was sitting he put one hand on each of his outspread knees and he leaned forward with a very earnest and animated expression on his countenance now look here mrs cliff he said i want to say something to you when i see a young woman brought up in the very bosom of the sunday school and on the quarter deck of respectability and who never perhaps had a cross word said to her in all her life or said one to anybody judging from her appearance and whose mind is more like a clean pockethandkerchief in regard to hard words and rough language than anything i can think ofwhen i see that young woman with a snowwhite disposition that would naturally lead her to hymns whenever she wanted to raise her voice above common conversationwhen i see that young woman i say in a moment of life or death to her and every one about her dash to the door of that engine room and shout my orders down to that muddled engineerknowing i couldnt leave the wheel to give them myselframming them into him as if with the point of a handspike yelling out everything that i said word for word without picking or choosing trusting in me that i knew what ought to be said in such a moment and saying it after me word for word cursing swearing slamming down oaths on him just as i did trusting in me all the time as to what words ought to be used and just warming up that blasted engineer until sense enough came to him to make him put out his hand and back herthen mrs cliff i know that a woman who stands by me at a time like that will stand by me at any time and thats the woman i want to stand by and now what have you got to say  all i have to say answered mrs cliff who had been listening intently to mr burkes extraordinary flow of words all i have to say is if thats the way you think about her you ought to speak to her  madam said burke springing to his feet that suits me i would have spoken to her before but i had my doubts about what youd think of it but now that i see youre willing to sign the papers what i want to know is where will i be likely to find miss croup  mrs cliff laughed you are very prompt said she and i think you will find willy in the little parlor she was sewing there when i saw her last  in less than a minute mr burke stood before willy croup in the little parlor miss croup said he i want to ask you something  illustration willy sat and looked at him  what is it said willy letting her work drop in her lap  miss croup said he i heard you swear once and i never heard anybody swear better and with more conscience you did that swearing for me and now i want to ask you if you will be willing to swear for me again  no said willy her cheeks flushing as she spoke no i wont it was all very well for you to tell me that i didnt do anything wrong when i talked in that dreadful way to mr maxwell and for you to get the ministers to tell me that as i didnt understand what i was saying of course there was no sin in it but although i dont feel as badly about it as i did i sometimes wake up in the night and fairly shiver when i think of the words i used that day and ive made up my mind no matter whether ships are to be sunk or what is to happen i will never do that thing again and i dont want you ever to expect it of me  but william croup exclaimed mr burke forgetting in his excitement that the full form of her christian name was not likely to be masculine that isnt the way i want you to swear this time what i want you to do is to stand up alongside of me in front of a minister and swear youll take me for your loving husband to love honor and protect and all the rest of it till death do us part now what do you say to that  willy sat and looked at him the flush went out of her cheeks and then came again but it was a different kind of a flush this time and the brightness went out of her eyes and another light a softer and a different light came into them oh is that what you want she said presently i wouldnt mind that   the end                                         novels and short stories  by  frank r stockton   charles scribners sons publishers new york   of mr

fanciful humor        concerning mr stocktons stories       mr stockton more perhaps than any recent writer has helped to      define the peculiar virtues of the short story he has shown how

not      rely often upon a sudden reversal at the end of a story to capture      the reader but gives him a whimsey or caprice to enjoy while he      works out the details in a succession of amusing
