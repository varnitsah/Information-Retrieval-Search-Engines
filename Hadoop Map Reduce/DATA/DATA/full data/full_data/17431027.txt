17431027	novel notes   to bighearted bigsouled bigbodied friend conan doyle     prologue   years ago when i was very small we lived in a great house in a long straight browncoloured street in the east end of london  it was a noisy crowded street in the daytime but a silent lonesome street at night when the gaslights few and far between partook of the character of lighthouses rather than of illuminants and the tramp tramp of the policeman on his long beat seemed to be ever drawing nearer or fading away except for brief moments when the footsteps ceased as he paused to rattle a door or window or to flash his lantern into some dark passage leading down towards the river  the house had many advantages so my father would explain to friends who expressed surprise at his choosing such a residence and among these was included in my own small morbid mind the circumstance that its back windows commanded an uninterrupted view of an ancient and muchpeopled churchyard  often of a night would i steal from between the sheets and climbing upon the high oak chest that stood before my bedroom window sit peering down fearfully upon the aged gray tombstones far below wondering whether the shadows that crept among them might not be ghostssoiled ghosts that had lost their natural whiteness by long exposure to the citys smoke and had grown dingy like the snow that sometimes lay there  i persuaded myself that they were ghosts and came at length to have quite a friendly feeling for them  i wondered what they thought when they saw the fading letters of their own names upon the stones whether they remembered themselves and wished they were alive again or whether they were happier as they were  but that seemed a still sadder idea  one night as i sat there watching i felt a hand upon my shoulder  i was not frightened because it was a soft gentle hand that i well knew so i merely laid my cheek against it  whats mummas naughty boy doing out of bed  shall i beat him  and the other hand was laid against my other cheek and i could feel the soft curls mingling with my own  only looking at the ghosts ma i answered  theres such a lot of em down there  then i added musingly i wonder what it feels like to be a ghost  my mother said nothing but took me up in her arms and carried me back to bed and then sitting down beside me and holding my hand in hersthere was not so very much difference in the sizebegan to sing in that low caressing voice of hers that always made me feel for the time being that i wanted to be a good boy a song she often used to sing to me and that i have never heard any one else sing since and should not care to  but while she sang something fell on my hand that caused me to sit up and insist on examining her eyes  she laughed rather a strange broken little laugh i thought and said it was nothing and told me to lie still and go to sleep  so i wriggled down again and shut my eyes tight but i could not understand what had made her cry  poor little mother she had a notion founded evidently upon inborn belief rather than upon observation that all children were angels and that in consequence an altogether exceptional demand existed for them in a certain other place where there are more openings for angels rendering their retention in this world difficult and undependable  my talk about ghosts must have made that foolishly fond heart ache with a vague dread that night and for many a night onward i fear  for some time after this i would often look up to find my mothers eyes fixed upon me  especially closely did she watch me at feeding times and on these occasions as the meal progressed her face would acquire an expression of satisfaction and relief  once during dinner i heard her whisper to my father for children are not quite so deaf as their elders think he seems to eat all right  eat replied my father in the same penetrating undertone if he dies of anything it will be of eating  so my little mother grew less troubled and as the days went by saw reason to think that my brother angels might consent to do without me for yet a while longer and i putting away the child with his ghostly fancies became in course of time a grownup person and ceased to believe in ghosts together with many other things that perhaps it were better for a man if he did believe in  but the memory of that dingy graveyard and of the shadows that dwelt therein came back to me very vividly the other day for it seemed to me as though i were a ghost myself gliding through the silent streets where once i had passed swiftly full of life  diving into a long unopened drawer i had by chance drawn forth a dusty volume of manuscript labelled upon its torn brown paper cover novel notes  the scent of dead days clung to its dogseared pages and as it lay open before me my memory wandered back to the summer eveningsnot so very long ago perhaps if one but adds up the years but a long long while ago if one measures time by feelingwhen four friends had sat together making it who would never sit together any more  with each crumpled leaf i turned the uncomfortable conviction that i was only a ghost grew stronger  the handwriting was my own but the words were the words of a stranger so that as i read i wondered to myself saying did i ever think this did i really hope that did i plan to do this did i resolve to be such does life then look so to the eyes of a young man not knowing whether to smile or sigh  the book was a compilation half diary half memoranda  in it lay the record of many musings of many talks and out of itselecting what seemed suitable adding altering and arrangingi have shaped the chapters that hereafter follow  that i have a right to do so i have fully satisfied my own conscience an exceptionally fussy one  of the four joint authors he whom i call macshaughnassy has laid aside his title to all things beyond six feet of sunscorched ground in the african veldt while from him i have designated brown i have borrowed but little and that little i may fairly claim to have made my own by reason of the artistic merit with which i have embellished it  indeed in thus taking a few of his bald ideas and shaping them into readable form am i not doing him a kindness and thereby returning good for evil  for has he not slipping from the high ambition of his youth sunk ever downward step by step until he has become a critic and therefore my natural enemy  does he not in the columns of a certain journal of large pretension but small circulation call me arry without an h the satirical rogue and is not his contempt for the englishspeaking people based chiefly upon the fact that some of them read my books  but in the days of bloomsbury lodgings and firstnight pits we thought each other clever  from jephson i hold a letter dated from a station deep in the heart of the queensland bush  do what you like with it dear boy the letter runs so long as you keep me out of it  thanks for your complimentary regrets but i cannot share them  i was never fitted for a literary career  lucky for me i found it out in time  some poor devils dont im not getting at you old man  we read all your stuff and like it very much  time hangs a bit heavy you know here in the winter and we are glad of almost anything  this life suits me better  i love to feel my horse between my thighs and the sun upon my skin  and there are the youngsters growing up about us and the hands to look after and the stock  i daresay it seems a very commonplace unintellectual life to you but it satisfies my nature more than the writing of books could ever do besides there are too many authors as it is  the world is so busy reading and writing it has no time left for thinking  youll tell me of course that books are thought but that is only the jargon of the press  you come out here old man and sit as i do sometimes for days and nights together alone with the dumb cattle on an upheaved island of earth as it were jutting out into the deep sky and you will know that they are not  what a man thinksreally thinksgoes down into him and grows in silence  what a man writes in books are the thoughts that he wishes to be thought to think  poor jephson he promised so well at one time  but he always had strange notions     chapter i   when on returning home one evening after a pipe party at my friend jephsons i informed my wife that i was going to write a novel she expressed herself as pleased with the idea  she said she had often wondered i had never thought of doing so before  look she added how silly all the novels are nowadays im sure you could write one ethelbertha intended to be complimentary i am convinced but there is a looseness about her mode of expression which at times renders her meaning obscure  when however i told her that my friend jephson was going to collaborate with me she remarked oh in a doubtful tone and when i further went on to explain to her that selkirk brown and derrick macshaughnassy were also going to assist she replied oh in a tone which contained no trace of doubtfulness whatever and from which it was clear that her interest in the matter as a practical scheme had entirely evaporated  i fancy that the fact of my three collaborators being all bachelors diminished somewhat our chances of success in ethelberthas mind against bachelors as a class she entertains a strong prejudice  a mans not having sense enough to want to marry or having that not having wit enough to do it argues to her thinking either weakness of intellect or natural depravity the former rendering its victim unable and the latter unfit ever to become a really useful novelist  i tried to make her understand the peculiar advantages our plan possessed  you see i explained in the usual commonplace novel we only get as a matter of fact one persons ideas  now in this novel there will be four clever men all working together  the public will thus be enabled to obtain the thoughts and opinions of the whole four of us at the price usually asked for merely one authors views  if the british reader knows his own business he will order this book early to avoid disappointment such an opportunity may not occur again for years  ethelbertha agreed that this was probable  besides i continued my enthusiasm waxing stronger the more i reflected upon the matter this work is going to be a genuine bargain in another way also  we are not going to put our mere everyday ideas into it  we are going to crowd into this one novel all the wit and wisdom that the whole four of us possess if the book will hold it  we shall not write another novel after this one  indeed we shall not be able to we shall have nothing more to write  this work will partake of the nature of an intellectual clearance sale  we are going to put into this novel simply all we know  ethelbertha shut her lips and said something inside and then remarked aloud that she supposed it would be a one volume affair  i felt hurt at the implied sneer  i pointed out to her that there already existed a numerous body of speciallytrained men employed to do nothing else but make disagreeable observations upon authors and their worksa duty that so far as i could judge they seemed capable of performing without any amateur assistance whatever  and i hinted that by his own fireside a literary man looked to breathe a more sympathetic atmosphere  ethelbertha replied that of course i knew what she meant  she said that she was not thinking of me and that jephson was no doubt sensible enough jephson is engaged but she did not see the object of bringing half the parish into it  nobody suggested bringing half the parish into it  ethelbertha will talk so wildly  to suppose that brown and macshaughnassy could be of any use whatever she considered absurd  what could a couple of raw bachelors know about life and human nature  as regarded macshaughnassy in particular she was of opinion that if we only wanted out of him all that he knew and could keep him to the subject we ought to be able to get that into about a page  my wifes present estimate of macshaughnassys knowledge is the result of reaction  the first time she ever saw him she and he got on wonderfully well together and when i returned to the drawingroom after seeing him down to the gate her first words were what a wonderful man that mr macshaughnassy is  he seems to know so much about everything  that describes macshaughnassy exactly  he does seem to know a tremendous lot  he is possessed of more information than any man i ever came across  occasionally it is correct information but speaking broadly it is remarkable for its marvellous unreliability  where he gets it from is a secret that nobody has ever yet been able to fathom  ethelbertha was very young when we started housekeeping  our first butcher very nearly lost her custom i remember once and for ever by calling her missie and giving her a message to take back to her mother  she arrived home in tears  she said that perhaps she wasnt fit to be anybodys wife but she did not see why she should be told so by the tradespeople  she was naturally somewhat inexperienced in domestic affairs and feeling this keenly was grateful to any one who would give her useful hints and advice  when macshaughnassy came along he seemed in her eyes a sort of glorified mrs beeton  he knew everything wanted to be known inside a house from the scientific method of peeling a potato to the cure of spasms in cats and ethelbertha would sit at his feet figuratively speaking and gain enough information in one evening to make the house unlivable in for a month  he told her how fires ought to be laid  he said that the way fires were usually laid in this country was contrary to all the laws of nature and he showed her how the thing was done in crim tartary or some such place where the science of laying fires is alone properly understood  he proved to her that an immense saving in time and labour to say nothing of coals could be effected by the adoption of the crim tartary system and he taught it to her then and there and she went straight downstairs and explained it to the girl  amenda our then general was an extremely stolid young person and in some respects a model servant  she never argued  she never seemed to have any notions of her own whatever  she accepted our ideas without comment and carried them out with such pedantic precision and such evident absence of all feeling of responsibility concerning the result as to surround our home legislation with quite a military atmosphere  on the present occasion she stood quietly by while the macshaughnassy method of firelaying was expounded to her  when ethelbertha had finished she simply said  you want me to lay the fires like that  yes amenda well always have the fires laid like that in future if you please  all right mum replied amenda with perfect unconcern and there the matter ended for that evening  on coming downstairs the next morning we found the breakfast table spread very nicely but there was no breakfast  we waited  ten minutes went bya quarter of an hourtwenty minutes  then ethelbertha rang the bell  in response amenda presented herself calm and respectful  do you know that the proper time for breakfast is halfpast eight amenda  yesm  and do you know that its now nearly nine  yesm  well isnt breakfast ready  no mum  will it ever be ready  well mum replied amenda in a tone of genial frankness to tell you the truth i dont think it ever will  whats the reason  wont the fire light  oh yes it lights all right  well then why cant you cook the breakfast  because before you can turn yourself round it goes out again  amenda never volunteered statements  she answered the question put to her and then stopped dead  i called downstairs to her on one occasion before i understood her peculiarities to ask her if she knew the time she replied yes sir and disappeared into the back kitchen  at the end of thirty seconds or so i called down again  i asked you amenda i said reproachfully to tell me the time about ten minutes ago  oh did you she called back pleasantly  i beg your pardon  i thought you asked me if i knew itits halfpast four  ethelbertha inquiredto return to our fireif she had tried lighting it again  oh yes mum answered the girl  ive tried four times  then she added cheerfully ill try again if you like mum  amenda was the most willing servant we ever paid wages to  ethelbertha said she would step down and light the fire herself and told amenda to follow her and watch how she did it  i felt interested in the experiment and followed also  ethelbertha tucked up her frock and set to work  amenda and i stood around and looked on  at the end of half an hour ethelbertha retired from the contest hot dirty and a trifle irritable  the fireplace retained the same cold cynical expression with which it had greeted our entrance  then i tried  i honestly tried my best  i was eager and anxious to succeed  for one reason i wanted my breakfast  for another i wanted to be able to say that i had done this thing  it seemed to me that for any human being to light a fire laid as that fire was laid would be a feat to be proud of  to light a fire even under ordinary circumstances is not too easy a task to do so handicapped by macshaughnassys rules would i felt be an achievement pleasant to look back upon  my idea had i succeeded would have been to go round the neighbourhood and brag about it  however i did not succeed  i lit various other things including the kitchen carpet and the cat who would come sniffing about but the materials within the stove appeared to be fireproof  ethelbertha and i sat down one each side of our cheerless hearth and looked at one another and thought of macshaughnassy until amenda chimed in on our despair with one of those practical suggestions of hers that she occasionally threw out for us to accept or not as we chose  maybe said she id better light it in the old way just for today  do amenda said ethelbertha rising  and then she added i think well always have them lighted in the old way amenda if you please  another time he showed us how to make coffeeaccording to the arabian method  arabia must be a very untidy country if they made coffee often over there  he dirtied two saucepans three jugs one tablecloth one nutmeggrater one hearthrug three cups and himself  this made coffee for twowhat would have been necessary in the case of a party one dares not think  that we did not like the coffee when made macshaughnassy attributed to our debased tastethe result of long indulgence in an inferior article he drank both cups himself and afterwards went home in a cab  he had an aunt in those days i remember a mysterious old lady who lived in some secluded retreat from where she wrought incalculable mischief upon macshaughnassys friends  what he did not knowthe one or two things that he was not an authority uponthis aunt of his knew no he would say with engaging candourno that is a thing i cannot advise you about myself  but he would add ill tell you what ill do  ill write to my aunt and ask her  and a day or two afterwards he would call again bringing his aunts advice with him and if you were young and inexperienced or a natural born fool you might possibly follow it  she sent us a recipe on one occasion through macshaughnassy for the extermination of blackbeetles  we occupied a very picturesque old house but as with most picturesque old houses its advantages were chiefly external  there were many holes and cracks and crevices within its creaking framework  frogs who had lost their way and taken the wrong turning would suddenly discover themselves in the middle of our dining room apparently quite as much to their own surprise and annoyance as to ours  a numerous company of rats and mice remarkably fond of physical exercise had fitted the place up as a gymnasium for themselves and our kitchen after ten oclock was turned into a blackbeetles club  they came up through the floor and out through the walls and gambolled there in their lighthearted reckless way till daylight  the rats and mice amenda did not object to  she said she liked to watch them  but against the blackbeetles she was prejudiced  therefore when my wife informed her that macshaughnassys aunt had given us an infallible recipe for their annihilation she rejoiced  we purchased the materials manufactured the mixture and put it about the beetles came and ate it  they seemed to like it  they finished it all up and were evidently vexed that there was not more  but they did not die  we told these facts to macshaughnassy  he smiled a very grim smile and said in a low tone full of meaning let them eat  it appeared that this was one of those slow insidious poisons  it did not kill the beetle off immediately but it undermined his constitution day by day he would sink and droop without being able to tell what was the matter with himself until one morning we should enter the kitchen to find him lying cold and very still  so we made more stuff and laid it round each night and the blackbeetles from all about the parish swarmed to it  each night they came in greater quantities  they fetched up all their friends and relations  strange beetlesbeetles from other families with no claim on us whatevergot to hear about the thing and came in hordes and tried to rob our blackbeetles of it  by the end of a week we had lured into our kitchen every beetle that wasnt lame for miles round  macshaughnassy said it was a good thing  we should clear the suburb at one swoop  the beetles had now been eating this poison steadily for ten days and he said that the end could not be far off  i was glad to hear it because i was beginning to find this unlimited hospitality expensive it was a dear poison that we were giving them and they were hearty eaters  we went downstairs to see how they were getting on  macshaughnassy thought they seemed queer and was of opinion that they were breaking up speaking for myself i can only say that a healthierlooking lot of beetles i never wish to see  one it is true did die that very evening  he was detected in the act of trying to make off with an unfairly large portion of the poison and three or four of the others set upon him savagely and killed him  but he was the only one so far as i could ever discover to whom macshaughnassys recipe proved fatal  as for the others they grew fat and sleek upon it  some of them indeed began to acquire quite a figure  we lessened their numbers eventually by the help of some common oilshop stuff  but such vast numbers attracted by macshaughnassys poison had settled in the house that to finally exterminate them now was hopeless  i have not heard of macshaughnassys aunt lately  possibly one of macshaughnassys bosom friends has found out her address and has gone down and murdered her  if so i should like to thank him  i tried a little while ago to cure macshaughnassy of his fatal passion for advicegiving by repeating to him a very sad story that was told to me by a gentleman i met in an american railway car  i was travelling from buffalo to new york and during the day it suddenly occurred to me that i might make the journey more interesting by leaving the cars at albany and completing the distance by water  but i did not know how the boats ran and i had no guidebook with me  i glanced about for some one to question  a mildlooking elderly gentleman sat by the next window reading a book the cover of which was familiar to me  i deemed him to be intelligent and approached him  i beg your pardon for interrupting you i said sitting down opposite to him but could you give me any information about the boats between albany and new york  well he answered looking up with a pleasant smile there are three lines of boats altogether  there is the heggarty line but they only go as far as catskill  then there are the poughkeepsie boats which go every other day  or there is what we call the canal boat  oh i said  well now which would you advise me to  he jumped to his feet with a cry and stood glaring down at me with a gleam in his eyes which was positively murderous  you villain he hissed in low tones of concentrated fury so thats your game is it  ill give you something that youll want advice about and he whipped out a sixchambered revolver  i felt hurt  i also felt that if the interview were prolonged i might feel even more hurt  so i left him without a word and drifted over to the other end of the car where i took up a position between a stout lady and the door  i was still musing upon the incident when looking up i observed my elderly friend making towards me  i rose and laid my hand upon the door knob  he should not find me unprepared  he smiled reassuringly however and held out his hand  ive been thinking he said that maybe i was a little rude just now i should like if you will let me to explain  i think when you have heard my story you will understand and forgive me  there was that about him which made me trust him  we found a quiet corner in the smokingcar  i had a whiskey sour and he prescribed for himself a strange thing of his own invention  then we lighted our cigars and he talked  thirty years ago said he i was a young man with a healthy belief in myself and a desire to do good to others  i did not imagine myself a genius  i did not even consider myself exceptionally brilliant or talented  but it did seem to me and the more i noted the doings of my fellowmen and women the more assured did i become of it that i possessed plain practical common sense to an unusual and remarkable degree  conscious of this i wrote a little book which i entitled how to be happy wealthy and wise and published it at my own expense  i did not seek for profit  i merely wished to be useful  the book did not make the stir that i had anticipated  some two or three hundred copies went off and then the sale practically ceased  i confess that at first i was disappointed  but after a while i reflected that if people would not take my advice it was more their loss than mine and i dismissed the matter from my mind  one morning about a twelvemonth afterwards i was sitting in my study when the servant entered to say that there was a man downstairs who wanted very much to see me  i gave instructions that he should be sent up and up accordingly he came  he was a common man but he had an open intelligent countenance and his manner was most respectful  i motioned him to be seated  he selected a chair and sat down on the extreme edge of it  i hope youll pardn this intrusion sir he began speaking deliberately and twirling his hat the while but ive come moren two hundred miles to see you sir  i expressed myself as pleased and he continued they tell me sir as youre the gentleman as wrote that little book how to be happy wealthy and wise  he enumerated the three items slowly dwelling lovingly on each  i admitted the fact  ah thats a wonderful book sir he went on  i aint one of them as has got brains of their ownnot to speak ofbut i know enough to know them as has and when i read that little book i says to myself josiah hackett thats my name sir when youre in doubt dont you get addling that thick head o yours as will only tell you all wrong you go to the gentleman as wrote that little book and ask him for his advice  he is a kindhearted gentleman as any one can tell and hell give it you and when youve got it you go straight ahead full steam and dont you stop for nothing cause hell know whats best for you same as he knows whats best for everybody  thats what i says sir and thats what im here for  he paused and wiped his brow with a green cotton handkerchief  i prayed him to proceed  it appeared that the worthy fellow wanted to marry but could not make up his mind whom he wanted to marry  he had his eyeso he expressed itupon two young women and they he had reason to believe regarded him in return with more than usual favour  his difficulty was to decide which of the twoboth of them excellent and deserving young personswould make him the best wife  the one juliana the only daughter of a retired seacaptain he described as a winsome lassie  the other hannah was an older and altogether more womanly girl  she was the eldest of a large family  her father he said was a godfearing man and was doing well in the timber trade  he asked me which of them i should advise him to marry  i was flattered  what man in my position would not have been  this josiah hackett had come from afar to hear my wisdom  he was willingnay anxiousto entrust his whole lifes happiness to my discretion  that he was wise in so doing i entertained no doubt  the choice of a wife i had always held to be a matter needing a calm unbiassed judgment such as no lover could possibly bring to bear upon the subject  in such a case i should not have hesitated to offer advice to the wisest of men  to this poor simpleminded fellow i felt it would be cruel to refuse it  he handed me photographs of both the young persons under consideration i jotted down on the back of each such particulars as i deemed would assist me in estimating their respective fitness for the vacancy in question and promised to carefully consider the problem and write him in a day or two  his gratitude was touching  dont you trouble to write no letters sir he said you just stick down julia or hannah on a bit of paper and put it in an envelope  i shall know what it means and thats the one as i shall marry  then he gripped me by the hand and left me  i gave a good deal of thought to the selection of josiahs wife  i wanted him to be happy  juliana was certainly very pretty  there was a lurking playfulness about the corners of julianas mouth which conjured up the sound of rippling laughter  had i acted on impulse i should have clasped juliana in josiahs arms  but i reflected more sterling qualities than mere playfulness and prettiness are needed for a wife  hannah though not so charming clearly possessed both energy and sensequalities highly necessary to a poor mans wife  hannahs father was a pious man and was doing wella thrifty saving man no doubt  he would have instilled into her lessons of economy and virtue and later on she might possibly come in for a little something  she was the eldest of a large family  she was sure to have had to help her mother a good deal  she would be experienced in household matters and would understand the bringing up of children  julias father on the other hand was a retired seacaptain  seafaring folk are generally loose sort of fish  he had probably been in the habit of going about the house using language and expressing views the hearing of which could not but have exercised an injurious effect upon the formation of a growing girls character  juliana was his only child only children generally make bad men and women  they are allowed to have their own way too much  the pretty daughter of a retired seacaptain would be certain to be spoilt  josiah i had also to remember was a man evidently of weak character he would need management  now there was something about hannahs eye that eminently suggested management  at the end of two days my mind was made up  i wrote hannah on a slip of paper and posted it  a fortnight afterwards i received a letter from josiah  he thanked me for my advice but added incidentally that he wished i could have made it julia  however he said he felt sure i knew best and by the time i received the letter he and hannah would be one  that letter worried me  i began to wonder if after all i had chosen the right girl  suppose hannah was not all i thought her  what a terrible thing it would be for josiah  what data sufficient to reason upon had i possessed  how did i know that hannah was not a lazy ill tempered girl a continual thorn in the side of her poor overworked mother and a perpetual blister to her younger brothers and sisters  how did i know she had been well brought up  her father might be a precious old fraud most seemingly pious men are  she may have learned from him only hypocrisy  then also how did i know that julianas merry childishness would not ripen into sweet cheerful womanliness  her father for all i knew to the contrary might be the model of what a retired seacaptain should be with possibly a snug little sum safely invested somewhere  and juliana was his only child  what reason had i for rejecting this fair young creatures love for josiah  i took her photo from my desk  i seemed to detect a reproachful look in the big eyes  i saw before me the scene in the little faraway home when the first tidings of josiahs marriage fell like a cruel stone into the hitherto placid waters of her life  i saw her kneeling by her fathers chair while the whitehaired bronzed old man gently stroked the golden head shaking with silent sobs against his breast  my remorse was almost more than i could bear  i put her aside and took up hannahmy chosen one  she seemed to be regarding me with a smile of heartless triumph  there began to take possession of me a feeling of positive dislike to hannah  i fought against the feeling  i told myself it was prejudice  but the more i reasoned against it the stronger it became  i could tell that as the days went by it would grow from dislike to loathing from loathing to hate  and this was the woman i had deliberately selected as a life companion for josiah  for weeks i knew no peace of mind  every letter that arrived i dreaded to open fearing it might be from josiah  at every knock i started up and looked about for a hidingplace  every time i came across the heading domestic tragedy in the newspapers i broke into a cold perspiration  i expected to read that josiah and hannah had murdered each other and died cursing me  as the time went by however and i heard nothing my fears began to assuage and my belief in my own intuitive good judgment to return maybe i had done a good thing for josiah and hannah and they were blessing me  three years passed peacefully away and i was beginning to forget the existence of the hacketts  then he came again  i returned home from business one evening to find him waiting for me in the hall  the moment i saw him i knew that my worst fears had fallen short of the truth  i motioned him to follow me to my study  he did so and seated himself in the identical chair on which he had sat three years ago  the change in him was remarkable he looked old and careworn  his manner was that of resigned hopelessness  we remained for a while without speaking he twirling his hat as at our first interview i making a show of arranging papers on my desk  at length feeling that anything would be more bearable than this silence i turned to him  things have not been going well with you im afraid josiah i said  no sir he replied quietly i cant say as they have altogether that hannah of yours has turned out a bit of a teaser  there was no touch of reproach in his tones  he simply stated a melancholy fact  but she is a good wife to you in other ways i urged  she has her faults of course  we all have  but she is energetic  come now you will admit shes energetic  i owed it to myself to find some good in hannah and this was the only thing i could think of at that moment  oh yes shes that he assented  a little too much so for our sized house i sometimes think  you see he went on shes a bit cornery in her temper hannah is and then her mothers a bit trying at times  her mother i exclaimed but whats she got to do with you  well you see sir he answered shes living with us nowever since the old man went off  hannahs father  is he dead then  well not exactly sir he replied  he ran off about a twelvemonth ago with one of the young women who used to teach in the sunday school and joined the mormons  it came as a great surprise to every one  i groaned  and his business i inquiredthe timber business who carries that on  oh that answered josiah  oh that had to be sold to pay his debtsleastways to go towards em  i remarked what a terrible thing it was for his family  i supposed the home was broken up and they were all scattered  no sir he replied simply they aint scattered much  theyre all living with us  but there he continued seeing the look upon my face of course all this has nothing to do with you sir  youve got troubles of your own i daresay sir  i didnt come here to worry you with mine  that would be a poor return for all your kindness to me  what has become of julia i asked  i did not feel i wanted to question him any more about his own affairs  a smile broke the settled melancholy of his features  ah he said in a more cheerful tone than he had hitherto employed it does one good to think about her it does  shes married to a friend of mine now young sam jessop  i slips out and gives em a call now and then when hannah aint round  lord its like getting a glimpse of heaven to look into their little home  he often chaffs me about it sam does  well you was a sawnyheaded chunk josiah you was he often says to me were old chums you know sir sam and me so he dont mind joking a bit like  then the smile died away and he added with a sigh yes ive often thought since sir how jolly it would have been if you could have seen your way to making it juliana  i felt i must get him back to hannah at any cost  i said i suppose you and your wife are still living in the old place  yes he replied if you can call it living  its a hard struggle with so many of us  he said he did not know how he should have managed if it had not been for the help of julias father  he said the captain had behaved more like an angel than anything else he knew of  i dont say as hes one of your clever sort you know sir he explained  not the man as one would go to for advice like one would to you sir but hes a good sort for all that  and that reminds me sir he went on of what ive come here about youll think it very bold of me to ask sir but  i interrupted him  josiah i said i admit that i am much to blame for what has come upon you  you asked me for my advice and i gave it you  which of us was the bigger idiot we will not discuss  the point is that i did give it and i am not a man to shirk my responsibilities what in reason you ask and i can grant i will give you  he was overcome with gratitude  i knew it sir he said  i knew you would not refuse me  i said so to hannah  i said i will go to that gentleman and ask him  i will go to him and ask him for his advice  i said his what  his advice repeated josiah apparently surprised at my tone on a little matter as i cant quite make up my mind about  i thought at first he was trying to be sarcastic but he wasnt  that man sat there and wrestled with me for my advice as to whether he should invest a thousand dollars which julias father had offered to lend him in the purchase of a laundry business or a bar  he hadnt had enough of it my advice i mean he wanted it again and he spun me reasons why i should give it him  the choice of a wife was a different thing altogether he argued  perhaps he ought not to have asked me for my opinion as to that  but advice as to which of two trades a man would do best to select surely any business man could give  he said he had just been reading again my little book how to be happy etc and if the gentleman who wrote that could not decide between the respective merits of one particular laundry and one particular bar both situate in the same city well then all he had got to say was that knowledge and wisdom were clearly of no practical use in this world whatever  well it did seem a simple thing to advise a man about  surely as to a matter of this kind i a professed business man must be able to form a sounder judgment than this poor pumpkinheaded lamb  it would be heartless to refuse to help him  i promised to look into the matter and let him know what i thought  he rose and shook me by the hand  he said he would not try to thank me words would only seem weak  he dashed away a tear and went out  i brought an amount of thought to bear upon this thousanddollar investment sufficient to have floated a bank  i did not mean to make another hannah job if i could help it  i studied the papers josiah had left with me but did not attempt to form any opinion from them  i went down quietly to josiahs city and inspected both businesses on the spot i instituted secret but searching inquiries in the neighbourhood  i disguised myself as a simpleminded young man who had come into a little money and wormed myself into the confidence of the servants  i interviewed half the town upon the pretence that i was writing the commercial history of new england and should like some particulars of their career and i invariably ended my examination by asking them which was their favourite bar and where they got their washing done  i stayed a fortnight in the town  most of my spare time i spent at the bar  in my leisure moments i dirtied my clothes so that they might be washed at the laundry  as the result of my investigations i discovered that so far as the two businesses themselves were concerned there was not a pin to choose between them  it became merely a question of which particular trade would best suit the hacketts  i reflected  the keeper of a bar was exposed to much temptation  a weakminded man mingling continually in the company of topers might possibly end by giving way to drink  now josiah was an exceptionally weakminded man  it had also to be borne in mind that he had a shrewish wife and that her whole family had come to live with him  clearly to place josiah in a position of easy access to unlimited liquor would be madness  about a laundry on the other hand there was something soothing  the working of a laundry needed many hands  hannahs relatives might be used up in a laundry and made to earn their own living  hannah might expend her energy in flatironing and josiah could turn the mangle  the idea conjured up quite a pleasant domestic picture  i recommended the laundry  on the following monday josiah wrote to say that he had bought the laundry  on tuesday i read in the commercial intelligence that one of the most remarkable features of the time was the marvellous rise taking place all over new england in the value of hotel and bar property  on thursday in the list of failures i came across no less than four laundry proprietors and the paper added in explanation that the american washing industry owing to the rapid growth of chinese competition was practically on its last legs  i went out and got drunk  my life became a curse to me  all day long i thought of josiah  all night i dreamed of him  suppose that not content with being the cause of his domestic misery i had now deprived him of the means of earning a livelihood and had rendered useless the generosity of that good old sea captain  i began to appear to myself as a malignant fiend ever following this simple but worthy man to work evil upon him  time passed away however i heard nothing from or of him and my burden at last fell from me  then at the end of about five years he came again  he came behind me as i was opening the door with my latchkey and laid an unsteady hand upon my arm  it was a dark night but a gaslamp showed me his face  i recognised it in spite of the red blotches and the bleary film that hid the eyes  i caught him roughly by the arm and hurried him inside and up into my study  sit down i hissed and tell me the worst first  he was about to select his favourite chair  i felt that if i saw him and that particular chair in association for the third time i should do something terrible to both  i snatched it away from him and he sat down heavily on the floor and burst into tears  i let him remain there and thickly between hiccoughs he told his tale  the laundry had gone from bad to worse  a new railway had come to the town altering its whole topography  the business and residential portion had gradually shifted northward  the spot where the barthe particular one which i had rejected for the laundryhad formerly stood was now the commercial centre of the city  the man who had purchased it in place of josiah had sold out and made a fortune  the southern area where the laundry was situate was it had been discovered built upon a swamp and was in a highly unsanitary condition  careful housewives naturally objected to sending their washing into such a neighbourhood  other troubles had also come  the babyjosiahs pet the one bright thing in his lifehad fallen into the copper and been boiled  hannahs mother had been crushed in the mangle and was now a helpless cripple who had to be waited on day and night  under these accumulated misfortunes josiah had sought consolation in drink and had become a hopeless sot  he felt his degradation keenly and wept copiously  he said he thought that in a cheerful place such as a bar he might have been strong and brave but that there was something about the everlasting smell of damp clothes and suds that seemed to sap his manhood  i asked him what the captain had said to it all  he burst into fresh tears and replied that the captain was no more  that he added reminded him of what he had come about  the goodhearted old fellow had bequeathed him five thousand dollars  he wanted my advice as to how to invest it  my first impulse was to kill him on the spot  i wish now that i had  i restrained myself however and offered him the alternative of being thrown from the window or of leaving by the door without another word  he answered that he was quite prepared to go by the window if i would first tell him whether to put his money in the terra del fuego nitrate company limited or in the union pacific bank  life had no further interest for him  all he cared for was to feel that this little nestegg was safely laid by for the benefit of his beloved ones after he was gone  he pressed me to tell him what i thought of nitrates  i replied that i declined to say anything whatever on the subject  he assumed from my answer that i did not think much of nitrates and announced his intention of investing the money in consequence in the union pacific bank  i told him by all means to do so if he liked  he paused and seemed to be puzzling it out  then he smiled knowingly and said he thought he understood what i meant  it was very kind of me he should put every dollar he possessed in the terra del fuego nitrate company  he rose with difficulty to go  i stopped him  i knew as certainly as i knew the sun would rise the next morning that whichever company i advised him or he persisted in thinking i had advised him which was the same thing to invest in would sooner or later come to smash  my grandmother had all her little fortune in the terra del fuego nitrate company  i could not see her brought to penury in her old age  as for josiah it could make no difference to him whatever  he would lose his money in any event  i advised him to invest in union pacific bank shares  he went and did it  the union pacific bank held out for eighteen months  then it began to totter  the financial world stood bewildered  it had always been reckoned one of the safest banks in the country  people asked what could be the cause  i knew well enough but i did not tell  the bank made a gallant fight but the hand of fate was upon it  at the end of another nine months the crash came  nitrates it need hardly be said had all this time been going up by leaps and bounds  my grandmother died worth a million dollars and left the whole of it to a charity  had she known how i had saved her from ruin she might have been more grateful  a few days after the failure of the bank josiah arrived on my doorstep and this time he brought his families with him  there were sixteen of them in all  what was i to do  i had brought these people step by step to the verge of starvation  i had laid waste alike their happiness and their prospects in life  the least amends i could make was to see that at all events they did not want for the necessities of existence  that was seventeen years ago  i am still seeing that they do not want for the necessities of existence and my conscience is growing easier by noticing that they seem contented with their lot  there are twentytwo of them now and we have hopes of another in the spring  that is my story he said  perhaps you will now understand my sudden emotion when you asked for my advice  as a matter of fact i do not give advice now on any subject        i told this tale to macshaughnassy  he agreed with me that it was instructive and said he should remember it  he said he should remember it so as to tell it to some fellows that he knew to whom he thought the lesson should prove useful     chapter ii   i cant honestly say that we made much progress at our first meeting  it was browns fault  he would begin by telling us a story about a dog  it was the old old story of the dog who had been in the habit of going every morning to a certain bakers shop with a penny in his mouth in exchange for which he always received a penny bun  one day the baker thinking he would not know the difference tried to palm off upon the poor animal a hapenny bun whereupon the dog walked straight outside and fetched in a policeman  brown had heard this chestnut for the first time that afternoon and was full of it  it is always a mystery to me where brown has been for the last hundred years  he stops you in the street with oh i must tell yousuch a capital story  and he thereupon proceeds to relate to you with much spirit and gusto one of noahs best known jokes or some story that romulus must have originally told to remus  one of these days somebody will tell him the history of adam and eve and he will think he has got hold of a new plot and will work it up into a novel  he gives forth these hoary antiquities as personal reminiscences of his own or at furthest as episodes in the life of his second cousin  there are certain strange and moving catastrophes that would seem either to have occurred to or to have been witnessed by nearly every one you meet  i never came across a man yet who had not seen some other man jerked off the top of an omnibus into a mudcart  half london must at one time or another have been jerked off omnibuses into mudcarts and have been fished out at the end of a shovel  then there is the tale of the lady whose husband is taken suddenly ill one night at an hotel  she rushes downstairs and prepares a stiff mustard plaster to put on him and runs up with it again  in her excitement however she charges into the wrong room and rolling down the bedclothes presses it lovingly upon the wrong man  i have heard that story so often that i am quite nervous about going to bed in an hotel now  each man who has told it me has invariably slept in the room next door to that of the victim and has been awakened by the mans yell as the plaster came down upon him  that is how he the storyteller came to know all about it  brown wanted us to believe that this prehistoric animal he had been telling us about had belonged to his brotherinlaw and was hurt when jephson murmured sotto voce that that made the twentyeighth man he had met whose brotherinlaw had owned that dogto say nothing of the hundred and seventeen who had owned it themselves  we tried to get to work afterwards but brown had unsettled us for the evening  it is a wicked thing to start dog stories among a party of average sinful men  let one man tell a dog story and every other man in the room feels he wants to tell a bigger one  there is a story goingi cannot vouch for its truth it was told me by a judgeof a man who lay dying  the pastor of the parish a good and pious man came to sit with him and thinking to cheer him up told him an anecdote about a dog  when the pastor had finished the sick man sat up and said i know a better story than that  i had a dog once a big brown lopsided  the effort had proved too much for his strength  he fell back upon the pillows and the doctor stepping forward saw that it was a question only of minutes  the good old pastor rose and took the poor fellows hand in his and pressed it  we shall meet again he gently said  the sick man turned towards him with a consoled and grateful look  im glad to hear you say that he feebly murmured  remind me about that dog  then he passed peacefully away with a sweet smile upon his pale lips  brown who had had his dog story and was satisfied wanted us to settle our heroine but the rest of us did not feel equal to settling anybody just then  we were thinking of all the true dog stories we had ever heard and wondering which was the one least likely to be generally disbelieved  macshaughnassy in particular was growing every moment more restless and moody  brown concluded a long discourseto which nobody had listenedby remarking with some pride what more can you want  the plot has never been used before and the characters are entirely original  then macshaughnassy gave way  talking of plots he said hitching his chair a little nearer the table that puts me in mind  did i ever tell you about that dog we had when we lived in norwood  its not that one about the bulldog is it queried jephson anxiously  well it was a bulldog admitted macshaughnassy but i dont think ive ever told it you before  we knew by experience that to argue the matter would only prolong the torture so we let him go on  a great many burglaries had lately taken place in our neighbourhood he began and the pater came to the conclusion that it was time he laid down a dog  he thought a bulldog would be the best for his purpose and he purchased the most savage and murderouslooking specimen that he could find  my mother was alarmed when she saw the dog  surely youre not going to let that brute loose about the house she exclaimed  hell kill somebody  i can see it in his face  i want him to kill somebody replied my father i want him to kill burglars  i dont like to hear you talk like that thomas answered the mater its not like you  weve a right to protect our property but weve no right to take a fellow human creatures life  our fellow human creatures will be all rightso long as they dont come into our kitchen when theyve no business there retorted my father somewhat testily  im going to fix up this dog in the scullery and if a burglar comes fooling aroundwell thats his affair  the old folks quarrelled on and off for about a month over this dog  the dad thought the mater absurdly sentimental and the mater thought the dad unnecessarily vindictive  meanwhile the dog grew more ferociouslooking every day  one night my mother woke my father up with thomas theres a burglar downstairs im positive  i distinctly heard the kitchen door open  oh well the dogs got him by now then murmured my father who had heard nothing and was sleepy  thomas replied my mother severely im not going to lie here while a fellowcreature is being murdered by a savage beast  if you wont go down and save that mans life i will  oh bother said my father preparing to get up  youre always fancying you hear noises  i believe thats all you women come to bed forto sit up and listen for burglars  just to satisfy her however he pulled on his trousers and socks and went down  well sure enough my mother was right this time  there was a burglar in the house  the pantry window stood open and a light was shining in the kitchen  my father crept softly forward and peeped through the partly open door  there sat the burglar eating cold beef and pickles and there beside him on the floor gazing up into his face with a bloodcurdling smile of affection sat that idiot of a dog wagging his tail  my father was so taken aback that he forgot to keep silent  well im and he used a word that i should not care to repeat to you fellows  the burglar hearing him made a dash and got clear off by the window and the dog seemed vexed with my father for having driven him away  next morning we took the dog back to the trainer from whom we had bought it  what do you think i wanted this dog for asked my father trying to speak calmly  well replied the trainer you said you wanted a good house dog  exactly so answered the dad  i didnt ask for a burglars companion did i  i didnt say i wanted a dog whod chum on with a burglar the first time he ever came to the house and sit with him while he had supper in case he might feel lonesome did i  and my father recounted the incidents of the previous night  the man agreed that there was cause for complaint  ill tell you what it is sir he said  it was my boy jim as trained this ere dawg and i guess the young beggars taught im more about tackling rats than burglars  you leave im with me for a week sir ill put that all right  we did so and at the end of the time the trainer brought him back again  youll find im game enough now sir said the man  e aint what i call an intellectual dawg but i think ive knocked the right idea into im  my father thought hed like to test the matter so we hired a man for a shilling to break in through the kitchen window while the trainer held the dog by a chain  the dog remained perfectly quiet until the man was fairly inside  then he made one savage spring at him and if the chain had not been stout the fellow would have earned his shilling dearly  the dad was satisfied now that he could go to bed in peace and the maters alarm for the safety of the local burglars was proportionately increased  months passed uneventfully by and then another burglar sampled our house  this time there could be no doubt that the dog was doing something for his living  the din in the basement was terrific  the house shook with the concussion of falling bodies  my father snatched up his revolver and rushed downstairs and i followed him  the kitchen was in confusion  tables and chairs were overturned and on the floor lay a man gurgling for help  the dog was standing over him choking him  the pater held his revolver to the mans ear while i by superhuman effort dragged our preserver away and chained him up to the sink after which i lit the gas  then we perceived that the gentleman on the floor was a police constable  good heavens exclaimed my father dropping the revolver however did you come here  ow did i come ere retorted the man sitting up and speaking in a tone of bitter but not unnatural indignation  why in the course of my dooty thats ow i come ere  i see a burglar getting in through the window so i just follows and slips in after im  did you catch him asked my father  did i catch im almost shrieked the man  ow could i catch im with that blasted dog of yours olding me down by the throat while e lights is pipe and walks out by the back door  the dog was for sale the next day  the mater who had grown to like him because he let the baby pull his tail wanted us to keep him  the mistake she said was not the animals fault  two men broke into the house almost at the same time  the dog could not go for both of them  he did his best and went for one  that his selection should have fallen upon the policeman instead of upon the burglar was unfortunate  but still it was a thing that might have happened to any dog  my father however had become prejudiced against the poor creature and that same week he inserted an advertisement in the field in which the animal was recommended as an investment likely to prove useful to any enterprising member of the criminal classes  macshaughnassy having had his innings jephson took a turn and told us a pathetic story about an unfortunate mongrel that was run over in the strand one day and its leg broken  a medical student who was passing at the time picked it up and carried it to the charing cross hospital where its leg was set and where it was kept and tended until it was quite itself again when it was sent home  the poor thing had quite understood what was being done for it and had been the most grateful patient they had ever had in the hospital  the whole staff were quite sorry when it left  one morning a week or two later the housesurgeon looking out of the window saw the dog coming down the street  when it came near he noticed that it had a penny in its mouth  a catsmeat barrow was standing by the kerb and for a moment as he passed it the dog hesitated  but his nobler nature asserted itself and walking straight up to the hospital railings and raising himself upon his hind legs he dropped his penny into the contribution box  macshaughnassy was much affected by this story  he said it showed such a beautiful trait in the dogs character  the animal was a poor outcast vagrant thing that had perhaps never possessed a penny before in all its life and might never have another  he said that dogs penny seemed to him to be a greater gift than the biggest cheque that the wealthiest patron ever signed  the other three were very eager now to get to work on the novel but i did not quite see the fairness of this  i had one or two dog stories of my own  i knew a blackandtan terrier years ago  he lodged in the same house with me  he did not belong to any one  he had discharged his owner if indeed he had ever permitted himself to possess one which is doubtful having regard to his aggressively independent character and was now running himself entirely on his own account  he appropriated the front hall for his sleepingapartment and took his meals with the other lodgerswhenever they happened to be having meals  at five oclock he would take an early morning snack with young hollis an engineers pupil who had to get up at halfpast four and make his own coffee so as to be down at the works by six  at eightthirty he would breakfast in a more sensible fashion with mr blair on the first floor and on occasions would join jack gadbut who was a late riser in a devilled kidney at eleven  from then till about five when i generally had a cup of tea and a chop he regularly disappeared  where he went and what he did between those hours nobody ever knew  gadbut swore that twice he had met him coming out of a stockbrokers office in threadneedle street and improbable though the statement at first appeared some colour of credibility began to attach to it when we reflected upon the dogs inordinate passion for acquiring and hoarding coppers  this craving of his for wealth was really quite remarkable  he was an elderly dog with a great sense of his own dignity yet on the promise of a penny i have seen him run round after his own tail until he didnt know one end of himself from the other  he used to teach himself tricks and go from room to room in the evening performing them and when he had completed his programme he would sit up and beg  all the fellows used to humour him  he must have made pounds in the course of the year  once just outside our door i saw him standing in a crowd watching a performing poodle attached to a hurdygurdy  the poodle stood on his head and then with his hind legs in the air walked round on his front paws  the people laughed very much and when afterwards he came amongst them with his wooden saucer in his mouth they gave freely  our dog came in and immediately commenced to study  in three days he could stand on his head and walk round on his front legs and the first evening he did so he made sixpence  it must have been terribly hard work for him at his age and subject to rheumatism as he was but he would do anything for money  i believe he would have sold himself to the devil for eightpence down  he knew the value of money  if you held out to him a penny in one hand and a threepennybit in the other he would snatch at the threepence and then break his heart because he could not get the penny in as well  you might safely have left him in the room with a leg of mutton but it would not have been wise to leave your purse about  now and then he spent a little but not often  he was desperately fond of spongecakes and occasionally when he had had a good week he would indulge himself to the extent of one or two  but he hated paying for them and always made a frantic and frequently successful effort to get off with the cake and the penny also  his plan of operations was simple he would walk into the shop with his penny in his mouth well displayed and a sweet and lamblike expression in his eyes  taking his stand as near to the cakes as he could get and fixing his eyes affectionately upon them he would begin to whine and the shopkeeper thinking he was dealing with an honest dog would throw him one  to get the cake he was obliged of course to drop the penny and then began a struggle between him and the shopkeeper for the possession of the coin  the man would try to pick it up  the dog would put his foot upon it and growl savagely  if he could finish the cake before the contest was over he would snap up the penny and bolt  i have known him to come home gorged with spongecakes the original penny still in his mouth  so notorious throughout the neighbourhood did this dishonest practice of his become that after a time the majority of the local tradespeople refused to serve him at all  only the exceptionally quick and ablebodied would attempt to do business with him  then he took his custom further afield into districts where his reputation had not yet penetrated  and he would pick out shops kept by nervous females or rheumatic old men  they say that the love of money is the root of all evil  it seemed to have robbed him of every shred of principle  it robbed him of his life in the end and that came about in this way  he had been performing one evening in gadbuts room where a few of us were sitting smoking and talking and young hollis being in a generous mood had thrown him as he thought a sixpence  the dog grabbed it and retired under the sofa  this was an odd thing for him to do and we commented upon it  suddenly a thought occurred to hollis and he took out his money and began counting it  by jove he exclaimed ive given that little beast halfasovereignhere tiny  but tiny only backed further underneath the sofa and no mere verbal invitation would induce him to stir  so we adopted a more pressing plan and coaxed him out by the scruff of his neck  he came an inch at a time growling viciously and holding holliss half sovereign tight between his teeth  we tried sweet reasonableness at first  we offered him a sixpence in exchange he looked insulted and evidently considered the proposal as tantamount to our calling him a fool  we made it a shilling then halfacrownhe seemed only bored by our persistence  i dont think youll ever see this halfsovereign again hollis said gadbut laughing  we all with the exception of young hollis thought the affair a very good joke  he on the contrary seemed annoyed and taking the dog from gadbut made an attempt to pull the coin out of its mouth  tiny true to his lifelong principle of never parting if he could possibly help it held on like grim death until feeling that his little earnings were slowly but surely going from him he made one final desperate snatch and swallowed the money  it stuck in his throat and he began to choke  then we became seriously alarmed for the dog  he was an amusing chap and we did not want any accident to happen to him  hollis rushed into his room and procured a long pair of pincers and the rest of us held the little miser while hollis tried to relieve him of the cause of his suffering  but poor tiny did not understand our intentions  he still thought we were seeking to rob him of his nights takings and resisted vehemently his struggles fixed the coin firmer and in spite of our efforts he diedone more victim among many to the fierce fever for gold        i dreamt a very curious dream about riches once that made a great impression upon me  i thought that i and a frienda very dear friendwere living together in a strange old house  i dont think anybody else dwelt in the house but just we two  one day wandering about this strange old rambling place i discovered the hidden door of a secret room and in this room were many ironbound chests and when i raised the heavy lids i saw that each chest was full of gold  and when i saw this i stole out softly and closed the hidden door and drew the worn tapestries in front of it again and crept back along the dim corridor looking behind me fearfully  and the friend that i had loved came towards me and we walked together with our hands clasped  but i hated him  and all day long i kept beside him or followed him unseen lest by chance he should learn the secret of that hidden door and at night i lay awake watching him  but one night i sleep and when i open my eyes he is no longer near me i run swiftly up the narrow stairs and along the silent corridor  the tapestry is drawn aside and the hidden door stands open and in the room beyond the friend that i loved is kneeling before an open chest and the glint of the gold is in my eyes  his back is towards me and i crawl forward inch by inch  i have a knife in my hand with a strong curved blade and when i am near enough i kill him as he kneels there  his body falls against the door and it shuts to with a clang and i try to open it and cannot  i beat my hands against its iron nails and scream and the dead man grins at me  the light streams in through the chink beneath the massive door and fades and comes again and fades again and i gnaw at the oaken lids of the ironbound chests for the madness of hunger is climbing into my brain  then i awake and find that i really am hungry and remember that in consequence of a headache i did not eat any dinner  so i slip on a few clothes and go down to the kitchen on a foraging expedition  it is said that dreams are momentary conglomerations of thought centring round the incident that awakens us and as with most scientific facts this is occasionally true  there is one dream that with slight variations is continually recurring to me  over and over again i dream that i am suddenly called upon to act an important part in some piece at the lyceum  that poor mr irving should invariably be the victim seems unfair but really it is entirely his own fault  it is he who persuades and urges me  i myself would much prefer to remain quietly in bed and i tell him so  but he insists on my getting up at once and coming down to the theatre  i explain to him that i cant act a bit  he seems to consider this unimportant and says oh that will be all right  we argue for a while but he makes the matter quite a personal one and to oblige him and get him out of the bedroom i consent though much against my own judgment  i generally dress the character in my nightshirt though on one occasion for banquo i wore pyjamas and i never remember a single word of what i ought to say  how i get through i do not know irving comes up afterwards and congratulates me but whether upon the brilliancy of my performance or upon my luck in getting off the stage before a brickbat is thrown at me i cannot say  whenever i dream this incident i invariably wake up to find that the bedclothes are on the floor and that i am shivering with cold and it is this shivering i suppose that causes me to dream i am wandering about the lyceum stage in nothing but my nightshirt  but still i do not understand why it should always be the lyceum  another dream which i fancy i have dreamt more than onceor if not i have dreamt that i dreamt it before a thing one sometimes doesis one in which i am walking down a very wide and very long road in the east end of london  it is a curious road to find there  omnibuses and trams pass up and down and it is crowded with stalls and barrows beside which men in greasy caps stand shouting yet on each side it is bordered by a strip of tropical forest  the road in fact combines the advantages of kew and whitechapel  some one is with me but i cannot see him and we walk through the forest pushing our way among the tangled vines that cling about our feet and every now and then between the giant treetrunks we catch glimpses of the noisy street  at the end of this road there is a narrow turning and when i come to it i am afraid though i do not know why i am afraid  it leads to a house that i once lived in when a child and now there is some one waiting there who has something to tell me  i turn to run away  a blackwall bus is passing and i try to overtake it  but the horses turn into skeletons and gallop away from me and my feet are like lead and the thing that is with me and that i cannot see seizes me by the arm and drags me back  it forces me along and into the house and the door slams to behind us and the sound echoes through the lifeless rooms  i recognise the rooms i laughed and cried in them long ago  nothing is changed  the chairs stand in their places empty  my mothers knitting lies upon the hearthrug where the kitten i remember dragged it somewhere back in the sixties  i go up into my own little attic  my cot stands in the corner and my bricks lie tumbled out upon the floor i was always an untidy child  an old man entersan old bent withered manholding a lamp above his head and i look at his face and it is my own face  and another enters and he also is myself  then more and more till the room is thronged with faces and the stairway beyond and all the silent house  some of the faces are old and others young and some are fair and smile at me and many are foul and leer at me  and every face is my own face but no two of them are alike  i do not know why the sight of myself should alarm me so but i rush from the house in terror and the faces follow me and i run faster and faster but i know that i shall never leave them behind me        as a rule one is the hero of ones own dreams but at times i have dreamt a dream entirely in the third persona dream with the incidents of which i have had no connection whatever except as an unseen and impotent spectator  one of these i have often thought about since wondering if it could not be worked up into a story  but perhaps it would be too painful a theme  i dreamt i saw a womans face among a throng  it is an evil face but there is a strange beauty in it  the flickering gleams thrown by street lamps flash down upon it showing the wonder of its evil fairness  then the lights go out  i see it next in a place that is very far away and it is even more beautiful than before for the evil has gone out of it  another face is looking down into it a bright pure face  the faces meet and kiss and as his lips touch hers the blood mounts to her cheeks and brow  i see the two faces again  but i cannot tell where they are or how long a time has passed  the mans face has grown a little older but it is still young and fair and when the womans eyes rest upon it there comes a glory into her face so that it is like the face of an angel  but at times the woman is alone and then i see the old evil look struggling back  then i see clearer  i see the room in which they live  it is very poor an oldfashioned piano stands in one corner and beside it is a table on which lie scattered a tumbled mass of papers round an inkstand  an empty chair waits before the table  the woman sits by the open window  from far below there rises the sound of a great city  its lights throw up faint beams into the dark room  the smell of its streets is in the womans nostrils  every now and again she looks towards the door and listens then turns to the open window  and i notice that each time she looks towards the door the evil in her face shrinks back but each time she turns to the window it grows more fierce and sullen  suddenly she starts up and there is a terror in her eyes that frightens me as i dream and i see great beads of sweat upon her brow  then very slowly her face changes and i see again the evil creature of the night she wraps around her an old cloak and creeps out  i hear her footsteps going down the stairs  they grow fainter and fainter  i hear a door open  the roar of the streets rushes up into the house and the womans footsteps are swallowed up  time drifts onward through my dream  scenes change take shape and fade but all is vague and undefined until out of the dimness there fashions itself a long deserted street  the lights make glistening circles on the wet pavement  a figure dressed in gaudy rags slinks by keeping close against the wall  its back is towards me and i do not see its face  another figure glides from out the shadows  i look upon its face and i see it is the face that the womans eyes gazed up into and worshipped long ago when my dream was just begun  but the fairness and the purity are gone from it and it is old and evil as the womans when i looked upon her last  the figure in the gaudy rags moves slowly on the second figure follows it and overtakes it  the two pause and speak to one another as they draw near  the street is very dark where they have met and the figure in the gaudy rags keeps its face still turned aside  they walk together in silence till they come to where a flaring gaslamp hangs before a tavern and there the woman turns and i see that it is the woman of my dream  and she and the man look into each others eyes once more        in another dream that i remember an angel or a devil i am not quite sure which has come to a man and told him that so long as he loves no living human thingso long as he never suffers himself to feel one touch of tenderness towards wife or child towards kith or kin towards stranger or towards friend so long will he succeed and prosper in his dealingsso long will all this worlds affairs go well with him and he will grow each day richer and greater and more powerful  but if ever he let one kindly thought for living thing come into his heart in that moment all his plans and schemes will topple down about his ears and from that hour his name will be despised by men and then forgotten  and the man treasures up these words for he is an ambitious man and wealth and fame and power are the sweetest things in all the world to him  a woman loves him and dies thirsting for a loving look from him childrens footsteps creep into his life and steal away again old faces fade and new ones come and go  but never a kindly touch of his hand rests on any living thing never a kindly word comes from his lips never a kindly thought springs from his heart  and in all his doings fortune favours him  the years pass by and at last there is left to him only one thing that he need feara childs small wistful face  the child loves him as the woman long ago had loved him and her eyes follow him with a hungry beseeching look  but he sets his teeth and turns away from her  the little face grows thin and one day they come to him where he sits before the keyboard of his many enterprises and tell him she is dying he comes and stands beside the bed and the childs eyes open and turn towards him and as he draws nearer her little arms stretch out towards him pleading dumbly  but the mans face never changes and the little arms fall feebly back upon the tumbled coverlet and the wistful eyes grow still and a woman steps softly forward and draws the lids down over them then the man goes back to his plans and schemes  but in the night when the great house is silent he steals up to the room where the child still lies and pushes back the white uneven sheet  deaddead he mutters  then he takes the tiny corpse up in his arms and holds it tight against his breast and kisses the cold lips and the cold cheeks and the little cold stiff hands  and at that point my story becomes impossible for i dream that the dead child lies always beneath the sheet in that quiet room and that the little face never changes nor the limbs decay  i puzzle about this for an instant but soon forget to wonder for when the dream fairy tells us tales we are only as little children sitting round with open eyes believing all though marvelling that such things should be  each night when all else in the house sleeps the door of that room opens noiselessly and the man enters and closes it behind him  each night he draws away the white sheet and takes the small dead body in his arms and through the dark hours he paces softly to and fro holding it close against his breast kissing it and crooning to it like a mother to her sleeping baby  when the first ray of dawn peeps into the room he lays the dead child back again and smooths the sheet above her and steals away  and he succeeds and prospers in all things and each day he grows richer and greater and more powerful     chapter iii   we had much trouble with our heroine  brown wanted her ugly  browns chief ambition in life is to be original and his method of obtaining the original is to take the unoriginal and turn it upside down  if brown were given a little planet of his own to do as he liked with he would call day night and summer winter  he would make all his men and women walk on their heads and shake hands with their feet his trees would grow with their roots in the air and the old cock would lay all the eggs while the hens sat on the fence and crowed  then he would step back and say see what an original world i have created entirely my own idea  there are many other people besides brown whose notion of originality would seem to be precisely similar  i know a little girl the descendant of a long line of politicians  the hereditary instinct is so strongly developed in her that she is almost incapable of thinking for herself  instead she copies in everything her elder sister who takes more after the mother  if her sister has two helpings of rice pudding for supper then she has two helpings of rice pudding  if her sister isnt hungry and doesnt want any supper at all then she goes to bed without any supper  this lack of character in the child troubles her mother who is not an admirer of the political virtues and one evening taking the little one on her lap she talked seriously to her  do try to think for yourself said she  dont always do just what jessie does thats silly  have an idea of your own now and then  be a little original  the child promised shed try and went to bed thoughtful  next morning for breakfast a dish of kippers and a dish of kidneys were placed on the table side by side  now the child loved kippers with an affection that amounted almost to passion while she loathed kidneys worse than powders  it was the one subject on which she did know her own mind  a kidney or a kipper for you jessie asked the mother addressing the elder child first  jessie hesitated for a moment while her sister sat regarding her in an agony of suspense  kipper please ma jessie answered at last and the younger child turned her head away to hide the tears  youll have a kipper of course trixy said the mother who had noticed nothing  no thank you ma said the small heroine stifling a sob and speaking in a dry tremulous voice ill have a kidney  but i thought you couldnt bear kidneys exclaimed her mother surprised  no ma i dont like em much  and youre so fond of kippers  yes ma  well then why on earth dont you have one  cos jessies going to have one and you told me to be original and here the poor mite reflecting upon the price her originality was going to cost her burst into tears        the other three of us refused to sacrifice ourselves upon the altar of browns originality  we decided to be content with the customary beautiful girl  good or bad queried brown  bad responded macshaughnassy emphatically  what do you say jephson  well replied jephson taking the pipe from between his lips and speaking in that soothingly melancholy tone of voice that he never varies whether telling a joke about a wedding or an anecdote relating to a funeral not altogether bad  bad with good instincts the good instincts well under control  i wonder why it is murmured macshaughnassy reflectively that bad people are so much more interesting than good  i dont think the reason is very difficult to find answered jephson theres more uncertainty about them  they keep you more on the alert its like the difference between riding a wellbroken steadygoing hack and a lively young colt with ideas of his own  the one is comfortable to travel on but the other provides you with more exercise  if you start off with a thoroughly good woman for your heroine you give your story away in the first chapter  everybody knows precisely how she will behave under every conceivable combination of circumstances in which you can place her  on every occasion she will do the same thingthat is the right thing  with a bad heroine on the other hand you can never be quite sure what is going to happen  out of the fifty or so courses open to her she may take the right one or she may take one of the fortynine wrong ones and you watch her with curiosity to see which it will be  but surely there are plenty of good heroines who are interesting i said  at intervalswhen they do something wrong answered jephson  a consistently irreproachable heroine is as irritating as socrates must have been to xantippe or as the model boy at school is to all the other lads  take the stock heroine of the eighteenthcentury romance  she never met her lover except for the purpose of telling him that she could not be his and she generally wept steadily throughout the interview  she never forgot to turn pale at the sight of blood nor to faint in his arms at the most inconvenient moment possible  she was determined never to marry without her fathers consent and was equally resolved never to marry anybody but the one particular person she was convinced he would never agree to her marrying  she was an excellent young woman and nearly as uninteresting as a celebrity at home  ah but youre not talking about good women now i observed  youre talking about some silly persons idea of a good woman  i quite admit it replied jephson  nor indeed am i prepared to say what is a good woman  i consider the subject too deep and too complicated for any mere human being to give judgment upon  but i am talking of the women who conformed to the popular idea of maidenly goodness in the age when these books were written  you must remember goodness is not a known quantity  it varies with every age and every locality and it is generally speaking your silly persons who are responsible for its varying standards  in japan a good girl would be a girl who would sell her honour in order to afford little luxuries to her aged parents  in certain hospitable islands of the torrid zone the good wife goes to lengths that we should deem altogether unnecessary in making her husbands guest feel himself at home  in ancient hebraic days jael was accounted a good woman for murdering a sleeping man and sarai stood in no danger of losing the respect of her little world when she led hagar unto abraham  in eighteenthcentury england supernatural stupidity and dulness of a degree that must have been difficult to attain were held to be feminine virtuesindeed they are so stilland authors who are always among the most servile followers of public opinion fashioned their puppets accordingly  nowadays slumming is the most applauded virtue and so all our best heroines go slumming and are good to the poor  how useful the poor are remarked macshaughnassy somewhat abruptly placing his feet on the mantelpiece and tilting his chair back till it stood at an angle that caused us to rivet our attention upon it with hopeful interest  i dont think we scribbling fellows ever fully grasp how much we owe to the poor  where would our angelic heroines and our noblehearted heroes be if it were not for the poor  we want to show that the dear girl is as good as she is beautiful  what do we do  we put a basket full of chickens and bottles of wine on her arm a fetching little sunbonnet on her head and send her round among the poor  how do we prove that our apparent scamp of a hero is really a noble young man at heart  why by explaining that he is good to the poor  they are as useful in real life as they are in bookland  what is it consoles the tradesman when the actor earning eighty pounds a week cannot pay his debts  why reading in the theatrical newspapers gushing accounts of the dear fellows invariable generosity to the poor  what is it stills the small but irritating voice of conscience when we have successfully accomplished some extra big feat of swindling  why the noble resolve to give ten per cent of the net profits to the poor  what does a man do when he finds himself growing old and feels that it is time for him to think seriously about securing his position in the next world  why he becomes suddenly good to the poor  if the poor were not there for him to be good to what could he do  he would be unable to reform at all  its a great comfort to think that the poor will always be with us  they are the ladder by which we climb into heaven  there was silence for a few moments while macshaughnassy puffed away vigorously and almost savagely at his pipe and then brown said i can tell you rather a quaint incident bearing very aptly on the subject  a cousin of mine was a landagent in a small country town and among the houses on his list was a fine old mansion that had remained vacant for many years  he had despaired of ever selling it when one day an elderly lady very richly dressed drove up to the office and made inquiries about it  she said she had come across it accidentally while travelling through that part of the country the previous autumn and had been much struck by its beauty and picturesqueness  she added she was looking out for some quiet spot where she could settle down and peacefully pass the remainder of her days and thought this place might possibly prove to be the very thing for her  my cousin delighted with the chance of a purchaser at once drove her across to the estate which was about eight miles distant from the town and they went over it together  my cousin waxed eloquent upon the subject of its advantages  he dwelt upon its quiet and seclusion its proximitybut not too close proximityto the church its convenient distance from the village  everything pointed to a satisfactory conclusion of the business  the lady was charmed with the situation and the surroundings and delighted with the house and grounds  she considered the price moderate  and now mr brown said she as they stood by the lodge gate tell me what class of poor have you got round about  poor answered my cousin there are no poor  no poor exclaimed the lady  no poor people in the village or anywhere near  you wont find a poor person within five miles of the estate he replied proudly  you see my dear madam this is a thinly populated and exceedingly prosperous county this particular district especially so there is not a family in it that is not comparatively speaking wellto do  im sorry to hear that said the lady in a tone of disappointment the place would have suited me so admirably but for that  but surely madam cried my cousin to whom a demand for poor persons was an entirely new idea you dont mean to say that you want poor people  why weve always considered it one of the chief attractions of the propertynothing to shock the eye or wound the susceptibilities of the most tenderhearted occupant  my dear mr brown replied the lady i will be perfectly frank with you  i am becoming an old woman and my past life has not perhaps been altogether too well spent  it is my desire to atone for theerfollies of my youth by an old age of welldoing and to that end it is essential that i should be surrounded by a certain number of deserving poor  i had hoped to find in this charming neighbourhood of yours the customary proportion of poverty and misery in which case i should have taken the house without hesitation  as it is i must seek elsewhere  my cousin was perplexed and sad  there are plenty of poor people in the town he said many of them most interesting cases and you could have the entire care of them all  thered be no opposition whatever im positive  thank you replied the lady but i really couldnt go as far as the town  they must be within easy driving distance or they are no good  my cousin cudgelled his brains again  he did not intend to let a purchaser slip through his fingers if he could help it  at last a bright thought flashed into his mind  ill tell you what we could do he said  theres a piece of waste land the other end of the village that weve never been able to do much with in consequence of its being so swampy  if you liked we could run you up a dozen cottages on that cheapit would be all the better their being a bit ramshackle and unhealthyand get some poor people for you and put into them  the lady reflected upon the idea and it struck her as a good one  you see continued my cousin pushing his advantage by adopting this method you would be able to select your own poor  we would get you some nice clean grateful poor and make the thing pleasant for you  it ended in the ladys accepting my cousins offer and giving him a list of the poor people she would like to have  she selected one bedridden old woman church of england preferred one paralytic old man one blind girl who would want to be read aloud to one poor atheist willing to be converted two cripples one drunken father who would consent to be talked to seriously one disagreeable old fellow needing much patience two large families and four ordinary assorted couples  my cousin experienced some difficulty in securing the drunken father most of the drunken fathers he interviewed upon the subject had a rooted objection to being talked to at all  after a long search however he discovered a mild little man who upon the ladys requirements and charitable intentions being explained to him undertook to qualify himself for the vacancy by getting intoxicated at least once a week  he said he could not promise more than once a week at first he unfortunately possessing a strong natural distaste for all alcoholic liquors which it would be necessary for him to overcome  as he got more used to them he would do better  over the disagreeable old man my cousin also had trouble  it was hard to hit the right degree of disagreeableness  some of them were so very unpleasant  he eventually made choice of a decayed cabdriver with advanced radical opinions who insisted on a three years contract  the plan worked exceedingly well and does so my cousin tells me to this day  the drunken father has completely conquered his dislike to strong drink  he has not been sober now for over three weeks and has lately taken to knocking his wife about  the disagreeable fellow is most conscientious in fulfilling his part of the bargain and makes himself a perfect curse to the whole village  the others have dropped into their respective positions and are working well  the lady visits them all every afternoon and is most charitable  they call her lady bountiful and everybody blesses her  brown rose as he finished speaking and mixed himself a glass of whisky and water with the selfsatisfied air of a benevolent man about to reward somebody for having done a good deed and macshaughnassy lifted up his voice and talked  i know a story bearing on the subject too he said  it happened in a tiny yorkshire villagea peaceful respectable spot where folks found life a bit slow  one day however a new curate arrived and that woke things up considerably  he was a nice young man and having a large private income of his own was altogether a most desirable catch  every unmarried female in the place went for him with one accord  but ordinary feminine blandishments appeared to have no effect upon him he was a seriously inclined young man and once in the course of a casual conversation upon the subject of love he was heard to say that he himself should never be attracted by mere beauty and charm  what would appeal to him he said would be a womans goodnessher charity and kindliness to the poor  well that set the petticoats all thinking  they saw that in studying fashion plates and practising expressions they had been going upon the wrong tack  the card for them to play was the poor  but here a serious difficulty arose  there was only one poor person in the whole parish a cantankerous old fellow who lived in a tumbledown cottage at the back of the church and fifteen ablebodied women eleven girls three old maids and a widow wanted to be good to him  miss simmonds one of the old maids got hold of him first and commenced feeding him twice a day with beeftea and then the widow boarded him with port wine and oysters  later in the week others of the party drifted in upon him and wanted to cram him with jelly and chickens  the old man couldnt understand it  he was accustomed to a small sack of coals now and then accompanied by a long lecture on his sins and an occasional bottle of dandelion tea  this sudden spurt on the part of providence puzzled him  he said nothing however but continued to take in as much of everything as he could hold  at the end of a month he was too fat to get through his own back door  the competition among the womenfolk grew keener every day and at last the old man began to give himself airs and to make the place hard for them  he made them clean his cottage out and cook his meals and when he was tired of having them about the house he set them to work in the garden  they grumbled a good deal and there was a talk at one time of a sort of a strike but what could they do  he was the only pauper for miles round and knew it  he had the monopoly and like all monopolises he abused his position  he made them run errands  he sent them out to buy his baccy at their own expense  on one occasion he sent miss simmonds out with a jug to get his supper beer  she indignantly refused at first but he told her that if she gave him any of her stuckup airs out she would go and never come into his house again  if she wouldnt do it there were plenty of others who would  she knew it and went  they had been in the habit of reading to himgood books with an elevating tendency  but now he put his foot down upon that sort of thing  he said he didnt want sundayschool rubbish at his time of life what he liked was something spicy  and he made them read him french novels and seafaring tales containing realistic language  and they didnt have to skip anything either or hed know the reason why  he said he liked music so a few of them clubbed together and bought him a harmonium  their idea was that they would sing hymns and play high class melodies but it wasnt his  his idea waskeeping up the old girls birthday and she winked the other eye with chorus and skirt dance and thats what they sang  to what lengths his tyranny would have gone it is difficult to say had not an event happened that brought his power to a premature collapse this was the curates sudden and somewhat unexpected marriage with a very beautiful burlesque actress who had lately been performing in a neighbouring town  he gave up the church on his engagement in consequence of his fiancees objection to becoming a ministers wife she said she could never tumble to the district visiting  with the curates wedding the old paupers brief career of prosperity ended  they packed him off to the workhouse after that and made him break stones        at the end of the telling of his tale macshaughnassy lifted his feet off the mantelpiece and set to work to wake up his legs and jephson took a hand and began to spin us stories  but none of us felt inclined to laugh at jephsons stories for they dealt not with the goodness of the rich to the poor which is a virtue yielding quick and highly satisfactory returns but with the goodness of the poor to the poor a somewhat less remunerative investment and a different matter altogether  for the poor themselvesi do not mean the noisy professional poor but the silent fighting poorone is bound to feel a genuine respect  one honours them as one honours a wounded soldier  in the perpetual warfare between humanity and nature the poor stand always in the van  they die in the ditches and we march over their bodies with the flags flying and the drums playing  one cannot think of them without an uncomfortable feeling that one ought to be a little bit ashamed of living in security and ease leaving them to take all the hard blows  it is as if one were always skulking in the tents while ones comrades were fighting and dying in the front  they bleed and fall in silence there  nature with her terrible club survival of the fittest and civilisation with her cruel sword supply and demand beat them back and they give way inch by inch fighting to the end  but it is in a dumb sullen way that is not sufficiently picturesque to be heroic  i remember seeing an old bulldog one saturday night lying on the doorstep of a small shop in the new cut  he lay there very quiet and seemed a bit sleepy and as he looked savage nobody disturbed him people stepped in and out over him and occasionally in doing so one would accidentally kick him and then he would breathe a little harder and quicker  at last a passerby feeling something wet beneath his feet looked down and found that he was standing in a pool of blood and looking to see where it came from found that it flowed in a thick dark stream from the step on which the dog was lying  then he stooped down and examined the dog and the dog opened its eyes sleepily and looked at him gave a grin which may have implied pleasure or may have implied irritation at being disturbed and died  a crowd collected and they turned the dead body of the dog over on its side and saw a fearful gash in the groin out of which oozed blood and other things  the proprietor of the shop said the animal had been there for over an hour  i have known the poor to die in that same grim silent waynot the poor that you my delicatelygloved lady bountiful and my very excellent sir simon dogood know or that you would care to know not the poor who march in processions with banners and collectionboxes not the poor that clamour round your soup kitchens and sing hymns at your tea meetings but the poor that you dont know are poor until the tale is told at the coroners inquestthe silent proud poor who wake each morning to wrestle with death till nighttime and who when at last he overcomes them and forcing them down on the rotting floor of the dim attic strangles them still die with their teeth tight shut  there was a boy i came to know when i was living in the east end of london  he was not a nice boy by any means  he was not quite so clean as are the good boys in the religious magazines and i have known a sailor to stop him in the street and reprove him for using indelicate language  he and his mother and the baby a sickly infant of about five months old lived in a cellar down a turning off three colt street  i am not quite sure what had become of the father  i rather think he had been converted and had gone off round the country on a preaching tour  the lad earned six shillings a week as an errandboy and the mother stitched trousers and on days when she was feeling strong and energetic would often make as much as tenpence or even a shilling  unfortunately there were days when the four bare walls would chase each other round and round and the candle seem a faint speck of light a very long way off and the frequency of these caused the family income for the week to occasionally fall somewhat low  one night the walls danced round quicker and quicker till they danced away altogether and the candle shot up through the ceiling and became a star and the woman knew that it was time to put away her sewing  jim she said she spoke very low and the boy had to bend over her to hear if you poke about in the middle of the mattress youll find a couple of pounds  i saved them up a long while ago  that will pay for burying me  and jim youll take care of the kid  you wont let it go to the parish  jim promised  say swelp me gawd jim  swelp me gawd mother  then the woman having arranged her worldly affairs lay back ready and death struck  jim kept his oath  he found the money and buried his mother and then putting his household goods on a barrow moved into cheaper apartmentshalf an old shed for which he paid two shillings a week  for eighteen months he and the baby lived there  he left the child at a nursery every morning fetching it away each evening on his return from work and for that he paid fourpence a day which included a limited supply of milk  how he managed to keep himself and more than half keep the child on the remaining two shillings i cannot say  i only know that he did it and that not a soul ever helped him or knew that there was help wanted  he nursed the child often pacing the room with it for hours washed it occasionally and took it out for an airing every sunday  notwithstanding all which care the little beggar at the end of the time above mentioned pegged out to use jimmys own words  the coroner was very severe on jim  if you had taken proper steps he said this childs life might have been preserved  he seemed to think it would have been better if the childs life had been preserved coroners have quaint ideas  why didnt you apply to the relieving officer  cos i didnt want no relief replied jim sullenly  i promised my mother it should never go on the parish and it didnt  the incident occurred very luckily during the dead season and the evening papers took the case up and made rather a good thing out of it jim became quite a hero i remember  kindhearted people wrote urging that somebodythe ground landlord or the government or some one of that sortought to do something for him  and everybody abused the local vestry  i really think some benefit to jim might have come out of it all if only the excitement had lasted a little longer  unfortunately however just at its height a spicy divorce case cropped up and jim was crowded out and forgotten  i told the boys this story of mine after jephson had done telling his and when i had finished we found it was nearly one oclock  so of course it was too late to do any more work to the novel that evening     chapter iv   we held our next business meeting on my houseboat  brown was opposed at first to my going down to this houseboat at all  he thought that none of us should leave town while the novel was still on hand  macshaughnassy on the contrary was of opinion that we should work better on a houseboat  speaking for himself he said he never felt more like writing a really great work than when lying in a hammock among whispering leaves with the deep blue sky above him and a tumbler of iced claret cup within easy reach of his hand  failing a hammock he found a deck chair a great incentive to mental labour  in the interests of the novel he strongly recommended me to take down with me at least one comfortable deck chair and plenty of lemons  i could not myself see any reason why we should not be able to think as well on a houseboat as anywhere else and accordingly it was settled that i should go down and establish myself upon the thing and that the others should visit me there from time to time when we would sit round and toil  this houseboat was ethelberthas idea  we had spent a day the summer before on one belonging to a friend of mine and she had been enraptured with the life  everything was on such a delightfully tiny scale  you lived in a tiny little room you slept on a tiny little bed in a tiny tiny little bedroom and you cooked your little dinner by a tiny little fire in the tiniest little kitchen that ever you did see  oh it must be lovely living on a houseboat said ethelbertha with a gasp of ecstasy it must be like living in a dolls house  ethelbertha was very youngridiculously young as i think i have mentioned beforein those days of which i am writing and the love of dolls and of the gorgeous dresses that dolls wear and of the manywindowed but inconveniently arranged houses that dolls inhabitor are supposed to inhabit for as a rule they seem to prefer sitting on the roof with their legs dangling down over the front door which has always appeared to me to be unladylike but then of course i am no authority on doll etiquettehad not yet i think quite departed from her  nay am i not sure that it had not  do i not remember years later peeping into a certain room the walls of which are covered with works of art of a character calculated to send any aesthetic person mad and seeing her sitting on the floor before a red brick mansion containing two rooms and a kitchen and are not her hands trembling with delight as she arranges the three real tin plates upon the dresser  and does she not knock at the real brass knocker upon the real front door until it comes off and i have to sit down beside her on the floor and screw it on again  perhaps however it is unwise for me to recall these things and bring them forward thus in evidence against her for cannot she in turn laugh at me  did not i also assist in the arrangement and appointment of that house beautiful  we differed on the matter of the drawingroom carpet i recollect  ethelbertha fancied a dark blue velvet but i felt sure taking the wallpaper into consideration that some shade of terracotta would harmonise best  she agreed with me in the end and we manufactured one out of an old chest protector  it had a really charming effect and gave a delightfully warm tone to the room  the blue velvet we put in the kitchen  i deemed this extravagance but ethelbertha said that servants thought a lot of a good carpet and that it paid to humour them in little things when practicable  the bedroom had one big bed and a cot in it but i could not see where the girl was going to sleep  the architect had overlooked her altogether that is so like an architect  the house also suffered from the inconvenience common to residences of its class of possessing no stairs so that to move from one room to another it was necessary to burst your way up through the ceiling or else to come outside and climb in through a window either of which methods must be fatiguing when you come to do it often  apart from these drawbacks however the house was one that any doll agent would have been justified in describing as a most desirable family residence and it had been furnished with a lavishness that bordered on positive ostentation  in the bedroom there was a washingstand and on the washingstand there stood a jug and basin and in the jug there was real water  but all this was as nothing  i have known mere ordinary middleclass dolls houses in which you might find washingstands and jugs and basins and real wateray and even soap  but in this abode of luxury there was a real towel so that a body could not only wash himself but wipe himself afterwards and that is a sensation that as all dolls know can be enjoyed only in the very firstclass establishments  then in the drawingroom there was a clock which would tick just so long as you continued to shake it it never seemed to get tired also a picture and a piano and a book upon the table and a vase of flowers that would upset the moment you touched it just like a real vase of flowers  oh there was style about this room i can tell you  but the glory of the house was its kitchen  there were all things that heart could desire in this kitchen saucepans with lids that took on and off a flatiron and a rollingpin  a dinner service for three occupied about half the room and what space was left was filled up by the stovea real stove  think of it oh ye owners of dolls houses a stove in which you could burn real bits of coal and on which you could boil real bits of potato for dinnerexcept when people said you mustnt because it was dangerous and took the grate away from you and blew out the fire a thing that hampers a cook  i never saw a house more complete in all its details  nothing had been overlooked not even the family  it lay on its back just outside the front door proud but calm waiting to be put into possession  it was not an extensive family  it consisted of fourpapa and mamma and baby and the hired girl just the family for a beginner  it was a welldressed family toonot merely with grand clothes outside covering a shameful condition of things beneath such as alas is too often the case in doll society but with every article necessary and proper to a lady or gentleman down to items that i could not mention and all these garments you must know could be unfastened and taken off i have known dollsstylish enough dolls to look at some of themwho have been content to go about with their clothes gummed on to them and in some cases nailed on with tacks which i take to be a slovenly and unhealthy habit  but this family could be undressed in five minutes without the aid of either hot water or a chisel  not that it was advisable from an artistic point of view that any of them should  they had not the figure that looks well in its natural statenone of them  there was a want of fulness about them all besides without their clothes it might have been difficult to distinguish the baby from the papa or the maid from the mistress and thus domestic complications might have arisen  when all was ready for their reception we established them in their home we put as much of the baby to bed as the cot would hold and made the papa and mamma comfortable in the drawingroom where they sat on the floor and stared thoughtfully at each other across the table  they had to sit on the floor because the chairs were not big enough  the girl we placed in the kitchen where she leant against the dresser in an attitude suggestive of drink embracing the broom we had given her with maudlin affection  then we lifted up the house with care and carried it cautiously into another room and with the deftness of experienced conspirators placed it at the foot of a small bed on the southwest corner of which an absurdly small somebody had hung an absurdly small stocking  to return to our own dolls house ethelbertha and i discussing the subject during our return journey in the train resolved that next year we ourselves would possess a houseboat a smaller houseboat if possible than even the one we had just seen  it should have artmuslin curtains and a flag and the flowers about it should be wild roses and forgetme nots  i could work all the morning on the roof with an awning over me to keep off the sun while ethelbertha trimmed the roses and made cakes for tea and in the evenings we would sit out on the little deck and ethelbertha would play the guitar she would begin learning it at once or we could sit quiet and listen to the nightingales  for when you are very very young you dream that the summer is all sunny days and moonlight nights that the wind blows always softly from the west and that roses will thrive anywhere  but as you grow older you grow tired of waiting for the gray sky to break  so you close the door and come in and crouch over the fire wondering why the winds blow ever from the east and you have given up trying to rear roses  i knew a little cottage girl who saved up her money for months and months so as to buy a new frock in which to go to a flowershow  but the day of the flowershow was a wet day so she wore an old frock instead  and all the fete days for quite a long while were wet days and she feared she would never have a chance of wearing her pretty white dress  but at last there came a fete day morning that was bright and sunny and then the little girl clapped her hands and ran upstairs and took her new frock which had been her new frock for so long a time that it was now the oldest frock she had from the box where it lay neatly folded between lavender and thyme and held it up and laughed to think how nice she would look in it  but when she went to put it on she found that she had outgrown it and that it was too small for her every way  so she had to wear a common old frock after all  things happen that way you know in this world  there were a boy and girl once who loved each other very dearly  but they were both poor so they agreed to wait till he had made enough money for them to live comfortably upon and then they would marry and be happy  it took him a long while to make because making money is very slow work and he wanted while he was about it to make enough for them to be very happy upon indeed  he accomplished the task eventually however and came back home a wealthy man  then they met again in the poorlyfurnished parlour where they had parted  but they did not sit as near to each other as of old  for she had lived alone so long that she had grown oldmaidish and she was feeling vexed with him for having dirtied the carpet with his muddy boots  and he had worked so long earning money that he had grown hard and cold like the money itself and was trying to think of something affectionate to say to her  so for a while they sat one each side of the paper firestove ornament both wondering why they had shed such scalding tears on that day they had kissed each other goodbye then said goodbye again and were glad  there is another tale with much the same moral that i learnt at school out of a copybook  if i remember rightly it runs somewhat like this  once upon a time there lived a wise grasshopper and a foolish ant  all through the pleasant summer weather the grasshopper sported and played gambolling with his fellows in and out among the sunbeams dining sumptuously each day on leaves and dewdrops never troubling about the morrow singing ever his one peaceful droning song  but there came the cruel winter and the grasshopper looking around saw that his friends the flowers lay dead and knew thereby that his own little span was drawing near its close  then he felt glad that he had been so happy and had not wasted his life it has been very short said he to himself but it has been very pleasant and i think i have made the best use of it  i have drunk in the sunshine i have lain on the soft warm air i have played merry games in the waving grass i have tasted the juice of the sweet green leaves  i have done what i could  i have spread my wings i have sung my song  now i will thank god for the sunny days that are passed and die  saying which he crawled under a brown leaf and met his fate in the way that all brave grasshoppers should and a little bird that was passing by picked him up tenderly and buried him  now when the foolish ant saw this she was greatly puffed up with pharisaical conceit  how thankful i ought to be said she that i am industrious and prudent and not like this poor grasshopper  while he was flitting about from flower to flower enjoying himself i was hard at work putting by against the winter  now he is dead while i am about to make myself cosy in my warm home and eat all the good things that i have been saving up  but as she spoke the gardener came along with his spade and levelled the hill where she dwelt to the ground and left her lying dead amidst the ruins  then the same kind little bird that had buried the grasshopper came and picked her out and buried her also and afterwards he composed and sang a song the burthen of which was gather ye rosebuds while ye may  it was a very pretty song and a very wise song and a man who lived in those days and to whom the birds loving him and feeling that he was almost one of themselves had taught their language fortunately overheard it and wrote it down so that all may read it to this day  unhappily for us however fate is a harsh governess who has no sympathy with our desire for rosebuds  dont stop to pick flowers now my dear she cries in her sharp cross tones as she seizes our arm and jerks us back into the roadway we havent time today  we will come back again tomorrow and you shall pick them then  and we have to follow her knowing if we are experienced children that the chances are that we shall never come that way tomorrow or that if we do the roses will be dead  fate would not hear of our having a houseboat that summerwhich was an exceptionally fine summerbut promised us that if we were good and saved up our money we should have one next year and ethelbertha and i being simpleminded inexperienced children were content with the promise and had faith in its satisfactory fulfilment  as soon as we reached home we informed amenda of our plan  the moment the girl opened the door ethelbertha burst out withoh can you swim amenda  no mum answered amenda with entire absence of curiosity as to why such a question had been addressed to her i never knew but one girl as could and she got drowned  well youll have to make haste and learn then continued ethelbertha because you wont be able to walk out with your young man youll have to swim out  were not going to live in a house any more  were going to live on a boat in the middle of the river  ethelberthas chief object in life at this period was to surprise and shock amenda and her chief sorrow that she had never succeeded in doing so  she had hoped great things from this announcement but the girl remained unmoved  oh are you mum she replied and went on to speak of other matters  i believe the result would have been the same if we had told her we were going to live in a balloon  i do not know how it was i am sure  amenda was always most respectful in her manner  but she had a knack of making ethelbertha and myself feel that we were a couple of children playing at being grown up and married and that she was humouring us  amenda stayed with us for nearly five yearsuntil the milkman having saved up sufficient to buy a walk of his own had become practicablebut her attitude towards us never changed  even when we came to be really important married people the proprietors of a family it was evident that she merely considered we had gone a step further in the game and were playing now at being fathers and mothers  by some subtle process she contrived to imbue the baby also with this idea  the child never seemed to me to take either of us quite seriously she would play with us or join with us in light conversation but when it came to the serious affairs of life such as bathing or feeding she preferred her nurse  ethelbertha attempted to take her out in the perambulator one morning but the child would not hear of it for a moment  its all right baby dear explained ethelbertha soothingly  babys going out with mamma this morning  oh no baby aint was babys rejoinder in effect if not in words baby dont take a hand in experimentsnot this baby  i dont want to be upset or run over  poor ethel  i shall never forget how heartbroken she was  it was the want of confidence that wounded her  but these are reminiscences of other days having no connection with the days of which i amor should bewriting and to wander from one matter to another is in a teller of tales a grievous sin and a growing custom much to be condemned  therefore i will close my eyes to all other memories and endeavour to see only that little white and green houseboat by the ferry which was the scene of our future collaborations  houseboats then were not built to the scale of mississippi steamers but this boat was a small one even for that primitive age  the man from whom we hired it described it as compact  the man to whom at the end of the first month we tried to sublet it characterised it as poky in our letters we traversed this definition  in our hearts we agreed with it  at first however its sizeor rather its lack of sizewas one of its chief charms in ethelberthas eyes  the fact that if you got out of bed carelessly you were certain to knock your head against the ceiling and that it was utterly impossible for any man to put on his trousers except in the saloon she regarded as a capital joke  that she herself had to take a lookingglass and go upon the roof to do her back hair she thought less amusing  amenda accepted her new surroundings with her usual philosophic indifference  on being informed that what she had mistaken for a linen press was her bedroom she remarked that there was one advantage about it and that was that she could not tumble out of bed seeing there was nowhere to tumble and on being shown the kitchen she observed that she should like it for two thingsone was that she could sit in the middle and reach everything without getting up the other that nobody else could come into the apartment while she was there  you see amenda explained ethelbertha apologetically we shall really live outside  yes mum answered amenda i should say that would be the best place to do it  if only we could have lived more outside the life might have been pleasant enough but the weather rendered it impossible six days out of the seven for us to do more than look out of the window and feel thankful that we had a roof over our heads  i have known wet summers before and since  i have learnt by many bitter experiences the danger and foolishness of leaving the shelter of london any time between the first of may and the thirtyfirst of october indeed the country is always associate in my mind with recollections of long weary days passed in the pitiless rain and sad evenings spent in other peoples clothes  but never have i known and never i pray night and morning may i know again such a summer as the one we lived through though none of us expected to on that confounded houseboat  in the morning we would be awakened by the rains forcing its way through the window and wetting the bed and would get up and mop out the saloon after breakfast i would try to work but the beating of the hail upon the roof just over my head would drive every idea out of my brain and after a wasted hour or two i would fling down my pen and hunt up ethelbertha and we would put on our mackintoshes and take our umbrellas and go out for a row  at midday we would return and put on some dry clothes and sit down to dinner  in the afternoon the storm generally freshened up a bit and we were kept pretty busy rushing about with towels and cloths trying to prevent the water from coming into the rooms and swamping us  during teatime the saloon was usually illuminated by forked lightning  the evenings we spent in baling out the boat after which we took it in turns to go into the kitchen and warm ourselves  at eight we supped and from then until it was time to go to bed we sat wrapped up in rugs listening to the roaring of the thunder and the howling of the wind and the lashing of the waves and wondering whether the boat would hold out through the night  friends would come down to spend the day with uselderly irritable people fond of warmth and comfort people who did not as a rule hanker after jaunts even under the most favourable conditions but who had been persuaded by our silly talk that a day on the river would be to them like a saturday to monday in paradise  they would arrive soaked and we would shut them up in different bunks and leave them to strip themselves and put on things of ethelberthas or of mine  but ethel and i in those days were slim so that stout middleaged people in our clothes neither looked well nor felt happy  upon their emerging we would take them into the saloon and try to entertain them by telling them what we had intended to do with them had the day been fine  but their answers were short and occasionally snappy and after a while the conversation would flag and we would sit round reading last weeks newspapers and coughing  the moment their own clothes were dry we lived in a perpetual atmosphere of steaming clothes they would insist upon leaving us which seemed to me discourteous after all that we had done for them and would dress themselves once more and start off home and get wet again before they got there  we would generally receive a letter a few days afterwards written by some relative informing us that both patients were doing as well as could be expected and promising to send us a card for the funeral in case of a relapse  our chief recreation our sole consolation during the long weeks of our imprisonment was to watch from our windows the pleasureseekers passing by in small open boats and to reflect what an awful day they had had or were going to have as the case might be  in the forenoon they would head up streamyoung men with their sweethearts nephews taking out their rich old aunts husbands and wives some of them pairs some of them odd ones stylishlooking girls with cousins energeticlooking men with dogs highclass silent parties low class noisy parties quarrelsome family partiesboatload after boatload they went by wet but still hopeful pointing out bits of blue sky to each other  in the evening they would return drenched and gloomy saying disagreeable things to one another  one couple and one couple only out of the many hundreds that passed under our review came back from the ordeal with pleasant faces  he was rowing hard and singing with a handkerchief tied round his head to keep his hat on and she was laughing at him while trying to hold up an umbrella with one hand and steer with the other  there are but two explanations to account for people being jolly on the river in the rain  the one i dismissed as being both uncharitable and improbable  the other was creditable to the human race and adopting it i took off my cap to this damp but cheerful pair as they went by they answered with a wave of the hand and i stood looking after them till they disappeared in the mist  i am inclined to think that those young people if they be still alive are happy  maybe fortune has been kind to them or maybe she has not but in either event they are i am inclined to think happier than are most people  now and again the daily tornado would rage with such fury as to defeat its own purpose by prematurely exhausting itself  on these rare occasions we would sit out on the deck and enjoy the unwonted luxury of fresh air  i remember well those few pleasant evenings the river luminous with the drowned light the dark banks where the night lurked the stormtossed sky jewelled here and there with stars  it was delightful not to hear for an hour or so the sullen thrashing of the rain but to listen to the leaping of the fishes the soft swirl raised by some waterrat swimming stealthily among the rushes the restless twitterings of the few still wakeful birds  an old corncrake lived near to us and the way he used to disturb all the other birds and keep them from going to sleep was shameful  amenda who was townbred mistook him at first for one of those cheap alarm clocks and wondered who was winding him up and why they went on doing it all night and above all why they didnt oil him  he would begin his unhallowed performance about dusk just as every respectable bird was preparing to settle down for the night  a family of thrushes had their nest a few yards from his stand and they used to get perfectly furious with him  theres that fool at it again the female thrush would say why cant he do it in the daytime if he must do it at all  she spoke of course in twitters but i am confident the above is a correct translation  after a while the young thrushes would wake up and begin chirping and then the mother would get madder than ever  cant you say something to him she would cry indignantly to her husband  how do you think the children can get to sleep poor things with that hideous row going on all night  might just as well be living in a sawmill  thus adjured the male thrush would put his head over the nest and call out in a nervous apologetic manner  i say you know you there i wish you wouldnt mind being quiet a bit my wife says she cant get the children to sleep  its too bad you know pon my word it is  gor on the corncrake would answer surlily  you keep your wife herself quiet thats enough for you to do  and on he would go again worse than before  then a mother blackbird from a little further off would join in the fray  ah its a good hiding he wants not a talking to  and if i was a cock id give it him  this remark would be made in a tone of withering contempt and would appear to bear reference to some previous discussion  youre quite right maam mrs thrush would reply  thats what i tell my husband but with rising inflection so that every lady in the plantation might hear he wouldnt move himself bless youno not if i and the children were to die before his eyes for want of sleep  ah he aint the only one my dear the blackbird would pipe back theyre all alike then in a voice more of sorrow than of angerbut there it aint their fault i suppose poor things  if you aint got the spirit of a bird you cant help yourself  i would strain my ears at this point to hear if the male blackbird was moved at all by these taunts but the only sound i could ever detect coming from his neighbourhood was that of palpably exaggerated snoring  by this time the whole glade would be awake expressing views concerning that corncrake that would have wounded a less callous nature  blow me tight bill some vulgar little hedgesparrow would chirp out in the midst of the hubbub if i dont believe the gent thinks es a singing  taint is fault bill would reply with mock sympathy  somebodys put a penny in the slot and e cant stop isself  irritated by the laugh that this would call forth from the younger birds the corncrake would exert himself to be more objectionable than ever and as a means to this end would commence giving his marvellous imitation of the sharpening of a rusty saw by a steel file  but at this an old crow not to be trifled with would cry out angrily  stop that now  if i come down to you ill peck your cranky head off i will  and then would follow silence for a quarter of an hour after which the whole thing would begin again     chapter v   brown and macshaughnassy came down together on the saturday afternoon and as soon as they had dried themselves and had had some tea we settled down to work  jephson had written that he would not be able to be with us until late in the evening and brown proposed that we should occupy ourselves until his arrival with plots  let each of us said he sketch out a plot  afterwards we can compare them and select the best  this we proceeded to do  the plots themselves i forget but i remember that at the subsequent judging each man selected his own and became so indignant at the bitter criticism to which it was subjected by the other two that he tore it up and for the next halfhour we sat and smoked in silence  when i was very young i yearned to know other peoples opinion of me and all my works now my chief aim is to avoid hearing it  in those days had any one told me there was half a line about myself in a newspaper i should have tramped london to obtain that publication  now when i see a column headed with my name i hurriedly fold up the paper and put it away from me subduing my natural curiosity to read it by saying to myself why should you  it will only upset you for the day  in my cubhood i possessed a friend  other friends have come into my life sincevery dear and precious friendsbut they have none of them been to me quite what this friend was  because he was my first friend and we lived together in a world that was much bigger than this worldmore full of joy and of grief and in that world we loved and hated deeper than we love and hate in this smaller world that i have come to dwell in since  he also had the very young mans craving to be criticised and we made it our custom to oblige each other  we did not know then that what we meant when we asked for criticism was encouragement  we thought that we were strongone does at the beginning of the battle and that we could bear to hear the truth  accordingly each one pointed out to the other one his errors and this task kept us both so busy that we had never time to say a word of praise to one another  that we each had a high opinion of the others talents i am convinced but our heads were full of silly saws  we said to ourselves there are many who will praise a man it is only his friend who will tell him of his faults  also we said no man sees his own shortcomings but when these are pointed out to him by another he is grateful and proceeds to mend them  as we came to know the world better we learnt the fallacy of these ideas  but then it was too late for the mischief had been done  when one of us had written anything he would read it to the other and when he had finished he would say now tell me what you think of itfrankly and as a friend  those were his words  but his thoughts though he may not have known them were  tell me it is clever and good my friend even if you do not think so the world is very cruel to those that have not yet conquered it and though we keep a careless face our young hearts are scored with wrinkles  often we grow weary and fainthearted  is it not so my friend  no one has faith in us and in our dark hours we doubt ourselves  you are my comrade  you know what of myself i have put into this thing that to others will be but an idle halfhours reading  tell me it is good my friend  put a little heart into me i pray you  but the other full of the lust of criticism which is civilisations substitute for cruelty would answer more in frankness than in friendship  then he who had written would flush angrily and scornful words would pass  one evening he read me a play he had written  there was much that was good in it but there were also faults there are in some plays and these i seized upon and made merry over  i could hardly have dealt out to the piece more unnecessary bitterness had i been a professional critic  as soon as i paused from my sport he rose and taking his manuscript from the table tore it in two and flung it in the firehe was but a very young man you must rememberand then standing before me with a white face told me unsolicited his opinion of me and of my art  after which double event it is perhaps needless to say that we parted in hot anger  i did not see him again for years  the streets of life are very crowded and if we loose each others hands we are soon hustled far apart  when i did next meet him it was by accident  i had left the whitehall rooms after a public dinner and glad of the cool night air was strolling home by the embankment  a man slouching along under the trees paused as i overtook him  you couldnt oblige me with a light could you guvnor he said  the voice sounded strange coming from the figure that it did  i struck a match and held it out to him shaded by my hands  as the faint light illumined his face i started back and let the match fall  harry  he answered with a short dry laugh  i didnt know it was you he said or i shouldnt have stopped you  how has it come to this old fellow i asked laying my hand upon his shoulder  his coat was unpleasantly greasy and i drew my hand away again as quickly as i could and tried to wipe it covertly upon my handkerchief  oh its a long story he answered carelessly and too conventional to be worth telling  some of us go up you know  some of us go down youre doing pretty well i hear  i suppose so i replied ive climbed a few feet up a greasy pole and am trying to stick there  but it is of you i want to talk  cant i do anything for you  we were passing under a gaslamp at the moment  he thrust his face forward close to mine and the light fell full and pitilessly upon it  do i look like a man you could do anything for he said  we walked on in silence side by side i casting about for words that might seize hold of him  you neednt worry about me he continued after a while im comfortable enough  we take life easily down here where i am  weve no disappointments  why did you give up like a weak coward i burst out angrily  you had talent  you would have won with ordinary perseverance  maybe he replied in the same even tone of indifference  i suppose i hadnt the grit  i think if somebody had believed in me it might have helped me  but nobody did and at last i lost belief in myself  and when a man loses that hes like a balloon with the gas let out  i listened to his words in indignation and astonishment  nobody believed in you i repeated  why i always believed in you you know that i  then i paused remembering our candid criticism of one another  did you he replied quietly i never heard you say so  goodnight  in the course of our strandward walking we had come to the neighbourhood of the savoy and as he spoke he disappeared down one of the dark turnings thereabouts  i hastened after him calling him by name but though i heard his quick steps before me for a little way they were soon swallowed up in the sound of other steps and when i reached the square in which the chapel stands i had lost all trace of him  a policeman was standing by the churchyard railings and of him i made inquiries  what sort of a gent was he sir questioned the man  a tall thin gentleman very shabbily dressedmight be mistaken for a tramp  ah theres a good many of that sort living in this town replied the man  im afraid youll have some difficulty in finding him  thus for a second time had i heard his footsteps die away knowing i should never listen for their drawing near again  i wondered as i walked oni have wondered before and sincewhether art even with a capital a is quite worth all the suffering that is inflicted in her behalfwhether she and we are better for all the scorning and the sneering all the envying and the hating that is done in her name  jephson arrived about nine oclock in the ferryboat  we were made acquainted with this fact by having our heads bumped against the sides of the saloon  somebody or other always had their head bumped whenever the ferryboat arrived  it was a heavy and cumbersome machine and the ferryboy was not a good punter  he admitted this frankly which was creditable of him  but he made no attempt to improve himself that is where he was wrong  his method was to arrange the punt before starting in a line with the point towards which he wished to proceed and then to push hard without ever looking behind him until something suddenly stopped him this was sometimes the bank sometimes another boat occasionally a steamer from six to a dozen times a day our riparian dwelling  that he never succeeded in staving the houseboat in speaks highly for the man who built her  one day he came down upon us with a tremendous crash  amenda was walking along the passage at the moment and the result to her was that she received a violent blow first on the left side of her head and then on the right  she was accustomed to accept one bump as a matter of course and to regard it as an intimation from the boy that he had come but this double knock annoyed her so much style was out of place in a mere ferryboy accordingly she went out to him in a state of high indignation  what do you think you are she cried balancing accounts by boxing his ears first on one side and then on the other a torpedo  what are you doing here at all  what do you want  i dont want nothin explained the boy rubbing his head ive brought a gent down  a gent said amenda looking round but seeing no one  what gent  a stout gent in a straw at answered the boy staring round him bewilderedly  well where is he asked amenda  i dunno replied the boy in an awed voice e was astandin there at the other end of the punt asmokin a cigar  just then a head appeared above the water and a spent but infuriated swimmer struggled up between the houseboat and the bank  oh there e is cried the boy delightedly evidently much relieved at this satisfactory solution of the mystery e must ha tumbled off the punt  youre quite right my lad thats just what he did do and theres your fee for assisting him to do it  saying which my dripping friend who had now scrambled upon deck leant over and following amendas excellent example expressed his feelings upon the boys head  there was one comforting reflection about the transaction as a whole and that was that the ferryboy had at last received a fit and proper reward for his services  i had often felt inclined to give him something myself  i think he was without exception the most clumsy and stupid boy i have ever come across and that is saying a good deal  his mother undertook that for threeandsixpence a week he should make himself generally useful to us for a couple of hours every morning  those were the old ladys very words and i repeated them to amenda when i introduced the boy to her  this is james amenda i said he will come down here every morning at seven and bring us our milk and the letters and from then till nine he will make himself generally useful  amenda took stock of him  it will be a change of occupation for him sir i should say by the look of him she remarked  after that whenever some more than usually stirring crash or bloodcurdling bump would cause us to leap from our seats and cry what on earth has happened  amenda would reply oh its only james mum making himself generally useful  whatever he lifted he let fall whatever he touched he upset whatever he came nearthat was not a fixturehe knocked over if it was a fixture it knocked him over  this was not carelessness it seemed to be a natural gift  never in his life i am convinced had he carried a bucketful of anything anywhere without tumbling over it before he got there  one of his duties was to water the flowers on the roof fortunatelyfor the flowersnature that summer stood drinks with a lavishness sufficient to satisfy the most confirmed vegetable toper otherwise every plant on our boat would have died from drought  never one drop of water did they receive from him  he was for ever taking them water but he never arrived there with it  as a rule he upset the pail before he got it on to the boat at all and this was the best thing that could happen because then the water simply went back into the river and did no harm to any one  sometimes however he would succeed in landing it and then the chances were he would spill it over the deck or into the passage  now and again he would get halfway up the ladder before the accident occurred  twice he nearly reached the top and once he actually did gain the roof  what happened there on that memorable occasion will never be known  the boy himself when picked up could explain nothing it is supposed that he lost his head with the pride of the achievement and essayed feats that neither his previous training nor his natural abilities justified him in attempting  however that may be the fact remains that the main body of the water came down the kitchen chimney and that the boy and the empty pail arrived together on deck before they knew they had started  when he could find nothing else to damage he would go out of his way to upset himself  he could not be sure of stepping from his own punt on to the boat with safety  as often as not he would catch his foot in the chain or the puntpole and arrive on his chest  amenda used to condole with him  your mother ought to be ashamed of herself i heard her telling him one morning she could never have taught you to walk  what you want is a gocart  he was a willing lad but his stupidity was supernatural  a comet appeared in the sky that year and everybody was talking about it  one day he said to me  theres a comet coming aint there sir  he talked about it as though it were a circus  coming i answered its come  havent you seen it  no sir  oh well you have a look for it tonight  its worth seeing  yees sir i should like to see it  its got a tail aint it sir  yes a very fine tail  yees sir they said it ad a tail  where do you go to see it sir  go  you dont want to go anywhere  youll see it in your own garden at ten oclock  he thanked me and tumbling over a sack of potatoes plunged head foremost into his punt and departed  next morning i asked him if he had seen the comet  no sir i couldnt see it anywhere  did you look  yees sir  i looked a long time  how on earth did you manage to miss it then i exclaimed  it was a clear enough night  where did you look  in our garden sir  where you told me  whereabouts in the garden chimed in amenda who happened to be standing by under the gooseberry bushes  yeeseverywhere  that is what he had done he had taken the stable lantern and searched the garden for it  but the day when he broke even his own record for foolishness happened about three weeks later  macshaughnassy was staying with us at the time and on the friday evening he mixed us a salad according to a recipe given him by his aunt  on the saturday morning everybody was of course very ill  everybody always is very ill after partaking of any dish prepared by macshaughnassy  some people attempt to explain this fact by talking glibly of cause and effect  macshaughnassy maintains that it is simply coincidence  how do you know he says that you wouldnt have been ill if you hadnt eaten any  youre queer enough now any one can see and im very sorry for you but for all that you can tell if you hadnt eaten any of that stuff you might have been very much worseperhaps dead  in all probability it has saved your life  and for the rest of the day he assumes towards you the attitude of a man who has dragged you from the grave  the moment jimmy arrived i seized hold of him  jimmy i said you must rush off to the chemists immediately  dont stop for anything  tell him to give you something for colicthe result of vegetable poisoning  it must be something very strong and enough for four  dont forget something to counteract the effects of vegetable poisoning  hurry up or it may be too late  my excitement communicated itself to the boy  he tumbled back into his punt and pushed off vigorously  i watched him land and disappear in the direction of the village  half an hour passed but jimmy did not return  no one felt sufficiently energetic to go after him  we had only just strength enough to sit still and feebly abuse him  at the end of an hour we were all feeling very much better  at the end of an hour and a half we were glad he had not returned when he ought to have and were only curious as to what had become of him  in the evening strolling through the village we saw him sitting by the open door of his mothers cottage with a shawl wrapped round him  he was looking worn and ill  why jimmy i said whats the matter  why didnt you come back this morning  i couldnt sir jimmy answered i was so queer  mother made me go to bed  you seemed all right in the morning i said whats made you queer  what mr jones give me sir it upset me awful  a light broke in upon me  what did you say jimmy when you got to mr joness shop i asked  i told im what you said sir that e was to give me something to counteract the effects of vegetable poisoning  and that it was to be very strong and enough for four  and what did he say  e said that was only your nonsense sir and that id better have enough for one to begin with and then e asked me if id been eating green apples again  and you told him  yees sir i told im id ad a few and e said it served me right and that e oped it would be a warning to me  and then e put something fizzy in a glass and told me to drink it  and you drank it  yees sir  it never occurred to you jimmy that there was nothing the matter with youthat you were never feeling better in your life and that you did not require any medicine  no sir  did one single scintilla of thought of any kind occur to you in connection with the matter jimmy from beginning to end  no sir  people who never met jimmy disbelieve this story  they argue that its premises are in disaccord with the known laws governing human nature that its details do not square with the average of probability  people who have seen and conversed with jimmy accept it with simple faith  the advent of jephsonwhich i trust the reader has not entirely forgottencheered us up considerably  jephson was always at his best when all other things were at their worst  it was not that he struggled in mark tapley fashion to appear most cheerful when most depressed it was that petty misfortunes and mishaps genuinely amused and inspirited him  most of us can recall our unpleasant experiences with amused affection jephson possessed the robuster philosophy that enabled him to enjoy his during their actual progress  he arrived drenched to the skin chuckling hugely at the idea of having come down on a visit to a houseboat in such weather  under his warming influence the hard lines on our faces thawed and by supper time we were as all englishmen and women who wish to enjoy life should be independent of the weather  later on as if disheartened by our indifference the rain ceased and we took our chairs out on the deck and sat watching the lightning which still played incessantly  then not unnaturally the talk drifted into a sombre channel and we began recounting stories dealing with the gloomy and mysterious side of life  some of these were worth remembering and some were not  the one that left the strongest impression on my mind was a tale that jephson told us  i had been relating a somewhat curious experience of my own  i met a man in the strand one day that i knew very well as i thought though i had not seen him for years  we walked together to charing cross and there we shook hands and parted  next morning i spoke of this meeting to a mutual friend and then i learnt for the first time that the man had died six months before  the natural inference was that i had mistaken one man for another an error that not having a good memory for faces i frequently fall into what was remarkable about the matter however was that throughout our walk i had conversed with the man under the impression that he was that other dead man and whether by coincidence or not his replies had never once suggested to me my mistake  as soon as i finished jephson who had been listening very thoughtfully asked me if i believed in spiritualism to its fullest extent  that is rather a large question i answered  what do you mean by spiritualism to its fullest extent  well do you believe that the spirits of the dead have not only the power of revisiting this earth at their will but that when here they have the power of action or rather of exciting to action  let me put a definite case  a spiritualist friend of mine a sensible and by no means imaginative man once told me that a table through the medium of which the spirit of a friend had been in the habit of communicating with him came slowly across the room towards him of its own accord one night as he sat alone and pinioned him against the wall  now can any of you believe that or cant you  i could brown took it upon himself to reply but before doing so i should wish for an introduction to the friend who told you the story speaking generally he continued it seems to me that the difference between what we call the natural and the supernatural is merely the difference between frequency and rarity of occurrence  having regard to the phenomena we are compelled to admit i think it illogical to disbelieve anything we are unable to disprove  for my part remarked macshaughnassy i can believe in the ability of our spirit friends to give the quaint entertainments credited to them much easier than i can in their desire to do so  you mean added jephson that you cannot understand why a spirit not compelled as we are by the exigencies of society should care to spend its evenings carrying on a laboured and childish conversation with a room full of abnormally uninteresting people  that is precisely what i cannot understand macshaughnassy agreed  nor i either said jephson  but i was thinking of something very different altogether  suppose a man died with the dearest wish of his heart unfulfilled do you believe that his spirit might have power to return to earth and complete the interrupted work  well answered macshaughnassy if one admits the possibility of spirits retaining any interest in the affairs of this world at all it is certainly more reasonable to imagine them engaged upon a task such as you suggest than to believe that they occupy themselves with the performance of mere drawingroom tricks  but what are you leading up to  why to this replied jephson seating himself straddlelegged across his chair and leaning his arms upon the back  i was told a story this morning at the hospital by an old french doctor  the actual facts are few and simple all that is known can be read in the paris police records of sixtytwo years ago  the most important part of the case however is the part that is not known and that never will be known  the story begins with a great wrong done by one man unto another man what the wrong was i do not know  i am inclined to think however it was connected with a woman  i think that because he who had been wronged hated him who had wronged him with a hate such as does not often burn in a mans brain unless it be fanned by the memory of a womans breath  still that is only conjecture and the point is immaterial  the man who had done the wrong fled and the other man followed him  it became a pointtopoint race the first man having the advantage of a days start the course was the whole world and the stakes were the first mans life  travellers were few and far between in those days and this made the trail easy to follow  the first man never knowing how far or how near the other was behind him and hoping now and again that he might have baffled him would rest for a while  the second man knowing always just how far the first one was before him never paused and thus each day the man who was spurred by hate drew nearer to the man who was spurred by fear  at this town the answer to the nevervaried question would be  at seven oclock last evening msieur  sevenah eighteen hours  give me something to eat quick while the horses are being put to  at the next the calculation would be sixteen hours  passing a lonely chalet monsieur puts his head out of the window  how long since a carriage passed this way with a tall fair man inside  such a one passed early this morning msieur  thanks drive on a hundred francs apiece if you are through the pass before daybreak  and what for dead horses msieur  twice their value when living  one day the man who was ridden by fear looked up and saw before him the open door of a cathedral and passing in knelt down and prayed  he prayed long and fervently for men when they are in sore straits clutch eagerly at the straws of faith  he prayed that he might be forgiven his sin and more important still that he might be pardoned the consequences of his sin and be delivered from his adversary and a few chairs from him facing him knelt his enemy praying also  but the second mans prayer being a thanksgiving merely was short so that when the first man raised his eyes he saw the face of his enemy gazing at him across the chairtops with a mocking smile upon it  he made no attempt to rise but remained kneeling fascinated by the look of joy that shone out of the other mans eyes  and the other man moved the highbacked chairs one by one and came towards him softly  then just as the man who had been wronged stood beside the man who had wronged him full of gladness that his opportunity had come there burst from the cathedral tower a sudden clash of bells and the man whose opportunity had come broke his heart and fell back dead with that mocking smile still playing round his mouth  and so he lay there  then the man who had done the wrong rose up and passed out praising god  what became of the body of the other man is not known  it was the body of a stranger who had died suddenly in the cathedral  there was none to identify it none to claim it  years passed away and the survivor in the tragedy became a worthy and useful citizen and a noted man of science  in his laboratory were many objects necessary to him in his researches and prominent among them stood in a certain corner a human skeleton  it was a very old and muchmended skeleton and one day the longexpected end arrived and it tumbled to pieces  thus it became necessary to purchase another  the man of science visited a dealer he well knewa little parchment faced old man who kept a dingy shop where nothing was ever sold within the shadow of the towers of notre dame  the little parchmentfaced old man had just the very thing that monsieur wanteda singularly fine and wellproportioned study  it should be sent round and set up in monsieurs laboratory that very afternoon  the dealer was as good as his word  when monsieur entered his laboratory that evening the thing was in its place  monsieur seated himself in his highbacked chair and tried to collect his thoughts  but monsieurs thoughts were unruly and inclined to wander and to wander always in one direction  monsieur opened a large volume and commenced to read  he read of a man who had wronged another and fled from him the other man following finding himself reading this he closed the book angrily and went and stood by the window and looked out  he saw before him the sunpierced nave of a great cathedral and on the stones lay a dead man with a mocking smile upon his face  cursing himself for a fool he turned away with a laugh  but his laugh was shortlived for it seemed to him that something else in the room was laughing also  struck suddenly still with his feet glued to the ground he stood listening for a while then sought with starting eyes the corner from where the sound had seemed to come  but the white thing standing there was only grinning  monsieur wiped the damp sweat from his head and hands and stole out  for a couple of days he did not enter the room again  on the third telling himself that his fears were those of a hysterical girl he opened the door and went in  to shame himself he took his lamp in his hand and crossing over to the far corner where the skeleton stood examined it  a set of bones bought for three hundred francs  was he a child to be scared by such a bogey  he held his lamp up in front of the things grinning head  the flame of the lamp flickered as though a faint breath had passed over it  the man explained this to himself by saying that the walls of the house were old and cracked and that the wind might creep in anywhere  he repeated this explanation to himself as he recrossed the room walking backwards with his eyes fixed on the thing  when he reached his desk he sat down and gripped the arms of his chair till his fingers turned white  he tried to work but the empty sockets in that grinning head seemed to be drawing him towards them  he rose and battled with his inclination to fly screaming from the room  glancing fearfully about him his eye fell upon a high screen standing before the door  he dragged it forward and placed it between himself and the thing so that he could not see itnor it see him  then he sat down again to his work  for a while he forced himself to look at the book in front of him but at last unable to control himself any longer he suffered his eyes to follow their own bent  it may have been an hallucination  he may have accidentally placed the screen so as to favour such an illusion  but what he saw was a bony hand coming round the corner of the screen and with a cry he fell to the floor in a swoon  the people of the house came running in and lifting him up carried him out and laid him upon his bed  as soon as he recovered his first question was where had they found the thingwhere was it when they entered the room and when they told him they had seen it standing where it always stood and had gone down into the room to look again because of his frenzied entreaties and returned trying to hide their smiles he listened to their talk about overwork and the necessity for change and rest and said they might do with him as they would  so for many months the laboratory door remained locked  then there came a chill autumn evening when the man of science opened it again and closed it behind him  he lighted his lamp and gathered his instruments and books around him and sat down before them in his highbacked chair  and the old terror returned to him  but this time he meant to conquer himself  his nerves were stronger now and his brain clearer he would fight his unreasoning fear  he crossed to the door and locked himself in and flung the key to the other end of the room where it fell among jars and bottles with an echoing clatter  later on his old housekeeper going her final round tapped at his door and wished him goodnight as was her custom  she received no response at first and growing nervous tapped louder and called again and at length an answering goodnight came back to her  she thought little about it at the time but afterwards she remembered that the voice that had replied to her had been strangely grating and mechanical  trying to describe it she likened it to such a voice as she would imagine coming from a statue  next morning his door remained still locked  it was no unusual thing for him to work all night and far into the next day so no one thought to be surprised  when however evening came and yet he did not appear his servants gathered outside the room and whispered remembering what had happened once before  they listened but could hear no sound  they shook the door and called to him then beat with their fists upon the wooden panels  but still no sound came from the room  becoming alarmed they decided to burst open the door and after many blows it gave way and they crowded in  he sat bolt upright in his highbacked chair  they thought at first he had died in his sleep  but when they drew nearer and the light fell upon him they saw the livid marks of bony fingers round his throat and in his eyes there was a terror such as is not often seen in human eyes        brown was the first to break the silence that followed  he asked me if i had any brandy on board  he said he felt he should like just a nip of brandy before going to bed  that is one of the chief charms of jephsons stories they always make you feel you want a little brandy     chapter vi   cats remarked jephson to me one afternoon as we sat in the punt discussing the plot of our novel cats are animals for whom i entertain a very great respect  cats and nonconformists seem to me the only things in this world possessed of a practicable working conscience  watch a cat doing something mean and wrongif ever one gives you the chance notice how anxious she is that nobody should see her doing it and how prompt if detected to pretend that she was not doing itthat she was not even thinking of doing itthat as a matter of fact she was just about to do something else quite different  you might almost think they had a soul  only this morning i was watching that tortoiseshell of yours on the houseboat  she was creeping along the roof behind the flowerboxes stalking a young thrush that had perched upon a coil of rope  murder gleamed from her eye assassination lurked in every twitching muscle of her body  as she crouched to spring fate for once favouring the weak directed her attention to myself and she became for the first time aware of my presence  it acted upon her as a heavenly vision upon a biblical criminal  in an instant she was a changed being  the wicked beast going about seeking whom it might devour had vanished  in its place sat a longtailed furry angel gazing up into the sky with an expression that was onethird innocence and twothirds admiration of the beauties of nature  what was she doing there did i want to know  why could i not see playing with a bit of earth  surely i was not so evil minded as to imagine she wanted to kill that dear little birdgod bless it  then note an old tom slinking home in the early morning after a night spent on a roof of bad repute  can you picture to yourself a living creature less eager to attract attention  dear me you can all but hear it saying to itself id no idea it was so late how time does go when one is enjoying oneself  i do hope i shant meet any one i knowvery awkward its being so light  in the distance it sees a policeman and stops suddenly within the shelter of a shadow  now whats he doing there it says and close to our door too  i cant go in while hes hanging about  hes sure to see and recognise me and hes just the sort of man to talk to the servants  it hides itself behind a post and waits peeping cautiously round the corner from time to time  the policeman however seems to have taken up his residence at that particular spot and the cat becomes worried and excited  whats the matter with the fool it mutters indignantly is he dead why dont he move on hes always telling other people to  stupid ass  just then a faroff cry of milk is heard and the cat starts up in an agony of alarm  great scott hark at that  why everybody will be down before i get in  well i cant help it  i must chance it  he glances round at himself and hesitates  i wouldnt mind if i didnt look so dirty and untidy he muses people are so prone to think evil in this world  ah well he adds giving himself a shake theres nothing else for it i must put my trust in providence its pulled me through before here goes  he assumes an aspect of chastened sorrow and trots along with a demure and saddened step  it is evident he wishes to convey the idea that he has been out all night on work connected with the vigilance association and is now returning home sick at heart because of the sights that he has seen  he squirms in unnoticed through a window and has just time to give himself a hurried lick down before he hears the cooks step on the stairs  when she enters the kitchen he is curled up on the hearthrug fast asleep  the opening of the shutters awakes him  he rises and comes forward yawning and stretching himself  dear me is it morning then he says drowsily  heighho  ive had such a lovely sleep cook and such a beautiful dream about poor mother  cats do you call them  why they are christians in everything except the number of legs  they certainly are i responded wonderfully cunning little animals and it is not by their moral and religious instincts alone that they are so closely linked to man the marvellous ability they display in taking care of number one is worthy of the human race itself  some friends of mine had a cat a big black tom they have got half of him still  they had reared him from a kitten and in their homely undemonstrative way they liked him  there was nothing however approaching passion on either side  one day a chinchilla came to live in the neighbourhood under the charge of an elderly spinster and the two cats met at a garden wall party  what sort of diggings have you got asked the chinchilla  oh pretty fair  nice people  yes nice enoughas people go  pretty willing  look after you well and all that sort of thing  yesoh yes  ive no fault to find with them  whats the victuals like  oh the usual thing you know bones and scraps and a bit of dogbiscuit now and then for a change  bones and dogbiscuits  do you mean to say you eat bones  yes when i can get em  why whats wrong about them  shade of egyptian isis bones and dogbiscuits  dont you ever get any spring chickens or a sardine or a lamb cutlet  chickens  sardines  what are you talking about  what are sardines  what are sardines  oh my dear child the chinchilla was a lady cat and always called gentlemen friends a little older than herself dear child these people of yours are treating you just shamefully  come sit down and tell me all about it  what do they give you to sleep on  the floor  i thought so and skim milk and water to drink i suppose  it is a bit thin  i can quite imagine it  you must leave these people my dear at once  but where am i to go to  anywhere  but wholl take me in  anybody if you go the right way to work  how many times do you think ive changed my people  sevenand bettered myself on each occasion why do you know where i was born  in a pigsty  there were three of us mother and i and my little brother  mother would leave us every evening returning generally just as it was getting light  one morning she did not come back  we waited and waited but the day passed on and she did not return and we grew hungrier and hungrier and at last we lay down side by side and cried ourselves to sleep  in the evening peeping through a hole in the door we saw her coming across the field  she was crawling very slowly with her body close down against the ground  we called to her and she answered with a low crroo but she did not hasten her pace  she crept in and rolled over on her side and we ran to her for we were almost starving  we lay long upon her breasts and she licked us over and over  i dropped asleep upon her and in the night i awoke feeling cold  i crept closer to her but that only made me colder still and she was wet and clammy with a dark moisture that was oozing from her side  i did not know what it was at that time but i have learnt since  that was when i could hardly have been four weeks old and from that day to this ive looked after myself youve got to do that in this world my dear  for a while i and my brother lived on in that sty and kept ourselves  it was a grim struggle at first two babies fighting for life but we pulled through  at the end of about three months wandering farther from home than usual i came upon a cottage standing in the fields  it looked warm and cosy through the open door and i went in i have always been blessed with plenty of nerve  some children were playing round the fire and they welcomed me and made much of me  it was a new sensation to me and i stayed there  i thought the place a palace at the time  i might have gone on thinking so if it had not been that passing through the village one day i happened to catch sight of a room behind a shop  there was a carpet on the floor and a rug before the fire  i had never known till then that there were such luxuries in the world  i determined to make that shop my home and i did so  how did you manage it asked the black cat who was growing interested  by the simple process of walking in and sitting down  my dear child cheeks the open sesame to every door  the cat that works hard dies of starvation the cat that has brains is kicked downstairs for a fool and the cat that has virtue is drowned for a scamp but the cat that has cheek sleeps on a velvet cushion and dines on cream and horseflesh  i marched straight in and rubbed myself against the old mans legs  he and his wife were quite taken with what they called my trustfulness and adopted me with enthusiasm  strolling about the fields of an evening i often used to hear the children of the cottage calling my name  it was weeks before they gave up seeking for me  one of them the youngest would sob herself to sleep of a night thinking that i was dead they were affectionate children  i boarded with my shopkeeping friends for nearly a year and from them i went to some new people who had lately come to the neighbourhood and who possessed a really excellent cook  i think i could have been very satisfied with these people but unfortunately they came down in the world and had to give up the big house and the cook and take a cottage and i did not care to go back to that sort of life  accordingly i looked about for a fresh opening  there was a curious old fellow who lived not far off  people said he was rich but nobody liked him  he was shaped differently from other men  i turned the matter over in my mind for a day or two and then determined to give him a trial  being a lonely sort of man he might make a fuss over me and if not i could go  my surmise proved correct  i have never been more petted than i was by toady as the village boys had dubbed him  my present guardian is foolish enough over me goodness knows but she has other ties while toady had nothing else to love not even himself  he could hardly believe his eyes at first when i jumped up on his knees and rubbed myself against his ugly face  why kitty he said do you know youre the first living thing that has ever come to me of its own accord  there were tears in his funny little red eyes as he said that  i remained two years with toady and was very happy indeed  then he fell ill and strange people came to the house and i was neglected toady liked me to come up and lie upon the bed where he could stroke me with his long thin hand and at first i used to do this  but a sick man is not the best of company as you can imagine and the atmosphere of a sick room not too healthy so all things considered i felt it was time for me to make a fresh move  i had some difficulty in getting away  toady was always asking for me and they tried to keep me with him he seemed to lie easier when i was there  i succeeded at length however and once outside the door i put sufficient distance between myself and the house to ensure my not being captured for i knew toady so long as he lived would never cease hoping to get me back  where to go i did not know  two or three homes were offered me but none of them quite suited me  at one place where i put up for a day just to see how i liked it there was a dog and at another which would otherwise have done admirably they kept a baby  whatever you do never stop at a house where they keep a baby  if a child pulls your tail or ties a paper bag round your head you can give it one for itself and nobody blames you  well serve you right they say to the yelling brat you shouldnt tease the poor thing  but if you resent a babys holding you by the throat and trying to gouge out your eye with a wooden ladle you are called a spiteful beast and shood all round the garden  if people keep babies they dont keep me thats my rule  after sampling some three or four families i finally fixed upon a banker  offers more advantageous from a worldly point of view were open to me  i could have gone to a publichouse where the victuals were simply unlimited and where the back door was left open all night  but about the bankers he was also a churchwarden and his wife never smiled at anything less than a joke by the bishop there was an atmosphere of solid respectability that i felt would be comforting to my nature  my dear child you will come across cynics who will sneer at respectability dont you listen to them  respectability is its own rewardand a very real and practical reward  it may not bring you dainty dishes and soft beds but it brings you something better and more lasting  it brings you the consciousness that you are living the right life that you are doing the right thing that so far as earthly ingenuity can fix it you are going to the right place and that other folks aint  dont you ever let any one set you against respectability  its the most satisfying thing i know of in this worldand about the cheapest  i was nearly three years with this family and was sorry when i had to go  i should never have left if i could have helped it but one day something happened at the bank which necessitated the bankers taking a sudden journey to spain and after that the house became a somewhat unpleasant place to live in  noisy disagreeable people were continually knocking at the door and making rows in the passage and at night folks threw bricks at the windows  i was in a delicate state of health at the time and my nerves could not stand it  i said goodbye to the town and making my way back into the country put up with a county family  they were great swells but i should have preferred them had they been more homely  i am of an affectionate disposition and i like every one about me to love me  they were good enough to me in their distant way but they did not take much notice of me and i soon got tired of lavishing attentions on people that neither valued nor responded to them  from these people i went to a retired potato merchant  it was a social descent but a rise so far as comfort and appreciation were concerned they appeared to be an exceedingly nice family and to be extremely fond of me  i say they appeared to be these things because the sequel proved that they were neither  six months after i had come to them they went away and left me  they never asked me to accompany them  they made no arrangements for me to stay behind  they evidently did not care what became of me  such egotistical indifference to the claims of friendship i had never before met with  it shook my faithnever too robustin human nature  i determined that in future no one should have the opportunity of disappointing my trust in them  i selected my present mistress on the recommendation of a gentleman friend of mine who had formerly lived with her  he said she was an excellent caterer  the only reason he had left her was that she expected him to be in at ten each night and that hour didnt fit in with his other arrangements  it made no difference to meas a matter of fact i do not care for these midnight reunions that are so popular amongst us  there are always too many cats for one properly to enjoy oneself and sooner or later a rowdy element is sure to creep in  i offered myself to her and she accepted me gratefully  but i have never liked her and never shall  she is a silly old woman and bores me  she is however devoted to me and unless something extra attractive turns up i shall stick to her  that my dear is the story of my life so far as it has gone  i tell it you to show you how easy it is to be taken in  fix on your house and mew piteously at the back door  when it is opened run in and rub yourself against the first leg you come across  rub hard and look up confidingly  nothing gets round human beings i have noticed quicker than confidence  they dont get much of it and it pleases them  always be confiding  at the same time be prepared for emergencies  if you are still doubtful as to your reception try and get yourself slightly wet why people should prefer a wet cat to a dry one i have never been able to understand but that a wet cat is practically sure of being taken in and gushed over while a dry cat is liable to have the garden hose turned upon it is an undoubted fact  also if you can possibly manage it and it is offered you eat a bit of dry bread  the human race is always stirred to its deepest depths by the sight of a cat eating a bit of dry bread  my friends black tom profited by the chinchillas wisdom  a catless couple had lately come to live next door  he determined to adopt them on trial  accordingly on the first rainy day he went out soon after lunch and sat for four hours in an open field  in the evening soaked to the skin and feeling pretty hungry he went mewing to their door  one of the maids opened it he rushed under her skirts and rubbed himself against her legs  she screamed and down came the master and the mistress to know what was the matter  its a stray cat mum said the girl  turn it out said the master  oh no dont said the mistress  oh poor thing its wet said the housemaid  perhaps its hungry said the cook  try it with a bit of dry bread sneered the master who wrote for the newspapers and thought he knew everything  a stale crust was proffered  the cat ate it greedily and afterwards rubbed himself gratefully against the mans light trousers  this made the man ashamed of himself likewise of his trousers oh well let it stop if it wants to he said  so the cat was made comfortable and stayed on  meanwhile its own family were seeking for it high and low  they had not cared over much for it while they had had it now it was gone they were inconsolable  in the light of its absence it appeared to them the one thing that had made the place home  the shadows of suspicion gathered round the case  the cats disappearance at first regarded as a mystery began to assume the shape of a crime  the wife openly accused the husband of never having liked the animal and more than hinted that he and the gardener between them could give a tolerably truthful account of its last moments an insinuation that the husband repudiated with a warmth that only added credence to the original surmise  the bullterrier was had up and searchingly examined  fortunately for him he had not had a single fight for two whole days  had any recent traces of blood been detected upon him it would have gone hard with him  the person who suffered most however was the youngest boy  three weeks before he had dressed the cat in dolls clothes and taken it round the garden in the perambulator  he himself had forgotten the incident but justice though tardy was on his track  the misdeed was suddenly remembered at the very moment when unavailing regret for the loss of the favourite was at its deepest so that to box his ears and send him then and there straight off to bed was felt to be a positive relief  at the end of a fortnight the cat finding he had not after all bettered himself came back  the family were so surprised that at first they could not be sure whether he was flesh and blood or a spirit come to comfort them  after watching him eat half a pound of raw steak they decided he was material and caught him up and hugged him to their bosoms  for a week they overfed him and made much of him  then the excitement cooling he found himself dropping back into his old position and didnt like it and went next door again  the next door people had also missed him and they likewise greeted his return with extravagant ebullitions of joy  this gave the cat an idea he saw that his game was to play the two families off one against the other which he did  he spent an alternate fortnight with each and lived like a fighting cock  his return was always greeted with enthusiasm and every means were adopted to induce him to stay  his little whims were carefully studied his favourite dishes kept in constant readiness  the destination of his goings leaked out at length and then the two families quarrelled about him over the fence  my friend accused the newspaper man of having lured him away  the newspaper man retorted that the poor creature had come to his door wet and starving and added that he would be ashamed to keep an animal merely to illtreat it  they have a quarrel about him twice a week on the average  it will probably come to blows one of these days  jephson appeared much surprised by this story  he remained thoughtful and silent  i asked him if he would like to hear any more and as he offered no active opposition i went on  maybe he was asleep that idea did not occur to me at the time  i told him of my grandmothers cat who after living a blameless life for upwards of eleven years and bringing up a family of something like sixtysix not counting those that died in infancy and the waterbutt took to drink in her old age and was run over while in a state of intoxication oh the justice of it  by a brewers dray  i have read in temperance tracts that no dumb animal will touch a drop of alcoholic liquor  my advice is if you wish to keep them respectable dont give them a chance to get at it  i knew a ponybut never mind him we are talking about my grandmothers cat  a leaky beertap was the cause of her downfall  a saucer used to be placed underneath it to catch the drippings  one day the cat coming in thirsty and finding nothing else to drink lapped up a little liked it and lapped a little more went away for half an hour and came back and finished the saucerful  then sat down beside it and waited for it to fill again  from that day till the hour she died i dont believe that cat was ever once quite sober  her days she passed in a drunken stupor before the kitchen fire  her nights she spent in the beer cellar  my grandmother shocked and grieved beyond expression gave up her barrel and adopted bottles  the cat thus condemned to enforced abstinence meandered about the house for a day and a half in a disconsolate quarrelsome mood  then she disappeared returning at eleven oclock as tight as a drum  where she went and how she managed to procure the drink we never discovered but the same programme was repeated every day  some time during the morning she would contrive to elude our vigilance and escape and late every evening she would come reeling home across the fields in a condition that i will not sully my pen by attempting to describe  it was on saturday night that she met the sad end to which i have before alluded  she must have been very drunk for the man told us that in consequence of the darkness and the fact that his horses were tired he was proceeding at little more than a snails pace  i think my grandmother was rather relieved than otherwise  she had been very fond of the cat at one time but its recent conduct had alienated her affection  we children buried it in the garden under the mulberry tree but the old lady insisted that there should be no tombstone not even a mound raised  so it lies there unhonoured in a drunkards grave  i also told him of another cat our family had once possessed  she was the most motherly thing i have ever known  she was never happy without a family  indeed i cannot remember her when she hadnt a family in one stage or another  she was not very particular what sort of a family it was  if she could not have kittens then she would content herself with puppies or rats  anything that she could wash and feed seemed to satisfy her  i believe she would have brought up chickens if we had entrusted them to her  all her brains must have run to motherliness for she hadnt much sense she could never tell the difference between her own children and other peoples  she thought everything young was a kitten  we once mixed up a spaniel puppy that had lost its own mother among her progeny  i shall never forget her astonishment when it first barked  she boxed both its ears and then sat looking down at it with an expression of indignant sorrow that was really touching  youre going to be a credit to your mother she seemed to be saying youre a nice comfort to any ones old age you are making a row like that  and look at your ears flopping all over your face  i dont know where you pick up such ways  he was a good little dog  he did try to mew and he did try to wash his face with his paw and to keep his tail still but his success was not commensurate with his will  i do not know which was the sadder to reflect upon his efforts to become a creditable kitten or his foster mothers despair of ever making him one  later on we gave her a baby squirrel to rear  she was nursing a family of her own at the time but she adopted him with enthusiasm under the impression that he was another kitten though she could not quite make out how she had come to overlook him  he soon became her prime favourite  she liked his colour and took a mothers pride in his tail what troubled her was that it would cock up over his head  she would hold it down with one paw and lick it by the halfhour together trying to make it set properly  but the moment she let it go up it would cock again  i have heard her cry with vexation because of this  one day a neighbouring cat came to see her and the squirrel was clearly the subject of their talk  its a good colour said the friend looking critically at the supposed kitten who was sitting up on his haunches combing his whiskers and saying the only truthfully pleasant thing about him that she could think of  hes a lovely colour exclaimed our cat proudly  i dont like his legs much remarked the friend  no responded his mother thoughtfully youre right there  his legs are his weak point  i cant say i think much of his legs myself  maybe theyll fill out later on suggested the friend kindly  oh i hope so replied the mother regaining her momentarily dashed cheerfulness  oh yes theyll come all right in time  and then look at his tail  now honestly did you ever see a kitten with a finer tail  yes its a good tail assented the other but why do you do it up over his head  i dont answered our cat  it goes that way  i cant make it out  i suppose it will come straight as he gets older  it will be awkward if it dont said the friend  oh but im sure it will replied our cat  i must lick it more  its a tail that wants a good deal of licking you can see that  and for hours that afternoon after the other cat had gone she sat trimming it and at the end when she lifted her paw off it and it flew back again like a steel spring over the squirrels head she sat and gazed at it with feelings that only those among my readers who have been mothers themselves will be able to comprehend  what have i done she seemed to saywhat have i done that this trouble should come upon me  jephson roused himself on my completion of this anecdote and sat up  you and your friends appear to have been the possessors of some very remarkable cats he observed  yes i answered our family has been singularly fortunate in its cats  singularly so agreed jephson i have never met but one man from whom i have heard more wonderful cat talk than at one time or another i have from you  oh i said not perhaps without a touch of jealousy in my voice and who was he  he was a seafaring man replied jephson  i met him on a hampstead tram and we discussed the subject of animal sagacity  yes sir he said monkeys is cute  ive come across monkeys as could give points to one or two lubbers ive sailed under and elephants is pretty spry if you can believe all thats told of em  ive heard some tall tales about elephants  and of course dogs has their heads screwed on all right i dont say as they aint  but what i do say is that for straightforard levelheaded reasoning give me cats  you see sir a dog he thinks a powerful deal of a mannever was such a cute thing as a man in a dogs opinion and he takes good care that everybody knows it  naturally enough we says a dog is the most intellectual animal there is  now a cat shes got her own opinion about human beings  she dont say much but you can tell enough to make you anxious not to hear the whole of it  the consequence is we says a cats got no intelligence  thats where we let our prejudice steer our judgment wrong  in a matter of plain common sense there aint a cat living as couldnt take the lee side of a dog and fly round him  now have you ever noticed a dog at the end of a chain trying to kill a cat as is sitting washing her face threequarters of an inch out of his reach  of course you have  well whos got the sense out of those two  the cat knows that it aint in the nature of steel chains to stretch  the dog who ought youd think to know a durned sight more about em than she does is sure they will if you only bark loud enough  then again have you ever been made mad by cats screeching in the night and jumped out of bed and opened the window and yelled at them did they ever budge an inch for that though you shrieked loud enough to skeer the dead and waved your arms about like a man in a play  not they  theyve turned and looked at you thats all  yell away old man theyve said we like to hear you the more the merrier  then what have you done  why youve snatched up a hairbrush or a boot or a candlestick and made as if youd throw it at them  theyve seen your attitude theyve seen the thing in your hand but they aint moved a point  they knew as you werent going to chuck valuable property out of window with the chance of getting it lost or spoiled  theyve got sense themselves and they give you credit for having some  if you dont believe thats the reason you try showing them a lump of coal or half a brick next timesomething as they know you will throw  before youre ready to heave it there wont be a cat within aim  then as to judgment and knowledge of the world why dogs are babies to em  have you ever tried telling a yarn before a cat sir  i replied that cats had often been present during anecdotal recitals of mine but that hitherto i had paid no particular attention to their demeanour  ah well you take an opportunity of doing so one day sir answered the old fellow its worth the experiment  if youre telling a story before a cat and she dont get uneasy during any part of the narrative you can reckon youve got hold of a thing as it will be safe for you to tell to the lord chief justice of england  ive got a messmate he continued william cooley is his name  we call him truthful billy  hes as good a seaman as ever trod quarterdeck but when he gets spinning yarns he aint the sort of man as i could advise you to rely upon  well billy hes got a dog and ive seen him sit and tell yarns before that dog that would make a cat squirm out of its skin and that dogs taken em in and believed em  one night up at his old womans bill told us a yarn by the side of which salt junk two voyages old would pass for spring chicken  i watched the dog to see how he would take it  he listened to it from beginning to end with cocked ears and never so much as blinked  every now and then he would look round with an expression of astonishment or delight that seemed to say wonderful isnt it  dear me just think of it  did you ever  well if that dont beat everything  he was a chuckleheaded dog you could have told him anything  it irritated me that bill should have such an animal about him to encourage him and when he had finished i said to him i wish youd tell that yarn round at my quarters one evening  why said bill  oh its just a fancy of mine i says  i didnt tell him i was wanting my old cat to hear it  oh all right says bill you remind me  he loved yarning billy did  next night but one he slings himself up in my cabin and i does so nothing loth off he starts  there was about halfadozen of us stretched round and the cat was sitting before the fire fussing itself up  before bill had got fairly under weigh she stops washing and looks up at me puzzled like as much as to say what have we got here a missionary  i signalled to her to keep quiet and bill went on with his yarn  when he got to the part about the sharks she turned deliberately round and looked at him  i tell you there was an expression of disgust on that cats face as might have made a travelling cheap jack feel ashamed of himself  it was that human i give you my word sir i forgot for the moment as the poor animal couldnt speak  i could see the words that were on its lips why dont you tell us you swallowed the anchor and i sat on tenterhooks fearing each instant that she would say them aloud  it was a relief to me when she turned her back on bill  for a few minutes she sat very still and seemed to be wrestling with herself like  i never saw a cat more set on controlling its feelings or that seemed to suffer more in silence  it made my heart ache to watch it  at last bill came to the point where he and the captain between em hold the sharks mouth open while the cabinboy dives in head foremost and fetches up undigested the gold watch and chain as the bosun was a wearing when he fell overboard and at that the old cat givd a screech and rolled over on her side with her legs in the air  i thought at first the poor thing was dead but she rallied after a bit and it seemed as though she had braced herself up to hear the thing out  but a little further on bill got too much for her again and this time she owned herself beat  she rose up and looked round at us youll excuse me gentlemen she saidleastways that is what she said if looks go for anythingmaybe youre used to this sort of rubbish and it dont get on your nerves  with me its different  i guess ive heard as much of this fools talk as my constitution will stand and if its all the same to you ill get outside before im sick  with that she walked up to the door and i opened it for her and she went out  you cant fool a cat with talk same as you can a dog     chapter vii   does man ever reform  balzac says he doesnt  so far as my experience goes it agrees with that of balzaca fact the admirers of that author are at liberty to make what use of they please  when i was young and accustomed to take my views of life from people who were older than myself and who knew better so they said i used to believe that he did  examples of reformed characters were frequently pointed out to meindeed our village situate a few miles from a small seaport town seemed to be peculiarly rich in such  they were from all accounts including their own persons who had formerly behaved with quite unnecessary depravity and who at the time i knew them appeared to be going to equally objectionable lengths in the opposite direction they invariably belonged to one of two classes the lowspirited or the aggressively unpleasant  they said and i believed that they were happy but i could not help reflecting how very sad they must have been before they were happy  one of them a small meekeyed old man with a piping voice had been exceptionally wild in his youth  what had been his special villainy i could never discover  people responded to my inquiries by saying that he had been oh generally bad and increased my longing for detail by adding that little boys ought not to want to know about such things  from their tone and manner i assumed that he must have been a pirate at the very least and regarded him with awe not unmingled with secret admiration  whatever it was he had been saved from it by his wife a bony lady of unprepossessing appearance but irreproachable views  one day he called at our house for some purpose or other and being left alone with him for a few minutes i took the opportunity of interviewing him personally on the subject  you were very wicked once werent you i said seeking by emphasis on the once to mitigate what i felt might be the disagreeable nature of the question  to my intense surprise a gleam of shameful glory lit up his wizened face and a sound which i tried to think a sigh but which sounded like a chuckle escaped his lips  ay he replied ive been a bit of a spanker in my time  the term spanker in such connection puzzled me  i had been hitherto led to regard a spanker as an eminently conscientious person especially where the shortcomings of other people were concerned a person who laboured for the good of others  that the word could also be employed to designate a sinful party was a revelation to me  but you are good now arent you i continued dismissing further reflection upon the etymology of spanker to a more fitting occasion  ay ay he answered his countenance resuming its customary aspect of resigned melancholy  i be a brand plucked from the burning i be  there beant much wrong wi deacon sawyers now  and it was your wife that made you good wasnt it i persisted determined now that i had started this investigation to obtain confirmation at first hand on all points  at the mention of his wife his features became suddenly transformed glancing hurriedly round to make sure apparently that no one but myself was within hearing he leaned across and hissed these words into my eari have never forgotten them there was a ring of such evident sincerity about them  id like to skin her id like to skin her alive  it struck me even in the light of my then limited judgment as an unregenerate wish and thus early my faith in the possibility of mans reformation received the first of those many blows that have resulted in shattering it  nature whether human or otherwise was not made to be reformed  you can develop you can check but you cannot alter it  you can take a small tiger and train it to sit on a hearthrug and to lap milk and so long as you provide it with hearthrugs to lie on and sufficient milk to drink it will purr and behave like an affectionate domestic pet  but it is a tiger with all a tigers instincts and its progeny to the end of all time will be tigers  in the same way you can take an ape and develop it through a few thousand generations until it loses its tail and becomes an altogether superior ape  you can go on developing it through still a few more thousands of generations until it gathers to itself out of the waste vapours of eternity an intellect and a soul by the aid of which it is enabled to keep the original apish nature more or less under control  but the ape is still there and always will be and every now and again when constable civilisation turns his back for a moment as during spanish furies or september massacres or western mob rule it creeps out and bites and tears at quivering flesh or plunges its hairy arms elbow deep in blood or dances round a burning nigger  i knew a man onceor rather i knew of a manwho was a confirmed drunkard  he became and continued a drunkard not through weakness but through will  when his friends remonstrated with him he told them to mind their own business and to let him mind his  if he saw any reason for not getting drunk he would give it up  meanwhile he liked getting drunk and he meant to get drunk as often as possible  he went about it deliberately and did it thoroughly  for nearly ten years so it was reported he never went to bed sober  this may be an exaggerationit would be a singular report were it notbut it can be relied upon as sufficiently truthful for all practical purposes  then there came a day when he did see a reason for not getting drunk  he signed no pledge he took no oath  he said i will never touch another drop of drink and for twentysix years he kept his word  at the end of that time a combination of circumstances occurred that made life troublesome to him so that he desired to be rid of it altogether he was a man accustomed when he desired a thing within his reach to stretch out his hand and take it  he reviewed the case calmly and decided to commit suicide  if the thing were to be done at all it would be best for reasons that if set forth would make this a long story that it should be done that very night and if possible before eleven oclock which was the earliest hour a certain person could arrive from a certain place  it was then four in the afternoon  he attended to some necessary business and wrote some necessary letters  this occupied him until seven  he then called a cab and drove to a small hotel in the suburbs engaged a private room and ordered up materials for the making of the particular punch that had been the last beverage he had got drunk on six andtwenty years ago  for three hours he sat there drinking steadily with his watch before him  at halfpast ten he rang the bell paid his bill came home and cut his throat  for a quarter of a century people had been calling that man a reformed character  his character had not reformed one jot  the craving for drink had never died  for twentysix years he had being a great man held it gripped by the throat  when all things became a matter of indifference to him he loosened his grasp and the evil instinct rose up within him as strong on the day he died as on the day he forced it down  that is all a man can do pray for strength to crush down the evil that is in him and to keep it held down day after day  i never hear washy talk about changed characters and reformed natures but i think of a sermon i once heard at a wesleyan revivalist meeting in the black country  ah my friends weve all of us got the devil inside us  ive got him youve got him cried the preacherhe was an old man with long white hair and beard and wild fighting eyes  most of the preachers who came reviving as it was called through that district had those eyes  some of them needed reviving themselves in quite another sense before they got clear out of it  i am speaking now of more than thirty years ago  ah so us haveso us have came the response  and you carnt get rid of him continued the speaker  not of oursels ejaculated a fervent voice at the end of the room but the lord will help us  the old preacher turned on him almost fiercely  but th lord woant he shouted doant ee reckon on that lad  yeve got him an yeve got ta keep him  ye carnt get rid of him  th lord doant mean ee to  here there broke forth murmurs of angry disapproval but the old fellow went on unheeding  it arnt good for ee to get rid of him  yeve just got to hug him tight  doant let him go  hold him fast andlam into him  i tell ee its good healthy christian exercise  we had been discussing the subject with reference to our hero  it had been suggested by brown as an unhackneyed idea and one lending itself therefore to comparative freshness of treatment that our hero should be a thoroughpaced scamp  jephson seconded the proposal for the reason that it would the better enable us to accomplish artistic work  he was of opinion that we should be more sure of our ground in drawing a villain than in attempting to portray a good man  macshaughnassy thirded if i may coin what has often appeared to me to be a muchneeded word the motion with ardour  he was tired he said of the crystalhearted noblethinking young man of fiction  besides it made bad reading for the young person  it gave her false ideas and made her dissatisfied with mankind as he really is  and thereupon he launched forth and sketched us his idea of a hero with reference to whom i can only say that i should not like to meet him on a dark night  brown our one earnest member begged us to be reasonable and reminded us not for the first time and not perhaps altogether unnecessarily that these meetings were for the purpose of discussing business not of talking nonsense  thus adjured we attacked the subject conscientiously  browns idea was that the man should be an outandout blackguard until about the middle of the book when some event should transpire that would have the effect of completely reforming him  this naturally brought the discussion down to the question with which i have commenced this chapter does man ever reform  i argued in the negative and gave the reasons for my disbelief much as i have set them forth here  macshaughnassy on the other hand contended that he did and instanced the case of himselfa man who in his early days so he asserted had been a scatterbrained impracticable person entirely without stability  i maintained that this was merely an example of enormous willpower enabling a man to overcome and rise superior to the defects of character with which nature had handicapped him  my opinion of you i said is that you are naturally a hopelessly irresponsible wellmeaning ass  but i continued quickly seeing his hand reaching out towards a complete shakespeare in one volume that lay upon the piano your mental capabilities are of such extraordinary power that you can disguise this fact and make yourself appear a man of sense and wisdom  brown agreed with me that in macshaughnassys case traces of the former disposition were clearly apparent but pleaded that the illustration was an unfortunate one and that it ought not to have weight in the discussion  seriously speaking said he dont you think that there are some experiences great enough to break up and reform a mans nature  to break up i replied yes but to reform no  passing through a great experience may shatter a man or it may strengthen a man just as passing through a furnace may melt or purify metal but no furnace ever lit upon this earth can change a bar of gold into a bar of lead or a bar of lead into one of gold  i asked jephson what he thought  he did not consider the bar of gold simile a good one  he held that a mans character was not an immutable element  he likened it to a drugpoison or elixircompounded by each man for himself from the pharmacopoeia of all things known to life and time and saw no impossibility though some improbability in the glass being flung aside and a fresh draught prepared with pain and labour  well i said let us put the case practically did you ever know a mans character to change  yes he answered i did know a man whose character seemed to me to be completely changed by an experience that happened to him  it may as you say only have been that he was shattered or that the lesson may have taught him to keep his natural disposition ever under control  the result in any case was striking  we asked him to give us the history of the case and he did so  he was a friend of some cousins of mine jephson began people i used to see a good deal of in my undergraduate days  when i met him first he was a young fellow of twentysix strong mentally and physically and of a stern and stubborn nature that those who liked him called masterful and that those who disliked hima more numerous bodytermed tyrannical when i saw him three years later he was an old man of twentynine gentle and yielding beyond the borderline of weakness mistrustful of himself and considerate of others to a degree that was often unwise formerly his anger had been a thing very easily and frequently aroused since the change of which i speak i have never known the shade of anger to cross his face but once  in the course of a walk one day we came upon a young rough terrifying a small child by pretending to set a dog at her  he seized the boy with a grip that almost choked him and administered to him a punishment that seemed to me altogether out of proportion to the crime brutal though it was  i remonstrated with him when he rejoined me  yes he replied apologetically i suppose im a hard judge of some follies  and knowing what his haunted eyes were looking at i said no more  he was junior partner in a large firm of tea brokers in the city  there was not much for him to do in the london office and when therefore as the result of some mortgage transactions a south indian tea plantation fell into the hands of the firm it was suggested that he should go out and take the management of it  the plan suited him admirably  he was a man in every way qualified to lead a rough life to face a by no means contemptible amount of difficulty and danger to govern a small army of native workers more amenable to fear than to affection  such a life demanding thought and action would afford his strong nature greater interest and enjoyment than he could ever hope to obtain amid the cramped surroundings of civilisation  only one thing could in reason have been urged against the arrangement that thing was his wife  she was a fragile delicate girl whom he had married in obedience to that instinct of attraction towards the opposite which nature for the purpose of maintaining her average has implanted in our breastsa timid meekeyed creature one of those women to whom death is less terrible than danger and fate easier to face than fear such women have been known to run screaming from a mouse and to meet martyrdom with heroism  they can no more keep their nerves from trembling than an aspen tree can stay the quivering of its leaves  that she was totally unfitted for and would be made wretched by the life to which his acceptance of the post would condemn her might have readily occurred to him had he stopped to consider for a moment her feelings in the matter  but to view a question from any other standpoint than his own was not his habit  that he loved her passionately in his way as a thing belonging to himself there can be no doubt but it was with the love that such men have for the dog they will thrash the horse they will spur to a broken back  to consult her on the subject never entered his head  he informed her one day of his decision and of the date of their sailing and handing her a handsome cheque told her to purchase all things necessary to her and to let him know if she needed more and she loving him with a doglike devotion that was not good for him opened her big eyes a little wider but said nothing  she thought much about the coming change to herself however and when nobody was by she would cry softly then hearing his footsteps would hastily wipe away the traces of her tears and go to meet him with a smile  now her timidity and nervousness which at home had been a butt for mere chaff became under the new circumstances of their life a serious annoyance to the man  a woman who seemed unable to repress a scream whenever she turned and saw in the gloom a pair of piercing eyes looking out at her from a dusky face who was liable to drop off her horse with fear at the sound of a wild beasts roar a mile off and who would turn white and limp with horror at the mere sight of a snake was not a companionable person to live with in the neighbourhood of indian jungles  he himself was entirely without fear and could not understand it  to him it was pure affectation  he had a muddled idea common to men of his stamp that women assume nervousness because they think it pretty and becoming to them and that if one could only convince them of the folly of it they might be induced to lay it aside in the same way that they lay aside mincing steps and simpering voices  a man who prided himself as he did upon his knowledge of horses might one would think have grasped a truer notion of the nature of nervousness which is a mere matter of temperament  but the man was a fool  the thing that vexed him most was her horror of snakes  he was unblessedor uncursed whichever you may preferwith imagination of any kind  there was no special enmity between him and the seed of the serpent  a creature that crawled upon its belly was no more terrible to him than a creature that walked upon its legs indeed less so for he knew that as a rule there was less danger to be apprehended from them a reptile is only too eager at all times to escape from man  unless attacked or frightened it will make no onset  most people are content to acquire their knowledge of this fact from the natural history books he had proved it for himself  his servant an old sergeant of dragoons has told me that he has seen him stop with his face six inches from the head of a hooded cobra and stand watching it through his eyeglass as it crawled away from him knowing that one touch of its fangs would mean death from which there could be no possible escape  that any reasoning being should be inspired with terrorsickening deadly terrorby such pitifully harmless things seemed to him monstrous and he determined to try and cure her of her fear of them  he succeeded in doing this eventually somewhat more thoroughly than he had anticipated but it left a terror in his own eyes that has not gone out of them to this day and that never will  one evening riding home through a part of the jungle not far from his bungalow he heard a soft low hiss close to his ear and looking up saw a python swing itself from the branch of a tree and make off through the long grass  he had been out antelopeshooting and his loaded rifle hung by his stirrup  springing from the frightened horse he was just in time to get a shot at the creature before it disappeared  he had hardly expected under the circumstances to even hit it  by chance the bullet struck it at the junction of the vertebrae with the head and killed it instantly  it was a wellmarked specimen and except for the small wound the bullet had made quite uninjured  he picked it up and hung it across the saddle intending to take it home and preserve it  galloping along glancing down every now and again at the huge hideous thing swaying and writhing in front of him almost as if still alive a brilliant idea occurred to him  he would use this dead reptile to cure his wife of her fear of living ones  he would fix matters so that she should see it and think it was alive and be terrified by it then he would show her that she had been frightened by a mere dead thing and she would feel ashamed of herself and be healed of her folly  it was the sort of idea that would occur to a fool  when he reached home he took the dead snake into his smokingroom then locking the door the idiot set out his prescription  he arranged the monster in a very natural and lifelike position  it appeared to be crawling from the open window across the floor and any one coming into the room suddenly could hardly avoid treading on it  it was very cleverly done  that finished he picked out a book from the shelves opened it and laid it face downward upon the couch  when he had completed all things to his satisfaction he unlocked the door and came out very pleased with himself  after dinner he lit a cigar and sat smoking a while in silence  are you feeling tired he said to her at length with a smile  she laughed and calling him a lazy old thing asked what it was he wanted  only my novel that i was reading  i left it in my den  do you mind you will find it open on the couch  she sprang up and ran lightly to the door  as she paused there for a moment to look back at him and ask the name of the book he thought how pretty and how sweet she was and for the first time a faint glimmer of the true nature of the thing he was doing forced itself into his brain  never mind he said half rising ill then enamoured of the brilliancy of his plan checked himself and she was gone  he heard her footsteps passing along the matted passage and smiled to himself  he thought the affair was going to be rather amusing  one finds it difficult to pity him even now when one thinks of it  the smokingroom door opened and closed and he still sat gazing dreamily at the ash of his cigar and smiling  one moment perhaps two passed but the time seemed much longer  the man blew the gray cloud from before his eyes and waited  then he heard what he had been expecting to heara piercing shriek  then another which expecting to hear the clanging of the distant door and the scurrying back of her footsteps along the passage puzzled him so that the smile died away from his lips  then another and another and another shriek after shriek  the native servant gliding noiselessly about the room laid down the thing that was in his hand and moved instinctively towards the door  the man started up and held him back  keep where you are he said hoarsely  it is nothing  your mistress is frightened that is all  she must learn to get over this folly  then he listened again and the shrieks ended with what sounded curiously like a smothered laugh and there came a sudden silence  and out of that bottomless silence fear for the first time in his life came to the man and he and the dusky servant looked at each other with eyes in which there was a strange likeness and by a common instinct moved together towards the place where the silence came from  when the man opened the door he saw three things one was the dead python lying where he had left it the second was a live python its comrade apparently slowly crawling round it the third a crushed bloody heap in the middle of the floor  he himself remembered nothing more until weeks afterwards he opened his eyes in a darkened unfamiliar place but the native servant before he fled screaming from the house saw his master fling himself upon the living serpent and grasp it with his hands and when later on others burst into the room and caught him staggering in their arms they found the second python with its head torn off  that is the incident that changed the character of my manif it be changed concluded jephson  he told it me one night as we sat on the deck of the steamer returning from bombay  he did not spare himself  he told me the story much as i have told it to you but in an even monotonous tone free from emotion of any kind  i asked him when he had finished how he could bear to recall it  recall it he replied with a slight accent of surprise it is always with me     chapter viii   one day we spoke of crime and criminals  we had discussed the possibility of a novel without a villain but had decided that it would be uninteresting  it is a terribly sad reflection remarked macshaughnassy musingly but what a desperately dull place this earth would be if it were not for our friends the bad people  do you know he continued when i hear of folks going about the world trying to reform everybody and make them good i get positively nervous  once do away with sin and literature will become a thing of the past  without the criminal classes we authors would starve  i shouldnt worry replied jephson drily one half mankind has been reforming the other half pretty steadily ever since the creation yet there appears to be a fairly appreciable amount of human nature left in it notwithstanding  suppressing sin is much the same sort of task that suppressing a volcano would beplugging one vent merely opens another evil will last our time  i cannot take your optimistic view of the case answered macshaughnassy  it seems to me that crimeat all events interesting crimeis being slowly driven out of our existence  pirates and highwaymen have been practically abolished  dear old smuggler bill has melted down his cutlass into a pintcan with a false bottom  the pressgang that was always so ready to rescue our hero from his approaching marriage has been disbanded  theres not a lugger fit for the purposes of abduction left upon the coast  men settle their affairs of honour in the law courts and return home wounded only in the pocket assaults on unprotected females are confined to the slums where heroes do not dwell and are avenged by the nearest magistrate  your modern burglar is generally an outofwork greengrocer  his swag usually consists of an overcoat and a pair of boots in attempting to make off with which he is captured by the servantgirl  suicides and murders are getting scarcer every season  at the present rate of decrease deaths by violence will be unheard of in another decade and a murder story will be laughed at as too improbable to be interesting  a certain section of busybodies are even crying out for the enforcement of the seventh commandment  if they succeed authors will have to follow the advice generally given to them by the critics and retire from business altogether  i tell you our means of livelihood are being filched from us one by one  authors ought to form themselves into a society for the support and encouragement of crime  macshaughnassys leading intention in making these remarks was to shock and grieve brown and in this object he succeeded  brown isor was in those daysan earnest young man with an exaltedsome were inclined to say an exaggeratedview of the importance and dignity of the literary profession  browns notion of the scheme of creation was that god made the universe so as to give the literary man something to write about  i used at one time to credit brown with originality for this idea but as i have grown older i have learned that the theory is a very common and popular one in cultured circles  brown expostulated with macshaughnassy  you speak he said as though literature were the parasite of evil  and what else is she replied the macshaughnassy with enthusiasm what would become of literature without folly and sin  what is the work of the literary man but raking a living for himself out of the dustheap of human woe  imagine if you can a perfect worlda world where men and women never said foolish things and never did unwise ones where small boys were never mischievous and children never made awkward remarks where dogs never fought and cats never screeched where wives never henpecked their husbands and mothersinlaw never nagged where men never went to bed in their boots and seacaptains never swore where plumbers understood their work and old maids never dressed as girls where niggers never stole chickens and proud men were never seasick where would be your humour and your wit  imagine a world where hearts were never bruised where lips were never pressed with pain where eyes were never dim where feet were never weary where stomachs were never empty where would be your pathos  imagine a world where husbands never loved more wives than one and that the right one where wives were never kissed but by their husbands where mens hearts were never black and womens thoughts never impure where there was no hating and no envying no desiring no despairing where would be your scenes of passion your interesting complications your subtle psychological analyses  my dear brown we writersnovelists dramatists poetswe fatten on the misery of our fellowcreatures  god created man and woman and the woman created the literary man when she put her teeth into the apple  we came into the world under the shadow of the serpent  we are special correspondents with the devils army  we report his victories in our threevolume novels his occasional defeats in our fiveact melodramas  all of which is very true remarked jephson but you must remember it is not only the literary man who traffics in misfortune  the doctor the lawyer the preacher the newspaper proprietor the weather prophet will hardly i should say welcome the millennium  i shall never forget an anecdote my uncle used to relate dealing with the period when he was chaplain of the lincolnshire county jail  one morning there was to be a hanging and the usual little crowd of witnesses consisting of the sheriff the governor three or four reporters a magistrate and a couple of warders was assembled in the prison  the condemned man a brutal ruffian who had been found guilty of murdering a young girl under exceptionally revolting circumstances was being pinioned by the hangman and his assistant and my uncle was employing the last few moments at his disposal in trying to break down the sullen indifference the fellow had throughout manifested towards both his crime and his fate  my uncle failing to make any impression upon him the governor ventured to add a few words of exhortation upon which the man turned fiercely on the whole of them  go to hell he cried with your snivelling jaw  who are you to preach at me  youre glad enough im hereall of you  why im the only one of you as aint going to make a bit over this job  where would you all be i should like to know you canting swine if it wasnt for me and my sort  why its the likes of me as keeps the likes of you with which he walked straight to the gallows and told the hangman to hurry up and not keep the gentlemen waiting  there was some grit in that man said macshaughnassy  yes added jephson and wholesome wit also  macshaughnassy puffed a mouthful of smoke over a spider which was just about to kill a fly  this caused the spider to fall into the river from where a supperhunting swallow quickly rescued him  you remind me he said of a scene i once witnessed in the office of the dailywell in the office of a certain daily newspaper  it was the dead season and things were somewhat slow  an endeavour had been made to launch a discussion on the question are babies a blessing  the youngest reporter on the staff writing over the simple but touching signature of mother of six had led off with a scathing though somewhat irrelevant attack upon husbands as a class the sporting editor signing himself working man and garnishing his contribution with painfully elaborated orthographical lapses arranged to give an air of verisimilitude to the correspondence while at the same time not to offend the susceptibilities of the democracy from whom the paper derived its chief support had replied vindicating the british father and giving what purported to be stirring midnight experiences of his own  the gallery man calling himself with a burst of imagination gentleman and christian wrote indignantly that he considered the agitation of the subject to be both impious and indelicate and added he was surprised that a paper holding the exalted and deservedly popular position of the  should have opened its columns to the brainless vapourings of mother of six and working man  the topic had however fallen flat  with the exception of one man who had invented a new feedingbottle and thought he was going to advertise it for nothing the outside public did not respond and over the editorial department gloom had settled down  one evening as two or three of us were mooning about the stairs praying secretly for a war or a famine todhunter the town reporter rushed past us with a cheer and burst into the subeditors room  we followed  he was waving his notebook above his head and clamouring after the manner of people in french exercises for pens ink and paper  whats up cried the subeditor catching his enthusiasm influenza again  better than that shouted todhunter  excursion steamer run down a hundred and twentyfive lives lostfour good columns of heartrending scenes  by jove said the sub couldnt have happened at a better time eitherand then he sat down and dashed off a leaderette in which he dwelt upon the pain and regret the paper felt at having to announce the disaster and drew attention to the exceptionally harrowing account provided by the energy and talent of our special reporter  it is the law of nature said jephson we are not the first party of young philosophers who have been struck with the fact that one mans misfortune is another mans opportunity  occasionally another womans i observed  i was thinking of an incident told me by a nurse  if a nurse in fair practice does not know more about human naturedoes not see clearer into the souls of men and women than all the novelists in little bookland put togetherit must be because she is physically blind and deaf  all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players so long as we are in good health we play our parts out bravely to the end acting them on the whole artistically and with strenuousness even to the extent of sometimes fancying ourselves the people we are pretending to be  but with sickness comes forgetfulness of our part and carelessness of the impression we are making upon the audience  we are too weak to put the paint and powder on our faces the stage finery lies unheeded by our side  the heroic gestures the virtuous sentiments are a weariness to us  in the quiet darkened room where the footlights of the great stage no longer glare upon us where our ears are no longer strained to catch the clapping or the hissing of the town we are for a brief space ourselves  this nurse was a quiet demure little woman with a pair of dreamy soft gray eyes that had a curious power of absorbing everything that passed before them without seeming to look at anything  gazing upon much life laid bare had given to them a slightly cynical expression but there was a background of kindliness behind  during the evenings of my convalescence she would talk to me of her nursing experiences  i have sometimes thought i would put down in writing the stories that she told me but they would be sad reading  the majority of them i fear would show only the tangled seamy side of human nature and god knows there is little need for us to point that out to each other though so many nowadays seem to think it the only work worth doing  a few of them were sweet but i think they were the saddest and over one or two a man might laugh but it would not be a pleasant laugh  i never enter the door of a house to which i have been summoned she said to me one evening without wondering as i step over the threshold what the story is going to be  i always feel inside a sickroom as if i were behind the scenes of life  the people come and go about you and you listen to them talking and laughing and you look into your patients eyes and you just know that its all a play  the incident that jephsons remark had reminded me of she told me one afternoon as i sat propped up by the fire trying to drink a glass of port wine and feeling somewhat depressed at discovering i did not like it  one of my first cases she said was a surgical operation  i was very young at the time and i made rather an awkward mistakei dont mean a professional mistakebut a mistake nevertheless that i ought to have had more sense than to make  my patient was a goodlooking pleasantspoken gentleman  the wife was a pretty dark little woman but i never liked her from the first she was one of those perfectly proper frigid women who always give me the idea that they were born in a church and have never got over the chill however she seemed very fond of him and he of her and they talked very prettily to each othertoo prettily for it to be quite genuine i should have said if id known as much of the world then as i do now  the operation was a difficult and dangerous one  when i came on duty in the evening i found him as i expected highly delirious  i kept him as quiet as i could but towards nine oclock as the delirium only increased i began to get anxious  i bent down close to him and listened to his ravings  over and over again i heard the name louise  why wouldnt louise come to him  it was so unkind of herthey had dug a great pit and were pushing him down into itoh why didnt she come and save him  he should be saved if she would only come and take his hand  his cries became so pitiful that i could bear them no longer  his wife had gone to attend a prayermeeting but the church was only in the next street  fortunately the daynurse had not left the house i called her in to watch him for a minute and slipping on my bonnet ran across  i told my errand to one of the vergers and he took me to her  she was kneeling but i could not wait  i pushed open the pew door and bending down whispered to her please come over at once your husband is more delirious than i quite care about and you may be able to calm him  she whispered back without raising her head ill be over in a little while  the meeting wont last much longer  her answer surprised and nettled me  youll be acting more like a christian woman by coming home with me i said sharply than by stopping here  he keeps calling for you and i cant get him to sleep  she raised her head from her hands calling for me she asked with a slightly incredulous accent  yes i replied it has been his one cry for the last hour wheres louise why doesnt louise come to him  her face was in shadow but as she turned it away and the faint light from one of the turneddown gasjets fell across it i fancied i saw a smile upon it and i disliked her more than ever  ill come back with you she said rising and putting her books away and we left the church together  she asked me many questions on the way did patients when they were delirious know the people about them  did they remember actual facts or was their talk mere incoherent rambling  could one guide their thoughts in any way  the moment we were inside the door she flung off her bonnet and cloak and came upstairs quickly and softly  she walked to the bedside and stood looking down at him but he was quite unconscious of her presence and continued muttering  i suggested that she should speak to him but she said she was sure it would be useless and drawing a chair back into the shadow sat down beside him  seeing she was no good to him i tried to persuade her to go to bed but she said she would rather stop and i being little more than a girl then and without much authority let her  all night long he tossed and raved the one name on his lips being ever louiselouiseand all night long that woman sat there in the shadow never moving never speaking with a set smile on her lips that made me long to take her by the shoulders and shake her  at one time he imagined himself back in his courting days and pleaded say you love me louise  i know you do  i can read it in your eyes whats the use of our pretending  we know each other  put your white arms about me  let me feel your breath upon my neck  ah  i knew it my darling my love  the whole house was deadly still and i could hear every word of his troubled ravings  i almost felt as if i had no right to be there listening to them but my duty held me  later on he fancied himself planning a holiday with her so i concluded  i shall start on monday evening he was saying and you can join me in dublin at jacksons hotel on the wednesday and well go straight on  his voice grew a little faint and his wife moved forward on her chair and bent her head closer to his lips  no no he continued after a pause theres no danger whatever  its a lonely little place right in the heart of the galway mountainsomullens halfway house they call itfive miles from ballynahinch  we shant meet a soul there  well have three weeks of heaven all to ourselves my goddess my mrs maddox from bostondont forget the name  he laughed in his delirium and the woman sitting by his side laughed also and then the truth flashed across me  i ran up to her and caught her by the arm  your names not louise i said looking straight at her  it was an impertinent interference but i felt excited and acted on impulse  no she replied very quietly but its the name of a very dear school friend of mine  ive got the clue tonight that ive been waiting two years to get  goodnight nurse thanks for fetching me  she rose and went out and i listened to her footsteps going down the stairs and then drew up the blind and let in the dawn  ive never told that incident to any one until this evening my nurse concluded as she took the empty port wine glass out of my hand and stirred the fire  a nurse wouldnt get many engagements if she had the reputation for making blunders of that sort  another story that she told me showed married life more lovelit but then as she added with that cynical twinkle which glinted so oddly from her gentle demure eyes this couple had only very recently been wedhad in fact only just returned from their honeymoon  they had been travelling on the continent and there had both contracted typhoid fever which showed itself immediately on their homecoming  i was called in to them on the very day of their arrival she said the husband was the first to take to his bed and the wife followed suit twelve hours afterwards  we placed them in adjoining rooms and as often as was possible we left the door ajar so that they could call out to one another  poor things  they were little else than boy and girl and they worried more about each other than they thought about themselves  the wifes only trouble was that she wouldnt be able to do anything for poor jack  oh nurse you will be good to him wont you she would cry with her big childish eyes full of tears and the moment i went in to him it would be oh dont trouble about me nurse im all right  just look after the wifie will you  i had a hard time between the two of them for with the help of her sister i was nursing them both  it was an unprofessional thing to do but i could see they were not well off and i assured the doctor that i could manage  to me it was worth while going through the double work just to breathe the atmosphere of unselfishness that sweetened those two sickrooms  the average invalid is not the patient sufferer people imagine  it is a fretful querulous selfpitying little world that we live in as a rule and that we grow hard in  it gave me a new heart nursing these young people  the man pulled through and began steadily to recover but the wife was a wee slip of a girl and her strengthwhat there was of itebbed day by day  as he got stronger he would call out more and more cheerfully to her through the open door and ask her how she was getting on and she would struggle to call back laughing answers  it had been a mistake to put them next to each other and i blamed myself for having done so but it was too late to change then  all we could do was to beg her not to exhaust herself and to let us when he called out tell him she was asleep  but the thought of not answering him or calling to him made her so wretched that it seemed safer to let her have her way  her one anxiety was that he should not know how weak she was  it will worry him so she would say he is such an old fidget over me  and i am getting stronger slowly aint i nurse  one morning he called out to her as usual asking her how she was and she answered though she had to wait for a few seconds to gather strength to do so  he seemed to detect the effort for he called back anxiously are you sure youre all right dear  yes she replied getting on famously  why  i thought your voice sounded a little weak dear he answered dont call out if it tries you  then for the first time she began to worry about herselfnot for her own sake but because of him  do you think i am getting weaker nurse she asked me fixing her great eyes on me with a frightened look  youre making yourself weak by calling out i answered a little sharply  i shall have to keep that door shut  oh dont tell himthat was all her thoughtdont let him know it tell him im strong wont you nurse  it will kill him if he thinks im not getting well  i was glad when her sister came up and i could get out of the room for youre not much good at nursing when you feel as i felt then as though you had swallowed a tablespoon and it was sticking in your throat  later on when i went in to him he drew me to the bedside and whispered me to tell him truly how she was  if you are telling a lie at all you may just as well make it a good one so i told him she was really wonderfully well only a little exhausted after the illness as was natural and that i expected to have her up before him  poor lad that lie did him more good than a weeks doctoring and nursing and next morning he called out more cheerily than ever to her and offered to bet her a new bonnet against a new hat that he would race her and be up first  she laughed back quite merrily i was in his room at the time  all right she said youll lose  i shall be well first and i shall come and visit you  her laugh was so bright and her voice sounded so much stronger that i really began to think she had taken a turn for the better so that when on going in to her i found her pillow wet with tears i could not understand it  why we were so cheerful just a minute ago i said whats the matter  oh poor jack she moaned as her little wasted fingers opened and closed upon the counterpane  poor jack it will break his heart  it was no good my saying anything  there comes a moment when something tells your patient all that is to be known about the case and the doctor and the nurse can keep their hopeful assurances for where they will be of more use  the only thing that would have brought comfort to her then would have been to convince her that he would soon forget her and be happy without her  i thought it at the time and i tried to say something of the kind to her but i couldnt get it out and she wouldnt have believed me if i had  so all i could do was to go back to the other room and tell him that i wanted her to go to sleep and that he must not call out to her until i told him  she lay very still all day  the doctor came at his usual hour and looked at her  he patted her hand and just glanced at the untouched food beside her  yes he said quietly  i shouldnt worry her nurse  and i understood  towards evening she opened her eyes and beckoned to her sister who was standing by the bedside to bend down  jeanie she whispered do you think it wrong to deceive any one when its for their own good  i dont know said the girl in a dry voice i shouldnt think so why do you ask  jeanie your voice was always very much like minedo you remember they used to mistake us at home  jeanie call out for mejust tilltill hes a bit better promise me  they had loved each other those two more than is common among sisters jeanie could not answer but she pressed her sister closer in her arms and the other was satisfied  then drawing all her little stock of life together for one final effort the child raised herself in her sisters arms  goodnight jack she called out loud and clear enough to be heard through the closed door  goodnight little wife he cried back cheerily are you all right  yes dear  goodnight  her little wornout frame dropped back upon the bed and the next thing i remember is snatching up a pillow and holding it tightpressed against jeanies face for fear the sound of her sobs should penetrate into the next room and afterwards we both got out somehow by the other door and rushed downstairs and clung to each other in the back kitchen  how we two women managed to keep up the deceit as for three whole days we did i shall never myself know  jeanie sat in the room where her dead sister from its head to its stickingup feet lay outlined under the white sheet and i stayed beside the living man and told lies and acted lies till i took a joy in them and had to guard against the danger of overelaborating them  he wondered at what he thought my new merry mood and i told him it was because of my delight that his wife was out of danger and then i went on for the pure devilment of the thing and told him that a week ago when we had let him think his wife was growing stronger we had been deceiving him that as a matter of fact she was at that time in great peril and i had been in hourly alarm concerning her but that now the strain was over and she was safe and i dropped down by the foot of the bed and burst into a fit of laughter and had to clutch hold of the bedstead to keep myself from rolling on the floor  he had started up in bed with a wild white face when jeanie had first answered him from the other room though the sisters voices had been so uncannily alike that i had never been able to distinguish one from the other at any time  i told him the slight change was the result of the fever that his own voice also was changed a little and that such was always the case with a person recovering from a long illness  to guide his thoughts away from the real clue i told him jeanie had broken down with the long work and that the need for her being past i had packed her off into the country for a short rest  that afternoon we concocted a letter to him and i watched jeanies eyes with a towel in my hand while she wrote it so that no tears should fall on it and that night she travelled twenty miles down the great western line to post it returning by the next uptrain  no suspicion of the truth ever occurred to him and the doctor helped us out with our deception yet his pulse which day by day had been getting stronger now beat feebler every hour  in that part of the country where i was born and grew up the folks say that wherever the dead lie there round about them whether the time be summer or winter the air grows cold and colder and that no fire though you pile the logs halfway up the chimney will ever make it warm  a few months hospital training generally cures one of all fanciful notions about death but this idea i have never been able to get rid of  my thermometer may show me sixty and i may try to believe that the temperature is sixty but if the dead are beside me i feel cold to the marrow of my bones  i could see the chill from the dead room crawling underneath the door and creeping up about his bed and reaching out its hand to touch his heart  jeanie and i redoubled our efforts for it seemed to us as if death were waiting just outside in the passage watching with his eye at the keyhole for either of us to make a blunder and let the truth slip out  i hardly ever left his side except now and again to go into that next room and poke an imaginary fire and say a few chaffing words to an imaginary living woman on the bed where the dead one lay and jeanie sat close to the corpse and called out saucy messages to him or reassuring answers to his anxious questions  at times knowing that if we stopped another moment in these rooms we should scream we would steal softly out and rush downstairs and shutting ourselves out of hearing in a cellar underneath the yard laugh till we reeled against the dirty walls  i think we were both getting a little mad  one dayit was the third of that nightmare life so i learned afterwards though for all i could have told then it might have been the three hundredth for time seemed to have fled from that house as from a dream so that all things were tangledi made a slip that came near to ending the matter then and there  i had gone into that other room  jeanie had left her post for a moment and the place was empty  i did not think what i was doing  i had not closed my eyes that i can remember since the wife had died and my brain and my senses were losing their hold of one another  i went through my usual performance of talking loudly to the thing underneath the white sheet and noisily patting the pillows and rattling the bottles on the table  on my return he asked me how she was and i answered half in a dream oh bonny shes trying to read a little and he raised himself on his elbow and called out to her and for answer there came back silencenot the silence that is silence but the silence that is as a voice  i do not know if you understand what i mean by that  if you had lived among the dead as long as i have you would know  i darted to the door and pretended to look in  shes fallen asleep i whispered closing it and he said nothing but his eyes looked queerly at me  that night jeanie and i stood in the hall talking  he had fallen to sleep early and i had locked the door between the two rooms and put the key in my pocket and had stolen down to tell her what had happened and to consult with her  what can we do  god help us what can we do was all that jeanie could say  we had thought that in a day or two he would be stronger and that the truth might be broken to him  but instead of that he had grown so weak that to excite his suspicions now by moving him or her would be to kill him  we stood looking blankly in each others faces wondering how the problem could be solved and while we did so the problem solved itself  the one womanservant had gone out and the house was very silentso silent that i could hear the ticking of jeanies watch inside her dress suddenly into the stillness there came a sound  it was not a cry  it came from no human voice  i have heard the voice of human pain till i know its every note and have grown careless to it but i have prayed god on my knees that i may never hear that sound again for it was the sob of a soul  it wailed through the quiet house and passed away and neither of us stirred  at length with the return of the blood to our veins we went upstairs together  he had crept from his own room along the passage into hers  he had not had strength enough to pull the sheet off though he had tried he lay across the bed with one hand grasping hers        my nurse sat for a while without speaking a somewhat unusual thing for her to do  you ought to write your experiences i said  ah she said giving the fire a contemplative poke if youd seen as much sorrow in the world as i have you wouldnt want to write a sad book  i think she added after a long pause with the poker still in her hand it can only be the people who have never known suffering who can care to read of it  if i could write a book i should write a merry booka book that would make people laugh     chapter ix   the discussion arose in this way  i had proposed a match between our villain and the daughter of the local chemist a singularly noble and pureminded girl the humble but worthy friend of the heroine  brown had refused his consent on the ground of improbability  what in thunder would induce him to marry her he asked  love i replied love that burns as brightly in the meanest villains breast as in the proud heart of the good young man  are you trying to be light and amusing returned brown severely or are you supposed to be discussing the matter seriously  what attraction could such a girl have for such a man as reuben neil  every attraction i retorted  she is the exact moral contrast to himself  she is beautiful if shes not beautiful enough we can touch her up a bit and when the father dies there will be the shop  besides i added it will make the thing seem more natural if everybody wonders what on earth could have been the reason for their marrying each other  brown wasted no further words on me but turned to macshaughnassy  can you imagine our friend reuben seized with a burning desire to marry mary holme he asked with a smile  of course i can said macshaughnassy i can imagine anything and believe anything of anybody  it is only in novels that people act reasonably and in accordance with what might be expected of them  i knew an old seacaptain who used to read the young ladies journal in bed and cry over it  i knew a bookmaker who always carried brownings poems about with him in his pocket to study in the train  i have known a harley street doctor to develop at fortyeight a sudden and overmastering passion for switchbacks and to spend every hour he could spare from his practice at one or other of the exhibitions having threepenorths one after the other  i have known a bookreviewer give oranges not poisoned ones to children  a man is not a character he is a dozen characters one of them prominent the other eleven more or less undeveloped  i knew a man once two of whose characters were of equal value and the consequences were peculiar  we begged him to relate the case to us and he did so  he was a balliol man said macshaughnassy and his christian name was joseph  he was a member of the devonshire at the time i knew him and was i think the most superior person i have ever met  he sneered at the saturday review as the pet journal of the suburban literary club and at the athenaeum as the trade organ of the unsuccessful writer thackeray he considered was fairly entitled to his position of favourite author to the cultured clerk and carlyle he regarded as the exponent of the earnest artisan  living authors he never read but this did not prevent his criticising them contemptuously  the only inhabitants of the nineteenth century that he ever praised were a few obscure french novelists of whom nobody but himself had ever heard  he had his own opinion about god almighty and objected to heaven on account of the strong clapham contingent likely to be found in residence there humour made him sad and sentiment made him ill  art irritated him and science bored him  he despised his own family and disliked everybody else  for exercise he yawned and his conversation was mainly confined to an occasional shrug  nobody liked him but everybody respected him  one felt grateful to him for his condescension in living at all  one summer i was fishing over the norfolk broads and on the bank holiday thinking i would like to see the london arry in his glory i ran over to yarmouth  walking along the seafront in the evening i suddenly found myself confronted by four remarkably choice specimens of the class  they were urging on their wild and erratic career arminarm the one nearest the road was playing an unusually wheezy concertina and the other three were bawling out the chorus of a musichall song the heroine of which appeared to be hemmer  they spread themselves right across the pavement compelling all the women and children they met to step into the roadway  i stood my ground on the kerb and as they brushed by me something in the face of the one with the concertina struck me as familiar  i turned and followed them  they were evidently enjoying themselves immensely  to every girl they passed they yelled out oh you little jam tart and every old lady they addressed as mar  the noisiest and the most vulgar of the four was the one with the concertina  i followed them on to the pier and then hurrying past waited for them under a gaslamp  when the man with the concertina came into the light and i saw him clearly i started  from the face i could have sworn it was joseph but everything else about him rendered such an assumption impossible  putting aside the time and the place and forgetting his behaviour his companions and his instrument what remained was sufficient to make the suggestion absurd  joseph was always clean shaven this youth had a smudgy moustache and a pair of incipient red whiskers  he was dressed in the loudest check suit i have ever seen off the stage  he wore patentleather boots with motherofpearl buttons and a necktie that in an earlier age would have called down lightning out of heaven  he had a lowcrowned billycock hat on his head and a big evilsmelling cigar between his lips  argue as i would however the face was the face of joseph and moved by a curiosity i could not control i kept near him watching him  once for a little while i missed him but there was not much fear of losing that suit for long and after a little looking about i struck it again  he was sitting at the end of the pier where it was less crowded with his arm round a girls waist  i crept close  she was a jolly red faced girl goodlooking enough but common to the last degree  her hat lay on the seat beside her and her head was resting on his shoulder  she appeared to be fond of him but he was evidently bored  dontcher like me joe i heard her murmur  yas he replied somewhat unconvincingly o course i likes yer  she gave him an affectionate slap but he did not respond and a few minutes afterwards muttering some excuse he rose and left her and i followed him as he made his way towards the refreshmentroom  at the door he met one of his pals  hullo was the question wot a yer done wi liza  oh i carnt stand er was his reply she gives me the bloomin ump  you ave a turn with er  his friend disappeared in the direction of liza and joe pushed into the room i keeping close behind him  now that he was alone i was determined to speak to him  the longer i had studied his features the more resemblance i had found in them to those of my superior friend joseph  he was leaning across the bar clamouring for two of gin when i tapped him on the shoulder  he turned his head and the moment he saw me his face went livid  mr joseph smythe i believe i said with a smile  whos mr joseph smythe he answered hoarsely my names smith i aint no bloomin smythe  who are you  i dont know yer  as he spoke my eyes rested upon a curious gold ring of indian workmanship which he wore upon his left hand  there was no mistaking the ring at all events it had been passed round the club on more than one occasion as a unique curiosity  his eyes followed my gaze  he burst into tears and pushing me before him into a quiet corner of the saloon sat down facing me  dont give me away old man he whimpered for gawds sake dont let on to any of the chaps ere that im a member of that blessed old waxwork show in saint jamess theyd never speak to me agen  and keep yer mug shut about oxford theres a good sort  i wouldnt ave em know as ow i was one o them college blokes for anythink  i sat aghast  i had listened to hear him entreat me to keep smith the rorty arry a secret from the acquaintances of smythe the superior person  here was smith in mortal terror lest his pals should hear of his identity with the aristocratic smythe and discard him  his attitude puzzled me at the time but when i came to reflect my wonder was at myself for having expected the opposite  i carnt elp it he went on i ave to live two lives  arf my time im a stuckup prig as orter be jolly well kicked  at which times i interrupted i have heard you express some extremely uncomplimentary opinions concerning arries  i know he replied in a voice betraying strong emotion thats where its so precious rough on me  when im a toff i despises myself cos i knows that underneath my sneering phiz im a bloomin arry  when im an arry i ates myself cos i knows im a toff  cant you decide which character you prefer and stick to it i asked  no he answered i carnt  its a rum thing but whichever i am sure as fate bout the end of a month i begin to get sick o myself  i can quite understand it i murmured i should give way myself in a fortnight  ive been myself now he continued without noticing my remark for somethin like ten days  one mornin in bout three weeks time i shall get up in my diggins in the mile end road and i shall look round the room and at these clothes angin over the bed and at this yer concertina he gave it an affectionate squeeze and i shall feel myself gettin scarlet all over  then i shall jump out o bed and look at myself in the glass  you howling little cad i shall say to myself i have half a mind to strangle you and i shall shave myself and put on a quiet blue serge suit and a bowler at tell my landlady to keep my rooms for me till i comes back slip out o the ouse and into the fust ansom i meets and back to the halbany  and a month arter that i shall come into my chambers at the halbany fling voltaire and parini into the fire shy me at at the bust of good old omer slip on my blue suit agen and back to the mile end road  how do you explain your absence to both parties i asked  oh thats simple enough he replied  i just tells my ousekeeper at the halbany as im goin on the continong and my mates ere thinks im a traveller  nobody misses me much he added pathetically i haint a particlarly fetchin sort o bloke either of me  im sich an outand outer  when im an arry im too much of an arry and when im a prig im a reglar fust prize prig  seems to me as if i was two ends of a man without any middle  if i could only mix myself up a bit more id be all right  he sniffed once or twice and then he laughed  ah well he said casting aside his momentary gloom its all a game and wots the odds so long as yer appy  ave a wet  i declined the wet and left him playing sentimental airs to himself upon the concertina  one afternoon about a month later the servant came to me with a card on which was engraved the name of mr joseph smythe  i requested her to show him up  he entered with his usual air of languid superciliousness and seated himself in a graceful attitude upon the sofa  well i said as soon as the girl had closed the door behind her so youve got rid of smith  a sickly smile passed over his face  you have not mentioned it to any one he asked anxiously  not to a soul i replied though i confess i often feel tempted to  i sincerely trust you never will he said in a tone of alarm  you can have no conception of the misery the whole thing causes me  i cannot understand it  what possible affinity there can be between myself and that disgusting little snob passes my comprehension  i assure you my dear mac the knowledge that i was a ghoul or a vampire would cause me less nausea than the reflection that i am one and the same with that odious little whitechapel bounder  when i think of him every nerve in my body  dont think about him any more i interrupted perceiving his strongly suppressed emotion  you didnt come here to talk about him im sure let us dismiss him  well he replied in a certain roundabout way it is slightly connected with him  that is really my excuse for inflicting the subject upon you  you are the only man i can speak to about itif i shall not bore you  not in the least i said  i am most interested  as he still hesitated i asked him pointblank what it was  he appeared embarrassed  it is really very absurd of me he said while the faintest suspicion of pink crossed his usually colourless face but i feel i must talk to somebody about it  the fact is my dear mac i am in love  capital i cried im delighted to hear it  i thought it might make a man of him  do i know the lady  i am inclined to think you must have seen her he replied she was with me on the pier at yarmouth that evening you met me  not liza i exclaimed  that was she he answered miss elizabeth muggins  he dwelt lovingly upon the name  but i said you seemedi really could not help noticing it was so pronouncedyou seemed to positively dislike her  indeed i gathered from your remark to a friend that her society was distinctly distasteful to you  to smith he corrected me  what judge would that howling little blackguard be of a womans worth  the dislike of such a man as that is a testimonial to her merit  i may be mistaken i said but she struck me as a bit common  she is not perhaps what the world would call a lady he admitted but then my dear mac my opinion of the world is not such as to render its opinion of much value to me  i and the world differ on most subjects i am glad to say  she is beautiful and she is good and she is my choice  shes a jolly enough little girl i replied and i should say affectionate but have you considered smythe whether she is quitewhat shall we sayquite as intellectual as could be desired  really to tell the truth i have not troubled myself much about her intellect he replied with one of his sneering smiles  i have no doubt that the amount of intellect absolutely necessary to the formation of a british home i shall be able to supply myself  i have no desire for an intellectual wife  one is compelled to meet tiresome people but one does not live with them if one can avoid it  no he continued reverting to his more natural tone the more i think of elizabeth the more clear it becomes to me that she is the one woman in the world for whom marriage with me is possible  i perceive that to the superficial observer my selection must appear extraordinary i do not pretend to explain it or even to understand it  the study of mankind is beyond man  only fools attempt it  maybe it is her contrast to myself that attracts me  maybe my perhaps too spiritual nature feels the need of contact with her coarser clay to perfect itself  i cannot tell  these things must always remain mysteries  i only know that i love herthat if any reliance is to be placed upon instinct she is the mate to whom artemis is leading me  it was clear that he was in love and i therefore ceased to argue with him  you kept up your acquaintanceship with her then after youi was going to say after you ceased to be smith but not wishing to agitate him by more mention of that person than i could help i substituted after you returned to the albany  not exactly he replied i lost sight of her after i left yarmouth and i did not see her again until five days ago when i came across her in an aerated bread shop  i had gone in to get a glass of milk and a bun and she brought them to me  i recognised her in a moment  his face lighted up with quite a human smile  i take tea there every afternoon now he added glancing towards the clock at four  theres not much need to ask her views on the subject i said laughing her feelings towards you were pretty evident  well that is the curious part of it he replied with a return to his former embarrassment she does not seem to care for me now at all indeed she positively refuses me  she saysto put it in the dear childs own racy languagethat she wouldnt take me on at any price  she says it would be like marrying a clockwork figure without the key  shes more frank than complimentary but i like that  wait a minute i said an idea occurs to me  does she know of your identity with smith  no he replied alarmed i would not have her know it for worlds only yesterday she told me that i reminded her of a fellow she had met at yarmouth and my heart was in my mouth  how did she look when she told you that i asked  how did she look he repeated not understanding me  what was her expression at that moment i saidwas it severe or tender  well he replied now i come to think of it she did seem to soften a bit just then  my dear boy i said the case is as clear as daylight  she loves smith  no girl who admired smith could be attracted by smythe  as your present self you will never win her  in a few weeks time however you will be smith  leave the matter over until then  propose to her as smith and she will accept you  after marriage you can break smythe gently to her  by jove he exclaimed startled out of his customary lethargy i never thought of that  the truth is when i am in my right senses smith and all his affairs seem like a dream to me  any idea connected with him would never enter my mind  he rose and held out his hand  i am so glad i came to see you he said your suggestion has almost reconciled me to my miserable fate indeed i quite look forward to a month of smith now  im so pleased i answered shaking hands with him  mind you come and tell me how you get on  another mans love affairs are not usually absorbing but there is an element of interest about yours that renders the case exceptional  we parted and i did not see him again for another month  then late one evening the servant knocked at my door to say that a mr smith wished to see me  smith smith i repeated what smith didnt he give you a card  no sir answered the girl he doesnt look the sort that would have a card  hes not a gentleman sir but he says youll know him  she evidently regarded the statement as an aspersion upon myself  i was about to tell her to say i was out when the recollection of smythes other self flashed into my mind and i directed her to send him up  a minute passed and then he entered  he was wearing a new suit of a louder pattern if possible than before  i think he must have designed it himself  he looked hot and greasy  he did not offer to shake hands but sat down awkwardly on the extreme edge of a small chair and gaped about the room as if he had never seen it before  he communicated his shyness to myself  i could not think what to say and we sat for a while in painful silence  well i said at last plunging headforemost into the matter according to the method of shy people and hows liza  oh shes all right he replied keeping his eyes fixed on his hat  have you done it i continued  done wot he asked looking up  married her  no he answered returning to the contemplation of his hat  has she refused you then i said  i aint arst er he returned  he seemed unwilling to explain matters of his own accord  i had to put the conversation into the form of a crossexamination  why not i asked dont you think she cares for you any longer  he burst into a harsh laugh  there aint much fear o that he said its like aving an alcocks porous plaster mashed on yer blowed if it aint  theres no gettin rid of er  i wish shed giv somebody else a turn  im fair sick of er  but you were enthusiastic about her a month ago i exclaimed in astonishment  smythe may ave been he said there aint no accounting for that ninny is eads full of starch  anyhow i dont take er on while im myself  im too jolly fly  that sort o gals all right enough to lark with he continued but yer dont want to marry em  they dont do yer no good  a man wants a wife as e can respectsome one as is a cut above imself as will raise im up a peg or twosome one as e can look up to and worship  a mans wife orter be to im a gawddessa hangel a  you appear to have met the lady i remarked interrupting him  he blushed scarlet and became suddenly absorbed in the pattern of the carpet  but the next moment he looked up again and his face seemed literally transformed  oh  mr macshaughnassy he burst out with a ring of genuine manliness in his voice you dont know ow good ow beautiful she is  i aint fit to breathe er name in my thoughts  an shes so clever  i met er at that toynbee all  there was a party of toffs there all together  you would ave enjoyed it mr macshaughnassy if you could ave eard er she was makin fun of the pictures and the people round about to er pasuch wit such learnin such aughtiness  i follered them out and opened the carriage door for er and she just drew er skirt aside and looked at me as if i was the dirt in the road  i wish i was for then perhaps one day id kiss er feet  his emotion was so genuine that i did not feel inclined to laugh at him did you find out who she was i asked  yes he answered i eard the old gentleman say ome to the coachman and i ran after the carriage all the way to arley street treviors er name hedith trevior  miss trevior i cried a tall dark girl with untidy hair and rather weak eyes  tall and dark he replied with air that seems tryin to reach er lips to kiss em and heyes light blue like a cambridge necktie  a undred and seventythree was the number  thats right i said my dear smith this is becoming complicated youve met the lady and talked to her for half an houras smythe dont you remember  no he said after cogitating for a minute carnt say i do i never can remember much about smythe  he allers seems to me like a bad dream  well you met her i said im positive  i introduced you to her myself and she confided to me afterwards that she thought you a most charming man  nodid she he remarked evidently softening in his feelings towards smythe and did i like er  well to tell the truth i answered i dont think you did  you looked intensely bored  the juggins i heard him mutter to himself and then he said aloud dyer think i shall get a chance o seein er agen when imwhen im smythe  of course i said ill take you round myself  by the bye i added jumping up and looking on the mantelpiece ive got a card for a cinderella at their placesomething to do with a birthday  will you be smythe on november the twentieth  yeas he replied oh yasbound to be by then  very well then i said ill call round for you at the albany and well go together  he rose and stood smoothing his hat with his sleeve  fust time ive ever looked forard to bein that hanimated corpse smythe he said slowly  blowed if i dont try to urry it uppon my sivey i will  hell be no good to you till the twentieth i reminded him  and i added as i stood up to ring the bell youre sure its a genuine case this time  you wont be going back to liza  oh dont talk bout liza in the same breath with hedith he replied it sounds like sacrilege  he stood hesitating with the handle of the door in his hand  at last opening it and looking very hard at his hat he said im goin to arley street now  i walk up and down outside the ouse every evening and sometimes when there aint no one lookin i get a chance to kiss the doorstep  he disappeared and i returned to my chair  on november twentieth i called for him according to promise  i found him on the point of starting for the club he had forgotten all about our appointment  i reminded him of it and he with difficulty recalled it and consented without any enthusiasm to accompany me  by a few artful hints to her mother including a casual mention of his income i manoeuvred matters so that he had edith almost entirely to himself for the whole evening  i was proud of what i had done and as we were walking home together i waited to receive his gratitude  as it seemed slow in coming i hinted my expectations  well i said i think i managed that very cleverly for you  managed what very cleverly said he  why getting you and miss trevior left together for such a long time in the conservatory i answered somewhat hurt i fixed that for you  oh it was you was it he replied ive been cursing providence  i stopped dead in the middle of the pavement and faced him  dont you love her i said  love her he repeated in the utmost astonishment what on earth is there in her to love  shes nothing but a bad translation of a modern french comedy with the interest omitted  this tired meto use an americanism  you came to me a month ago i said raving over her and talking about being the dirt under her feet and kissing her doorstep  he turned very red  i wish my dear mac he said you would pay me the compliment of not mistaking me for that detestable little cad with whom i have the misfortune to be connected  you would greatly oblige me if next time he attempts to inflict upon you his vulgar drivel you would kindly kick him downstairs  no doubt he added with a sneer as we walked on miss trevior would be his ideal  she is exactly the type of woman i should say to charm that type of man  for myself i do not appreciate the artistic and literary female  besides he continued in a deeper tone you know my feelings  i shall never care for any other woman but elizabeth  and she i said  she he sighed is breaking her heart for smith  why dont you tell her you are smith i asked  i cannot he replied not even to win her  besides she would not believe me  we said goodnight at the corner of bond street and i did not see him again till one afternoon late in the following march when i ran against him in ludgate circus  he was wearing his transition blue suit and bowler hat  i went up to him and took his arm  which are you i said  neither for the moment he replied thank god  half an hour ago i was smythe half an hour hence i shall be smith  for the present half hour i am a man  there was a pleasant hearty ring in his voice and a genial kindly light in his eyes and he held himself like a frank gentleman  you are certainly an improvement upon both of them i said  he laughed a sunny laugh with just the shadow of sadness dashed across it  do you know my idea of heaven he said  no i replied somewhat surprised at the question  ludgate circus was the answer  the only really satisfying moments of my life he said have been passed in the neighbourhood of ludgate circus  i leave piccadilly an unhealthy unwholesome prig  at charing cross i begin to feel my blood stir in my veins  from ludgate circus to cheapside i am a human thing with human feeling throbbing in my heart and human thought throbbing in my brainwith fancies sympathies and hopes  at the bank my mind becomes a blank  as i walk on my senses grow coarse and blunted and by the time i reach whitechapel i am a poor little uncivilised cad  on the return journey it is the same thing reversed  why not live in ludgate circus i said and be always as you are now  because he answered man is a pendulum and must travel his arc  my dear mac said he laying his hand upon my shoulder there is only one good thing about me and that is a moral  man is as god made him dont be so sure that you can take him to pieces and improve him  all my life i have sought to make myself an unnaturally superior person  nature has retaliated by making me also an unnaturally inferior person  nature abhors lopsidedness  she turns out man as a whole to be developed as a whole  i always wonder whenever i come across a supernaturally pious a supernaturally moral a supernaturally cultured person if they also have a reverse self  i was shocked at his suggested argument and walked by his side for a while without speaking  at last feeling curious on the subject i asked him how his various love affairs were progressing  oh as usual he replied in and out of a cul de sac  when i am smythe i love eliza and eliza loathes me  when i am smith i love edith and the mere sight of me makes her shudder  it is as unfortunate for them as for me  i am not saying it boastfully  heaven knows it is an added draught of misery in my cup but it is a fact that eliza is literally pining away for me as smith andas smith i find it impossible to be even civil to her while edith poor girl has been foolish enough to set her heart on me as smythe and as smythe she seems to me but the skin of a woman stuffed with the husks of learning and rags torn from the corpse of wit  i remained absorbed in my own thoughts for some time and did not come out of them till we were crossing the minories  then the idea suddenly occurring to me i said  why dont you get a new girl altogether  there must be medium girls that both smith and smythe could like and that would put up with both of you  no more girls for this child he answered theyre more trouble than theyre worth  those yer want yer carnt get and those yer can ave yer dont want  i started and looked up at him  he was slouching along with his hands in his pockets and a vacuous look in his face  a sudden repulsion seized me  i must go now i said stopping  id no idea i had come so far  he seemed as glad to be rid of me as i to be rid of him  oh must yer he said holding out his hand  well so long  we shook hands carelessly  he disappeared in the crowd and that is the last i have ever seen of him        is that a true story asked jephson  well ive altered the names and dates said macshaughnassy but the main facts you can rely upon     chapter x   the final question discussed at our last meeting been what shall our hero be  macshaughnassy had suggested an author with a critic for the villain  my idea was a stockbroker with an undercurrent of romance in his nature  said jephson who has a practical mind the question is not what we like but what the female novelreader likes  that is so agreed macshaughnassy  i propose that we collect feminine opinion upon this point  i will write to my aunt and obtain from her the old ladys view  you he said turning to me can put the case to your wife and get the young ladys ideal  let brown write to his sister at newnham and find out whom the intellectual maiden favours while jephson can learn from miss medbury what is most attractive to the commonsensed girl  this plan we had adopted and the result was now under consideration macshaughnassy opened the proceedings by reading his aunts letter  wrote the old lady     i think if i were you my dear boy i should choose a soldier  you    know your poor grandfather who ran away to america with that wicked    mrs featherly the bankers wife was a soldier and so was your poor    cousin robert who lost eight thousand pounds at monte carlo  i have    always felt singularly drawn towards soldiers even as a girl though    your poor dear uncle could not bear them  you will find many    allusions to soldiers and men of war in the old testament see jer    xlviii 14  of course one does not like to think of their fighting    and killing each other but then they do not seem to do that sort of    thing nowadays  so much for the old lady said macshaughnassy as he folded up the letter and returned it to his pocket  what says culture  brown produced from his cigarcase a letter addressed in a bold round hand and read as follows     what a curious coincidence  a few of us were discussing this very    subject last night in millicent hightoppers rooms and i may tell you    at once that our decision was unanimous in favour of soldiers  you    see my dear selkirk in human nature the attraction is towards the    opposite  to a milliners apprentice a poet would no doubt be    satisfying to a woman of intelligence he would he an unutterable    bore  what the intellectual woman requires in man is not something to    argue with but something to look at  to an emptyheaded woman i can    imagine the soldier type proving vapid and uninteresting to the woman    of mind he represents her ideal of mana creature strong handsome    welldressed and not too clever  that gives us two votes for the army remarked macshaughnassy as brown tore his sisters letter in two and threw the pieces into the wastepaper basket  what says the commonsensed girl  first catch your commonsensed girl muttered jephson a little grumpily as it seemed to me  where do you propose finding her  well returned macshaughnassy i looked to find her in miss medbury  as a rule the mention of miss medburys name brings a flush of joy to jephsons face but now his features wore an expression distinctly approaching a scowl  oh he replied did you  well then the commonsensed girl loves the military also  by jove exclaimed macshaughnassy what an extraordinary thing  what reason does she give  that theres a something about them and that they dance so divinely answered jephson shortly  well you do surprise me murmured macshaughnassy i am astonished  then to me he said and what does the young married woman say  the same  yes i replied precisely the same  does she give a reason he asked  oh yes i explained because you cant help liking them  there was silence for the next few minutes while we smoked and thought i fancy we were all wishing we had never started this inquiry  that four distinctly different types of educated womanhood should with promptness and unanimity quite unfeminine have selected the soldier as their ideal was certainly discouraging to the civilian heart  had they been nursemaids or servant girls i should have expected it  the worship of mars by the venus of the white cap is one of the few vital religions left to this devoutless age  a year or two ago i lodged near a barracks and the sight to be seen round its huge iron gates on sunday afternoons i shall never forget  the girls began to assemble about twelve oclock  by two at which hour the army with its hair nicely oiled and a cane in its hand was ready for a stroll there would be some four or five hundred of them waiting in a line  formerly they had collected in a wild mob and as the soldiers were let out to them two at a time had fought for them as lions for early christians  this however had led to scenes of such disorder and brutality that the police had been obliged to interfere and the girls were now marshalled in queue two abreast and compelled by a force of constables specially told off for the purpose to keep their places and wait their proper turn  at three oclock the sentry on duty would come down to the wicket and close it  theyre all gone my dears he would shout out to the girls still left its no good your stopping weve no more for you today  oh not one some poor child would murmur pleadingly while the tears welled up into her big round eyes not even a little one  ive been waiting such a long time  cant help that the honest fellow would reply gruffly but not unkindly turning aside to hide his emotion youve had em all between you  we dont make em you know you cant have em if we havent got em can you  come earlier next time  then he would hurry away to escape further importunity and the police who appeared to have been waiting for this moment with gloating anticipation would jeeringly hustle away the weeping remnant  now then pass along you girls pass along they would say in that irritatingly unsympathetic voice of theirs  youve had your chance cant have the roadway blocked up all the afternoon with this ere demonstration of the unloved  pass along  in connection with this same barracks our charwoman told amenda who told ethelbertha who told me a story which i now told the boys  into a certain house in a certain street in the neighbourhood there moved one day a certain family  their servant had left themmost of their servants did at the end of a weekand the day after the movingin an advertisement for a domestic was drawn up and sent to the chronicle it ran thus     wanted general servant in small family of eleven  wages 6 pounds    no beer money  must be early riser and hard worker  washing done at    home  must be good cook and not object to windowcleaning  unitarian    preferredapply with references to a b etc  that advertisement was sent off on wednesday afternoon  at seven oclock on thursday morning the whole family were awakened by continuous ringing of the streetdoor bell  the husband looking out of window was surprised to see a crowd of about fifty girls surrounding the house  he slipped on his dressinggown and went down to see what was the matter the moment he opened the door fifteen of them charged tumultuously into the passage sweeping him completely off his legs  once inside these fifteen faced round fought the other thirtyfive or so back on to the doorstep and slammed the door in their faces  then they picked up the master of the house and asked him politely to conduct them to a b  at first owing to the clamour of the mob outside who were hammering at the door and shouting curses through the keyhole he could understand nothing but at length they succeeded in explaining to him that they were domestic servants come ill answer to his wifes advertisement  the man went and told his wife and his wife said she would see them one at a time  which one should have audience first was a delicate question to decide the man on being appealed to said he would prefer to leave it to them they accordingly discussed the matter among themselves  at the end of a quarter of an hour the victor having borrowed some hairpins and a lookingglass from our charwoman who had slept in the house went upstairs while the remaining fourteen sat down in the hall and fanned themselves with their bonnets  a b was a good deal astonished when the first applicant presented herself  she was a tall genteellooking girl  up to yesterday she had been head housemaid at lady stantons and before that she had been under cook for two years to the duchess of york  and why did you leave lady stanton asked a b  to come here mum replied the girl  the lady was puzzled  and youll be satisfied with six pounds a year she asked  certainly mum i think it ample  and you dont mind hard work  i love it mum  and youre an early riser  oh yes mum it upsets me stopping in bed after halfpast five  you know we do the washing at home  yes mum  i think it so much better to do it at home  those laundries ruin good clothes  theyre so careless  are you a unitarian continued the lady  not yet mum replied the girl but i should like to be one  the lady took her reference and said she would write  the next applicant offered to come for three poundsthought six pounds too much  she expressed her willingness to sleep in the back kitchen a shakedown under the sink was all she wanted  she likewise had yearnings towards unitarianism  the third girl did not require any wages at allcould not understand what servants wanted with wagesthought wages only encouraged a love of foolish finerythought a comfortable home in a unitarian family ought to be sufficient wages for any girl  this girl said there was one stipulation she should like to make and that was that she should be allowed to pay for all breakages caused by her own carelessness or neglect  she objected to holidays and evenings out she held that they distracted a girl from her work  the fourth candidate offered a premium of five pounds for the place and then a b began to get frightened and refused to see any more of the girls convinced that they must be lunatics from some neighbouring asylum out for a walk  later in the day meeting the nextdoor lady on the doorstep she related her mornings experiences  oh thats nothing extraordinary said the nextdoor lady none of us on this side of the street pay wages and we get the pick of all the best servants in london  why girls will come from the other end of the kingdom to get into one of these houses  its the dream of their lives they save up for years so as to be able to come here for nothing  whats the attraction asked a b more amazed than ever  why dont you see explained the next door lady our back windows open upon the barrack yard  a girl living in one of these houses is always close to soldiers  by looking out of window she can always see soldiers and sometimes a soldier will nod to her or even call up to her they never dream of asking for wages  theyll work eighteen hours a day and put up with anything just to be allowed to stop  a b profited by this information and engaged the girl who offered the five pounds premium  she found her a perfect treasure of a servant she was invariably willing and respectful slept on a sofa in the kitchen and was always contented with an egg for her dinner  the truth of this story i cannot vouch for  myself i can believe it brown and macshaughnassy made no attempt to do so which seemed unfriendly  jephson excused himself on the plea of a headache  i admit there are points in it presenting difficulties to the average intellect as i explained at the commencement it was told to me by ethelbertha who had it from amenda who got it from the charwoman and exaggerations may have crept into it  the following however were incidents that came under my own personal observation  they afforded a still stronger example of the influence exercised by tommy atkins upon the british domestic and i therefore thought it right to relate them  the heroine of them i said is our amenda  now you would call her a tolerably wellbehaved orderly young woman would you not  she is my ideal of unostentatious respectability answered macshaughnassy  that was my opinion also i replied  you can therefore imagine my feelings on passing her one evening in the folkestone high street with a panama hat upon her head my panama hat and a soldiers arm round her waist  she was one of a mob following the band of the third berkshire infantry then in camp at sandgate  there was an ecstatic faraway look in her eyes  she was dancing rather than walking and with her left hand she beat time to the music  ethelbertha was with me at the time  we stared after the procession until it had turned the corner and then we stared at each other  oh its impossible said ethelbertha to me  but that was my hat i said to ethelbertha  the moment we reached home ethelbertha looked for amenda and i looked for my hat  neither was to be found  nine oclock struck ten oclock struck  at halfpast ten we went down and got our own supper and had it in the kitchen  at a quarterpast eleven amenda returned  she walked into the kitchen without a word hung my hat up behind the door and commenced clearing away the supper things  ethelbertha rose calm but severe  where have you been amenda she inquired  gadding half over the county with a lot of low soldiers answered amenda continuing her work  you had on my hat i added  yes sir replied amenda still continuing her work it was the first thing that came to hand  what im thankful for is that it wasnt mississ best bonnet  whether ethelbertha was mollified by the proper spirit displayed in this last remark i cannot say but i think it probable  at all events it was in a voice more of sorrow than of anger that she resumed her examination  you were walking with a soldiers arm around your waist when we passed you amenda she observed interrogatively  i know mum admitted amenda i found it there myself when the music stopped  ethelbertha looked her inquiries  amenda filled a saucepan with water and then replied to them  im a disgrace to a decent household she said no mistress who respected herself would keep me a moment  i ought to be put on the doorstep with my box and a months wages  but why did you do it then said ethelbertha with natural astonishment  because im a helpless ninny mum  i cant help myself if i see soldiers im bound to follow them  it runs in our family  my poor cousin emma was just such another fool  she was engaged to be married to a quiet respectable young fellow with a shop of his own and three days before the wedding she ran off with a regiment of marines to chatham and married the coloursergeant  thats what i shall end by doing  ive been all the way to sandgate with that lot you saw me with and ive kissed four of themthe nasty wretches  im a nice sort of girl to be walking out with a respectable milkman  she was so deeply disgusted with herself that it seemed superfluous for anybody else to be indignant with her and ethelbertha changed her tone and tried to comfort her  oh youll get over all that nonsense amenda she said laughingly you see yourself how silly it is  you must tell mr bowles to keep you away from soldiers  ah i cant look at it in the same light way that you do mum returned amenda somewhat reprovingly a girl that cant see a bit of red marching down the street without wanting to rush out and follow it aint fit to be anybodys wife  why i should be leaving the shop with nobody in it about twice a week and hed have to go the round of all the barracks in london looking for me  i shall save up and get myself into a lunatic asylum thats what i shall do  ethelbertha began to grow quite troubled  but surely this is something altogether new amenda she said you must have often met soldiers when youve been out in london  oh yes one or two at a time walking about anyhow i can stand that all right  its when theres a lot of them with a band that i lose my head  you dont know what its like mum she added noticing ethelberthas puzzled expression youve never had it  i only hope you never may  we kept a careful watch over amenda during the remainder of our stay at folkestone and an anxious time we had of it  every day some regiment or other would march through the town and at the first sound of its music amenda would become restless and excited  the pied pipers reed could not have stirred the hamelin children deeper than did those sandgate bands the heart of our domestic  fortunately they generally passed early in the morning when we were indoors but one day returning home to lunch we heard distant strains dying away upon the hythe road  we hurried in  ethelbertha ran down into the kitchen it was emptyup into amendas bedroom it was vacant  we called  there was no answer  that miserable girl has gone off again said ethelbertha  what a terrible misfortune it is for her  its quite a disease  ethelbertha wanted me to go to sandgate camp and inquire for her  i was sorry for the girl myself but the picture of a young and innocentlooking man wandering about a complicated camp inquiring for a lost domestic presenting itself to my mind i said that id rather not  ethelbertha thought me heartless and said that if i would not go she would go herself  i replied that i thought one female member of my household was enough in that camp at a time and requested her not to ethelbertha expressed her sense of my inhuman behaviour by haughtily declining to eat any lunch and i expressed my sense of her unreasonableness by sweeping the whole meal into the grate after which ethelbertha suddenly developed exuberant affection for the cat who didnt want anybodys love but wanted to get under the grate after the lunch and i became supernaturally absorbed in the daybeforeyesterdays newspaper  in the afternoon strolling out into the garden i heard the faint cry of a female in distress  i listened attentively and the cry was repeated  i thought it sounded like amendas voice but where it came from i could not conceive  it drew nearer however as i approached the bottom of the garden and at last i located it in a small wooden shed used by the proprietor of the house as a darkroom for developing photographs  the door was locked  is that you amenda i cried through the keyhole  yes sir came back the muffled answer will you please let me out youll find the key on the ground near the door  i discovered it on the grass about a yard away and released her  who locked you in i asked  i did sir she replied i locked myself in and pushed the key out under the door  i had to do it or i should have gone off with those beastly soldiers  i hope i havent inconvenienced you sir she added stepping out i left the lunch all laid        amendas passion for soldiers was her one tribute to sentiment  towards all others of the male sex she maintained an attitude of callous unsusceptibility and her engagements with them which were numerous were entered into or abandoned on grounds so sordid as to seriously shock ethelbertha  when she came to us she was engaged to a pork butcherwith a milkman in reserve  for amendas sake we dealt with the man but we never liked him and we liked his pork still less  when therefore amenda announced to us that her engagement with him was off and intimated that her feelings would in no way suffer by our going elsewhere for our bacon we secretly rejoiced  i am confident you have done right amenda said ethelbertha you would never have been happy with that man  no mum i dont think i ever should replied amenda  i dont see how any girl could as hadnt the digestion of an ostrich  ethelbertha looked puzzled  but what has digestion got to do with it she asked  a pretty good deal mum answered amenda when youre thinking of marrying a man as cant make a sausage fit to eat  but surely exclaimed ethelbertha you dont mean to say youre breaking off the match because you dont like his sausages  well i suppose thats what it comes to agreed amenda unconcernedly  what an awful idea sighed poor ethelbertha after a long pause  do you think you ever really loved him  oh yes said amenda i loved him right enough but its no good loving a man that wants you to live on sausages that keep you awake all night  but does he want you to live on sausages persisted ethelbertha  oh he doesnt say anything about it explained amenda but you know what it is mum when you marry a pork butcher youre expected to eat whats left over  thats the mistake my poor cousin eliza made  she married a muffin man  of course what he didnt sell they had to finish up themselves  why one winter when he had a run of bad luck they lived for two months on nothing but muffins  i never saw a girl so changed in all my life  one has to think of these things you know  but the most shamefully mercenary engagement that i think amenda ever entered into was one with a bus conductor  we were living in the north of london then and she had a young man a cheesemonger who kept a shop in lupus street chelsea  he could not come up to her because of the shop so once a week she used to go down to him  one did not ride ten miles for a penny in those days and she found the fare from holloway to victoria and back a severe tax upon her purse  the same bus that took her down at six brought her back at ten  during the first journey the bus conductor stared at amenda during the second he talked to her during the third he gave her a cocoanut during the fourth he proposed to her and was promptly accepted  after that amenda was enabled to visit her cheesemonger without expense  he was a quaint character himself this bus conductor  i often rode with him to fleet street  he knew me quite well i suppose amenda must have pointed me out to him and would always ask me after heraloud before all the other passengers which was tryingand give me messages to take back to her  where women were concerned he had what is called a way with him and from the extent and variety of his female acquaintance and the evident tenderness with which the majority of them regarded him i am inclined to hope that amendas desertion of him which happened contemporaneously with her jilting of the cheesemonger caused him less prolonged suffering than might otherwise have been the case  he was a man from whom i derived a good deal of amusement one way and another  thinking of him brings back to my mind a somewhat odd incident  one afternoon i jumped upon his bus in the seven sisters road  an elderly frenchman was the only other occupant of the vehicle  you vil not forget me the frenchman was saying as i entered i desire sharing cross  i wont forget yer answered the conductor you shall ave yer sharing cross  dont make a fuss about it  thats the third time ees arst me not to forget im he remarked to me in a stentorian aside ee dont giv yer much chance of doin it does ee  at the corner of the holloway road we drew up and our conductor began to shout after the manner of his species charing crosscharing crossere yer arecome along ladycharing cross  the little frenchman jumped up and prepared to exit the conductor pushed him back  sit down and dont be silly he said this aint charing cross  the frenchman looked puzzled but collapsed meekly  we picked up a few passengers and proceeded on our way  half a mile up the liverpool road a lady stood on the kerb regarding us as we passed with that pathetic mingling of desire and distrust which is the average womans attitude towards conveyances of all kinds  our conductor stopped  where dyer want to go to he asked her severelystrandcharing cross  the frenchman did not hear or did not understand the first part of the speech but he caught the words charing cross and bounced up and out on to the step  the conductor collared him as he was getting off and jerked him back savagely  carnt yer keep still a minute he cried indignantly blessed if you dont want lookin after like a bloomin kid  i vont to be put down at sharing cross answered the frenchman humbly  you vont to be put down at sharing cross repeated the other bitterly as he led him back to his seat  i shall put yer down in the middle of the road if i ave much more of yer  you stop there till i come and sling yer out  i aint likely to let yer go much past yer sharing cross i shall be too jolly glad to get rid o yer  the poor frenchman subsided and we jolted on  at the angel we of course stopped  charing cross shouted the conductor and up sprang the frenchman  oh my gawd said the conductor taking him by the shoulders and forcing him down into the corner seat wot am i to do  carnt somebody sit on im  he held him firmly down until the bus started and then released him  at the top of chancery lane the same scene took place and the poor little frenchman became exasperated  he keep saying sharing cross sharing cross he exclaimed turning to the other passengers and it is no sharing cross  he is fool  carnt yer understand retorted the conductor equally indignant of course i say sharing crossi mean charing cross but that dont mean that it is charing cross  that means and then perceiving from the blank look on the frenchmans face the utter impossibility of ever making the matter clear to him he turned to us with an appealing gesture and asked  does any gentleman know the french for bloomin idiot  a day or two afterwards i happened to enter his omnibus again  well i asked him did you get your french friend to charing cross all right  no sir he replied youll ardly believe it but i ad a bit of a row with a policeman just before i got to the corner and it put im clean out o my ead  blessed if i didnt run im on to victoria     chapter xi   said brown one evening there is but one vice and that is selfishness  jephson was standing before the fire lighting his pipe  he puffed the tobacco into a glow threw the match into the embers and then said  and the seed of all virtue also  sit down and get on with your work said macshaughnassy from the sofa where he lay at full length with his heels on a chair were discussing the novel  paradoxes not admitted during business hours  jephson however was in an argumentative mood  selfishness he continued is merely another name for will  every deed good or bad that we do is prompted by selfishness  we are charitable to secure ourselves a good place in the next world to make ourselves respected in this to ease our own distress at the knowledge of suffering  one man is kind because it gives him pleasure to be kind just as another is cruel because cruelty pleases him  a great man does his duty because to him the sense of duty done is a deeper delight than would be the case resulting from avoidance of duty  the religious man is religious because he finds a joy in religion the moral man moral because with his strong selfrespect viciousness would mean wretchedness  self sacrifice itself is only a subtle selfishness we prefer the mental exaltation gained thereby to the sensual gratification which is the alternative reward  man cannot be anything else but selfish  selfishness is the law of all life  each thing from the farthest fixed star to the smallest insect crawling on the earth fighting for itself according to its strength and brooding over all the eternal working for himself that is the universe  have some whisky said macshaughnassy and dont be so complicatedly metaphysical  you make my head ache  if all action good and bad spring from selfishness replied brown then there must be good selfishness and bad selfishness and your bad selfishness is my plain selfishness without any adjective so we are back where we started  i say selfishnessbad selfishnessis the root of all evil and there you are bound to agree with me  not always persisted jephson ive known selfishnessselfishness according to the ordinarily accepted meaning of the termto be productive of good actions  i can give you an instance if you like  has it got a moral asked macshaughnassy drowsily  jephson mused a moment  yes he said at length a very practical moraland one very useful to young men  thats the sort of story we want said the macshaughnassy raising himself into a sitting position  you listen to this brown  jephson seated himself upon a chair in his favourite attitude with his elbows resting upon the back and smoked for a while in silence  there are three people in this story he began the wife the wifes husband and the other man  in most dramas of this type it is the wife who is the chief character  in this case the interesting person is the other man  the wifei met her once she was the most beautiful woman i have ever seen and the most wickedlooking which is saying a good deal for both statements  i remember during a walking tour one year coming across a lovely little cottage  it was the sweetest place imaginable  i need not describe it  it was the cottage one sees in pictures and reads of in sentimental poetry  i was leaning over the neatlycropped hedge drinking in its beauty when at one of the tiny casements i saw looking out at me a face  it stayed there only a moment but in that moment the cottage had become ugly and i hurried away with a shudder  that womans face reminded me of the incident  it was an angels face until the woman herself looked out of it then you were struck by the strange incongruity between tenement and tenant  that at one time she had loved her husband i have little doubt  vicious women have few vices and sordidness is not usually one of them  she had probably married him borne towards him by one of those waves of passion upon which the souls of animal natures are continually rising and falling  on possession however had quickly followed satiety and from satiety had grown the desire for a new sensation  they were living at cairo at the period her husband held an important official position there and by virtue of this and of her own beauty and tact her house soon became the centre of the anglosaxon society ever drifting in and out of the city  the women disliked her and copied her the men spoke slightingly of her to their wives lightly of her to each other and made idiots of themselves when they were alone with her  she laughed at them to their faces and mimicked them behind their backs their friends said it was clever  one year there arrived a young english engineer who had come out to superintend some canal works  he brought with him satisfactory letters of recommendation and was at once received by the european residents as a welcome addition to their social circle  he was not particularly good looking he was not remarkably charming but he possessed the one thing that few women can resist in a man and that is strength  the woman looked at the man and the man looked back at the woman and the drama began  scandal flies swiftly through small communities  before a month their relationship was the chief topic of conversation throughout the quarter in less than two it reached the ears of the womans husband  he was either an exceptionally mean or an exceptionally noble character according to how one views the matter  he worshipped his wifeas men with big hearts and weak brains often do worship such womenwith dog like devotion  his only dread was lest the scandal should reach proportions that would compel him to take notice of it and thus bring shame and suffering upon the woman to whom he would have given his life that a man who saw her should love her seemed natural to him that she should have grown tired of himself a thing not to be wondered at  he was grateful to her for having once loved him for a little while  as for the other man he proved somewhat of an enigma to the gossips he attempted no secrecy if anything he rather paraded his subjugationor his conquest it was difficult to decide which term to apply  he rode and drove with her visited her in public and in private in such privacy as can be hoped for in a house filled with chattering servants and watched by spying eyes loaded her with expensive presents which she wore openly and papered his smokingden with her photographs  yet he never allowed himself to appear in the least degree ridiculous never allowed her to come between him and his work  a letter from her he would lay aside unopened until he had finished what he evidently regarded as more important business  when boudoir and engine shed became rivals it was the boudoir that had to wait  the woman chafed under his selfcontrol which stung her like a lash but clung to him the more abjectly  tell me you love me she would cry fiercely stretching her white arms towards him  i have told you so he would reply calmly without moving  i want to hear you tell it me again she would plead with a voice that trembled on a sob  come close to me and tell it me again again again  then as she lay with halfclosed eyes he would pour forth a flood of passionate words sufficient to satisfy even her thirsty ears and afterwards as the gates clanged behind him would take up an engineering problem at the exact point at which half an hour before on her entrance into the room he had temporarily dismissed it  one day a privileged friend put bluntly to him this question are you playing for love or vanity  to which the man after long pondering gave this reply pon my soul jack i couldnt tell you  now when a man is in love with a woman who cannot make up her mind whether she loves him or not we call the complication comedy where it is the woman who is in earnest the result is generally tragedy  they continued to meet and to make love  they talkedas people in their position are prone to talkof the beautiful life they would lead if it only were not for the thing that was of the earthly paradiseor maybe earthy would be the more suitable adjectivethey would each create for the other if only they had the right which they hadnt  in this work of imagination the man trusted chiefly to his literary faculties which were considerable the woman to her desires  thus his scenes possessed a grace and finish which hers lacked but her pictures were the more vivid  indeed so realistic did she paint them that to herself they seemed realities waiting for her  then she would rise to go towards them only to strike herself against the thought of the thing that stood between her and them  at first she only hated the thing but after a while there came an ugly look of hope into her eyes  the time drew near for the man to return to england  the canal was completed and a day appointed for the letting in of the water  the man determined to make the event the occasion of a social gathering  he invited a large number of guests among whom were the woman and her husband to assist at the function  afterwards the party were to picnic at a pleasant wooded spot some threequarters of a mile from the first lock  the ceremony of flooding was to be performed by the woman her husbands position entitling her to this distinction  between the river and the head of the cutting had been left a strong bank of earth pierced some distance down by a hole which hole was kept closed by means of a closely fitting steel plate  the woman drew the lever releasing this plate and the water rushed through and began to press against the lock gates  when it had attained a certain depth the sluices were raised and the water poured down into the deep basin of the lock  it was an exceptionally deep lock  the party gathered round and watched the water slowly rising  the woman looked down and shuddered the man was standing by her side  how deep it is she said  yes he replied it holds thirty feet of water when full  the water crept up inch by inch  why dont you open the gates and let it in quickly she asked  it would not do for it to come in too quickly he explained we shall half fill this lock and then open the sluices at the other end and so let the water pass through  the woman looked at the smooth stone walls and at the ironplated gates  i wonder what a man would do she said if he fell in and there was no one near to help him  the man laughed  i think he would stop there he answered  come the others are waiting for us  he lingered a moment to give some final instructions to the workmen you can follow on when youve made all right he said and get something to eat  theres no need for more than one to stop  then they joined the rest of the party and sauntered on laughing and talking to the picnic ground  after lunch the party broke up as is the custom of picnic parties and wandered away in groups and pairs  the man whose duty as host had hitherto occupied all his attention looked for the woman but she was gone  a friend strolled by the same that had put the question to him about love and vanity  have you quarrelled asked the friend  no replied the man  i fancied you had said the other  i met her just now walking with her husband of all men in the world and making herself quite agreeable to him  the friend strolled on and the man sat down on a fallen tree and lighted a cigar  he smoked and thought and the cigar burnt out but he still sat thinking  after a while he heard a faint rustling of the branches behind him and peering between the interlacing leaves that hid him saw the crouching figure of the woman creeping through the wood  his lips were parted to call her name when she turned her listening head in his direction and his eyes fell full upon her face  something about it he could not have told what struck him dumb and the woman crept on  gradually the nebulous thoughts floating through his brain began to solidify into a tangible idea and the man unconsciously started forward after walking a few steps he broke into a run for the idea had grown clearer  it continued to grow still clearer and clearer and the man ran faster and faster until at last he found himself racing madly towards the lock  as he approached it he looked round for the watchman who ought to have been there but the man was gone from his post  he shouted but if any answer was returned it was drowned by the roar of the rushing water  he reached the edge and looked down  fifteen feet below him was the reality of the dim vision that had come to him a mile back in the woods the womans husband swimming round and round like a rat in a pail  the river was flowing in and out of the lock at the same rate so that the level of the water remained constant  the first thing the man did was to close the lower sluices and then open those in the upper gate to their fullest extent  the water began to rise  can you hold out he cried  the drowning man turned to him a face already contorted by the agony of exhaustion and answered with a feeble no  he looked around for something to throw to the man  a plank had lain there in the morning he remembered stumbling over it and complaining of its having been left there he cursed himself now for his care  a hut used by the navvies to keep their tools in stood about two hundred yards away perhaps it had been taken there perhaps there he might even find a rope  just one minute old fellow he shouted down and ill be back  but the other did not hear him  the feeble struggles ceased  the face fell back upon the water the eyes half closed as if with weary indifference  there was no time for him to do more than kick off his riding boots and jump in and clutch the unconscious figure as it sank  down there in that walledin trap he fought a long fight with death for the life that stood between him and the woman  he was not an expert swimmer his clothes hampered him he was already blown with his long race the burden in his arms dragged him down the water rose slowly enough to make his torture fit for dantes hell  at first he could not understand why this was so but in glancing down he saw to his horror that he had not properly closed the lower sluices in each some eight or ten inches remained open so that the stream was passing out nearly half as fast as it came in  it would be another five andtwenty minutes before the water would be high enough for him to grasp the top  he noted where the line of wet had reached to on the smooth stone wall then looked again after what he thought must be a lapse of ten minutes and found it had risen half an inch if that  once or twice he shouted for help but the effort taxed severely his already failing breath and his voice only came back to him in a hundred echoes from his prison walls  inch by inch the line of wet crept up but the spending of his strength went on more swiftly  it seemed to him as if his inside were being gripped and torn slowly out his whole body cried out to him to let it sink and lie in rest at the bottom  at length his unconscious burden opened its eyes and stared at him stupidly then closed them again with a sigh a minute later opened them once more and looked long and hard at him  let me go he said we shall both drown  you can manage by yourself  he made a feeble effort to release himself but the other held him  keep still you fool he hissed youre going to get out of this with me or im going down with you  so the grim struggle went on in silence till the man looking up saw the stone coping just a little way above his head made one mad leap and caught it with his fingertips held on an instant then fell back with a plump and sank came up and made another dash and helped by the impetus of his rise caught the coping firmly this time with the whole of his fingers hung on till his eyes saw the stunted grass till they were both able to scramble out upon the bank and lie there their breasts pressed close against the ground their hands clutching the earth while the overflowing water swirled softly round them  after a while they raised themselves and looked at one another  tiring work said the other man with a nod towards the lock  yes answered the husband beastly awkward not being a good swimmer how did you know i had fallen in  you met my wife i suppose  yes said the other man  the husband sat staring at a point in the horizon for some minutes  do you know what i was wondering this morning said he  no said the other man  whether i should kill you or not  they told me he continued after a pause a lot of silly gossip which i was cad enough to believe  i know now it wasnt true becausewell if it had been you would not have done what you have done  he rose and came across  i beg your pardon he said holding out his hand  i beg yours said the other man rising and taking it do you mind giving me a hand with the sluices  they set to work to put the lock right  how did you manage to fall in asked the other man who was raising one of the lower sluices without looking round  the husband hesitated as if he found the explanation somewhat difficult  oh he answered carelessly the wife and i were chaffing and she said shed often seen you jump it andhe laughed a rather forced laughshe promised me aa kiss if i cleared it  it was a foolish thing to do  yes it was rather said the other man  a few days afterwards the man and woman met at a reception  he found her in a leafy corner of the garden talking to some friends  she advanced to meet him holding out her hand  what can i say more than thank you she murmured in a low voice  the others moved away leaving them alone  they tell me you risked your life to save his she said  yes he answered  she raised her eyes to his then struck him across the face with her ungloved hand  you damned fool she whispered  he seized her by her white arms and forced her back behind the orange trees  do you know why he said speaking slowly and distinctly because i feared that with him dead you would want me to marry you and that talked about as we have been i might find it awkward to avoid doing so because i feared that without him to stand between us you might prove an annoyance to meperhaps come between me and the woman i love the woman i am going back to  now do you understand  yes whispered the woman and he left her  but there are only two people concluded jephson who do not regard his saving of the husbands life as a highly noble and unselfish action and they are the man himself and the woman  we thanked jephson for his story and promised to profit by the moral when discovered  meanwhile macshaughnassy said that he knew a story dealing with the same theme namely the too close attachment of a woman to a strange man which really had a moral which moral was dont have anything to do with inventions  brown who had patented a safety gun which he had never yet found a man plucky enough to let off said it was a bad moral  we agreed to hear the particulars and judge for ourselves  this story commenced macshaughnassy comes from furtwangen a small town in the black forest  there lived there a very wonderful old fellow named nicholaus geibel  his business was the making of mechanical toys at which work he had acquired an almost european reputation  he made rabbits that would emerge from the heart of a cabbage flap their ears smooth their whiskers and disappear again cats that would wash their faces and mew so naturally that dogs would mistake them for real cats and fly at them dolls with phonographs concealed within them that would raise their hats and say good morning how do you do and some that would even sing a song  but he was something more than a mere mechanic he was an artist  his work was with him a hobby almost a passion  his shop was filled with all manner of strange things that never would or could be soldthings he had made for the pure love of making them  he had contrived a mechanical donkey that would trot for two hours by means of stored electricity and trot too much faster than the live article and with less need for exertion on the part of the driver a bird that would shoot up into the air fly round and round in a circle and drop to earth at the exact spot from where it started a skeleton that supported by an upright iron bar would dance a hornpipe a lifesize lady doll that could play the fiddle and a gentleman with a hollow inside who could smoke a pipe and drink more lager beer than any three average german students put together which is saying much  indeed it was the belief of the town that old geibel could make a man capable of doing everything that a respectable man need want to do  one day he made a man who did too much and it came about in this way  young doctor follen had a baby and the baby had a birthday  its first birthday put doctor follens household into somewhat of a flurry but on the occasion of its second birthday mrs doctor follen gave a ball in honour of the event  old geibel and his daughter olga were among the guests  during the afternoon of the next day some three or four of olgas bosom friends who had also been present at the ball dropped in to have a chat about it  they naturally fell to discussing the men and to criticising their dancing  old geibel was in the room but he appeared to be absorbed in his newspaper and the girls took no notice of him  there seem to be fewer men who can dance at every ball you go to said one of the girls  yes and dont the ones who can give themselves airs said another they make quite a favour of asking you  and how stupidly they talk added a third  they always say exactly the same things how charming you are looking tonight  do you often go to vienna  oh you should its delightful  what a charming dress you have on  what a warm day it has been  do you like wagner  i do wish theyd think of something new  oh i never mind how they talk said a fourth  if a man dances well he may be a fool for all i care  he generally is slipped in a thin girl rather spitefully  i go to a ball to dance continued the previous speaker not noticing the interruption  all i ask of a partner is that he shall hold me firmly take me round steadily and not get tired before i do  a clockwork figure would be the thing for you said the girl who had interrupted  bravo cried one of the others clapping her hands what a capital idea  whats a capital idea they asked  why a clockwork dancer or better still one that would go by electricity and never run down  the girls took up the idea with enthusiasm  oh what a lovely partner he would make said one he would never kick you or tread on your toes  or tear your dress said another  or get out of step  or get giddy and lean on you  and he would never want to mop his face with his handkerchief  i do hate to see a man do that after every dance  and wouldnt want to spend the whole evening in the supperroom  why with a phonograph inside him to grind out all the stock remarks you would not be able to tell him from a real man said the girl who had first suggested the idea  oh yes you would said the thin girl he would be so much nicer  old geibel had laid down his paper and was listening with both his ears  on one of the girls glancing in his direction however he hurriedly hid himself again behind it  after the girls were gone he went into his workshop where olga heard him walking up and down and every now and then chuckling to himself and that night he talked to her a good deal about dancing and dancing menasked what they usually said and didwhat dances were most popularwhat steps were gone through with many other questions bearing on the subject  then for a couple of weeks he kept much to his factory and was very thoughtful and busy though prone at unexpected moments to break into a quiet low laugh as if enjoying a joke that nobody else knew of  a month later another ball took place in furtwangen  on this occasion it was given by old wenzel the wealthy timber merchant to celebrate his nieces betrothal and geibel and his daughter were again among the invited  when the hour arrived to set out olga sought her father  not finding him in the house she tapped at the door of his workshop  he appeared in his shirtsleeves looking hot but radiant  dont wait for me he said you go on ill follow you  ive got something to finish  as she turned to obey he called after her tell them im going to bring a young man with mesuch a nice young man and an excellent dancer  all the girls will like him  then he laughed and closed the door  her father generally kept his doings secret from everybody but she had a pretty shrewd suspicion of what he had been planning and so to a certain extent was able to prepare the guests for what was coming anticipation ran high and the arrival of the famous mechanist was eagerly awaited  at length the sound of wheels was heard outside followed by a great commotion in the passage and old wenzel himself his jolly face red with excitement and suppressed laughter burst into the room and announced in stentorian tones  herr geibeland a friend  herr geibel and his friend entered greeted with shouts of laughter and applause and advanced to the centre of the room  allow me ladies and gentlemen said herr geibel to introduce you to my friend lieutenant fritz  fritz my dear fellow bow to the ladies and gentlemen  geibel placed his hand encouragingly on fritzs shoulder and the lieutenant bowed low accompanying the action with a harsh clicking noise in his throat unpleasantly suggestive of a death rattle  but that was only a detail  he walks a little stiffly old geibel took his arm and walked him forward a few steps  he certainly did walk stiffly but then walking is not his forte  he is essentially a dancing man  i have only been able to teach him the waltz as yet but at that he is faultless  come which of you ladies may i introduce him to as a partner  he keeps perfect time he never gets tired he wont kick you or tread on your dress he will hold you as firmly as you like and go as quickly or as slowly as you please he never gets giddy and he is full of conversation  come speak up for yourself my boy  the old gentleman twisted one of the buttons of his coat and immediately fritz opened his mouth and in thin tones that appeared to proceed from the back of his head remarked suddenly may i have the pleasure and then shut his mouth again with a snap  that lieutenant fritz had made a strong impression on the company was undoubted yet none of the girls seemed inclined to dance with him  they looked askance at his waxen face with its staring eyes and fixed smile and shuddered  at last old geibel came to the girl who had conceived the idea  it is your own suggestion carried out to the letter said geibel an electric dancer  you owe it to the gentleman to give him a trial  she was a bright saucy little girl fond of a frolic  her host added his entreaties and she consented  herr geibel fixed the figure to her  its right arm was screwed round her waist and held her firmly its delicately jointed left hand was made to fasten itself upon her right  the old toymaker showed her how to regulate its speed and how to stop it and release herself  it will take you round in a complete circle he explained be careful that no one knocks against you and alters its course  the music struck up  old geibel put the current in motion and annette and her strange partner began to dance  for a while every one stood watching them  the figure performed its purpose admirably  keeping perfect time and step and holding its little partner tightly clasped in an unyielding embrace it revolved steadily pouring forth at the same time a constant flow of squeaky conversation broken by brief intervals of grinding silence  how charming you are looking tonight it remarked in its thin far away voice  what a lovely day it has been  do you like dancing  how well our steps agree  you will give me another wont you  oh dont be so cruel  what a charming gown you have on  isnt waltzing delightful i could go on dancing for everwith you  have you had supper  as she grew more familiar with the uncanny creature the girls nervousness wore off and she entered into the fun of the thing  oh hes just lovely she cried laughing i could go on dancing with him all my life  couple after couple now joined them and soon all the dancers in the room were whirling round behind them  nicholaus geibel stood looking on beaming with childish delight at his success  old wenzel approached him and whispered something in his ear  geibel laughed and nodded and the two worked their way quietly towards the door  this is the young peoples house tonight said wenzel as soon as they were outside you and i will have a quiet pipe and a glass of hock over in the countinghouse  meanwhile the dancing grew more fast and furious  little annette loosened the screw regulating her partners rate of progress and the figure flew round with her swifter and swifter  couple after couple dropped out exhausted but they only went the faster till at length they were the only pair left dancing  madder and madder became the waltz  the music lagged behind the musicians unable to keep pace ceased and sat staring  the younger guests applauded but the older faces began to grow anxious  hadnt you better stop dear said one of the women youll make yourself so tired  but annette did not answer  i believe shes fainted cried out a girl who had caught sight of her face as it was swept by  one of the men sprang forward and clutched at the figure but its impetus threw him down on to the floor where its steelcased feet laid bare his cheek  the thing evidently did not intend to part with its prize easily  had any one retained a cool head the figure one cannot help thinking might easily have been stopped  two or three men acting in concert might have lifted it bodily off the floor or have jammed it into a corner  but few human heads are capable of remaining cool under excitement  those who are not present think how stupid must have been those who were those who are reflect afterwards how simple it would have been to do this that or the other if only they had thought of it at the time  the women grew hysterical  the men shouted contradictory directions to one another  two of them made a bungling rush at the figure which had the result of forcing it out of its orbit in the centre of the room and sending it crashing against the walls and furniture  a stream of blood showed itself down the girls white frock and followed her along the floor  the affair was becoming horrible  the women rushed screaming from the room  the men followed them  one sensible suggestion was made find geibelfetch geibel  no one had noticed him leave the room no one knew where he was  a party went in search of him  the others too unnerved to go back into the ballroom crowded outside the door and listened  they could hear the steady whir of the wheels upon the polished floor as the thing spun round and round the dull thud as every now and again it dashed itself and its burden against some opposing object and ricocheted off in a new direction  and everlastingly it talked in that thin ghostly voice repeating over and over the same formula how charming you are looking tonight  what a lovely day it has been  oh dont be so cruel  i could go on dancing for everwith you  have you had supper  of course they sought for geibel everywhere but where he was  they looked in every room in the house then they rushed off in a body to his own place and spent precious minutes in waking up his deaf old housekeeper  at last it occurred to one of the party that wenzel was missing also and then the idea of the countinghouse across the yard presented itself to them and there they found him  he rose up very pale and followed them and he and old wenzel forced their way through the crowd of guests gathered outside and entered the room and locked the door behind them  from within there came the muffled sound of low voices and quick steps followed by a confused scuffling noise then silence then the low voices again  after a time the door opened and those near it pressed forward to enter but old wenzels broad shoulders barred the way  i want youand you bekler he said addressing a couple of the elder men  his voice was calm but his face was deadly white  the rest of you please goget the women away as quickly as you can  from that day old nicholaus geibel confined himself to the making of mechanical rabbits and cats that mewed and washed their faces  we agreed that the moral of macshaughnassys story was a good one     chapter xii   how much more of ourfortunately not very valuabletime we devoted to this wonderful novel of ours i cannot exactly say  turning the dogs eared leaves of the dilapidated diary that lies before me i find the record of our later gatherings confused and incomplete  for weeks there does not appear a single word  then comes an alarmingly businesslike minute of a meeting at which there werepresent jephson macshaughnassy brown and self and at which the proceedings commenced at 830  at what time the proceedings terminated and what business was done the chronicle however sayeth not though faintly pencilled in the margin of the page i trace these hieroglyphics 3149267 bringing out a result of 182  evidently an unremunerative night  on september 13th we seem to have become suddenly imbued with energy to a quite remarkable degree for i read that we resolved to start the first chapter at onceat once being underlined  after this spurt we rest until october 4th when we discussed whether it should be a novel of plot or of character withoutso far as the diary affords indicationarriving at any definite decision  i observe that on the same day mac told a story about a man who accidentally bought a camel at a sale  details of the story are however wanting which perhaps is fortunate for the reader  on the 16th we were still debating the character of our hero and i see that i suggested a man of the charley buswell type  poor charley i wonder what could have made me think of him in connection with heroes his lovableness i supposecertainly not his heroic qualities  i can recall his boyish face now it was always a boyish face the tears streaming down it as he sat in the schoolyard beside a bucket in which he was drowning three white mice and a tame rat  i sat down opposite and cried too while helping him to hold a saucepan lid over the poor little creatures and thus there sprang up a friendship between us which grew  over the grave of these murdered rodents he took a solemn oath never to break school rules again by keeping either white mice or tame rats but to devote the whole of his energies for the future to pleasing his masters and affording his parents some satisfaction for the money being spent upon his education  seven weeks later the pervadence throughout the dormitory of an atmospheric effect more curious than pleasing led to the discovery that he had converted his box into a rabbit hutch  confronted with eleven kicking witnesses and reminded of his former promises he explained that rabbits were not mice and seemed to consider that a new and vexatious regulation had been sprung upon him  the rabbits were confiscated  what was their ultimate fate we never knew with certainty but three days later we were given rabbitpie for dinner  to comfort him i endeavoured to assure him that these could not be his rabbits  he however convinced that they were cried steadily into his plate all the time that he was eating them and afterwards in the playground had a standup fight with a fourth form boy who had requested a second helping  that evening he performed another solemn oathtaking and for the next month was the model boy of the school  he read tracts sent his spare pocketmoney to assist in annoying the heathen and subscribed to the young christian and the weekly rambler an evangelical miscellany whatever that may mean  an undiluted course of this pernicious literature naturally created in him a desire towards the opposite extreme  he suddenly dropped the young christian and the weekly rambler and purchased penny dreadfuls and taking no further interest in the welfare of the heathen saved up and bought a secondhand revolver and a hundred cartridges  his ambition he confided to me was to become a dead shot and the marvel of it is that he did not succeed  of course there followed the usual discovery and consequent trouble the usual repentance and reformation the usual determination to start a new life  poor fellow he lived starting a new life  every new years day he would start a new lifeon his birthdayon other peoples birthdays  i fancy that later on when he came to know their importance he extended the principle to quarter days  tidying up and starting afresh he always called it  i think as a young man he was better than most of us  but he lacked that great gift which is the distinguishing feature of the englishspeaking race all the world over the gift of hypocrisy  he seemed incapable of doing the slightest thing without getting found out a grave misfortune for a man to suffer from this  dear simplehearted fellow it never occurred to him that he was as other menwith perhaps a dash of straightforwardness added he regarded himself as a monster of depravity  one evening i found him in his chambers engaged upon his sisyphean labour of tidying up a heap of letters photographs and bills lay before him  he was tearing them up and throwing them into the fire  i came towards him but he stopped me  dont come near me he cried dont touch me  im not fit to shake hands with a decent man  it was the sort of speech to make one feel hot and uncomfortable  i did not know what to answer and murmured something about his being no worse than the average  dont talk like that he answered excitedly you say that to comfort me i know but i dont like to hear it  if i thought other men were like me i should be ashamed of being a man  ive been a blackguard old fellow but please god its not too late  tomorrow morning i begin a new life  he finished his work of destruction and then rang the bell and sent his man downstairs for a bottle of champagne  my last drink he said as we clicked glasses  heres to the old life out and the new life in  he took a sip and flung the glass with the remainder into the fire  he was always a little theatrical especially when most in earnest  for a long while after that i saw nothing of him  then one evening sitting down to supper at a restaurant i noticed him opposite to me in company that could hardly be called doubtful  he flushed and came over to me  ive been an old woman for nearly six months he said with a laugh  i find i cant stand it any longer  after all he continued what is life for but to live  its only hypocritical to try and be a thing we are not  and do you knowhe leant across the table speaking earnestlyhonestly and seriously im a better mani feel it and know itwhen i am my natural self than when i am trying to be an impossible saint  that was the mistake he made he always ran to extremes  he thought that an oath if it were only big enough would frighten away human nature instead of serving only as a challenge to it  accordingly each reformation was more intemperate than the last to be duly followed by a greater swing of the pendulum in the opposite direction  being now in a thoroughly reckless mood he went the pace rather hotly then one evening without any previous warning i had a note from him come round and see me on thursday  it is my wedding eve  i went  he was once more tidying up  all his drawers were open and on the table were piled packs of cards betting books and much written paper all as before in course of demolition  i smiled i could not help it and no way abashed he laughed his usual hearty honest laugh  i know he exclaimed gaily but this is not the same as the others  then laying his hand on my shoulder and speaking with the sudden seriousness that comes so readily to shallow natures he said god has heard my prayer old friend  he knows i am weak  he has sent down an angel out of heaven to help me  he took her portrait from the mantelpiece and handed it me  it seemed to me the face of a hard narrow woman but of course he raved about her  as he talked there fluttered to the ground from the heap before him an old restaurant bill and stooping he picked it up and held it in his hand musing  have you ever noticed how the scent of the champagne and the candles seems to cling to these things he said lightly sniffing carelessly at it  i wonder whats become of her  i think i wouldnt think about her at all tonight i answered  he loosened his hand letting the paper fall into the fire  my god he cried vehemently when i think of all the wrong i have donethe irreparable everwidening ruin i have perhaps brought into the worldo god spare me a long life that i may make amends  every hour every minute of it shall be devoted to your service  as he stood there with his eager boyish eyes upraised a light seemed to fall upon his face and illumine it  i had pushed the photograph back to him and it lay upon the table before him  he knelt and pressed his lips to it  with your help my darling and his he murmured  the next morning he was married  she was a wellmeaning girl though her piety as is the case with most people was of the negative order and her antipathy to things evil much stronger than her sympathy with things good  for a longer time than i had expected she kept him straightperhaps a little too straight  but at last there came the inevitable relapse  i called upon him in answer to an excited message and found him in the depths of despair  it was the old story human weakness combined with lamentable lack of the most ordinary precautions against being found out he gave me details interspersed with exuberant denunciations of himself and i undertook the delicate task of peacemaker  it was a weary work but eventually she consented to forgive him  his joy when i told him was boundless  how good women are he said while the tears came into his eyes  but she shall not repent it  please god from this day forth ill  he stopped and for the first time in his life the doubt of himself crossed his mind  as i sat watching him the joy died out of his face and the first hint of age passed over it  i seem to have been tidying up and starting afresh all my life he said wearily im beginning to see where the untidiness lies and the only way to get rid of it  i did not understand the meaning of his words at the time but learnt it later on  he strove according to his strength and fell  but by a miracle his transgression was not discovered  the facts came to light long afterwards but at the time there were only two who knew  it was his last failure  late one evening i received a hurriedlyscrawled note from his wife begging me to come round  a terrible thing has happened it ran charley went up to his study after dinner saying he had some tidying up as he calls it to do and did not wish to be disturbed  in clearing out his desk he must have handled carelessly the revolver that he always keeps there not remembering i suppose that it was loaded  we heard a report and on rushing into the room found him lying dead on the floor  the bullet had passed right through his heart  hardly the type of man for a hero  and yet i do not know  perhaps he fought harder than many a man who conquers  in the worlds courts we are compelled to judge on circumstantial evidence only and the chief witness the mans soul cannot very well be called  i remember the subject of bravery being discussed one evening at a dinner party when a german gentleman present related an anecdote the hero of which was a young prussian officer  i cannot give you his name our german friend explainedthe man himself told me the story in confidence and though he personally by virtue of his after record could afford to have it known there are other reasons why it should not be bruited about  how i learnt it was in this way  for a dashing exploit performed during the brief war against austria he had been presented with the iron cross this as you are well aware is the most highlyprized decoration in our army men who have earned it are usually conceited about it and indeed have some excuse for being so  he on the contrary kept his locked in a drawer of his desk and never wore it except when compelled by official etiquette  the mere sight of it seemed to be painful to him  one day i asked him the reason  we are very old and close friends and he told me  the incident occurred when he was a young lieutenant  indeed it was his first engagement  by some means or another he had become separated from his company and unable to regain it had attached himself to a line regiment stationed at the extreme right of the prussian lines  the enemys effort was mainly directed against the left centre and for a while our young lieutenant was nothing more than a distant spectator of the battle  suddenly however the attack shifted and the regiment found itself occupying an extremely important and critical position  the shells began to fall unpleasantly near and the order was given to grass  the men fell upon their faces and waited  the shells ploughed the ground around them smothering them with dirt  a horrible griping pain started in my young friends stomach and began creeping upwards  his head and heart both seemed to be shrinking and growing cold  a shot tore off the head of the man next to him sending the blood spurting into his face a minute later another ripped open the back of a poor fellow lying to the front of him  his body seemed not to belong to himself at all  a strange shrivelled creature had taken possession of it  he raised his head and peered about him  he and three soldiersyoungsters like himself who had never before been under fireappeared to be utterly alone in that hell  they were the end men of the regiment and the configuration of the ground completely hid them from their comrades  they glanced at each other these four and read one anothers thoughts leaving their rifles lying on the grass they commenced to crawl stealthily upon their bellies the lieutenant leading the other three following  some few hundred yards in front of them rose a small steep hill  if they could reach this it would shut them out of sight  they hastened on pausing every thirty yards or so to lie still and pant for breath then hurrying on again quicker than before tearing their flesh against the broken ground  at last they reached the base of the slope and slinking a little way round it raised their heads and looked back  where they were it was impossible for them to be seen from the prussian lines  they sprang to their feet and broke into a wild race  a dozen steps further they came face to face with an austrian field battery  the demon that had taken possession of them had been growing stronger the further they had fled  they were not men they were animals mad with fear  driven by the same frenzy that prompted other panicstricken creatures to once rush down a steep place into the sea these four men with a yell flung themselves sword in hand upon the whole battery and the whole battery bewildered by the suddenness and unexpectedness of the attack thinking the entire battalion was upon them gave way and rushed pellmell down the hill  with the sight of those flying austrians the fear as independently as it had come to him left him and he felt only a desire to hack and kill the four prussians flew after them cutting and stabbing at them as they ran and when the prussian cavalry came thundering up they found my young lieutenant and his three friends had captured two guns and accounted for half a score of the enemy  next day he was summoned to headquarters  will you be good enough to remember for the future sir said the chief of the staff that his majesty does not require his lieutenants to execute manoeuvres on their own responsibility and also that to attack a battery with three men is not war but damned tomfoolery  you ought to be courtmartialled sir  then in somewhat different tones the old soldier added his face softening into a smile however alertness and daring my young friend are good qualities especially when crowned with success  if the austrians had once succeeded in planting a battery on that hill it might have been difficult to dislodge them  perhaps under the circumstances his majesty may overlook your indiscretion  his majesty not only overlooked it but bestowed upon me the iron cross concluded my friend  for the credit of the army i judged it better to keep quiet and take it  but as you can understand the sight of it does not recall very pleasurable reflections        to return to my diary i see that on november 14th we held another meeting  but at this there were present only jephson macshaughnassy and self and of browns name i find henceforth no further trace  on christmas eve we three met again and my notes inform me that macshaughnassy brewed some whiskeypunch according to a recipe of his own a record suggestive of a sad christmas for all three of us  no particular business appears to have been accomplished on either occasion  then there is a break until february 8th and the assemblage has shrunk to jephson and self  with a final flicker as of a dying candle my diary at this point however grows luminous shedding much light upon that evenings conversation  our talk seems to have been of many thingsof most things in fact except our novel  among other subjects we spoke of literature generally  i am tired of this eternal cackle about books said jephson these columns of criticism to every line of writing these endless books about books these shrill praises and shrill denunciations this silly worship of novelist tom this silly hate of poet dick this silly squabbling over playwright harry  there is no soberness no sense in it all  one would think to listen to the high priests of culture that man was made for literature not literature for man  thought existed before the printing press and the men who wrote the best hundred books never read them books have their place in the world but they are not its purpose  they are things side by side with beef and mutton the scent of the sea the touch of a hand the memory of a hope and all the other items in the sum total of our threescore years and ten  yet we speak of them as though they were the voice of life instead of merely its faint echo  tales are delightful as talessweet as primroses after the long winter restful as the cawing of rooks at sunset  but we do not write tales now we prepare human documents and dissect souls  he broke off abruptly in the midst of his tirade  do you know what these psychological studies that are so fashionable just now always make me think of he said  one monkey examining another monkey for fleas  and what after all does our dissecting pen lay bare he continued human nature or merely some more or less unsavoury undergarment disguising and disfiguring human nature  there is a story told of an elderly tramp who overtaken by misfortune was compelled to retire for a while to the seclusion of portland  his hosts desiring to see as much as possible of their guest during his limited stay with them proceeded to bath him  they bathed him twice a day for a week each time learning more of him until at last they reached a flannel shirt  and with that they had to be content soap and water proving powerless to go further  that tramp appears to me symbolical of mankind  human nature has worn its conventions for so long that its habit has grown on to it  in this nineteenth century it is impossible to say where the clothes of custom end and the natural man begins  our virtues are taught to us as a branch of deportment our vices are the recognised vices of our reign and set our religion hangs readymade beside our cradle to be buttoned upon us by loving hands  our tastes we acquire with difficulty our sentiments we learn by rote  at cost of infinite suffering we study to love whiskey and cigars high art and classical music  in one age we admire byron and drink sweet champagne twenty years later it is more fashionable to prefer shelley and we like our champagne dry  at school we are told that shakespeare is a great poet and that the venus di medici is a fine piece of sculpture and so for the rest of our lives we go about saying what a great poet we think shakespeare and that there is no piece of sculpture in our opinion so fine as the venus di medici  if we are frenchmen we adore our mother if englishmen we love dogs and virtue  we grieve for the death of a near relative twelve months but for a second cousin we sorrow only three  the good man has his regulation excellencies to strive after his regulation sins to repent of  i knew a good man who was quite troubled because he was not proud and could not therefore with any reasonableness pray for humility  in society one must needs be cynical and mildly wicked in bohemia orthodoxly unorthodox  i remember my mother expostulating with a friend an actress who had left a devoted husband and eloped with a disagreeable ugly little low comedian i am speaking of long long ago  you must be mad said my mother what on earth induced you to take such a step  my dear emma replied the lady what else was there for me  you know i cant act  i had to do something to show i was an artiste  we are dressedup marionettes  our voice is the voice of the unseen showman convention our very movements of passion and pain are but in answer to his jerk  a man resembles one of those gigantic bundles that one sees in nursemaids arms  it is very bulky and very long it looks a mass of delicate lace and rich fur and fine woven stuffs and somewhere hidden out of sight among the finery there is a tiny red bit of bewildered humanity with no voice but a foolish cry  there is but one story he went on after a long pause uttering his own thoughts aloud rather than speaking to me  we sit at our desks and think and think and write and write but the story is ever the same  men told it and men listened to it many years ago we are telling it to one another today we shall be telling it to one another a thousand years hence and the story is once upon a time there lived a man and a woman who loved him  the little critic cries that it is not new and asks for something fresh thinkingas children dothat there are strange things in the world        at that point my notes end and there is nothing in the book beyond whether any of us thought any more of the novel whether we ever met again to discuss it whether it were ever begun whether it were ever abandonedi cannot say  there is a fairy story that i read many many years ago that has never ceased to haunt me  it told how a little boy once climbed a rainbow  and at the end of the rainbow just behind the clouds he found a wondrous city  its houses were of gold and its streets were paved with silver and the light that shone upon it was as the light that lies upon the sleeping world at dawn  in this city there were palaces so beautiful that merely to look upon them satisfied all desires temples so perfect that they who once knelt therein were cleansed of sin  and all the men who dwelt in this wondrous city were great and good and the women fairer than the women of a young mans dreams  and the name of the city was the city of the things men meant to do
