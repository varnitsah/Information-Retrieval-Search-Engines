issued under the general title of dave porter series  as i have mentioned several times this series was started a number of years ago by the publication of dave porter at oak hall in which my young readers were introduced to a typical wideawake american lad at an uptodate american boarding school  the publication of this first volume was followed by that of dave porter in the south seas whither the lad journeyed to clear up a question concerning his parentage then came dave porters return to school telling of more doings at oak hall dave porter in the far north in which he went on a second journey looking for his father dave porter and his classmates relating more happenings at school dave porter at star ranch in which our hero participated in many adventures in the wild west dave porter and his rivals showing how he outwitted some of his oldtime enemies dave porter on cave island giving the particulars of a remarkable voyage on the ocean and strange doings ashore dave porter and the runaways in which the youth taught some of his chums a muchneeded lesson and finally dave porter in the gold fields in which the lad and a number of his chums went in quest of a gold mine all traces of which had been lost through a landslide  the present volume tells the particulars of a thrilling rescue from fire at sea and how the boys and girls along with some of the older folks went for a vacation in a camp on the shore of a beautiful lake here most unexpectedly dave fell in with one of his old enemies the youth and his chums had some strenuous times the particulars of which are given in the pages which follow  once again i avail myself of the opportunity to thank my young readers for all the pleasant things they have said regarding my stories i trust that the reading of this volume will benefit them all    edward stratemeyer   march 1 1915       contents     chapter                                  page         i  the boys on shipboard               1        ii  something

to be a good deal worried this morning i hope it isnt on account of the way we cut up on this ship last evening  not at all dave returned phil lawrence i dont believe he noticed our monkeyshines he is worried over the letter he received in the mail we got at our last stoppingplace  no bad news i hope said roger morr another one of the group of boys seated on the forward deck of a small coastwise steamer  well i think it is rather bad news answered the son of the vessels owner poor dad stands to lose between twenty and thirty thousand dollars  twenty or thirty thousand dollars exclaimed dave porter why how can that be phil  did he make a bad investment asked ben basswood another youth of the group  you can hardly call it a bad investment ben returned phil buying the land was all right enough in the first place its trying to get rid of it thats the sticker  you are talking in riddles phil said roger morr wont you explain  maybe phil doesnt care to explain broke in dave porter quickly it may be his fathers private business you know  oh i dont think hell object to my telling you the details responded the shipowners son it isnt very much of a secret where we live or in east haven  east haven is that the place across the river from where you live queried dave porter  yes its quite a bustling little town too although when my father and his older brother lester lawrence bought the tract of land there it didnt amount to much and they got the ground for a song  id like to buy some land for a song put in another youth of the group then i might sell it and make a handsome profit say he continued his face brightening up that puts me in mind of a story once there was a man who wanted to  hold on shadow it isnt your turn to tell stories now interrupted dave we want to hear what phil has to say  this story wouldnt take but a minute grumbled maurice hamilton otherwise known as shadow its a dandy one too  all right well listen to it later returned roger morr let us first hear what phil has to tell  it isnt so much of a story said the shipowners son you see years ago my dad and his older brother purchased a tract of land at east haven along the waterfront for some time it was idle and then it was leased to a lumber company who used it for a number of years as a lumber yard at that time east haven had no railroad but the l a  h line came through that way and wanted to cross the river at east haven and wanted to locate their railroad repair shops along the waterfront there they have made my father an offer for the land and if that tract could be sold my folks would stand to make a profit of twenty to thirty thousand dollars  well why not sell the land thenunless you think it is worth more than the railroad company is willing to pay asked dave  my father is willing enough to sell and has been for some time but he cant give the railroad a clear title and consequently the deal is at a standstill  oh i see phil said roger morr that is the worst of buying land that has a flaw in the title  there wasnt any flaw in the title when my father and my uncle lester purchased the ground returned the shipowners son and now his face clouded the trouble has all come up within the last five yearsthat is it wouldnt have come up at all if it hadnt been for what happened about five years ago  oh i think i know to what you refer phil cried dave quickly i remember now that you told me about your old uncle lester didnt you ever hear from him  not a word dave and that is why my father cant sell the land  i dont understand this said ben basswood  and neither do i added shadow hamilton  well its this way about five years ago my folks were connected with a trust company in the town where we live my uncle lester was one of several men who had charge of certain funds and these funds were kept in a safedeposit vault belonging to the company one day it was found that some of these funds had disappeared suspicion pointed to my uncle and although he protested his entire innocence some of the other trust company officials were in favor of having him arrested a warrant was sworn out but before it could be served my uncle left home and went to another state then the local paper came out with an article which stated that the bank officials had evidence that lester lawrence was undoubtedly guilty my uncle got a copy of this paperit was found later in the room he had occupied at a hoteland this evidently frightened him so much that he disappeared  do you mean to say that he disappeared for good queried ben  yes he took a train out of town and that was the last seen or heard of him my father did all he could to locate uncle lester he had men searching for him and he advertised in the newspapers but up to the present time he hasnt heard a word from him or of him he is half inclined to believe that my uncle is dead  perhaps he went to some foreign country suggested dave  but how does that affect the title to the land questioned shadow hamilton  easily enough was the reply of the shipowners son my uncle held a onequarter interest in the tract in order to give a clear title to the railroad company it would be necessary for uncle lester to sign the deed the railroad companynor any one else for that matterwont buy the land without a clear title  i dont wonder that your father is worried said dave sympathetically i suppose he feels just as bad over the continued absence of your uncle as he does over the fact that he cant sell the land and make a profit on it  thats just it dave answered phil wed give a good deal to know what has become of uncle lester  i suppose he doesnt dare come back for fear of being arrested was shadows comment even if he is innocent they may be able to convict him  oh i forgot to tell you about that burst out phil less than four months after my uncle disappeared some men were arrested in springfield for a theft committed at one of the banks there during the trial it came out that one of these criminals had been in our town during the time when the funds disappeared from our trust company this rascals movements were traced by the authorities and then he was given what they call the third degree at that examination he broke down and admitted that he had taken the funds which my uncle lester was supposed to have stolen the affair created a great stir and those who had proceeded against my uncle made all sorts of apologies to my father they also did their best to locate uncle lester  and didnt they hear anything at all asked ben  not a word we got what we thought were clues but every one of them proved false  maybe he is dead  that may be but if we cant prove it it leaves the matter of the land just as unsettled as before  if your uncle is alive he must remember about the land and must know that the matter will give your father a lot of trouble suggested roger  that is true roger but when a man is accused of a grave crime like that he isnt apt to think about other things  you say he is older than your father queried dave  oh yes a good deal olderten or twelve years at least if he is still alive he must be well advanced in years  what does your father propose to do about the land questioned ben after a pause in the conversation  he doesnt know what to do hes at a complete standstill  wont the railroad company lease the land questioned dave  no they told dad that they wanted to buy and build they prefer his land to any other in east haven but at the same time if they cant get his property they are going to look elsewhere  twenty or thirty thousand dollars is a heap of money to let slip through ones fingers was shadows comment its a shame you cant find out where your uncle is or what has become of him  why not advertise again suggested dave if your uncle is still alive he must read some newspapers and he might possibly see the notice  father thinks something of doing that dave but it looks like rather a hopeless case returned phil lawrence he arose from the campchair on which he had been sitting and stretched himself but come on fellows he continued there is no use of your worrying over our troubles we came on this little trip to enjoy ourselves and i want all of you to have the best time possible  and we certainly have had a good time cried dave just as good a time as we had out in yellowstone park  that is dave considering the girls are not along remarked ben with a wink at the others  well of course that makes some difference ben returned dave his face flushing a trifle  sure it does a whole lot of difference declared roger just the same we are having a dandy time phil he added hastily the first outing of the oak hall club is a big success  it sure is broke in shadow hamilton only i did hope wed see a whale or some sharks or something like that he added regretfully  i suppose if you saw a shark shadow youd jump right overboard to interview him wouldnt you queried ben and gave a snicker  say speaking of sharks puts me in mind of a story cried shadow once there was a sailor who had traveled all around the world he met a lady in boston who wanted him to tell her a shark story says the sailor madam ive seen sharks in the atlantic an the pacific an the indian oceans but all of them sharks wasnt a patch to the shark i once met on land on land cried the lady from boston do you mean to say that you met a shark on land i did madam answered the sailor i met a shark right in new york and he did me out of every copper i had in my pockets he was a hotelkeeper who played cards and at this little yarn there was a general smile  pretty good for a fish story was rogers comment just the same i dont want to fall in with any sharks whether on land or at sea  before we land tonight i want to settle about this outing we expect to take at mirror lake said dave if you fellows are going along well have to make the necessary arrangements  well you can count on me dave returned roger promptly i told you at the start that id be glad to go with you  and so will i be glad to go added phil  ive got to find out what my folks want me to do first said shadow he looked curiously at dave who was gazing far out to sea what are you looking at dave he asked  im watching that smoke out there was the answer  thats only the smoke from some incoming steamer returned ben i noticed that a few minutes ago  maybe it is from a steamer returned dave but i dont think it is coming from any funnel  what do you think it isa fire cried phil and at these words all the boys on the deck rushed to the rail  it looks that way to me let us get the glasses and find out  ill get them cried roger and lost no time in disappearing into the cabin  a minute later he reappeared with a pair of powerful marine glasses which he handed to phil the glasses were quickly adjusted and the shipowners son took a hasty look seaward  its a small steamer all right he announced just as sure as youre born theres a fire on board  fire repeated roger  if shes on fire we ought to go to the rescue exclaimed dave     chapter ii  something about the past   whats this i hear about fire  the question came from a burly pleasantfaced man who had just appeared on deck close to the boys it was mr lawrence the owner of the steamer  why dad theres a steamer out there and we think shes on fire answered phil quickly here take a look at her and he handed over the marine glasses  on fire exclaimed mr lawrence and raised the glasses to his eyes by jove boys i think youre right phil call captain bradley and be quick about it youll find him in the after cabin i just left him there  the son darted off and while he was gone mr lawrence and the boys took turns in looking through the glasses at the distant vessel the smoke was now increasing and as it did not come from the funnel of the steamer there was no doubt but that the vessel was on fire  you sent for me mr lawrence inquired the captain of the steamer as he hurried up with phil at his heels  yes captain theres another steamer out there and we are pretty sure shes on fire answered mr lawrence change your course and put on speed and as he spoke the shipowner turned the glasses over to the captain  captain bradley gave one searching look its true shes on fire and we had better get to her as soon as possible he cried and then hurried away to give the necessary directions soon the bow of the eaglet which was the name of the steamer was headed in the direction of the craft that seemed to be in trouble  if shes really in danger i hope we get there soon enough to help those on board said dave  captain bradley will do his best you can rely on that answered mr lawrence gravely but that steamer is farther off than some of you may imagine distances over the water are rather deceptive  many of my young readers are doubtless already well acquainted with dave porter for the benefit of those who are now meeting the youth for the first time something of an introduction may not be out of place  when but a child of tender age our hero had been found one day walking along the railroad tracks near the town of crumville he could tell nothing about himself or where he belonged and was taken to the local poorhouse where he remained for a number of years finally being bound out to a retired college professor named caspar potts who was then running a small farm for his health the professor did what he could for the lad giving him a fairly good education but professor potts was no farmer and soon got into financial difficulties with a mean moneylender named aaron poole and would have lost his farm had it not been for something out of the ordinary happening  one of the main industries of crumville was a large jewelry factory owned by mr oliver wadsworth mr wadsworth had a beautiful young daughter named jessie and one day through an explosion of an automobile gasoline tank the young miss was in danger of being burned to death when dave came to her rescue this so pleased the wadsworths that they came not only to the aid of the boy but also assisted caspar potts who was discovered to be one of mr wadsworths former instructors at college  the lad shall go to boardingschool and get a good education said oliver wadsworth and he accordingly sent dave away from home as related in the first book of this series entitled dave porter at oak hall at that school our hero made many warm friends including phil lawrence the son of a wealthy shipowner roger morr the offspring of a united states senator shadow hamilton who was known far and wide for his yarnspinning qualities and many others  in those days the great cloud resting over dave had been the question of his identity and when some of his enemies spoke of him as that poorhouse nobody he resolved to find out who he really was getting a strange clue he set out on a remarkable ocean voyage as related in dave porter in the south seas and was gratified to fall in with his uncle dunston porter a great hunter and traveler then the lad came back to oak hall as related in dave porters return to school he next went in quest of his father as told in dave porter in the far north  now they cant say that im a poorhouse nobody he told his chums after having met his father and then with a light heart he came back to boardingschool once again as related in dave porter and his classmates here he made more friends than ever but likewise some bitter enemies including one link merwell the son of a ranchowner of the west merwell did all he could to cause dave trouble but in the end was exposed and had to leave oak hall  i hope i never fall in with link merwell again dave said to his school chums but this was not to be dave had not only found his father and an uncle but he had also found a sister laura porter who was very dear to him laura had a young lady friend named belle endicott who lived in the far west and through this friend dave and his chums and also laura as well as jessie wadsworth received an invitation to spend some time at the endicott place they had a great deal of fun and not a few adventures all of which have been set down in dave porter at star ranch not far from the endicott place was the home of link merwell and that young man as before tried to make trouble but his efforts were frustrated and he left home under a cloud  from the ranch dave and his chums returned again to oak hall as recorded in dave porter and his rivals then came the christmas holidays and dave went back to crumville where he and his folks were now living with the wadsworth family in their elegant mansion on the outskirts of the town directly after christmas there was a thrilling jewelry robbery at mr wadsworths factory it was dave aided by some of his chums who got on the track of the robbers and trailed them to the south and then to sea as related in dave porter on cave island  when our hero and his chums went back to oak hall they imagined that their adventures were at an end but soon came in news of a strange man who was terrorizing the neighborhood some very unusual things happened including an attempt to blow up a neighboring hotel some of the students were thought guilty and fearing arrest they fled in terror as told of in dave porter and the runaways dave was not one of those who ran away but he did go after the others and made them come back to face the music and also helped to clear up what had been a great mystery then all the boys graduated from oak hall dave receiving high honors  it is needless to say that our hero at that time was one of the happiest boys in the world his folks and jessie wadsworth came to the graduation which was celebrated with big bonfires music by a band and refreshments in the gymnasium  dave had promised roger morr that he would pay the senators son a visit he did so along with phil and some others and on that occasion heard about a gold mine which had been willed to mrs morr and which had been completely swallowed up by a landslide numerous searches had been made for this lost mine but up to that time without result  let us go in search of the lost mine dave had said and how he and roger and some of the others made the trip to the west and went on a hunt for the mine has been told in detail in the volume entitled dave porter in the gold fields  while the lads were on this quest they again fell in with link merwell who with job haskers a former teacher at oak hall was also trying to locate the lost mine the two parties had many adventures and when at last the missing mine was relocated there came another landslide which nearly cost dave and his friends their lives when they finally reached a place of safety they were joined by a man from the other party who had suffered severely and who told them that link merwell and job haskers as well as a third person of the party had been swept away to their death later on dave and his friends had looked for the missing persons but had been unable to locate them  the finding of the landslide mine as it was called had been of great financial benefit to the morr family and they had been so pleased that they had given dave and some of the others a share in the holding in the meanwhile our hero and his chums along with their friends had finished their outing in the west by a grand tour through yellowstone park on which they were accompanied by daves sister jessie and belle and some others  now you fellows have got to come on a little trip with me phil had said after coming east and had explained that a small steamer belonging to his father was then tied up at philadelphia getting ready for a trip to portland maine and back  that will be fine dave had answered and a little later a party had been made up including phil dave roger and shadow and also ben basswood who as my old readers know was one of daves old friends from crumville with the boys went mr lawrence when embarking on this trip none of those on board had dreamed of the strenuous time now so close at hand  i wonder how long it will take us to reach that vessel observed roger after mr lawrence had followed the captain  a quarter of an hour at least replied dave it will depend somewhat on how much steam the firemen can get up i dont believe we are running at full speed now  this steamer used to be a pretty good boat said phil but she is getting old now and i heard dad say something about laying her up for repairs next fall  wonder if well get a chance to do any rescue work observed ben  i guess well do all we can returned shadow  look look cried dave pointing with his hand the smoke is getting thicker than ever  maybe the poor people on that steamer will have to jump overboard before we can reach them said phil a fire like that must be pretty hot  soon the youths knew by the pounding of the engine that the eaglet was running at increased speed the course had been changed and now the craft was headed directly for the burning boat  shes a rather small affair thats certain remarked roger  looks to me as if she might be a pleasure boat remarked phil who taking after his father knew considerable about seagoing matters shes a private steam yacht to my way of thinking and later on this proved to be the case  as the eaglet drew closer to the burning vessel the boys saw that there was great excitement on board the steam yacht sailors and others were rushing to and fro over the deck and two streams of water from hoses were being directed to one part of the vessel down a hatchway the smoke was as thick as ever and sometimes as the wind shifted the steam yacht was hidden entirely from view  fortunately the sea was comparatively calm there being only a slight breeze from the northeast as the eaglet drew closer the boys heard captain bradley giving directions to some of the sailors to get ready to launch two of the small boats  dad why cant we take another small boat and go out asked phil of his father we know how to row we did lots of it on the river up at oak hall  very well answered mr lawrence but i want all of you to keep out of danger  soon they were within hailing distance of the steam yacht they could now see the persons on deck plainly and made out fully a score of men and three or four women and also one or two children the smoke was as thick as ever but so far no flames were visible  save us oh save us screamed some one aboard the burning vessel we are burning up  the words had scarcely been uttered when there came from the interior of the steam yacht a dull explosion then of a sudden something that looked like a bunch of rockets flew up into the air with a loud hissing and with sparks flying in all directions the bunch of rockets described a graceful curve and then headed directly for the deck of the eaglet     chapter iii  the rescue at sea   look out there  dont let those rockets hit you  say this is like a fourth of july  such were some of the cries that came from the boys on the forward deck of the steamer when they saw the bunch of rockets flying swiftly toward them they had barely time to leap to one side when with a loud hissing two of the rockets fell on the deck not far away the others just grazed the rail and swept overboard  weve got to put them out yelled phil and started to rush forward intending to stamp on the rockets when dave hauled him back  look out phil they may be on the point of explo  bang bang dave did not have time to finish what he was saying when the rockets went off in rapid succession hurling the bits of fire in all directions phil was burnt a little on one cheek and dave and roger each had a hand scorched but that was all then realizing that the worst was over all the boys rushed forward and stamped out what was left of the flames  anybody hurt up there it was a cry from captain bradley who came forward on a run followed by mr lawrence  no were all right gasped phil but we might not be if it hadnt been for dave and he gave our hero a grateful look  the explosion on the steam yacht had caused a wilder panic than ever and in a twinkling a number of those on board leaped into the water  man the boats was the order from captain bradley  the eaglet had already heaved to and two rowboats manned by the sailors and commanded by the first mate and a boatswain were soon lowered to the water while this was being done the boys led by phil and dave rushed to a third rowboat  now be careful boys warned mr lawrence perhaps i had better go with you  just as you say dad answered phil we can take care of ourselves though  all right then i wont go for you may want the room for those you pick up answered the shipowner and a moment later the rowboat was in the water and following the other small craft to the side of the burning vessel  seeing those from the eaglet coming to the rescue several others leaped overboard so that those in the rowboats had all they could do to move without hitting any one  save me save me dont let me drown yelled an elderly man and caught hold of one of the oars  all right well save you take it easy returned the first mate of the eaglet and soon those in the mates rowboat had the man on board in the meantime the boat in command of the boatswain pulled in a woman and a little boy  dave and his chums had their craft headed to where they had made out the forms of a woman and a girl struggling in the water they soon reached the first of the pair and after considerable difficulty managed to drag her on board  oh thank you thank you gasped the woman as she sank down on the stern seat now save della save della she cried and then suddenly collapsed  dave had his eyes on the girl and was on the point of reaching for her when she suddenly threw up her arms and disappeared  shes gone under gasped roger  will she come up again asked shadow anxiously  there she is over there yelled phil and pointed to a spot several yards away  a hand and an arm had shown themselves but that was all in less than two seconds they disappeared again  dave had done some rapid thinking before leaving the steamer the boys had thrown off their coats now standing up dave cast his cap to the bottom of the boat and made a quick dive overboard  hes gone after her  good for dave its the only thing to do if that girl is to be saved  row on and keep your eyes wide open directed phil i dont think theyll get very far away  dave had calculated the distance as closely as possible and once under water he pushed ahead with all speed in the direction where he had seen the hand and arm while at oak hall he had learned the trick of swimming under water with his eyes open and this now stood him in good stead  there she is he thought as he caught sight of something white passing just to the left of him he made a quick turn and a few seconds later had the girl by the hand then dave caught her under the arms and treading water brought both her and himself to the surface  there they are he heard phil cry and the next moment the rowboat came up close  oh oh sasasave mme spluttered the girl and breaking loose she swung around and caught dave tightly by the neck  illustration dave caught her under the arms and treading water brought both her and himself to the surfacepage 24  it was the stranglehold of a drowning person and our hero might have fared badly had not assistance been at hand but as it was roger and phil reached out and while shadow and ben balanced the rowboat this pair hauled the girl on board then they aided dave in getting in  oh oh is shshe ddead gasped the girl as she looked at the woman who had collapsed on the stern seat  no she has only fainted answered roger shell soon be over it  how brave you are to come to our rescue went on the girl turning to dave ii thought i was going to drown and she shuddered  it was a pretty close call answered phil my friend here jumped overboard just in the nick of time  there was just then little time to say more for others were in the water crying for assistance in the meantime there was another cry from the deck of the steam yacht  dont jump overboard it isnt necessary the fire is out  hello did you hear that queried dave somebody said the fire is out  by this time the two other rowboats had picked up eight of those who had leaped overboard the boys succeeded in getting on board two others a short fat man who was puffing like a porpoise and a young man  that settles it snorted the fat man as he sank down on one of the seats no more ocean pictures for me all the dramas i act in after this will be on dry land  and i shant go to sea again for mr appleby answered the girl who had been rescued she was rapidly recovering and so was the woman on the stern seat  got everybody yelled a man from the deck of the steam yacht and by his cap and uniform the boys knew he must be the captain of the vessel  i think so answered the first mate of the eaglet  it was foolish of them to jump overboard grumbled the captain of the steam yacht i told all of them there was no danger  no danger snorted the mate of the eaglet how do you make that out with all that fire  it wasnt firethat is not much of it was the answer it was mostly smoke we have a moving picture company on board and they had a lot of fireworks some of em tied up in old sail cloth the fireworks started to go offwhy i dont knowand they set fire to the cloth and when we wet that down it made an awful smoke but all the stuff was in a zinclined compartment so there wasnt much real danger the worst was when those rockets went off and shot up right out of the hatchway  and are you sure the fire is entirely out asked the mate of mr lawrences vessel  just about well have the men make a search so that there wont be any further danger  after a little more conversation the three rowboats were brought close to the steam yacht from the side of which a ladder had been lowered  o dear are we to go back to that boat queried the girl dave had saved from drowning  she was a miss of perhaps eighteen years tall and slender with brown hair and big brown eyes she appealed to our hero as she spoke  i dont see what else there is to do he answered unless you want to be taken to our steamer  what place is your steamer bound for  we hope to make portland some time this afternoon  oh indeed then i think i would rather go aboard that steamer than back on the yacht answered the young lady what do you think aunt bess she went on appealing to the woman in the rowboat who by this time had recovered from her plunge into the sea  i think i would like to get ashore as soon as possible della returned the aunt i just hate the water anyway and i dont think ill take another sea trip in a hurry  oh say miss ford you might as well go back on the steam yacht i guess the danger is all over put in the fourth person who had been picked upa young man about daves age didnt you hear the captain say that the fire was out  yes i know answered della ford but im so afraid mr porton and the girl looked rather helplessly at those around her  where is that steam yacht bound for questioned phil  we were going somewhere outside of cape cod answered the stout man who had been rescued but i guess mr appleby will have to give the trip up for the present hes the manager of our company you know he added by way of explanation  what sort of a company is thata theatrical company asked shadow  oh no this is a movingpicture companyone belonging to the appleby film corporation  oh then you are all movingpicture actors cried ben with interest  yes answered the young man but we didnt come out to get into any such scene as this he added with a short laugh  by this time a number of those in the rowboats had been assisted to the deck of the steam yacht and those above were calling down to those in the rowboat manned by dave and his chums  say young men im very much obliged to you for what you did for me cried the stout man heartily as he prepared to ascend the ladder i guess i was foolish to jump overboard when there was no great danger  its too bad case didnt get a picture of that scene said the young man named porton it would have been a dandy to work into one of the sea dramas  i guess thats right returned dave with a grim smile  much obliged to all of you went on ward porton if there are any charges send the bill to mr thomas appleby the manager he ought to reward you handsomely for saving a part of his company and with these words he followed the stout man to the deck of the steam yacht  arent you folks coming up came a call from the manager of the movingpicture company as he leaned over the rail  oh mr appleby i dont want to stay out here cried della ford and neither does my aunt bess the young men here say their boat is going to portland maybe we had better go there and take the train to boston  oh there is no use in doing that miss ford answered the manager the fire is out and it is perfectly safe on board now you had better come up here i will help you and he reached down with his hand  i dont suppose it will be just the right thing to do to desert the company said mrs ford the girls aunt we still have to act in several scenes on the ship you must remember  very well aunty just as you say returned the girl but oh i must thank this young man for what he did for me she went on and at the danger of causing the rowboat to tip she bent over and caught daves hand in both of her own wont you please tell me your name  its dave porter was the answer come let me help you up the ladder  my name is della ford and i belong in boston you are a very brave young man and i shall never forget you some time when you are in boston you must come to see me  thank you miss ford perhaps i will answered dave and after a word or two more he assisted the young lady up the ladder then the boys helped mrs ford who was still so weak that she could hardly stand  the first mate of the eaglet was on the deck of the steam yacht talking to the captain in the meantime several sailors were at work putting out the last sparks of the fire quite a quantity of fireworks had gone off and the burnt portions were thrown overboard the movingpicture manager explained that the fireworks had been brought along to be used in one of the film dramas  might as well get back to the steamer suggested roger after several minutes had passed during which time the boys had been calling to those on the deck of the steam yacht we cant do anything more here  all right returned phil and gave orders to pull away  goodbye mr porter called out della ford waving her hand thank you ever so much for what you did and dont forget to call and see me when you come to boston  goodbye returned dave and a moment later the rowboat shot out of hearing and was headed toward the eaglet     chapter iv  back to crumville   i think those on board that steam yacht can congratulate themselves because the fire was no worse remarked roger when the boys had returned to the eaglet  yes indeed answered dave some fires at sea are terrible things and cause a great loss of life  seems to me dave was the hero of the occasion burst out ben he did the reallyandtruly rescue act  come now dont start anything like that interrupted dave hastily i only did what any of you might have done  i know one thing remarked phil closing one eye suggestively dave made some hit with the young lady he pulled out of the water  thats right agreed shadow why do you know i thought miss ford was going to throw her arms right around his neck  oh cut it cut it said dave growing red in the face shadow your imagination will be the death of you  oh i dont know replied the former storyteller of oak hall coolly she certainly was smitten dave  not at all she was grateful thats all  just the same dave if we get to boston youll have to call on her remarked roger with a grin  we can all call if you feel that way about it answered our hero i rather think some of you were smitten pretty badly and at this sally there was a general laugh  it was some time before the last of the rowboats returned to the steamer the first mate brought a report to captain bradley and mr lawrence to which the boys listened with interest the mate said that it was thought on board the steam yacht that the fire had started from a cigarette thrown away by one of the movingpicture actors a young man named ward porton but that this could not be proved the mate stated that the captain of the steam yacht was quite upset over the occurrence as he considered that the fire was due to carelessness and nothing else he had told the mate privately that it would be a long time before he would take out another movingpicture company on his vessel  he says they are doing all sorts of stunts on the ship and taking pictures of em went on the mate he says some of the actors and actresses are pretty good people but the rest of the bunch act like wild indians  ward porton exclaimed dave turning to his chums why that is the young fellow we hauled out of the water  thats right returned phil maybe he got scared when he found out that his cigarette had started the fire and that was one reason why he jumped overboard  i didnt like the manner of that fellow at all was shadows comment he looked like a pretty loose sort of a character  well i dont know i thought he looked like began ben and then stopped suddenly in some confusion  looked like what ben asked dave curiously  oh it doesnt matter dave answered his crumville chum just the same i cant help but think thatoh well never mind let it go  but what did you think he looked like ben put in phil come what are you so mysterious about  oh it doesnt matter i tell you answered ben and now looked more confused than ever  hello ben is trying to hide some deep and dark mystery put in shadow come now little boy unlimber your mind and let us know what it is  well if youve got to know ill tell you i was thinking that in some way that ward porton looked something like dave  say thats right burst out phil and then added quickly to our hero no offense old man but he did resemble youonly of course he was not so goodlooking  yes there was some resemblance said roger but i dont think it was enough to count so dave neednt worry  i guess mr ward porton has a perfect right to his looks remarked dave calmly and if he and i resemble each other that is nobodys fault i dont suppose ill ever see that fellow again but in this surmise our hero was very much mistaken in the weeks to come he was to see a great deal of ward porton  it was not long after this when the eaglet resumed her run for portland as the other vessel was headed in the opposite direction they soon passed out of sight of the craft then portland light came into view and before long the eaglet was passing the numerous islands of casco bay  this would be a dandy place to pass the rest of the summer was rogers comment as he and dave stood by the rail watching the beautiful scene as it was unfolded before them the bay was very calm and the numerous islands dotting it in all directions made the spot one of unsurpassed beauty  from all accounts roger i think well find the vicinity of mirror lake just as beautiful as this answered dave i have never been there but they tell me the scenery is simply grand  we certainly ought to have a good time scenery or no scenery answered the senators son with such a fine bunch of people as are going  right you are broke in phil we ought to have the best times ever at the lake  it had been arranged by mr lawrence that they should stop for three days at portland the owner of the steamer having a number of business matters to transact during that time the boys continued to sleep on board but spent the days in visiting old orchard beach cape elizabeth peaks island orrs island and various other nearby resorts  it certainly is a great place remarked dave on the evening of the second day i think a fellow could spend his whole summer here and have a dandy time  it had been a question whether they would stop at boston on the return trip but at the last minute mr lawrence decided to go direct to new york city as he had been informed that a cargo was waiting there for the steamer  that cuts dave out of his visit to miss ford remarked roger after this announcement was made  i think it cuts you out just as much as it does me roger returned our hero with a smile i think behind it all you would like firstrate to call on her  ill tell you what i would like answered the senators son id like to see how they take moving picturesi mean the kind indoors  we may get a chance at that some day said phil i know one or two men who are in that business  the run to new york city occurred without special incident and soon the boys found themselves saying goodbye to mr lawrence and captain bradley it had been decided that phil should accompany dave and ben to crumville he to remain with our hero at the wadsworth mansion  take care of my boy said the shipowner as he shook hands with dave  oh well take care of him mr lawrence dont fear answered our hero and then leaving mr lawrence to look after matters concerning his various vessels the boys hurried to the grand central terminal and were soon on a train which was to take them to their various destinations  as my old readers know crumville was rather a small town the only industry of importance being mr wadsworths jewelry works the wadsworth mansion stood on the outskirts a large and wellconstructed building set among a number of trees and bushes when dave phil and ben alighted at the railroad depot they found the wadsworth touringcar awaiting them dunston porter daves uncle was driving the car and he had with him daves sister laura and jessie wadsworth  oh here they are cried laura and leaped out to embrace her brother and to shake hands with the others then jessie shook hands giving dave an extra bright smile as she did so  back from the salt salt sea cried laura merrily ill wager you were all dreadfully seasick  nothing doing on that score laura answered her brother we didnt have time to get seasick we had too much fun  and too many adventures added phil oh i can tell you girls we are heroes and he stuck his thumbs in the armholes of his vest and began to strut around  adventures eh queried dunston porter what sort of adventuresa shipwreck  oh mr porter please dont talk about a shipwreck pleaded jessie agitatedly why you dont want anybody to be drowned do you  they dont look very much as if they had been in a shipwreck responded daves uncle dryly i was only fooling  we werent in any shipwreck but we saw a fire at sea and we helped to pull some folks out of the water said ben  you did burst from both of the girls  do tell us all about it added laura  was anybody lost asked jessie and now even dunston porter looked much interested  nobody was lost and not even hurt so far as i could find out answered dave and then he and the others gave a few details concerning the conflagration aboard the steam yacht  and to think those poor people had to jump overboard came from jessie sympathetically oh dave wasnt that dreadful  jessie you ought to have seen dave playing the reallyandtruly hero act burst out ben  now ben quit it interrupted dave  not much dave you deserve some credit and i want the girls to know what a real genuine dyedinthewool hero you are  what did he do ben asked laura  he jumped into the briny deep and rescued the beautiful heroine of the movingpicture company was the answer oh you just ought to have seen it jessie the poor girl was going down for the last time when dave with a doordie look on his handsome face leaped into the flying spume and struck out boldly  ben will you please stop pleaded dave i never heard such foolish talk before in my life  but he did jump overboard and he did save the girl broke in phil if he hadnt gone after her she might have drowned  who was she asked laura while jessie wideeyed showed her interest  the leading lady of the film companya miss della ford answered the shipowners son a mighty nice young lady tooreal stylishgoldenbrown hair dreamy brown eyes and all that sort of thing you know  oh dave that was splendid of you to save her from drowning said jessie  indeed it was added ben and she was mighty grateful too he went on she grabbed daves hands for all she was worth and at one time i thought she was going to throw her arms right around his neck  oh ben  well it seemed that way to me anywayand she was a stunning looking girl too i can tell you  she was not going to do anything of the kind jessie dont pay any attention to him broke in dave and now his face was decidedly red come on lets get into the auto and get to the house im hungry and he started to help the two girls into the tonneau of the automobile  well have to hear more of this later on said dunston porter as he started the car  yes id like to hear more about miss ford added jessie in a somewhat uncertain tone     chapter v  dave at home   mirror lake was a beautiful sheet of water nestling among the mountains of the upper adirondacks of new york state at the lower end of the lake where there was a welldefined trail running to several fashionable summer resorts some miles away were located two beautiful bungalows one of six rooms and the other of eight rooms they were built on a plot of ground bordering on a small cove of the lake and extending about a thousand feet back into the woods of the mountainside  as my old readers will remember ben basswoods father was interested in real estate and a year or two before he and mr wadsworth had gone into a land deal of considerable proportions several important transactions had resulted and in making one of the deals mr wadsworth and mr basswood had become possessed of the two bungalows on mirror lake the two gentlemen owning both jointly  at first on acquiring the property the jewelry manufacturer had been in favor of selling it at public auction but to this mr basswood had demurred  i think mr wadsworth he had said if we hold that property for a few years it will be far more valuable than it is now the state road has been built to within a few miles and there is strong talk of its being carried directly past mirror lake not only that there is also talk of the railroad putting in a spur through that district and of course that will help a great deal  very well mr basswood if you think we ought to hold the land well do it had been mr wadsworths reply but what are we going to do with the bungalows in the meantime  we can either use them or rent them had been the answer  for the past season and also during the early part of the present summer the two bungalows had been leased to some people from rochester but now both bungalows were unoccupied  it had been dunston porters suggestion that they go up to mirror lake on the return from the trip to yellowstone park and this idea had been quickly seconded by the young folks especially by laura and jessie who had never as yet spent any time in the adirondacks  they tell me the mountains are lovely especially during the autumn said the daughter of the jewelry manufacturer oh let us go by all means  i am sure i would like it laura had answered but who will go with us  the matter had been talked over while the young folks were returning from yellowstone park and also while dave and ben were at home as well as during the voyage on the eaglet as a result it had been arranged that mr and mrs basswood were to go up for part of the time and also mr and mrs wadsworth laura and jessie as well as belle endicott who was coming east were to go along with dave and ben and a number of their chums mr dunston porter and daves father said they would make several trips back and forth during the time the others were up there it may be said here that the bungalows were fully furnished so our friends had no anxiety on that score  well have the best time ever jessie said dave in talking the matter over the day after his arrival home i am sure you will like it  have you your things packed dave questioned his sister who was present you dont want to leave that until the last minute  oh packing is getting easy to me laura i feel like a regular traveler since i took those trips to cave island and after the runaways and to the landslide mine and yellowstone park  oh it was splendid the way you relocated that gold mine dave cried jessie how glad roger and his folks must have been  they surely were glad answered the youth i never saw roger look so happy in my life it took a big weight off his shoulders  and just to think that they are going to give you and phil an interest in that mine remarked laura why dave if you keep on youll be a rich man some day  well i shant complain if i am answered the brother coolly  it had been arranged that the start for mirror lake should be made on the following monday morning some of the folks were to go as far as they could by train but the young people had demurred stating that they wanted if possible to make the trip by automobile  we can take our machine and the basswood car said dave it wont take us more than two or three days and it will be lots of fun  but what are we going to do with the automobiles after we reach carpen falls asked dunston porter you cant go any farther in an auto than that  isnt there some sort of garage at carpen falls questioned ben who was present  probably there is anyway i know there is a livery stable there  then we could leave the machines there until we were ready to bring them back replied dave  well see about this later said daves father with a shake of his head automobiling did not appeal to him quite as strongly as it did to his son and his brother  it was a beautiful afternoon and dave and ben had arranged for a little run in the automobile taking laura and jessie along dave ran the car with jessie on the seat beside him their course was out of crumville and then over the distant hills to a winding road which ran beside the river  it seems so strange dave to think you are not going back to oak hall this fall remarked jessie when the automobile was bowling along over the smooth highway  it does seem strange was daves somewhat grave reply do you know sometimes i wish i were going back again  why  well if i had to do that i wouldnt have to bother about anything else just now jessie as it is ive got to make up my mind what i am going to do one minute i think i want to go to college and the next i have a notion of going into some sort of business  what does your father say dave  he is leaving it entirely to me he says if i want to go to college i can do so  what would you like to do best of all  oh as for that id like to travel just as uncle dunston does id like to see the world  i suppose that would be nice dave but still a person cant be traveling all the time and jessies face clouded a trifle  i shouldnt want to be traveling all the time jessie some day ill want to settle down he gave her an earnest look i thought that was all settled  settled what and the girl gave him a quick look in return  why that i was going to settle down some day and that you were going to settle down with me  oh indeed thats the first i ever heard of it  oh but you know jessie  dave do you know that laura and ben are sitting right behind us  yes but they are busy with their own talk  maybe you only think so  all right but its settled isnt it jessie  i dont know that anything is settled jessie was gazing straight ahead at the road how about that beautiful young lady you rescued from drowning  oh say please dont bring that up pleaded dave hastily that was all some of bens nonsense  but you did pull her out of the water didnt you dave  what if i did you wouldnt have me let her drown would you  oh of course not but still ben said  oh there you go again didnt i tell you that was only some of bens nonsense you mustnt believe a word he says  indeed i always thought ben was a very truthful boy  oh well if youre going to make a mountain out of a molehill  i havent made a mountain out of anything dave  say whos talking about mountains on the front seat interrupted ben i thought we were going down on the river road  so we are declared dave somewhat sharply  i hope we can go up to the adirondacks in the autos said laura eagerly it will surely make a splendid trip  if we go in the autos who is going to drive questioned jessie  ill run our car and i suppose dave will run this one answered ben but we can change off with the other fellows if we want to  the top of a small hill had been reached and now the automobile glided down the other side in the direction of the river road here the way narrowed a trifle and dave had to give all his attention to the running of the car as the automobile turned in toward the stream they passed several other touringcars and then came in sight of a horse attached to a buggy the two wheels of which were deep in a ditch  hello thats mr aaron pooles buggy exclaimed dave  yes but it is nat who is driving returned ben  mr aaron poole was a rich moneylender who lived not far from crumville and who had a son nat who had gone to oak hall with dave and ben mr poole was a very grasping man and in the past he and the porters had had a number of differences nat had been almost as overbearing as his father but during the early part of the summer he had told dave that he was going to turn over a new leaf and since that time our hero had heard that the moneylenders son was quite a different sort of a boy and growing better every day  hello nat whats the trouble questioned dave as he brought the automobile to a standstill beside the buggy  trouble enough grumbled the moneylenders son did you notice those automobiles that just went by  i certainly did they were going at some speed  they were racing thats what they were doing explained nat poole they were racing and they made such a racket that it scared my horse and he landed me here in this ditch  its a good thing they didnt upset you nat said ben  if they upset me i would make them pay for the damages retorted the youth in the buggy  did you know them nat asked laura kindly  i know one of them hes a highflyer from pittstown the next time i see him ill give him a piece of my mind theyve got no right to use this road for a racetrack  did they hurt you at all queried jessie  i dont know as they did but this mud in the ditch is mighty sticky and i dont see how i am going to get out of it grumbled the moneylenders son  maybe we can give you a lift nat said dave and got out of the automobile followed by ben here ill hold the horse while you get out  be careful hes mighty skittish warned the other if he gets to kicking hell smash the buggy into kindlingwood  im not afraid of him answered dave and took a firm hold on the horses bridle then nat leaped from the buggy and he and ben took hold of the wheels and pushed while dave led the horse forward by this means in a minute more the turnout was safe in the middle of the roadway  much obliged to you fellows for this remarked the moneylenders son when all danger seemed past  dont mention it nat i am glad to help you returned dave quickly  and so am i added ben  funny thing went on the moneylenders son i was coming around to your house to see you and he glanced quickly at our hero  well youll have to come nat some time when i am home answered dave we are going off on another trip next monday  is that so then im glad i met you as i did because i wanted to see you before you went away ive got some strange news to tell you  what is it  link merwell is alive he wasnt killed in that landslide at all was nat pooles astonishing reply     chapter vi  news of importance   link merwell  nat you must be fooling put in ben  why we couldnt find a single trace of him after that awful landslide went on dave we made a thorough search too  i dont know anything about that returned the moneylenders son but i know link merwell is alive i got a letter from him yesterday  are you sure that it was not an old letter delayed in delivery queried ben  no it was not an old letter it was dated only a few days ago it was sent to me from boston  boston cried laura then he must not only be alive but he must have followed us east  did he say anything about job haskers queried our hero  he said he didnt know what had become of haskers he said they had separated a short while before the big landslide struck them he was pretty well bruised up and had to rest in a little mining camp up in the mountains for two weeks  this is certainly the strangest news yet was daves comment i thought sure that he and haskers had been swallowed up in that landslide along with that miner who was with them nat what caused him to write to you i thought you told me that you had destroyed his last letter without answering it  so i did destroy it dave without answering it returned the moneylenders son i was as surprised to hear from him as you would have been i thought he would know enough to let me alone  what did he have to say nat questioned ben of course you havent got to tell us if you dont want to he added hastily  thats all right didnt i tell you i was coming to see dave i was going to show him the letter ive got it in my pocket here it is and nat brought forth the communication  the letter was a long and rambling one which need not be reproduced here in it link merwell told something of how he had been caught in the landslide and how he had escaped and had been carried by some miners to their camp a search had been made for job haskers and the man named blugg but without results then merwell had obtained some money probably from his father and had come east where he expected to obtain a position he added that he was still as bitter as ever against dave and his chums and would do his best some day to square accounts as in his previous communication to nat he wanted to know if the moneylenders son would not aid him in making trouble for our hero  the same old link merwell remarked dave after he had read the letter with ben looking over his shoulder  wouldnt you think a fellow who had been so close to death would want to reform said his chum but i suppose link doesnt know what the word reform means  oh dave arent you afraid he will make you a lot of trouble cried jessie and her face showed her deep concern  i never was afraid of link merwell and i dont believe i ever shall be returned dave quickly at heart i think that fellow is a big coward  yes but you must be careful warned his sister even cowards know how to strike in the dark and that would be link merwells way of attacking you  i dont know how he is going to hurt dave when he is away off in boston was bens comment the chances are he has got to go to work and earn his living probably his father is sick of putting up money for him  merwell mustnt forget one thing said dave he is still responsible for his part in that jewelry robbery if the authorities get hold of him they will certainly send him to prison so far as that affair is concerned he was no better than jasniff  what makes me mad is his trying to connectup with me burst out nat ive told him twice now that i was done with him and i want him to leave me alone  were you going to answer this letter nat questioned ben  no i was going to tear it up the same as the other its only got boston for an address anyway  it seems to me nat it might be a good thing for you to write to link and tell him exactly what you think of him said dave tell him you are done with him forever and that you dont want to get any more letters perhaps that will settle him send the letter to the general delivery  thats what i was going to ask you about dave i dont want to have that fellow bothering me i told you i was going to turn over a new leaf and now for once in his life nat poole looked dave and then ben squarely in the face  then by all means write to him and tell him exactly where you stand went on our hero make the letter good and strong nat so that there wont be any mistake about it  ill do it answered the moneylenders son and then after a few words more he replaced the letter in his pocket and drove on and dave and his party resumed their automobile trip  that certainly is news was bens comment as they rolled along the river road i thought from what you said dave he must have been buried alive  so we all thought his escape must have been nothing short of a miracle  i dont begrudge him his life but i dont want him to bother dave any more said laura he is such a wicked fellow  dave didnt you say after you came from cave island that link said something about reforming asked jessie  yes he did talk that way he was very humble and sorry that he had gone into the robbery with jasniff but i guess now that what made him humble was the fact that he was in danger of going to prison as soon as he got away his ideas changed  i hope he doesnt come here to bother you dave sighed laura  oh please dont think of such a dreadful thing cried jessie if he is in boston i hope he stays there but this wish was not to be fulfilled as we shall see later  the ride along the river road and over the hills beyond was much enjoyed by the young folks and it was after dark when they returned to crumville all told jessie made it very pleasant for dave but she could not forget the fact that the youth had rescued della ford from the sea and she asked several times about the young lady and the movingpicture company to which she belonged  i dont know much about the picture company dave had answered i think there were about a dozen people in it including miss fords aunt and the young fellow and the fat man we picked up  but you said you would call on her in boston didnt you queried jessie  i said i might call if i was in the city dave replied  and i suppose youll go up there the first chance you get pouted jessie  maybe he answered not altogether liking her tone and then before anything more could be said the automobile swept up in front of ben basswoods home and the conversation became general  ben had been on the back seat with laura and now as he left the party jessie came into the tonneau to keep daves sister company so that on the journey to the wadsworth mansion the talk between jessie and dave could not be renewed  the next two days were busy ones for our hero he had several matters of business to attend to for his father and his uncle added to this old caspar potts asked the youth if he would not accompany him to the old farm where the pair had spent so long a time together  why certainly ill go to the farm with you professor replied dave but what are you going to do there if i may ask  i want to get a box of books that was left in the garret there when we came away answered the old whitehaired gentleman i would have brought them here before but it slipped my mind entirely perhaps you remember the box  do you mean that old blue box that stood in the back of the garret questioned dave  thats the one david i dont think the books in it are of very great value but they might as well be added to the library here went on the old professor the wadsworth library comprised many hundreds of volumes and was a source of great pride to professor potts who had spent many days in classifying the books and getting out a private catalogue to please the old gentleman mr wadsworth had from time to time added various books and pamphlets which he might not otherwise have purchased  since dave and caspar potts had left the old farm the place had been leased to another party but now it was unoccupied and the cottage and stable were locked up  looks natural remarked dave as he stood on the tiny piazza of the cottage and looked around on the familiar scene then his thoughts went back to the past what tremendous changes had taken place since he had left that home he had found a father a sister and an uncle and had made a host of friends not only that he was rich and had received a good education and was on the fair road to success  david it was caspar potts who spoke and his voice trembled how different it is from what it used to be certainly your folks and mr wadsworth have been great friends of mine and the old gentleman blinked away the tears that stood in his mild eyes  unlocking the door of the little cottage dave went inside and lost no time in throwing open a number of windows so that the fresh summer air from outside might dispel the dampness within then caspar potts entered and both ascended the narrow stairway to the upper floor here was a tiny garret which in the past had been given over mostly to the storage of old furniture and other articles not in use  i trust none of the tenants have disturbed that box remarked caspar potts when dave had lit a candle which he had thoughtfully brought along  i see the box professor answered the youth here if you will hold the candle i will get it out and then dave worked his way over to a corner under the eaves and from behind a broken rockingchair and a dilapidated couch dragged forth a small wooden box painted blue he threw back the cover exposing to view thirty or forty books covered with dust and yellow with age  good good murmured the old professor as he brushed one of the volumes off with his coat sleeve some of these books are not very valuable david but a few of them will add quite a little to our library i had those volumes when i was a student at college he added proudly  ill carry the box downstairs said dave  caspar potts candle in hand led the way to the floor below as he came out into the kitchen of the cottage he was somewhat surprised to find two persons on the porch talking earnestly  hello youve got visitors said dave as he set the box of books down on a bare table some one out for a look around i suppose he added  maybe it is some one who would like to lease the farm returned caspar potts let us go out and see and he extinguished the candle  brushing the dust and cobwebs from his coat dave followed the old professor to the porch of the cottage the two visitors were so busy talking that for the instant they did not notice the others  hello there exclaimed dave in some surprise as his eyes rested on the face of one of the visitors how in the world did you get here  ierierits mr porter stammered the fellow addressed and he leaped quickly to his feet  it was ward porton the young man dave and his chums had rescued from the sea when the steam yacht was on fire  dave porter here came from the other fellow who had been seated on the stoop and now he too leaped up i guess we had better leave he stammered  link merwell ejaculated our hero it must be confessed that now he was all but dumfounded he had thought that link merwell must be in boston and to find him here on the outskirts of crumville and in company with ward porton the fellow he had rescued was almost beyond belief     chapter vii  link merwell again   link merwell showed signs of both suffering and dissipation his face was thin and careworn and his eyes had an uncertain restless look in them he had on a business suit much the worse for wear and his tan shoes were worn down at the heels evidently he had not fared well since dave had met him in the west  i once thought you were dead link went on dave after a pause during which link merwell had taken several steps away from the cottage i thought you had been buried by that landslide  i know it was the bitter reply it would have pleased you immensely if i had been buried alive  that isnt true i wouldnt like to see anybody lose his life in that fashion declared dave and then he went on quickly did job haskers escape  i dont know anything about himand i dont want to know returned link merwell and his tone was as bitter as before haskers didnt treat me right and we separated before we got caught in the sliding rocks and dirt  i didnt know that you knew merwell said dave turning to ward porton  oh yes i have known him for some time was the reply of the young movingpicture actor  i think we had better be going broke out link merwell who had retreated a step or two further he showed very plainly that he was afraid dave might lay hands on him  oh dont be in a hurry answered ward porton now weve got the chance id like to talk to porter  i dont think ill stay and link merwell moved still farther away ill meet you later you know where  see here link dont be in such a hurry cried dave advancing toward the youth i want to talk to you  i know your game dave porter you want to catch me and hand me over to the authorities exclaimed link and showed more fear than ever  what makes you think that  never mind youre not going to catch me this way dont forget porton ill see you later and thus speaking link merwell turned and started away on a swift walk then as dave went after him he broke into a run and reaching the roadway dived into the woods beyond  my my came from old professor potts david why did he run away  hes afraid of being arrested thats why professor explained our hero dont you remember he is one of the villainous fellows who robbed mr wadsworths jewelry works a year or so ago  oh yes to be sure murmured the old gentleman i remember now what an awful thing for a young man like that to be such a criminal  you say he is a criminal asked ward porton curiously  he certainly is answered dave  hum i didnt know that returned the young movingpicture actor and for the moment looked quite thoughtful  may i ask what brought you to crumville queried our hero i thought you and your company were bound for boston  we did go to boston and the company is there now unless it has gone up into the woods i had a little business in this vicinity and so i came here before going on the next trip with them  did you come to crumville with merwell  i did but i didnt know he was a criminal  then you must have met merwell in boston  no i met him on the steam yacht  illustration then as dave went after him he broke into a runpage 63  the steam yacht do you mean the one that caught fire  of course  then link merwell was on board that vessel cried dave in added wonder  yes  was he a member of your company  he was mr appleby our manager took him on the day before we went on the trip i dont know where mr appleby met him  that certainly beats the dutch of course merwell must have seen me and my friends in the rowboat  he said he did  he took good pains to keep out of sight  i dont know anything about that porter but he was on the boat you can take my word for that  and is he a regular member of your company  he is to be provided he can make good at the business i think he came to mr appleby with some sort of a hardluck story and the manager said he would give him a chance privately though i dont think hes very much of an actor but then you know a fellow has got to do something for a living  he can probably act as well as the majority answered dave but i am surprised to learn that he was on the steam yacht and didnt show himself to us still he was probably afraid to do so and glad enough to keep out of sight i suppose he brought you to this farm  oh we just took a walk up this way returned ward porton with some hesitation he gave dave a keen look you see i was on my way to the crumville poorhouse by the way merwell told me that you had once been connected with that institution and he gave dave another keen look  our heros face flushed and for the instant he did not know what to say caspar potts too showed confusion  david was noterconnected with that institution sir said the old gentleman hurriedly he was placed there when he was a child by those who found him wandering along the railroad tracks here they did not know who he was and  i dont think mr porton will be interested in that story professor interrupted our hero  well to tell the truth i am interested answered ward porton i once lived in a poorhouse myself  indeed is that so murmured caspar potts how interesting  it wasnt anywhere around here though went on the young movingpicture actor it was way down east and believe me it was a hard life i dont really see how i pulled through and he smiled grimly  i cant say that i had such a very hard time of it said dave they treated me fairly well and as soon as i got old enough to work mr potts here took me and not only gave me a good home but also the beginning of a good education then after that i found my folksi had been stolen away from them you see when a babyand since that time i have had an easy time of it  youre the lucky one then answered ward porton he seemed on the point of saying something more but evidently changed his mind well if its all the same to you ill be going he concluded  better take my advice and drop link merwell said dave as the young man moved away if you dont sooner or later hell get you into hot water the authorities want him even though they got back the things he stole  ill remember what you say was the answer and then the young movingpicture actor walked away and soon disappeared around a bend of the road  it is very strange that they should have come here remarked caspar potts when he and dave reentered the cottage to get the box of books  i should say it was answered our hero i dont understand it at all i believe link merwell is up to another one of his tricks im going to keep my eyes open for him  when dave returned home he told the others there of having met link merwell and ward porton mr wadsworth was of course particularly interested in merwell and he at once telephoned to the authorities to be on the lookout for that individual but link merwell had probably taken warning and did not show himself again nor for the time being did dave see anything further of ward porton  on friday belle endicott lauras friend from the west arrived and was followed on saturday morning by roger and phil ben brought word that he had written to luke watson and shadow hamilton and that those two former pupils of oak hall had also signified their willingness to accompany the party to mirror lake  and say dave what do you think cried ben this place that we are to go to at mirror lake is known as bear camp they tell me the bears just love that vicinity  bear camp shrieked jessie who was present oh ben you are fooling  not a bit of it jessie my father got a letter from tad rason an old hunter and guide who lives in the vicinity of mirror lake he says that that place has been known as bear camp for years he told about shooting a big black bear there only a year or so ago  o dear if there are bears up there i dont know that i want to go said laura just think of having a big bear chase you  oh you mustnt mind that laura cried dave gaily just think of the nice hug he could give you and then he dodged as laura threw a fancy pillow at him  i think those bears will spoil everything came from jessie her face clouding i didnt know any wild animals were left in the adirondacks  bear camp mused laura what a queer name that is  i think its a fine name answered ben it suits me anyway  the boys were glad to see belle endicott who was a large wellbuilt girl with a bright breezy western air about her belle had much to tell concerning matters at star ranch and dave asked her about many of the friends he had made among the cowboys at the place  oh ill just love to see bears said belle when told about the camp they are such funny clumsy creatures why i once saw a little cinnamon bear climbing up a tree and he was the funniest fellow i ever looked at  oh belle werent you frightened asked jessie  frightened what with sid todd with me no indeed we just watched him until we got tired of it and then todd up with his rifle and that was the end of mr cinnamon bear  good for sid cried dave he was always on hand when wanted id like to see him again  well he sent his regards to you dave was belles rejoinder  shadow hamilton and luke watson the latter carrying a case containing his guitar and his banjo arrived on saturday afternoon they came to bens house and having been notified by telephone dave hurried over to see them  dave youre a sight for sore eyes said luke watson as he gave our heros hand a grasp that made him wince my gracious it seems to me that i havent seen you in a year of sundays  one things sure luke answered dave with a twinkle in his eyes you havent seen me since ive seen you and at this remark both laughed  luke has brought his instruments along said ben so well be sure to have plenty of music up at the camp  it suits me and will surely suit the girls returned dave we can sit out in the moonlight nights and have fine times singing he added  say talking about singing in the moonlight puts me in mind of a story burst out shadow once on a time a young fellow went to serenade his girl and  never mind the yarn now shadow said ben ive got something to tell you that is more interesting than a story its about nat pooles uncle  nat pooles uncle queried dave you dont mean wilbur poole the wild man we caught in the woods back of oakdale  that is the man  what of him i thought they had taken him to a sanitarium and that he was getting better  so he was getting betterin fact he was almost well so nat said but now what do you think has happened  what came from all of the other boys  he has disappeared  disappeared  thats it he has run away and nobody knows where he went to     chapter viii  off for bear camp   who told you this ben asked dave  i just got the story from nat he and his family are very much worried they had an idea that wilbur poole was practically well again and that is the reason why they did not watch him very closely  of course they are searching for him  sure nat said the authorities and also several other people were after him nat himself was going to look for him tomorrow  maybe well run across him said luke watson  i hope we dont luke exclaimed dave that man gave us trouble enough up at oak hall  right you are there burst out shadow and then he added i wonder if hell call himself the king of sumatra as he did before  a man who is out of his mind is apt to call himself anything said dave i feel sorry for nat this must worry him and his family a good deal  it was not long after this when all the boys went over to the wadsworth mansion there to complete their preparations for the trip to mirror lake ben had had the basswood automobile thoroughly overhauled and dave had likewise had the wadsworth touringcar put into the best possible running shape  my but there is going to be quite a bunch of us was daves comment as he looked at the boys and girls who were present  mamma says we must finish all our packing tonight or else do it monday morning said jessie she doesnt want any of it done on sunday  my things are all ready and so are belles returned laura but i dont know how it is with the boys  well be all right dont you worry answered dave  we never got left yet added ben with a grin  luke had brought along his banjo and the others insisted that he play a tune or two then they sang a couple of songs and after that the wadsworth phonograph was started and the young folks enjoyed an hour or so of dancing  sunday morning most of the young folks went to church and in the afternoon some of them spent their time in writing letters dave and several of the boys took a walk around the town at the railroad station they ran across nat poole  i am off to look for my uncle wilbur said nat weve an idea that he went to plattsburg new york he used to have some friends there and we think he started off to visit them  i certainly hope you find him nat and that hes all right answered dave kindly  by the way i heard link merwell was in town went on the moneylenders son  yes i met him at our old farm  i should think hed be afraid to show himself fearing arrest  hes a strange fellow nat and there is no telling what he will do he has been knocked around so much the last few months that i suppose he doesnt care very much what happens next  i dont want to see him ive got troubles enough without running into link merwell grumbled nat and then his train came in and he was off  during their spare time the boys had studied an automobile roadmap of new york state and especially of the adirondack mountains they had figured out that they would have good traveling nearly the whole of the distance although there were a few bad stretches here and there to be covered and also a number of mountains to be climbed  but the mountains wont bother us said dave in reply to a question from luke our car can go up almost any hill and the basswood auto is just about as good of course well have to do some of the traveling on low or second gear  the reason i asked was this returned luke a couple of years ago some friends of mine started to tour the adirondacks in a runabout they went up the side of one mountain and then down on the other they then found themselves in a valley and couldnt climb the grade on either side they tried for two days to get out and then had to get a team of horses to pull them a distance of several miles  well watch out that nothing like that happens to us answered dave we wont go down into any hollow until we know something about how we are going to get out of it  as both touringcars were large it had been decided that mr and mrs basswood as well as dunston porter should accompany the young folks on the automobile trip as all the baggage had been packed and either shipped forward by express or strapped on the touringcars it did not take long on monday morning to get ready to start it was a clear and fairly cool day and a slight shower sunday night had laid the dust  all aboard thats going cried dave gaily when the wadsworth car had been run around to the front of the mansion  he had hardly uttered the words when there came the sound of an automobile horn from the road and a few seconds later the basswood car came into sight with bens crowd on board  youll say goodbye to us here but well be at mirror lake before you get there said mrs wadsworth as she kissed her daughter and the other girls  now look out for accidents cautioned daves father  well be careful answered dunston porter with a smile and then he added to caspar potts professor dont forget to take good care of the place while we are away  it shall be well taken care of rest assured of that sir was the old gentlemans reply i trust all of you enjoy the outing he went on his kindly face beaming  dave was at the wheel with his uncle beside him and the others packed rather tightly in the tonneau behind with many a shout and merry word the wadsworth touringcar left the grounds followed by the basswood machine and passed out along the highway leading north from crumville  now dave do look where you are running cautioned laura we dont want any punctures or blowouts  soon crumville was left behind and the automobiles were passing along the river road where some time before dave and his chums had assisted nat poole then they began to climb the distant hills and presently were on the highway leading to poughkeepsie where they were to cross the hudson river  if only this lovely weather holds out im sure well have a splendid trip said jessie  i suppose belle youd rather be on horseback than in an auto remarked phil  well i wont go back on horsebackriding returned the western girl i love it too dearly but this is very nice she added quickly very nice indeed  by noon they reached the city on the hudson river and there stopped for lunch then they passed over the high bridge spanning the stream and struck out northward once more mr dunston porter was now running the car and this gave dave more of a chance to talk to those behind him  that evening found them in albany where it had been decided to spend the night dunston porter had already telegraphed ahead for hotel accommodations so there was no difficulty on that score the older folks were glad enough to rest during the evening but the young people went out for a walk up the hill leading to the capitol building  in the morning the tourists were rather alarmed to see that the sky had clouded over and there were some indications of rain  well if it rains we can put on our raincoats and put up the tops said dave so far they had been traveling with the tops folded down  noon found them well up in the heart of new york state they stopped only for a short while at lunch time wishing to cover as much ground as possible before the storm might break  if possible we want to make rayville today announced mr basswood when the two cars had come to a standstill at a crossroads ive got some friends living there and i want to make a call on them besides theres a good hotel there where we can stop for the night for they had made no arrangements beyond albany  there had been a signboard at the crossroads but this had fallen down so the tourists did not know which of the forks of the road to take finally a man coming along in a runabout told them to take the highway on the left  that other road is the regular one he explained but it is pretty well torn up and youll make time by taking this one but be careful of the hill its just a little bit dangerous  well be careful answered dave who was now running the car once more  want me to take the wheel questioned his uncle  oh no i guess i can get along all right  the basswood car with ben in charge had already taken to the highway on the left and the other turnout followed it at a distance of several hundred feet ben had put on considerable speed and dave had to watch closely to keep the other car in sight  take it easy davy said his uncle dunston we dont want any accidents away out here from any garage  i want to keep ben in sight hes going it pretty lively answered dave  yes its a wonder his father doesnt hold him back a little but mr basswood said he was anxious to reach rayville and thats at least twenty miles farther  ahead were several turns in the road and at these dave lost sight of the car ahead being cloudy it was quite dark on the roadway especially where the trees lined the highway and soon dave found it necessary to turn on the headlights then he sounded his horn expecting to get a reply from ben but to his surprise none came  do you know what i think hes trying to do said our hero hastily i believe hes trying to run away from us  its a foolish thing to attempt dave on a strange road like this answered dunston porter gravely i should think mr basswood would stop it  presently they were climbing a long hill the road wound in and out among the trees and at one place the grade was so steep that dave had to throw the clutch into low gear he and his uncle listened intently and from a distance heard the chugchug of the other car a long way ahead  say this is some climb believe me cried roger as they made another turn and dave found it advisable to come down to low gear  what will you do if you cant make it dave queried phil  oh well make itdont worry was the answer i threw into low gear just for safetys sake this road twists so a fellow cant see fifty feet ahead of him  i dont hear the other car any more declared roger a moment later  to this dave did not reply there was another turn ahead and a particularly hard climb over some rather rough rocks then with a jolt the big touringcar came out on the top of the hill here was another turn and then began a sharp descent  stop here a minute dave ordered the youths uncle and then as our hero brought the machine to a standstill he added thats rather a bad road ahead and you had better give the other car a chance to get down before we try to make it  a good idea uncle dunston well wait answered dave  as they stood there all strained their ears to catch some sound from the other car  i dont hear it at all said roger  all i hear is the breeze in the trees put in laura  they must be running without power answered dunston porter  if they are going down a really steep hill its a wonder we dont hear some squeak from the brakes was phils comment  listen cried dave suddenly and held up his hand  all strained their ears once more and now far below them they heard several cries mingled with a shriek then came a sudden crash followed by more shrieks  theyve had an accident  wonder what it was  well have to go and see cried dave and put on the power once more  thats right cried dunston porter get down there as fast as you can dave but be carefulwe dont want to run into them or have any accident of our own there must be something wrong down there     chapter ix  on the road   perhaps they have gone off into some ditch  maybe they bounced off a rock and hit a tree  a fellow could easily break a wheel on this rough road  oh i hope none of them have been hurt  such were some of the remarks that came from those in the tonneau of the touringcar as dave put on the power and started down the winding road which led to the bottom of the long hill  better keep her in low gear dave said dunston porter as the car struck a rather steep incline the engine will help hold her back  i think i can hold her with the brakes uncle dunston answered the youth who had already thrown off the power he had the footbrake well down and now he threw in the emergency as well  on and on slipped and slid the big touringcar bumping over a road which seemed to grow worse as they progressed all of the lights were on full and they were needed for the road turned and twisted in such a fashion that but little could be seen ahead in some places the highway seemed extra narrow this being caused by the heavy trees and bushes lining both sides at one point the water had caused quite a washout and into this and out again they bumped with such violence that all the girls shrieked in alarm  some bump that was rogers grim comment  o dear i thought sure id be jounced out cried jessie dave cant you go a little slower  ill try returned the youth and jammed down the footbrake as hard as he could for an instant the touringcar came almost to a standstill but presently they slid onward again coming a moment later to another bend  look out dont run into us it was a yell from in front and now dave saw luke watson standing in the roadway waving his handkerchief  down in the darkness beyond dave made out the red rearlight of the basswood automobile as the second touringcar came on luke leaped to one side but his warning had had its effect and now dave jammed on both brakes with all the force at his command at the same time swerving slightly to the left he just grazed a trunk strapped to the back of the first machine and then came to a halt on a waterbreak a short distance beyond  somebody get out and put a few stones under the wheels cried dave who could not leave his seat because of one foot on the brake  all right well fix it cried his uncle and leaped out followed quickly by the boys in the tonneau of the car  loose stones were to be had in plenty and soon the car wheels were well blocked then dave was able to join those on the ground  shall we get out asked laura anxiously  suit yourselves returned dunston porter who was already moving in the direction of the other car  the wadsworth machine contained a hand flashlight and getting possession of this dave and his chums hurried toward the other automobile they had already seen at a glance that the basswood touringcar had swung around to the side of the road and that one front wheel was held fast between a large rock and a fairsized tree apparently the car was not hurt and no one seemed to be injured  how did it happen ben sang out dave when he saw that the accident was not a serious one  funniest thing you ever heard of returned his chum you couldnt possibly guess it  didnt you slip on the rocks queried phil  it was a cow put us here said mr basswood gravely just a plain every day red cow and in spite of the accident his eyes had a twinkle in them  a cow came from several of the others in wonder  yes a cow answered ben and his tone showed his deep disgust i was going down the hill just as nicely as you please when along came a cow a man was driving her and when he saw us coming he did his best to get the cow out of our way but that mooly didnt budge from the middle of the road so i had to turn to one sideand this is the consequence  but i am so thankful that no one was hurt broke in mrs basswood think of what might have happened if the car had turned over and she shuddered  but where is the cow questioned roger  oh as soon as she had put us in this hole she turned tail and ran down the hill as fast as she could and the man went after her explained mr basswood  i guess the man ran away because he was afraid we might hold him responsible for damages remarked shadow say this puts me in mind of a story he added one time a cow got on the front piazza of a house and  for gracious sake shadow i guess youd want to tell stories at a funeral burst out ben never mind your yarn now let us see if we can get this machine out from between this rock and that tree  you didnt break the steeringgear did you asked dave anxiously as he allowed the flashlight to play over and around the touringcar  i dont believe i hurt anything dave but of course i cant be sure until i try to run the car answered ben whats worrying me is how am i going to get out of this fix i dont believe i can back outin fact it wouldnt be safe  looks to me as if wed have to chop the tree down to get out of here commented luke who had come back from where he had signaled the other car  i think i see a way of aiding you said dunston porter who was examining the rock that held the wheel to the tree i think if we dig under the edge of this rock we can loosen it and roll it down the hill then well be able to lift the front of the automobile aroundthat is if we can keep the machine from sliding down on us  we can easily fix that part of it answered dave all weve got to do is to take that towingrope we brought along and fasten it to a tree and the back axle of the car  thats the talk dave cried his uncle get the rope and make it fast at once  while our hero and several of the other boys were adjusting the towingline which had been brought along for emergencies dunston porter and mr basswood set to work to loosen the rock which held the wheel this was no easy task but finally with the aid of a hammer and a small crowbar it was accomplished and the rock slid down the roadway then the automobile began to start forward  look out there cried one of the boys this line may not hold  that will hold two cars like that answered dave the rope strained and creaked but did not break and soon those in front of the car had the machine jacked around once more in a straight position headed down the road  now ben i guess youre all right again said dave  provided i dont meet that cow again was the retort how about that rope  ill unfasten it for you just as soon as you are ready to start  i think id rather walk to the foot of the hill remarked mrs basswood timorously  let us all walk down ill be glad of the exercise cried belle who was tired of being cramped up in the tonneau of the automobile  oh but maybe that cow will get after us exclaimed jessie  pooh whos afraid of a cow cried the western girl who had been brought up to face hundreds of animals on her fathers ranch  well i think we had better let the automobiles go first anyway suggested laura we dont want them to come along and run over us she added playfully  soon ben and his chums were in the first of the touringcars dave released the rope and the automobile resumed the descent of the hill then the towingline was wound up and thrown into the tonneau of the second car and that also resumed its journey  down at the foot of the long hill they met the cow and her owner a tall cadaverouslooking individual who eyed our friends frowningly  i see you got your cow all right enough remarked ben  so i did but id a mighty long run to stop her growled the man  you put us in quite a hole do you know that went on ben  taint none of my fault replied the owner of the cow quickly i have as much right on this road with my cow as you have with that there autymobile  just the same you had no right to let your cow keep to the middle of the road cried ben if we had had a worse accident we might have held you responsible  huh hold me responsible eh well ye wouldnt have got a cent out of me said the owner of the cow and then he passed on up the hill once more driving the animal before him the cow was contentedly chewing her cud as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened to disturb her  a quarter of a mile further on our friends came to a small stream spanned by rather a shakylooking bridge over which each machine was run with great care on the other side of the stream they came to another fork of the road  heres a signboard anyway cried dave whose car was now in advance rayville four miles well be there soon if this road holds out  i think youll find the roads around rayville all right called mr basswood to him my friend told me that they were in good condition especially those on the other side of the town  a quarter of an hour later found the two touringcars in the village where mr basswoods friend resided here as the gentleman had said was located a fairly good hotel where accommodations for the night could be had  now im going to go around and see my friends said mr basswood ben you and your chums can stay here at the hotel well be back before its time to retire and then he set off in the touringcar taking his wife with him  as the hotel at rayville made a specialty of catering to automobile parties our friends found the accommodations there both ample and satisfactory after the hard run of the day the girls and the boys were glad to rest awhile then they fixed up for dinner which was served to them in a private diningroom apart from the other patrons of the house as might be expected they had a good deal of fun and shadow was allowed to tell several of his stories much to his own satisfaction if not to that of his listeners  by this time tomorrow night we ought to be at bear camp said dave after they had finished dinner and gone out on the hotel veranda to watch what little was going on in the town  i guess it will be a good deal more lonely than it is here dave observed jessie  there will be too many of us to be lonely he answered im looking forward to some splendid times  oh so am i dave and i am sure the others hope to have good times too  it was about ten oclock when mr and mrs basswood came back to the hotel having spent a very pleasant evening with their friends who had wanted them to remain over night  ive got some news that i want to telegraph to crumville announced bens father as he came in news that may interest mr poole  what is that dad questioned his son curiously  why mr dobson spoke about a strange sort of man who called on him yesterday he thought the man was out of his mind he said the fellow asked for work first but then said he didnt care whether he got a job or not because he had to take the night express for sumatra  a strange man who wanted to take the night express for sumatra exclaimed dave it must have been the king of sumatrawilbur poole  just exactly what i think dave answered mr basswood     chapter x  caught in a storm   did you ever know this wilbur poole dad questioned ben  yes i met him years ago at aaron pooles home but of course he was in his right mind then poor chap i pity him very much  i think we all pity him answered dave nobody can be responsible after his mind breaks down  i feel sorry for nat poole and his folks said laura this will give them a great deal of trouble not to mention the expense  if wilbur poole was anywhere around rayville it might pay to start a hunt for him suggested roger  i dont think youll find him anywhere around here answered mr basswood but it wont hurt to take a look around if you boys care to take a walk  bens father went off to send his telegram to aaron poole and all the boys set off on a hunt for the wild man they covered the streets of the village and some of the roads on the outskirts but without success they met three people who had talked to the strange individual and from what had passed dave and his chums were sure that the man must have been wilbur poole  i guess well have to give it up said phil when it was getting late im tired out and remember fellows we have a hard ride before us tomorrow if we expect to reach carpen falls in time to hit the trail for bear camp before it gets dark  when the boys reached the hotel the girls were anxious to hear what they might have to tell  its too bad said jessie soberly i am glad it is not one of my relatives who is roaming around like that  both dunston porter and mr basswood had suggested an early start on the following morning so the entire party were downstairs and to breakfast by seven oclock in the meantime the two automobiles had been overhauled and provided with oil and gasoline as well as with water  ive got rather a bad cut on one of the rear wheels said ben perhaps i had better change the shoe before we start  oh take a chance on it cried luke i think youll get through all right enough  perhaps luke but if i dont that blowout will cost me a fine inner tube however ill take the chance get in everybody and well be off  as mr basswoods friend had said the road leading from rayville northwestward was in fine shape and they were able to cover the next thirty miles at a fair rate of speed but then they got in among the hills and here the road became as winding and dangerous as ever  not knowing much about the stoppingplaces ahead the grown folks had had the hotel people put up a substantial lunch for the tourists packed in two hampers  it will be jolly fun camping out this noon said laura it ought to just suit you belle  it certainly will was the answer from the western girl id rather eat in the open than in the stuffy diningroom of a hotel any time  there may be one drawback to having lunch outdoors said phil it looks like rain  phil if you say rain again ill throw you out of the car cried roger  i must admit it does look a little like rain said laura casting her eyes skyward thats an awfully black cloud over yonder o dear rain would spoil it all i do hope it holds off  dave had been running the car but now his uncle insisted upon taking the wheel then roger climbed over onto the front seat giving the one he had been occupying beside jessie to our hero they were in the lead with the basswood turnout not far behind  this is more like said dave in a low tone to jessie  oh well i suppose you had to do your share in running the car dave she replied giving him a bright look  i dont believe uncle dunston cares as much for driving as he pretends went on the youth behind it all he is a good deal like bellehe prefers to be on horseback he was brought up to it  he has certainly been a great traveler dave  yes indeed and i would like to be just like him id love to travel  and where would you go if you had the chance  i dont know maybe around the world and daves eyes lit up as he spoke  around the world and would you go all alone  all alone not if i could get anybody to go along with me wouldnt you like to take a trip like that jessie and he gazed at her fondly  oh dave  well it would be a great trip for both of us wouldnt it  dave dont be silly and jessie blushed deeply we are not going around the world yet we are going to bear camp and thats plenty far enough  yes i know jessie but you seeand dave lowered his voicei want to make sure that when i go youll go with me it will then be the finest trip that ever anybody  bang it was a report like that from a small cannon and came from close beside them jessie gave a scream and so did laura and mrs basswood while cries of wonder and alarm came from the boys the basswood car had come up alongside of the other automobile and just at that instant the tire which ben had said was cut blew out sending a shower of dirt and stones in all directions mr basswood who was at the wheel brought the car to a quick stop and mr porter also halted  well it went just as i thought it might remarked ben grimly  too bad returned luke i reckon it was my fault i should have let you put on that other shoe before we started  its nobodys fault cried mr basswood quickly now then boys well see how soon we can get another shoe on  many hands made the labor of jacking up the car and changing the tire a light one fortunately the automobile was equipped with a pump attached to the engine so that blowing up the tire by hand was unnecessary  this is only a little exercise to get up an appetite for that lunch remarked dave gaily we want to do full justice to the stuff in the hamper  as if there was ever anything the matter with your appetite cried phil dryly  why philip my son you know i never eat more than a bird retorted dave with a twinkle in his eye  humph a bird eh i guess you must mean an ostrich retorted the shipowners son and at this sally there was a general laugh in which even dave joined  just eleven oclock remarked luke consulting his watch when do we stop for that lunch  at twelve oclock precisely answered mrs basswood that is of course if we happen to be in the right kind of a place we dont want to stop just anywhere  might eat the lunch while we were running suggested roger it would make it last so much longer  wow what a joke cried phil  say that puts me in mind of a story burst out shadow a fellow named william took his best girl for a trip by train to another town and on the way they went into the diningcar for lunch he said afterwards that it was the longest lunch he had ever eaten and as the girl had ordered nearly everything on the bill of fare it was also the longest bill he had ever paid  a long bill but a short story shadow cried luke  id like to know one thing shadow observed dave was it william who paid the bill or was it bill who had to put up several williams to pay for it  good gracious dave what are you talking about queried his sister with a puzzled look on her face  oh thats easy laura answered roger williambill billwilliam dont you see the joke  yes of course how thick i am returned the girl quickly  soon they were once more on the way they had a long hill to ascend the road winding in and out among the trees and around the rocks it was a hard pull and several times they had to change to second gear and even to low  o my what a beautiful view cried belle when the top of the hill was gained and in her excitement she stood straight up in the automobile to look around her  it certainly is beautiful returned jessie one can see for miles and miles in every direction  oh mrs basswood dont you think this would be a lovely place to have lunch cried laura  at the mention of lunch luke shadow and phil brought out their watches simultaneously  seventeen minutes of twelve announced the shipowners son  ive got quarter of cried luke  you must both be off put in shadow im only fourteen minutes and a half of twelve he announced gravely have we got to wait till twelve oclock he continued anxiously  i guess itll be twelve oclock before we get anything to eat answered mrs basswood with a smile i think this would be just an ideal spot to rest  oh weve just got to stay here for a while whether we eat or not cried belle im going to get out and run up on to the rocks over there and suiting the action to the words she leaped out of the automobile and started to make her way to the spot she had indicated  look out that you dont fall over into the hollow cautioned dave as he assisted jessie and his sister to alight  to one side of the roadway was something of a cleared space and into this the two automobiles were run the boys got out the hampers and other things and took them over to the spot which belles quick eyes had picked out here there was a patch of green grass shaded by several large trees and in front of it a flat rock beyond which was spread out a vast panorama of hills and valleys stretching for many miles  its a perfect picture cried jessie i must get a photograph of it  yes and we must take a photograph of the crowd at lunch returned dave  lets eat before we start to take any photographs put in luke who seemed to be extra hungry i never did look well in a picture taken before eating and at this there was a general laugh  while the boys brought the various things from the cars the girls and mrs basswood spread a lunchcloth partly on the grass and partly on the flat rock and on this placed the various good things which had been brought along  first call for lunch sang out dave loudly when all was in readiness  i guess your first call will be the last too dave exclaimed jessie here what will you havea ham sandwich or one with chicken  i think ill try the chicken he answered  oh dont be backward about coming forward dave cried luke why dont you try them both  i will before i get through  we all will declared roger there is nothing the matter with this air for giving one an appetite he added i believe after we have been up at bear camp for a while well all be eating like wolves  why not like bears if we are going to bear camp suggested phil  say i cant bear a joke like that broke in roger  it was a little barefaced wasnt it commented dave  oh quit your joking im hungry pleaded luke and then all the young folks fell to eating with great gusto and it must be admitted that the older heads followed suit  the lunch lasted the best part of half an hour and was thoroughly enjoyed by every one then the young people got out their cameras and various snapshots and timepictures were taken to be developed and printed later on  now then let us pack up as quickly as we can and finish this trip said mr basswood presently  as he spoke he looked up at the sky and the others did the same off to the westward they saw a number of black clouds rolling up rapidly  say dave that looks like a real storm to me remarked roger anxiously what do you think of it  its a storm all right was the answer and if we dont catch it before we reach the end of our journey well be lucky  illustration and then all the young folks fell to eating with great gustopage 102  as quickly as possible the various things were packed up and placed in the two touringcars then they started off once more with mr porter and mr basswood at the steering wheels they had covered less than five miles when they heard a rushing of wind through the woods it seemed to come by fits and starts but steadily increased in volume the sky grew darker and soon some large drops of rain fell  well have to put up the tops cried dave  the basswood car had already come to a stop and those in it were hurrying to put up the top as dave unfastened the straps on the wadsworth automobile the drops of rain came down faster than ever  we didnt get that up any too soon remarked the boys uncle when the job was finished  hadnt i better put up the side curtains too queried dave  youll have to put up everything youve got dave cried roger just look at whats coming  there was no need to look for already the rain was driving in on them working with all possible speed the boys soon adjusted the curtains  uncle dunston we cant run without chains if the road gets wet cried dave  i am going to run under yonder trees we can put the chains on there answered dunston porter and they started forward once again with the rain pelting down upon them furiously     chapter xi  from one hardship to another   i guess i was right about the rain remarked phil grimly as the drops pattered unceasingly on the cover of the automobile  you sure were phil cried belle its coming down just as hard as ever it can  if only the wind would stop blowing said jessie do you think there is any danger of our being blown over  oh it isnt as bad as all that answered dave  a few minutes later mr porter espied a suitable place under several large trees and here he brought the touringcar to a standstill then the basswood car come close alongside  going to put on the chains called out mr basswood to make himself heard above the noise of the elements  i think we had better returned daves uncle i imagine weve quite a hill to descend a little farther on  there were raincoats in each touringcar and these were now donned by dave and his uncle and by ben and his father then the chains for the back wheels for both automobiles were brought forth  even under the thick foliage of the trees the rain was coming down although of course not nearly as hard as on the roadway beyond the chains were straightened out on the grass and each automobile was backed up a little so that the articles might be fastened on the task took but a few minutes and then those who had accomplished it got back into the machines  ill lead the way called out mr porter you had better not follow me too closely  very well ill watch out answered mr basswood  uncle dunston dont you want to let me drive queried dave ive had a little more experience at it than you have had  i can do it dave was the reply but at the same time if you think it would be safer take the wheel i must own up that id rather be on a horse or behind one than steering a car like this in such a storm  dave squeezed himself into the drivers seat and a moment later they were off again over the plateau of the hill and then down the other side  the wind was blowing as furiously as ever and now from a distance came the low rumble of thunder  o dear what is that cried laura  i guess it was thunder but i dont think it will amount to anything returned roger  the bottom of the hill gained they traversed a narrow valley for a distance of seven or eight miles then came another climb over a winding highway which at certain points was filled with loose stones and dirt  be careful dave we dont want to do any skidding cautioned the youths uncle  im watching out all i can was the grim reply dave was bending over the steeringwheel trying his best to see through the windshield i guess ill have to open it a little he went on nodding in the direction of the glass  ill do it for you answered dunston porter and threw out the upper side of the shield  by this means dave was able to get a clear vision of the roadway directly in front of the machine but the opening of the windshield let in considerable of the driving rain  oh dave youll get wet from the knees down cried jessie solicitously  cant help it he replied i cant see with the windshield closed  the rumblings of thunder had increased and now from over a distant hill came various streaks of lightning the sky was much darker and in order to see better dave turned on the electric lights looking back those in the tonneau of the forward car saw that the basswood machine was also lighted by the time the top of the next hill was gained a distance of fully a mile the thunderstorm was on them in all its fury the wind tore through the woods sending leaves and small branches flying in all directions from the north and the west came vivid flashes of lightning followed by sharp claps of thunder which rolled and rumbled across the hills and mountains  o dear if we only had some place to stop cried jessie timorously  there isnt any sort of a building in sight replied dunston porter who had been looking on all sides for some time if there was id have dave head for it pretty quick  according to the map we ought to be within a few miles of simpsons corners said roger how about it dave  just what i was thinking answered our hero i was wondering if it wasnt on the other side of the next rise  they were running along another small valley at the end of which was a sharp turn to the left and a rise of several hundred feet here the downfall of rain had flooded the road for a considerable distance coming to this place dave had to slow down but he still kept on some power not wishing to get stuck  can you make it dave asked his uncle anxiously as the chains of the automobile ground deeply into the mud and loose stones  weve got to make it uncle dunston cried the boy grimly  the car proceeded more and more slowly even with the power turned on dave had been running in second gear but now he came down to low mud and stones flew in all directions while the water was splashed out on both sides as if coming from geysers then with one last effort the automobile left the level roadway and started up the hill beyond  the wadsworth car was almost at the top of the rise when a turn in the road enabled its occupants to see the second car  look burst out roger i do believe theyre stuck  stuck do you mean in that wet place asked dave quickly  thats it put in phil they are stuck just as sure as youre born he added a second later  the forward car had now reached a spot on the side of the hill which was comparatively level so that dave had no trouble in coming to a halt it was still raining as furiously as ever and the thunder and lightning were just as incessant looking down on the wet portion of the road below them they saw that the basswood car was standing still with water and mud half way up to the hubs  he has shut off the power thats no way to do cried dave he ought to keep his engine going and either try to go forward or backward if he stands still he will sink deeper than ever  hes trying to back now dave returned phil and he was right  soon they saw the wheels of the basswood car revolving rapidly and the turnout itself moved slowly to the rear then ben must have reversed the power for the car came forward but this time headed for the left side of the road  i dont think hell gain much by that move observed dave i tried it and found it rather soft over there  look he is backing again cried laura o dear whatever will he do if he gets stuck fast  let us hope that nothing like that happens answered her uncle gravely  but that was just what did happen and although both ben and his father did their best to free the car from the mud it was without avail they managed to get to within fifteen feet of the end of the wet place and there they stayed unable to budge either forward or backward  listen he is sounding his horn cried roger during a brief lull in the storm  i guess he wants us to come back and help pull him out answered dave and sounded a reply to show that he had heard the call of distress  what are you going to do davetry to turn around here or back down asked roger  oh its too narrow to turn here cried laura in alarm  youll have us all over in the ditch if you dont look out came from one of the others in the car  i see a little wider spot further ahead answered dave and turned on the power once more  soon he had reached the place in question and there by skillful maneuvering he managed to turn the touringcar the other way then he came down the hill slowly until within a few feet of the bad spot in the highway  hello there called out mr basswood i guess youll have to get out that towingrope again and give us a lift  just what i thought answered dave well have it out in a jiffy  he and his uncle alighted once more taking with them the towingrope that had been used before mr basswood was already out of the car standing in water and mud over his shoetops  here catch the rope called out our hero and sent one end whirling toward the other car in true cowboy fashiona trick he had learned while staying at star ranch  mr basswood caught the rope and soon had it adjusted to the front axle of the car in the meanwhile dave and his uncle fastened the other end to the rear axle of their own turnout  now then turn on your power when i sound my horn directed dave  right you are yelled back ben who was at the wheel  mr porter remained on the ground to watch proceedings while dave reentered the wadsworth machine and turned on the power then our hero sounded the horn and began to advance the towingrope strained and cracked and threatened for a moment to snap slowly the wadsworth car went ahead inch by inch the rear wheels of the basswood machine churned the water and mud furiously  say we dont seem to be getting out of this very fast remarked shadow who was in the rear car beside mrs basswood  put on all your power ben its the only thing you can do ordered the lads father  the rear wheels of the second machine ground deeper into the mud and loose stones throwing them and the water up into the air and even onto the cover of the machine the towingrope continued to creak ominously  be on guard everybody if that rope breaks cried mr basswood warningly he knew that if the towingline parted near one end or the other there was grave danger of the flying rope coming back to damage one of the machines  inch by inch the second car moved forward dave had not dared to turn on all power fearing to snap the towingline but now as the second machine gained a little headway he added power steadily  hurrah here we come shouted luke in a tone of relief and a few seconds later the basswood car rolled out of the water and mud to the comparatively dry roadway ahead  say that was some stuntto get out of there was shadows comment  im mighty glad the other car was here to help us answered ben if it hadnt been here i guess we would have stayed there for a while he added grimly  i think both our cars will need washing after this trip observed dave with a grin as he coiled up the towingline once more and stowed it away  this sure is some ending to this trip observed ben making a wry face  we havent seen the end of it yet ben answered dunston porter there may be worse roads than this ahead i dont believe they are very good around carpen falls  with the rain pelting down unceasingly the two cars proceeded on the journey the thunder and lightning had let up a little but now as the top of the next hill was gained it seemed to become more violent than before  oh this is dreadful cried jessie as a particularly bright flash lit up the interior of the automobile what if we should be struck  let us hope that nothing like that happens answered laura her face too showed her alarm  i think i saw some sort of a village ahead cried dave who had been peering intently through the windshield i think i saw the white steeple of a church  maybe its simpsons corners suggested belle  i hope there is a hotel there and a garage said dunston porter well want to have a chance to dry ourselves and get supper  then you dont think well reach carpen falls tonight questioned phil  i dont know what to think phil perhaps we may  mr porter did not finish what he was saying just at that instant came a vivid flash of lightning that nearly blinded them it was followed by an earsplitting crash of thunder then came another crash closer by and an instant later dave and his uncle saw a large tree fall directly toward the roadway in front of them     chapter xii  a stroke of lightning   look out  we are going into that tree  jam on both brakes dave just as hard as you can cried dunston porter  even before his uncle had spoken dave had pressed down both feet hard thus putting on the footbrake and releasing the gearclutch now his hand shot over to the emergency brake and this came up with all the power at his command but the grade was downward and the road slippery from the rain and instead of stopping the touringcar went on sliding through the mud and over the rocks until it was practically on top of the tree then came a jar that threw everybody forward the steeringwheel saved dave but his uncles elbow struck the windshield cracking it in several places  look weve run into a tree  did the lightning hit the machine  say roger take yourself off my feet will you  this last cry came from phil who was huddled up in a corner of the tonneau  it isnt me its the handbag phil gasped out roger who hung partly over the front seat of the touringcar  anybody hurt questioned dunston porter quickly as soon as the shock had come to an end  iithink i am all right uncle dunston panted laura but dear me wasnt it awful  i thought i was going to fly right over daves head wailed jessie who had come up behind the youth with a great thump oh dave did i hurt you  knocked a little of the wind out of me jessie thats all he answered but i wont mind that if only you are not hurt  say that was some stop believe me was phils grim comment as he managed to straighten up and look ahead stuffed mackerel what did we try to do daveclimb a tree  no we tried to take a running jump and go over it replied roger with a faint attempt at humor  sound the horn dave as loudly as you can cried his uncle quickly we must warn the others and thus admonished dave put his finger on the button of the electric horn and held it down for some time looking backward those in the wadsworth car soon saw the basswood machine come into sight and then slow down the heavy clap of thunder was now followed by another fierce downfall of rain while the sky grew blacker than ever in the midst of this outburst the second touringcar came slowly forward  did the lightning strike you yelled ben  no but we had a close call of it answered mr porter it hit this tree when we were less than one hundred and fifty feet away then the tree came down as you see and we ploughed right into it  phew thats some escape was mr basswoods comment anything broken  we dont know yet answered dave  he alighted from the car and his uncle did likewise an examination showed that one of the mudguards in front had been badly bent and that a headlight had snapped off but beyond this and the windshield the big touringcar seemed to be undamaged  im thankful its no worse remarked dunston porter  its too bad the light had to go returned dave it will make running at night rather dangerous until we can get it fixed  oh let us be thankful that no one was hurt cried laura  while dave and his uncle had been examining the car mr basswood and the others had been looking for some way around the tree which covered the roadway completely  i think i see a path through yonder trees said ben pointing to his left the ground seems to be pretty good there and i think the opening is plenty large enough for our cars  mr basswood moved forward in the direction his son indicated and soon called to ben to start the car he led the way on foot and the machine followed slowly they passed in and out among several trees and then emerged once more on the highway some distance beyond the obstruction  hurrah thats the way to do it cried luke now the others can back up and follow us  so they can answered shadow but what about leaving that tree in the roadway its mighty dangerous and will be more so after dark  we can notify the authorities at simpsons corners said mr basswood they can send somebody up here with a lantern  he went back to tell the others of what had been accomplished and soon the wadsworth car was backed out from between the branches of the tree that shut off the highway  well i think the rain is letting up a little anyway announced roger after the two touringcars were once more under way and he was right that last downfall seemed to clear the sky and soon they saw the clouds scattering  wet from end to end and covered with mud the two automobiles rolled into the little settlement that went by the name of simpsons corners here an old man named simpson kept a general store to which in the rear was attached a small livery stable and garage  you certainly must have had some trip over the hills in this storm remarked mr simpson after the party had trooped into his place its about as heavy a rainfall as we have had in some time where are you bound  we wanted to get to carpen falls if we could answered dunston porter but perhaps well stay in simpsons corners if there are any accommodations  aint no hotel here answered the storekeeper used to be one some years ago but it didnt pay so the feller that run it gave it up but mrs whittle serves lunch to travelers if you are hungry  me for mrs whittles whispered phil  good gracious phil you seem to be hungry all the time on this trip was belles goodnatured comment  maybe if we stay here an hour or two it will clear off said dave who was examining the sky closely i think the storm is shifting very rapidly  i believe youre right dave answered his uncle yes well stay here and get dried out a little if nothing else  it was learned that mrs whittles place was just across the street and the lady said she would be very glad to furnish them with a hot supper and added that they could come in and dry themselves in her sittingroom where she started an open fire the machines were placed in mr simpsons garage and they purchased from the storekeeper some gasoline and oil  only a little after five oclock announced roger i think by six oclock the storm will be over he added  while they were eating the supper provided by mrs whittle it stopped raining and a little later they saw the setting sun over the hills to the westward  how many miles is it to carpen falls from here asked luke  fourteen by the automobile blue book answered dave  and what of the road questioned ben  mr simpson said it wasnt so bad but that it might be worse answered dunston porter who had been interviewing the storekeeper and who had told the man about the fallen tree having learned that mr simpson was the head of the township committee  we dont want to get stuck especially after it gets dark said ben  i wish we could stay here sighed mrs basswood but there dont seem to be any accommodations  oh well get through come ahead cried dave if we dont reach carpen falls tonight mr and mrs wadsworth will worry about us  feeling in somewhat better spirits after having eaten and after having had an opportunity to dry themselves the tourists brought out their automobiles again and soon simpsons corners was left behind they had a long hill to climb and then the road wound in and out among some particularly rough rocks then they came out along the edge of a cliff with a vast panorama of woods and waters below them  oh isnt it perfectly lovely cried belle  if im not mistaken mirror lake lies off in that direction said dunston porter pointing with his hand that sheet of water away off yonder may be it  leaving the cliff the road wound in and out of the forest for a distance of several miles then they came to another little valley in which the highway was wet and in some spots suspiciously spongy  now then dave be careful warned his uncle we dont want to get stuck if we can possibly help it  ill do my best uncle dunston was the answer  with the wheels sucking and sousing in the mud the wadsworth machine moved forward as rapidly as the conditions would permit close behind was the basswood car and this time ben took care not to let the engine slow down too much once dave was afraid that he was going to be stuck but in a few seconds the danger was past and in two minutes more they were out on the solid roadway once more  we are coming to some sort of a settlement cried mr porter after several miles more had been covered see there it isright down at the foot of this hill  it must be carpen falls announced dave see there are the falls off to the right and he pointed to where a fairsized stream of water came down between the trees and fell over the rocks the falls were fifteen to twenty feet high and made a beautiful sight  carpen falls was a settlement of some importance for the campers on the lakes for miles around came there to do their trading there were two general stores one containing the postoffice and also a blacksmiths shop livery stable and garage combined and a small summer hotel  oh look my father and mother cried jessie as the two machines rolled up to the hotel  to the surprise of all mr and mrs wadsworth stood on the piazza watching their approach  oh we thought you would never get here cried mrs wadsworth in relief we thought sure you had had some sort of accident on the road  and how is it you are here asked dave quickly  we came in this morning to do some trading at the store answered mr wadsworth we were going back when it began to storm so hard that we decided to stay here until the rain let up and until you arrived it certainly was a hard downpour  we came pretty near having several accidents answered ben and then after the party had alighted they told of the various happenings on the journey  we can remain here all night if you want to announced the jewelry manufacturer but if you would rather go on to the bungalows i think we can make it there are two old stages here and the drivers are perfectly willing to make the trip  now we have gotten so far let us finish the trip urged laura i think i would rather be at the bungalows than at this hotel she added with a look around that hostelrya place that was not particularly inviting  but youll want supper first wont you questioned mrs wadsworth  we had something to eat at simpsons corners answered her daughter  the stages that mr wadsworth had mentioned were certainly oldfashioned and dilapidated but each was drawn by a pair of sturdy horses and the drivers said that they were perfectly safe and could make the journey to mirror lake without trouble so having transferred the baggage from the automobiles to these ancient vehicles and having placed the touringcars in the garage with orders to have the damaged car repaired our friends piled into the turnouts and then with various calls to the animals and loud crackings of the whips the two stages started for bear camp     chapter xiii  at bear camp   talk about the oldtime coaching days remarked dave i dont believe they were any worse than this  oh dave you mustnt find fault cried jessie well soon be there i hope  providing we dont go down in some hole and break off a wheel put in roger say this road is some rough  ill have it rolled down for you the next time roger cried phil gaily just imagine yourself in the wild west in one of the oldtime overland coaches with the indians in full pursuit how about that belle  it sounds good enough for a dime novel answered the girl from the west personally i never saw any indians in pursuit of a stagecoach or anything else the indians around star ranch were as peaceable as one could wish  over the rough and rather narrow trail bumped the two stagecoaches our friends frequently found themselves bounced off the seats and more than once they were in danger of cracking their heads against the roofs of the turnouts it was growing dark and the only lights the drivers had were their smoking lanterns inside of the stagecoaches the boys had their hand flashlights which they used occasionally to illuminate the scene  never mind dont you care cried phil and then added whats the matter with a song  lets give them our old oak hall song exclaimed dave and a moment later he started their old favorite sung to the tune of auld lang syne      oak hall we never shall forget       no matter where we roam     it is the very best of schools       to us its just like home     then give three cheers and let them ring       throughout this world so wide     to let the people know that we       elect to here abide  oh how splendid was belles comment please sing it again and they did  then they followed with a number of familiar songs the sound was caught up by those in the second coach and soon they too were singing lustily  goshallhemlock was the comment of the stagedriver of the forward coach that there singin is bettern a nigger minstrels  better join in suggested dave and then started up with the suwanee river and to the surprise of all the old stagedriver broke in with a heavy bass voice which really balanced the others quite well  the storm was a thing of the past and as night came on the thin crescent of the new moon and numberless stars showed themselves  o my look  isnt that perfectly grand  i dont wonder they call it mirror lake  such were some of the cries from the girls as the first of the stagecoaches rolled out on the edge of the sheet of water by which the bungalows were located here at a certain point they could gaze down the full length of the lake in spite of the rain that had fallen the surface of the water seemed unusually smooth and it glistened in the light of the moon and the stars like silver  oh its just too splendid for anything exclaimed jessie as she clapped her hands in delight what a beautiful place to come to  i dont see how it could be any prettier than it is added laura  why its just like a scene from fairyland declared belle oh i know im going to have just the nicest time ever while im here  i see the bungalows cried roger and he pointed to a number of lights twinkling between the trees  i told mary the hired girl to light up so we could see where we were going said mrs wadsworth  this is about as far as we can go with the stages announced the driver of the first turnout as he came to a halt youll have to walk the rest of the distance bill and me will help you with the traps  soon the other stage came up and all on board alighted the two stagedrivers took the heaviest of the suitcases while the boys and mr porter and mr basswood carried the others mr and mrs wadsworth led the way along a trail that was still somewhat wet and slippery  its right in the woods thats sure declared roger  what do you think of it asked dave as they approached the two bungalows which stood only a short distance apart  oh i like it very much i think we ought to have a dandy time here dave  just what i was thinking  their approach had been noticed by the servant girls and this couple came out to meet them then the two drivers were paid and they returned to their stages and started back for carpen falls  im glad that journey is ended remarked jessie as she sank into a rustic rockingchair my but it was quite an adventure now wasnt it  it certainly was jessie answered dave i dont suppose youll want to go back by automobile  not unless you guarantee the weather dave she answered with a smile  the basswood family along with shadow and luke had gone off to the second bungalow leaving the others at the one over which mrs wadsworth was to preside the lady of the bungalow showed the girls and the boys the various rooms which they were to occupy as all of the other baggage had arrived from the railroad station two days before the tourists lost no time in getting rid of their damp garments and donning others more comfortable after that all made an inspection of the bungalow and then trooped over to the other building  say this suits me down to the ground said luke it couldnt be better  i noticed a number of canoes and rowboats at the dock said shadow we are bound to have some fine times out on that lake  and did you notice the bathhouses added ben that means good times swimming  providing the water isnt too cold said phil in some of these lakes among the mountains it gets pretty cold dont you know especially if the lake happens to be fed by springs  oh pshaw whos afraid of a little cold water cried his chum disdainfully  any danger of a bear coming to eat us up queried luke  oh dont say bears again cried jessie i dont want to hear of them much less see them  say that puts me in mind of a story cried shadow eagerly once a bear got away from his keeper and wandered around a little new england village until he came to a cottage where an old lady lived all of the villagers were scared to death and some of them started to get their shotguns and rifles with which to kill mr bruin but the old lady had her own idea of what to do she grabbed up a broomstick and began to hammer that bear right on his nose and would you believe me mr bruin got so scared that he ran away and then went straight back to his keeper and allowed himself to be chained up again  shadow is that a true story or a madeup yarn asked laura  it was told to me down east and they said it was absolutely true was the answer they even gave me the name of the old lady  say shadow it was a wonder they didnt give you the name of the broomstick said dave and with that there was a short laugh  dave roger and phil had been given two rooms between them one was considerably smaller than the other and this dave occupied on the other side of a little hallway were the girls while mr and mrs wadsworth and dunston porter occupied large chambers next to the livingroom in the rear were two tiny rooms for the hired help at the other bungalow ben and his friends occupied three little rooms while mr and mrs basswood had a large apartment off to one side at this bungalow there was an extra large livingroom in which was placed among other things a small upright piano somewhat out of tune but still usable  now dont you boys dare to play any tricks tonight said laura when she and her girl friends were about to retire you just keep your tricks for some other time  all right laura ill make roger and phil be good answered her brother i guess we are all tired enough to sleep soundly and he certainly spoke the truth as far as he personally was concerned for hardly had his head touched the pillow than he was off to the land of dreams  the boys were up bright and early on the following morning it was a beautiful day with the sun shining brightly and a gentle breeze blowing from the west to be sure the forest back of the bungalow was still wet but it had dried off down at the shore of the lake and at the dock where were located two rowboats and several canoes  let us all go out for a row after breakfast suggested dave it will limber us up  the aroma of freshlymade coffee and of sizzling bacon filled the air between the bungalows and soon the young folks who had gone down to the dock to look at the lake and the craft on it came trooping back for their breakfast  dont you think it would be more pleasant if we could all eat together mrs wadsworth said laura while they were partaking of the repast  perhaps so laura and maybe well be able to arrange it answered the lady mrs basswood spoke about it they have a large livingroom there that might be utilized as a diningroom for all and in pleasant weather we might all eat out on our wide porch  thats the talk cried dave id rather eat outdoors any time if the weather would permit  oh yes let us eat on the porch cried jessie and so later on it was arranged the entire party eating indoors only when it was wet  the canoes had been turned over and were perfectly dry but the two rowboats had to be bailed out various parties were made up to go out and presently dave found himself in one of the canoes with jessie as his sole companion  any particular place youd like to go questioned our hero as he dipped his paddle into the lake and with a firm sweep sent the long and graceful canoe gliding away from the little dock  supposing we go along the shore dave answered the girl i would like to see how it looks beyond this cove  all right ill keep as close to shore as possible he replied and then they set off leaving the others to go where they pleased  you dont suppose theres any danger of our upsetting queried jessie  we wont upset if you keep perfectly still answered dave i think i can manage this craft all right  on and on they went over the smooth surface of the lake passing at times close to the shore and under the overhanging branches of trees which at some points were very thick in spots the water was shallow and so clear that they could see the bottom with ease and occasionally catch sight of fishes darting in one direction or another  i think were going to have some fine times fishing up here declared the youth as a beautiful trout flashed by only a few feet away  they were coming around a long curve of the shore just ahead was a high point of rocks on which somebody had erected a rude summerhouse of untrimmed treebranches  what a cute little place declared jessie in delight  it must belong to some of the cottages around the bend answered dave i believe there is quite a colony somewhere up here  they passed around the point of rocks and a few minutes later came in sight of several rustic cottages set in a grove of trees in front of the cottages was a long narrow dock at which rested several craft including a fairsized motorboat  hello i didnt know there was a motorboat on this lake exclaimed dave whoever owns it must have had some job getting it here  no one was at the dock or on the motorboat and passing that point dave sent his canoe along another picturesque bit of the lake shore then as they made another turn they came in sight of a log cabin which had evidently been erected many years before  well i never dave what in the world are those folks doing  the cry came from jessie and not without reason for they had suddenly come in sight of three or four men and several ladies all stationed in front of the old log cabin one of the men was dressed in the garb of a woodsman and he held a large ax in his hands raised over his head as if to strike down one of the younger ladies then another of the ladies rushed up and fell on her knees with upraised hands in front of the man  hello i know these people cried dave in astonishment they are the movingpicture actors who were on board that burning steam yacht     chapter xiv  something of a quarrel   the movingpicture actors dave queried jessie in wonder  yes dont you see the man over there with the camera he is grinding out a picture of that scene  o my is that the way they do it returned the girl with interest ive read about it but i never had a chance before to see how it was done  dave brought the canoe to a standstill and both watched the little drama being enacted before the old log cabin our hero saw that the young lady in the scene was della ford and the elderly lady the one she had called aunt bess  all over exclaimed a man who stood beside the individual at the movingpicture camera the latter had stopped turning the handle of the machine and now he proceeded to cover the whole outfit with a black cloth  well im glad thats over those in the canoe heard della ford exclaim come aunt bess let us go back to the water the young lady turned from the group and as she did so she caught sight of the canoe and its occupants she stared for an instant and then her face lit up  mr porter is it possible she exclaimed i certainly didnt expect to meet you up here aunt bess here is the young gentleman who saved us from drowning  you dont tell me came from the aunt and then both hurried their steps toward a tiny dock beside which the canoe was resting  i certainly didnt expect to meet you again and away up here in the adirondacks answered dave with a smile and then as the young movingpicture actress came closer he introduced the girls to each other  this is my aunt mrs bess ford announced della to jessie i suppose you saw us acting just now  we did answered jessie it was quite interesting  i suppose it is to an outsider responded the young actress it gets to be an old story with us doesnt it aunt bess  oh i dont mind it returned the aunt id rather be up here in the woods acting for the movies than down in some stuffy theater in this warm weather  did mr porter tell you what a grand hero he is miss wadsworth asked della ford turning to jessie oh hes just the grandest hero i ever met and she beamed on dave  come now miss ford please dont mention it again expostulated dave i didnt do so very much and you know it  isnt saving my life a good deal demanded the young actress archly  oh i dont mean that what i mean is that anybody could have done what i did  but you did it young man and you ought to have credit for it put in mrs ford bluntly it was certainly a brave thing to do  it was and i shall never cease to thank mr porter for it went on della ford and she gave dave another warm look at which he blushed more than ever  this look was not lost on jessie and she bit her lip in a way that showed she was not altogether pleased then mr appleby the manager of the movingpicture company came forward followed by several others  this certainly is a surprise said the manager first we meet on the atlantic ocean and next in the heart of the adirondacks  its like some of your changes in the movies answered dave smiling you show us a shipwreck and then presto you transfer us to an office in wall street you must have to jump around pretty lively to get all the scenes of a drama  we dont take just one drama explained mr appleby we sometimes do half a dozen or more for instance while we are up here we are going to take the outdoor scenes to fifteen or twenty dramas then well go back to the city and finish up with a number of interiors  wouldnt you like to be a movingpicture actor mr porter asked della ford eagerly you could go into a nautical rescue scene very nicely  there you go again miss ford returned dave just the same it must be some fun being in a moving picture  oh dave dont you go into any moving picture interrupted jessie quickly  why what would be the harm he questioned  oh no particular harm i suppose only i shouldnt like it she answered in a low tone  you might get into our next scene went on della ford ignoring jessies remark we are going to have one that will show several canoes besides the motorboat tied up at the dock around the bend  well ill think about it answered dave hesitatingly and then he went on to mr appleby by the way is ward porton still with you  he is with my company yes but he is not here just now was the reply i expect him in a week or so  i met him in crumville where i live  is that so i thought he had gone to his old home down east however it doesnt matter he has a right to go where he pleases  by the way mr appleby i would like to speak to you in private for a moment went on dave and leaping ashore he drew the manager to one side  what is it  you have a new member of your company a young fellow named link merwell  yes what of it  link merwell is a criminala fugitive from justice answered dave and then he gave the man some of the particulars already known to my readers  if what you say is true porter i dont want that fellow in my company said mr appleby warmly what do you want me to do when he comes hold him a prisoner  i wish you would do that and let us know mr wadsworth will take care of merwell  all right ill do itif he shows up but he may not do thatif he has found out that you are in this vicinity added the manager  im thinking he will make himself scarce returned dave with a grim smile  in the meantime della ford had come down to the side of the canoe  where are you staying miss wadsworth questioned the young actress  at a bungalow near the end of the lake returned jessie and explained about the location and who were in the party  oh how delightful you will surely have a splendid time here we are located in the cottage around the bend where you perhaps saw the motorboat tied up i am sure well be very glad to have you call on us  thank you perhaps well get this way again some time returned jessie somewhat coolly  you must come and see us mr porter by all means went on the young moving picture actress when our hero returned to the side of the canoe and bring the others along too i liked the appearance of your chums you all seemed to be so jolly  dave dont you think we ought to be going questioned jessie  just as you say he answered and dipped his paddle into the lake  then you dont want to stay and take part in that other picture called out della ford as the canoe began to leave the dock  not today miss ford called back dave but i may get into one of your pictures just for the fun of it  do and dont forget to call at the cottage returned the young lady and then the canoe passed out of hearing of those on the shore and a dozen strong strokes of the paddle sent the frail craft out of sight around another headland  that certainly was a surprise was daves comment as they passed along under some overhanging trees i never dreamed of coming across that movingpicture company in such a fashion as that  what did you get out for asked jessie curiously  i wanted to ask mr appleby about link merwell he didnt know link was a criminal he says if link shows himself up here he will make him a prisoner and notify us  isnt it queer that link should join that company  rather although i suppose he has got to do something for a livingand i guess he isnt the fellow to pick out hard work acting in the movies must be easyand lots of fun in the bargain  you are not going to act with them are you dave questioned jessie with her big round eyes full upon him  oh i dont know i think perhaps it might be sport  i dont think so  miss ford tried to make a regular hero out of me i wish she wouldnt do that  well it was a grand thing for you to doto pull her out of the water dave and she ought to be exceedingly grateful just the same i dont think i like her very much and jessie pouted a little  is that so why i thought she was real nice  shes awfully forward  i didnt notice that but maybe its her calling makes her so an actress cant be just like other people  i think she might be when she wasnt acting anyway i think she was toowell too gushing  i noticed that you didnt give her any invitation to call when she invited you went on dave after a pause during which they left the vicinity of the shore and swept out into mirror lake  why should i mamma might not approve of it i dont think she has a very high opinion of movingpicture actors and actresses  and i guess you havent either jessie returned dave somewhat bluntly  oh i dont know about that and the girl tossed her head they have a right to act in the movies if they want to theyve got to earn their living some way i suppose dont you think we had better be getting back dave  why its early yet jessie  never mind i think i would rather go back now that the sun is overhead it is quite warm  dave started to answer and then suddenly shut his mouth tightly the paddle went deeper into the water and the canoe shot around quickly in a long semicircle  oh dave dont tip us over  dont fear the canoe wont go over if you sit perfectly still he replied in a tone that was somewhat unsympathetic  are you going back to the bungalows  why certainly that was what you wantedto go back wasnt it  we havent got to race back have we  im not racing but i thought you wanted to get out of this hot sun  dave i think youre angry with me returned jessie reproachfully but she did not raise her eyes as before instead she kept them fastened on the bottom of the canoe  angry what foolishness what is there for me to be angry about  oh you know well enough  i dont see why you should feel so cut up over miss ford i cant help it if she is gratefulas you put itfor my saving her from drowning can i  oh it isnt that dave of course she ought to be grateful but youyou jessies voice broke a little and she could not go on  me i havent done a thing didnt you hear me tell her to quit it  oh it wasnt what you said it wasbut never mind let us get back to the bungalow and jessie kept her eyes on the bottom of the canoe refusing to look at her companion  and im sure i didnt do a thing either now please dont be silly and  dave silly  i didnt mean that exactly jessie but you know  its not a bit nice for you to call me silly retorted the girl her face flaming  i didnt mean just that jessie i meant  you did mean it you think i am silly do you all right you can think so please paddle straight for our dock  now jessie began dave entreatingly  i dont want to hear another word take me straight to the dock retorted the girl  very well if you wont listen to me you dont have to answered dave and now he too showed that he was completely out of sorts  he struck the paddle deeper than ever into the water and with long telling strokes the canoe shot forward over the lake in the direction of bear camp     chapter xv  visitors   several days went by and during that time the coldness that had sprung up between dave and jessie increased although both did their best to hide it from the others  one afternoon while the girl was off with laura and belle for a tramp along a brook that flowed into the lake not far from the bungalows mr appleby came into the cove in his motorboat bringing with him an old hunter and guide of that vicinity named tad rason and also della ford and her aunt bess they found dave roger and phil at the dock fishing  any luck called out the manager of the movingpicture company cheerily  some but not a great deal answered dave and he and the others pulled in their lines so that they might not become entangled in the propeller of the boat  youll have to go to the other shore for good fishing said tad rason who had already shown himself at the bungalows and made himself known  the fish are mighty scarce around here  id like to go fishing sometime exclaimed della with a smile and a nod to dave and his chums i never caught a fish in my life mr porter couldnt you show me how to do it she asked sweetly  i might if the fish was willing to be caught answered dave with a grin  oh i am sure i could catch one if you would only show me how returned the young actress  well if you are going to fish with worms youve got to first learn how to put one on a hook said phil  o my im sure that i dont want to put a squirming worm on any hook cried della with a slight shudder i want to fish with one of those beautiful flies its so much more interesting  i came down on a peculiar errand broke in mr appleby after he had tied up at the dock i would like to borrow a little furniture from you for one day only  furniture queried roger  yes you see we have an interior scene up at our cottage but we havent got just the furniture that the drama calls for i noticed when i stopped at your bungalows yesterday that you had several pieces that are just the ones required if you will lend them to me today i will see that you get them back safely by tomorrow  youll have to see mrs wadsworth and mrs basswood about that returned dave not but that i think it will be all right he added hastily  come up here to do some shooting i suppose just as soon as the season opens remarked tad rason to the boys  well we wont object to bringing down a deer or two if we get the chance answered our hero but i rather imagine deer are scarce around here i havent seen any of them yet  oh youll find plenty of deer up at the head of the lake returned the old hunter they dont come down here much they always left this spot for the bears  the bears oh mr rason you surely dont mean that cried della ford  but i certainly do maam this was always a great place for bears thats why they call this end of the lake bear camp i shot one of em here last winter and i got an old shebear and her two cubs here two years afore that  we havent seen any traces of bears said phil  youll see em sooner or later returned the old hunter with conviction they are bound to come here  what makes you say they are bound to come questioned dave curiously is there any particular reason for it  i think there is young man so far as i can understand it i think the bears come here in the fall to get certain roots and herbs that they like to eat i think they find more of em around here than they do anywhere else and thats what fetches em  and do you think the bears keep the deer away from here questioned roger  i dont know as to that but i do know that bears and deer dont mix very well answered tad rason  while mr appleby was negotiating with mrs wadsworth and mrs basswood for the loan of several pieces of rustic furniture which the bungalows contained della ford and her aunt visited with the boys the young actress wanted to know all about what the young folks at the bungalows had been doing and expressed her delight at the cosiness of the place and its beautiful surroundings  mr appleby aided by tad rason carried the borrowed furniture down to the motorboat there was more of it than the manager had at first anticipated taking and as a consequence the craft was well loaded  i dont see how we are going to sit in there with all that furniture packed around us exclaimed della in dismay as she viewed the situation  you might sit in that rockingchair on the bow suggested phil with a broad smile and at this suggestion there was a general laugh  no thank you i have no desire to be spilled overboard i went overboard once and that was quite enough answered the young actress  ill tell you what we might do answered dave we could take you and your aunt in one of the rowboats and have the motorboat tow it  oh that would be lovely cried della what do you say aunt bess shall we do it  im willing if it is safe answered the aunt i dont want to go to the bottom of this lake any more than i wanted to go to the bottom of the atlantic ocean  its perfectly safe answered dave the boats a good broad one so there is no danger of its tipping overnot unless mr appleby makes a quick turn and i dont suppose he will do that  if i pull your rowboat ill be as steady as an old freight engine was the managers reply its very kind of you boys to do this  the best and broadest of the rowboats was brought around and della ford and her aunt were assisted into the craft then after the boys had procured a pair of oars they too embarked and the motorboat headed back for the moving picture companys camp  hello hello where are you going  the cry came from the shore at a point where the brook ran into the lake and looking in that direction those in the rowboat saw jessie laura and belle just emerging from behind some brushwood and rocks the girl from the west was swinging her broad hat vigorously  we are going to take these ladies home yelled dave well be back soon  oh see the motorboat is loaded with furniture exclaimed daves sister what a funny sight  i didnt know those folks were going to visit us today was jessies comment and her face showed she was not at all pleased  see they have miss ford and her aunt with them said belle miss ford is a stunning girl isnt she  she certainly is quite goodlooking returned laura what do you say jessie  oh i dont think she is any betterlooking than lots of other girls i know returned jessie rather coldly come on lets get back to the bungalows this long tramp has tired me dreadfully  you do look rather pale said belle kindly dont you feel well  ive got a little headache thats all i think ill go back to the bungalow and rest returned jessie and went on ahead soon disappearing within one of the buildings  do you know laura i dont believe jessie likes that miss ford a bit was the comment of the western girl when she was alone with daves sister  why shouldnt she like miss ford belle she seems to be a nice enough girl and i dont think the fact she acts in the movies ought to be held against her  i dont think it is that laura it is something else  something else what do you mean  oh i dont know that i ought to mention it come on let us get up to the bungalows  but belle do tell me what you think pleaded laura you know you havent any right to keep back anything from me and she caught her chum around the shoulder and held her tightly  well if you must know its this jessie cant forget that dave saved miss ford from drowning  oh i see what you mean belle you think that because dave did that jessie thinks he might get more interested in her than would otherwise be the case  not exactly that laura jessie may imagine that miss ford is quite interested in dave  illustration hello hello where are you goingpage 153  oh i see daves sister was silent for a moment but you forget one thing belle dave saved jessies life too dont you remember that i told you of it a gasoline tank exploded and she was in danger of being burned to death when dave jumped in and  oh yes i remember that very well and you may be sure that jessie remembers it too but then this rescue was so much more recent  at these words laura grew more thoughtful than ever and suddenly she caught her western chum by the arm and pulled belle into a path leading to the dock  what now laura  oh belle do you really think there is anything in that do you think that is what has made jessie act so queerly for the last couple of days i noticed she was not herself at all and dave seemed to be different too  if you want the truth of it i do think there is some sort of a quarrel between them of course i am not sure it is on miss fords account but they dont act as they used to  its too bad and lauras face showed great seriousness i wouldnt have anything come between dave and jessie for the world  it would be a great shame there is no doubt of that answered the girl from the ranch  when the pair entered the bungalow they found that jessie had gone to her room she was lying on a couch and though the light was dim laura could see quite plainly that her friend had been crying  you poor dear said daves sister going up and placing her hand on jessies forehead is your headache worse  not much laura was the answer jessie turned over with her face toward the wall i just want to be left alone awhile and then ill be all right  dont you want me to get you anything at all  no just leave me alone thats all  laura stood by the side of the couch for a moment she was on the point of speaking again she wanted very much to relieve her mind but concluded that it might not be a wise thing to do she tiptoed to the doorway where she encountered belle and both walked to another part of the bungalow  and do you really think it was a headache laura whispered belle when the two were safe out of earshot of any of the others  she may have a headache but i think it is more than that was the reply from daves sister oh belle if matters are as you think they are what in the world are we going to do  i dont know of anything to do laura i dont believe it would be a wise thing to say anything to jessie  then suppose i talk to dave  you can suit yourself about that but if i were you id be very careful boys are as touchy as girls when it comes to a subject like that  do you really think so  i certainly do  then i will be very cautious but ive just got to say something declared laura     chapter xvi  a strange communication   the three boys had quite some sport going up the lake with della ford and her aunt as passengers being towed by the motorboat they had nothing to do but take it easy and they spent the time in chatting of things in general and of moving pictures and fun on mirror lake in particular  we would be pleased to have you come up some evening and take dinner with us said della ford after consulting with the manager of the movingpicture company come up and bring that boy with his banjo and well have a lot of fun  all right well be up some time answered phil  and dont forget mr porter that some day youre to show me how to catch a fish called out the young actress  all right i wont forget answered dave and then the three boys pushed the rowboat away from the dock and started upon the return to bear camp  shes a mighty pleasant girl thats sure remarked phil as he took it easy on the stern seat while dave and roger plied the oars  i think dave has made a hit with her responded roger with a sly wink at the shipowners son  if you dont look out ill make a hit with somebody in this boat declared dave his face flushing you attend to your rowing or we wont get back in time for dinner  i thought you said that fellow ward porton was going to join the company up here remarked phil by way of changing the subject  all i know about it is what mr appleby told me returned dave id like firstrate to see him again and ask him some more about link merwell  do you think link will come up here asked roger  i dont know what to think he is likely to do almost anything but i doubt whether he will want to place himself in any position where we can get hold of him  what a fool link has been was phils comment  when the rowboat returned to the dock at the camp the boys found only laura and belle on the veranda of one of the bungalows  wheres jessie asked dave  she has a headache and is lying down answered laura and looked at her brother closely  thats too bad he answered cant you do anything for it  she wanted to be left alone dave  i wonder if i cant do something  i dont think so  roger and phil sat down on the veranda and were soon joined by luke and shadow  where is ben questioned roger  he went to carpen falls with his father and mr porter for the mail answered mrs basswood who had joined the group  i hope i get a letter from daddy cried belle why just think i havent had a letter for three days she pouted  id like a letter too put in phil i havent had a word from home since i left and his face clouded as he remembered his fathers troubles over the land question  dave had been seated on the end of the piazza but now he arose and walked over to the other bungalow here he met mrs wadsworth just coming from jessies room  its only a slight headache dave said the lady in answer to his question i think jessie will be all right in the morning she thought she had better stay where she is this evening  i wish i could help her mrs wadsworth returned the youth quickly isnt there something i can do  nothing that i know of was the reply and then mrs wadsworth walked out of the bungalow to join her husband who was smoking a cigar in a little pavilion that overlooked the lake  dave took a turn or two across the livingroom he was very much disturbed in mind and felt that he ought to do something  ill take a chance and knock on the door anyhow he told himself and moving to the door of jessies room he tapped lightly then as there was no response he tapped again  who is it came from the girl  it is i jessie cant i do something for you  no i dont think you can she returned quickly  the others told me you had a headache im very sorry to hear that i wish i could do something to make you feel better  you cant do a thing  i might get a hotwater bottle or some chopped ice ororsomething he faltered not knowing how to go on  oh dave dont be silly  silly so now im the one whos silly am i he returned but there was more of slyness than bitterness in his tone  dave porter was there ever such a boy now you must go away and leave me alone  all right jessie if you want me to go away ill go just the same i want you to know that im awfully awfully sorry that you have a headache id rather have it myself  would you indeed there was a creaking of the couch as if jessie had turned and was sitting up well i dont want you to have a headache they are not a bit nice they are horrid  are you lying down  i was lying down  well if youre not so very very sick jessie wont you just come to the door a minute i want to tell you something went on dave after a moments hesitation  the girl came slowly to the door and opened it several inches showing a mass of disheveled hair and cheeks that had traces of tears on them  what do you want to tell me  a good many things jessie returned dave in a low tone first of all i dont want you to be angry with me i simply cant bear it and besides i dont think you have anything to be angry about  oh indeed  no i dont i think you misunderstand me why jessie i wouldnt have anything come between us for the world and you know it  do i the door opened a little wider  yes you do you know there isnt any one that i care for onetenth part as much as i care for you i didnt go up the lake this afternoon because i particularly wanted to and those people came here of their own accord  yes dave  and i dont want you to act so cold jessie why it cuts a fellow to the heart if i thought  a wild yell followed by several screams of terror from outside interrupted the conversation dave stopped short to listen and jessie threw wideopen the door to do likewise another yell rang out fierce and penetrating and then came several more screams and a rush of footsteps  oh dave what can it mean cried jessie in sudden alarm  i dont know i guess i had better find out he returned and ran toward the front doorway  be careful dave be careful cautioned the girl pleadingly maybe its a bear  in that case id better get one of the guns he returned  the party had brought a number of firearms with them and several of the pieces were hung up on the walls loaded and ready for use catching up a doublebarreled shotgun dave ran outside with jessie at his heels the commotion had continued and now the youth found himself confronted by his sister and belle  what is it laura  i dont know exactly but it certainly was something awful  i think it must have been a wild man broke in belle anyhow if it wasnt i dont know what else it could have been  the other boys had left the vicinity of the bungalows and were running toward the woods with mr wadsworth following them  they saw something but they dont know what it was said mrs wadsworth who was plainly much agitated it let out the most awful yells you ever heard  maybe it was that wild man wilbur poole exclaimed dave he might have followed us to this place you know  he ran on and soon joined the other boys and mr wadsworth who had come to a halt at the edge of the clearing on which the bungalows were located  i think he disappeared over here cried shadow  and i think he went this way returned luke  when i saw him last he was by yonder bushes were rogers words  i think he went over there just as shadow said came from phil  who was it asked dave wilbur poole  whoever he was he had the most outlandish rig on a fellow ever saw exclaimed luke i think he must have borrowed it from some scarecrow  if that was wilbur poole we had better keep our eyes open for him said dave seriously he had not forgotten the trouble which the wild man who called himself the king of sumatra had given him and his chums in the past  we were all sitting there enjoying ourselves when we heard the fellow give an awful yell or two explained phil then he came dancing out from behind some bushes waving a sort of sceptre in the air he nearly scared the girls into fits and that is what made them scream then he caught up a stick of wood from the pile yonder and disappeared between the trees i guess he must have imagined he was a wild indian on the warpath  i am afraid if that poor fellow isnt captured he will cause us a good deal of worry was mr wadsworths comment as long as he is at large there is no telling what he will do  if it really is wilbur poole we ought to let the pooles know about it said dave  the matter was talked over for some time and then after another search through the edge of the woods and among the rocks and brushwood of that vicinity the boys and mr wadsworth returned to the bungalows they found all of the girls and mrs wadsworth on one of the verandas discussing the situation even jessie had joined the group declaring that the alarm had scared most of her headache away  oh i was so frightened when i first saw the manif it really was a man cried laura  he looked more like an orangoutang declared the girl from the west if i had met him out on the range and if i had had a gun with me i surely would have shot at him  i brought a gun along returned dave exhibiting the weapon i thought it was a bear scare  the scare was the topic of conversation all through the dinner hour and it was decided that a letter should be posted to mr aaron poole the following morning acquainting him with what had occurred  its queer that my husband and ben and mr porter dont come remarked mrs basswood when the meal was nearly over and it was growing dark  its quite a walk to carpen falls said dave and you must remember the trail isnt any too good in some spots  i think i see them coming now announced roger a minute later and he was right soon ben and his father and dunston porter came into full view near the end of the lake  talk about an adventure cried ben as they came up who do you think we met  the wild man burst out several of those present  oh then he was here was he was it wilbur poole  we are not so sure about that we didnt get a very good look at him he had on such a queer outfit that he was completely disguised  thats just it broke in dunston porter we couldnt tell who he was either he appeared right in front of us on the trail flourishing a big stick he let out a whoop like an indian gave a leap or two into the air and then dashed out of sight behind some bushes  he didnt attack you did he questioned mrs basswood anxiously  no returned her husband but all the same i didnt like his actions he might have done some serious damage with the stick he carried  that man whoever he is ought to be put under guard declared phil and then he added quickly did you get any letters ben  oh yes several of them here they are and placing his hand in the pocket of his jacket the youth brought forth over a dozen epistles  there was a wild scramble and the letters were quickly distributed  oh good heres a letter from dear dad exclaimed belle excuse me while i read it and she quickly tore open the communication  all of the girls had letters and there was also one for dave and another for phil as our hero looked at the communication addressed to him he could not help but start he thought he recognized the handwriting as that of link merwell  i wonder what he has got to say now he mused and then as the others began reading their letters he opened the envelope and took out the single sheet it contained  in a large heavy hand were scrawled these words        i think before long you will be getting what is coming to       you you poorhouse nobody  there was no signature     chapter xvii  the swimming race   dave read the brief communication over several times as he did so his face showed both perplexity and anger roger who had received no letter and who therefore had nothing to read looked at him curiously  no bad news i hope he said as he came up to dave  i think its another communication from that goodfornothing link merwell returned dave here you can read it for yourself and he passed the letter over  the senators son read the scrawl and his face showed his disgust  i guess youre right dave it must be from link merwell  link merwell broke in shadow who sat on a bench near by what about that rascal have you heard something further of him  oh it doesnt amount to anything returned dave hastily and taking the communication he thrust it into his pocket dont say anything about it he added to roger in a low tone  all right i wont if you want it that way answered his chum just the same dave this looks to me as if link was plotting once more to do you an injury  if so roger would he be fool enough to notify me beforehand queried our hero as the pair walked a little distance away from the others  there is no telling what a fellow of links stamp might do he is just fool enough to brag about what he hoped to do rather than go and do it its an outrage that he should call you a poorhouse nobody  id thrash him for it if i could get my hands on him returned dave quickly and his face showed deep resentment he had not forgotten how in years gone by his enemies had taunted him with being a poorhouse nobody and how he had had to fight his way through until his identity had been established  anyway dave this gives you a chance to be on your guard went on roger if i were you id keep my eyes wide open for link merwell  i certainly shall roger and if i can lay my hands on him i wont be as considerate as i was on cave island was the answer ill hold him until i can turn him over to the authorities he ought to be keeping company with jasniff in jail  the girls were chattering among themselves over the letters they had received and shadow and luke soon joined in as was to be expected the former storyteller of oak hall had his usual anecdote to relate to which the others listened with interest phil had drawn apart from the crowd and was now reading the letter he had received a second time his face indicated unusual concern  well i hope you got good news phil remarked dave as the shipowners son came towards him and roger  no its just the opposite was the somewhat doleful reply  what do you mean its bad news broke in roger quickly  it certainly is instead of losing twenty to thirty thousand dollars my dad stands to lose about fifty thousand dollars on that land deal i mentioned to you some time ago  why how is that queried our hero curiously has the land gone up in value since then  i dont know about the value of the land itself but its this way since that railroad made a bid for the acreage another railroad has come into the field they are going to run a rival line through that territory and so they bid against the l a  h then the l a  h railroad increased their bid and the other folks did the same so that now if my father could give a clear deed to the land he could sell it for about fifty thousand dollars  and hasnt he been able to get any trace of your uncle lester  he has something of a clue but so far he has been unable to locate my uncle it certainly is a strange state of affairs  wont the railroad company take the land without your uncle being represented in the deed questioned roger  i dont think so if they were willing to do that my father would put the deal through without delay it certainly is too bad added phil with a sigh  it seems to me if i were you id get on the trail of your uncle lester somehow was rogers comment i wouldnt let that fifty thousand dollars get away from me id hire detectives to scour the whole united states for the missing man  my fathers doing all he can roger phil turned to our hero you got a letter didnt you  not much of a one phil dave hesitated for a moment here you might as well see it i showed it to roger but dont say anything to the others about it especially the girls there is no use in worrying them as it is they have had scare enough from that wild man  the shipowners son read the letter dave had received with interest  sure thats from link merwell i know his handwriting almost as well as i know my own he declared he always makes those funny little crooks on his capital letters i guess that shows what kind of a crook he is and phil grinned at his little joke what are you going to do about this dave  i dont see that theres anything to do about it as i told roger if link shows himself around here ill do all i can to place him in the hands of the authorities and see to it that he goes to jail  its a beastly shame that any one should write such a note as that went on the shipowners son you are not a poorhouse nobody and everybody knows it  ive been wondering what link merwell can have up his sleeve came from roger he certainly must be up to something or he wouldnt send such a letter as that  the matter was talked over for a little while longer by the three boys and then they rejoined the others  jessie declared that her headache was now gone completely and the young folks spent the rest of the evening in the basswood bungalow where belle played the piano and luke favored them with several selections on his banjo and his guitar they also sang a number of songs and altogether the evening ended quite pleasantly the cloud that had come up between dave and jessie seemed to have vanished much to their own satisfaction and to that of their friends  on the following morning mr basswood announced that he had to return to crumville for a few days on business he said that as soon as he arrived home he would get into telephone communication with mr aaron poole and acquaint him with the fact that some sort of a wild man had visited the vicinity of bear camp  of course we may be mistaken as to the identity of that individual said bens father he may not be wilbur poole at all  you want to be sure dad and let nats father know that said ben because if mr poole spent money up here looking for his brother and then found out that the wild man was somebody else he would never forgive either himself or you for the outlay and at this frank statement those who knew how miserly the moneylender of crumville was laughed outright  mr basswood departed for carpen falls in the middle of the forenoon as it promised to be a warm clear day one of the young folks suggested that they go in bathing at a little sandy beach a short distance below the bungalows this suggestion was eagerly seconded and as a consequence a little later on the young folks donned their bathing outfits and soon were having great sport in the water with the older folks sitting on a fallen tree not far away watching them  oh but its cold declared jessie after her first plunge  youll get used to it after a bit returned dave just strike out lively and that will help to keep your blood in circulation  come on for a race shouted luke who was splashing around in great shape  a race it is called back phil  where shall we race to questioned roger  if you are going to race ill be the referee and timekeeper announced dunston porter  it was decided that the boys should swim from the beach to a rock standing out of the water on the far edge of the cove  first fellow to stand up on the rock wins the prize announced phil and then he added quickly girls whats the prize  a fresh flapjack to the boy who bakes it announced belle gaily  say speaking of flapjacks puts me in mind of a story came from shadow who was wading around in water up to his ankles once there were two old miners who were in a camp in the mountains they got to disputing as to who could make the best flapjacks says one of them  shadow did not finish the story he had started to tell unbeknown to him roger had come up behind and was now on his hands and knees in the water luke gave the wouldbe storyteller a quick shove and over went shadow backwards to land in the shallow water with a resounding splash  flapjack number one cried luke gaily say shadow what are you making so much noise about  ill noise you roared the former storyteller of oak hall as he scrambled to his feet  then he started to rush after luke but roger caught him by his ankle and down he went into the water with another splash this time sending the spray flying clear to those sitting on the fallen tree  here here you boys stop that cried mrs wadsworth we havent any umbrellas  oh excuse me i didnt mean to shower you pleaded shadow anyway it was rogers fault  if you are going to race start in ordered dunston porter  well whats the prize queried roger doing his best to keep out of shadows reach  the fellow who wins gets the hole in the doughnut returned dave gaily  all ready line up ordered dunston porter and after a general scramble and amid much merriment the boys lined up then came the order go and all of them struck out lustily for the rock that marked the goal  at first ben who had taken but little interest in the horseplay just enacted kept well to the front ben had always been a good swimmer and many a time he and dave had raced each other in crumville creek  you fellows wont be in it he shouted merrily  dont you be too sure of that returned luke this race isnt over yet  you fellows had better save your wind spluttered phil who at that instant came up alongside of shadow there followed a great splashing of water and suddenly ben disappeared from view  hey you who fouled me that way roared the leader whoever caught me by the foot ought to be put out of this race  must have been a whale ben answered roger mischievously  ill whale you if you do it again was the answer and then all of the boys stopped talking and with renewed vigor bent to the task of trying to win the race  soon half the distance to the rock was covered ben was still in the lead with roger and phil close behind him luke and shadow had dropped so far to the rear that they gave up all hope of winning  here is where i leave you fellows announced phil and made a sudden spurt that soon placed him slightly in advance of ben  hi hi dont leave me this way yelled roger and he too put on a burst of speed followed a second later by dave  on and on through the cool clear waters of mirror lake plunged the four boys the goal was now less than fifty feet away  o my see how hard they are swimming came from laura  ben was ahead but i think roger is up to him announced mrs basswood  those four lads are pretty well bunched up remarked dunston porter  shadow and luke have dropped out of it announced belle gracious how those others are swimming wouldnt you think it was for a prize of a thousand dollars  the four who had remained in the race were now less than five yards from the goal a large flat rock that was joined to the mainland by a series of other rocks  here is where i win declared ben and threw himself forward with all the strength left to him  not much came from phil  count me in panted roger  also yours truly added dave  and then the four lining up side by side struck out fiercely each doing his level best to touch the rock first it was a neckandneck race and in a moment more four hands went up on the rock at practically the same time  i win  not much my hand was here first  oh look  dont climb up on that rock  whats the trouble  what is it  its a snake and a big one yelled dave back away from the rock boys just as fast as you can     chapter xviii  a cry from the cliff   its a snake sure enough  my what a big one  no climbing on that rock for me  such were some of the cries which rent the air as the four youths dropped back into the lake and lost no time in getting away from the spot which had been the goal of the swimming race  say dave what sort of a snake do you suppose that was queried roger  did he drop into the water questioned ben anxiously if its a water snake maybe its after us  i dont know what kind of snakes are to be found around here returned dave but it was dark in color and i think all of four or five feet long  say who won this race anyhow came from phil as the boys swam around not far from the rock  i should say the snake did laughed dave  in the meantime dunston porter noticing that something unusual was going on in the vicinity of the goal had leaped up and was running along the edge of the cove  illustration its a snake and a big onepage 179  whats the matter over there he yelled  a snake uncle dunston called back dave better get a shotgun and go after it  o dear did you say a snake came from laura in dismay  acting on daves suggestion dunston porter hurried back to one of the bungalows he reappeared with a shotgun and lost no time in making for the vicinity of the rock where the reptile had been seen in the meanwhile the four boys rejoined luke and shadow and all swam back to the dock  oh dave are you sure the snake didnt drop into the water after you questioned jessie and her face showed her anxiety  no it retreated to the rocks further back was the answer  was it a poisonous snake asked mrs basswood  i am sure i dont know  if there are snakes in these woods i dont think ill care to go out very much commented laura with a shiver  snakes will just spoil everything added jessie dismally  while the boys and girls were dressing the report of a shotgun rang out  if that was uncle dunston shooting he must have found mr snake were daves words  i hope he did find the snake answered roger if that reptile was left prowling around in this vicinity none of the ladies would want to go out  and i wouldnt care much about going out myself added luke  having finished dressing the boys lost no time in following dunston porter toward the rock which had been the goal of the swimming race they found the old hunter and traveler searching through the brushwood back of the rocks  did you get it uncle dunston questioned dave  i did was the reply whats left of that snake is over yonder and mr porter pointed with his hand im looking around here to see if there are any more of them but i rather fancy that is all there is  the charge from the shotgun had fairly torn the reptile to pieces for when dunston porter had fired the snake had been coiled up evidently ready for an attack  arming themselves with clubs and stones the boys joined dunston porter in the hunt for more reptiles but their search was unsuccessful and a little while later all returned to the bungalows  did you find any other snakes asked jessie after she had been told about the one that had been killed  no and i dont think there are any others answered mr porter  well i hope there are not put in laura but if there are i wish you had found them  we cant find what isnt there said luke with a grin  say that puts me in mind of a story burst out shadow  wow ejaculated roger here comes another  oh say this is a good one pleaded the wouldbe storyteller its about an old college graduate who was a regular fiend for football he would undergo almost any hardship for the sake of getting to a game well one time there was a great contest on between two of the big colleges and although old bixby nearly broke his back to get there he didnt arrive until late say how is it going he puffed to a gatekeeper nothing to nothing middle of the second half answered the gatekeeper is that so returned old bixby thats good i havent missed anything and he passed in and at this anecdote there was a general laugh  in the afternoon while the young folks were enjoying themselves in various ways around the bungalows they heard the putput of a motor and looking out on mirror lake saw the craft belonging to the movingpicture company manager approaching loaded with the furniture that had been borrowed  here they come with our things cried ben looks like a house moving doesnt it  they saw that the boat was in sole charge of mr appleby and as the craft drew closer the movingpicture manager gave them a cheery hail  going into the moving business instead of moving pictures eh cried dave  i thought i might as well bring this stuff back while i had a chance answered the manager and soon brought his motorboat to a standstill beside the dock then the boys made short work of taking the furniture back to the bungalows  ive got news for you mr porter announced the movingpicture man after the job was finished ive seen that young rascal link merwell  you have exclaimed dave eagerly up at your camp  thats it  did you make him a prisoner asked phil  i didnt get the chance he was evidently on his guard and as soon as i told him what i knew and that i was going to hand him over to the authorities he ran straight into the woods and that was the last any of us saw of him he even left his suitcase and a light overcoat behind  well its too bad he got away returned our hero i thought sure if he had the audacity to show himself here wed get a chance to capture him  i was foolish not to make him a prisoner as soon as he appeared answered thomas appleby but i didnt think he would run away in that fashion leaving his outfit behind besides what hell do in the woods behind our camp is a mystery to me i asked old tad rason if there were any roads back there and he said not within a couple of miles so merwell stands a good chance of losing himself completely  great scott supposing he should get into the woods and be unable to get out again burst out roger  well such things have happened answered luke i heard only last winter of a man who was lost in the maine woods  yes and tad rason told of two brothers who were lost up here in the adirondacks for over three weeks returned mr appleby when they were found they were almost starved to death and next door to crazy  if anything like that should happen to link he will have nobody to blame but himself announced roger  did he know we were up here queried dave  he knew you were somewhere in this vicinity but he did not know that the camps were so close to each other i think if he had imagined such to be the case he would have steered clear of this vicinity  was that young actor ward porton with him  i really dont know whether they came together or not porton showed up about two hours before merwell arrived of course they may have separated just before the camp was reachedporton not wanting to appear in the company of a fellow you had told him was a crook  is porton at your camp now  yes but he doesnt intend to stay very long he says he has something else in view although what it is i dont know to tell you the truth and mr appleby lowered his voice a trifle i think he is sweet on miss ford and as she doesnt care for him at all and has told him so it has put his nose out of joint  when you spoke to him about merwell did porton stand up for the fellow continued our hero he was anxious to learn if possible just how close the companionship of the pair had been  he didnt have much to say after i told him all i knew responded thomas appleby previous to that he remarked that you might be mistaken regarding merwellthat merwell had said that jasniff and somebody else were guilty of the jewelry robbery  humph he cant put it off on anybody else like that cried phil we know beyond a doubt that he and jasniff committed that crime  perhaps i ought not to blame ward porton for sticking up for merwell answered dave link is a mighty slick talker and he probably told his story to suit himself and got porton to swallow it just the same porton is very foolish to chum with him  ill be rather sorry to lose porton for he is a clever fellow in the movies went on the manager he wanted to leave in a few days but i persuaded him to stay for a week at least so we could finish several dramas in which he is an actor after he is gone ill have to get some one to take his place any of you young fellows want to have a try at it and mr appleby looked full at dave  oh i dont know returned our hero slowly and then he saw that jessies eyes were turned upon him and that they showed she was troubled i dont think i care to take the matter up you see i came here for a rest and a good time  i wouldnt mind taking a hand at it cried luke  you can count me in too added shadow id like firstrate to see myself on the screen in a movingpicture show and his eyes lit up in anticipation  well you fellows come down some time and well talk it over concluded the manager ive got to get back now we are getting ready to put on quite an important drama tomorrow and we have got to rehearse a number of scenes if you folks want to come up and look on youll be welcome he added to the crowd in general  when the movingpicture manager had departed the boys set out to fish along the brook that flowed into mirror lake while getting ready for the sport the conversation drifted around once more to link merwell  if he is in this vicinity dave you can make sure hell try to get in on us somehow before he leaves remarked phil  i dont see what he can do returned luke  oh a fellow like link can do lots of things burst out ben why he might even try to burn down the bungalows  do you think hes as bad as that questioned shadow  yes i do was the flat answer  fishing in the vicinity of the lake was not very good so the boys pushed further and further up the brook until they reached a point where there was a little waterfall and a pool of considerable size here fishing was better and soon they had quite a number of specimens of the finny tribe to their credit  come on dave lets go up a little farther pleaded phil id like to see what this brook looks like beyond the falls  all right ill go answered our hero what about you fellows he asked of the others  ill stay here and rest announced roger im tired of scrambling over the rocks  so am i agreed ben shadow and luke also said they would remain in the vicinity of the pool  dave and phil found it no easy task to follow the brook which wound in and out among the rocks and brushwood at one point they had to do some hard climbing and once the shipowners son slipped and came close to spraining an ankle  say i dont believe ill go much farther after all declared phil this is rough and no mistake  it is better walking a little farther on phil announced dave come on dont give up this way maybe well find some extra large fish up there  once more they set out and soon found themselves in a small clearing backed up by a cliff fifteen or twenty feet in height and overgrown with brushwood and trailing vines  hark what was that exclaimed phil as both came to a halt preparatory to casting their lines into the stream  i think it was a shout answered dave maybe the others are calling to us  no i think the call came from up on the cliff dave listen there it is again  both strained their ears and soon heard another cry this time it was much closer  stop stop let me alone such were the words that floated to their ears please dont hit me let me alone  dave and phil looked at each other curiously  who can it be questioned the shipowners son  i dont know but i guess we had better try to find out answered our hero     chapter xix  the capture of link merwell   where did that cry come from dave  i think it came from the top of the cliff phil listen there it goes again  both boys strained their ears once more and now heard another voice heavy and threatening  leave this place leave at once i command you no one has any right to disturb me  dont hit me ill go returned the one who had first spoken and a few seconds later he came into view at the edge of the cliff  hello its link merwell burst out dave in amazement  yes and see that wild man is after him added the shipowners son  he was right following closely upon the appearance of link merwell the boys at the foot of the cliff had seen some brushwood thrust aside and now appeared the strange fellow who had so frightened the girls some time previously he was dressed up more fantastically than ever and had his face smeared with red and yellow over his shoulder suspended by a strap he carried an oldfashioned fowling piece and in his hands was a heavy club  go away from here go away i say and never come back cried the strange individual dancing around wildly and flourishing his club close to link merwells head  all right im going please dont hit me pleaded the youth who was plainly in terror of his life and then in his haste to escape he took several steps forward  look out there or youll have a bad fall yelled dave in quick alarm  the warning however came too late deceived by the brushwood and vines growing at the edge of the cliff link merwell lost his footing and the next instant came tumbling headlong  ha ha i told you to keep away now dont come back yelled the fantasticallydressed man in the bushes behind the cliff and then with another yell he suddenly disappeared from view  dave and phil rushed forward fully expecting to find merwell seriously hurt but in falling the youth had been fortunate enough to catch hold of some of the trailing vines and these had stayed his progress somewhat so that all he received was a violent shakingup  dondont letlet him shoshoot me spluttered link merwell as he turned over and scrambled to his feet then for the first time recognizing those who stood before him his face showed more concern than ever  whos that fellow who attacked you link asked dave quickly  i dont knowsome crazy old lunatic i suppose muttered the former student of oak hall is hehecoming after me  no he just dashed out of sight answered phil hes the same chap who nearly scared the girls to death he added to dave  how do you know he didnt look like that fellow returned our hero  i recognized him by his voice even though he is dressed quite differently dave he must be as crazy as they make them  oh so you know him do you put in link merwell questioningly he had gotten to his feet and was now straightening out his apparel  i must say link i didnt think i was going to have the pleasure of meeting you so soon said dave with a little bit of pardonable sarcasm  humph link merwell was on the point of saying more but bit his lip and kept silent  so you were on board the steam yacht when she took fire put in phil  i was  why didnt you show yourself were you afraid  that was my business i didnt have to show myself if i didnt want to  we know well enough why you didnt show yourself link broke in our hero and we also know why you left mr applebys camp so suddenly you were afraid of arrest  who told you that  nobody told us we know it went on dave you have escaped several times but i guess weve got you now  hi dont you dare to touch me exclaimed link merwell in fresh alarm you havent got any right to put your hands on me  right or wrong link we are going to make you a prisoner declared phil and advancing he caught the youth who had helped to rob mr wadsworths jewelry works by the arm  you let me go phil lawrence if you dont it will be the worse for you bawled link and tried to wrench himself loose  here none of that broke in dave quickly and stepping forward he caught the evildoer by the other arm you just march along with us  i wont go bawled the boy who had gotten himself into trouble let go of me i tell you  he started to struggle and for a minute or two dave and phil had all they could do to hold him then in sudden viciousness link kicked out taking dave in the shin  oh so thats your game is it cried dave his anger rising and then as link kicked out once more he caught the foot and gave the youth a shove that sent him sprawling on his back before link could arise dave rushed in and sat down heavily on him  oh grunted the fallen one ddont crucrush my ribs he panted llet uup  i wont let up until you promise to behave yourself answered dave sternly for two pins link id give you the thrashing of your life you deserve it what right had you to send me that note and call me a poorhouse nobody  thats right dave pitch into him give him what he deserves agreed phil maybe a good licking would knock some commonsense into him  ddont you dare toto ttouch me panted the boy under dave if youyou do ill hahave the llaw on you  dont talk about the law cried dave the law will take care of you when i caught you down on cave island and you said that you were sorry that you had joined jasniff in that robbery and that you were going to reform i felt sorry for you but you are a faker merwell and i dont believe you ever will reform and thats the reason im going to do my best now to place you in the hands of the law  youyouyou let me uup  i wont let you up until you promise to behave yourself and come along with us  aall right i propromise  very well then you can get up answered dave arising but remember you have given us your word and if you break it ill guarantee that phil and i will come down on you like a ton of bricks now if you know when you are well off youll do exactly as we tell you to  ive got a scheme dave broke in phil bringing out an extra piece of fishline from his pocket lets tie his hands behind him with this then i dont think hell care to run awaynot very far anyhow  humph cant you let me walk along without having my hands tied grumbled the prisoner  we are not going to take any chances link answered the shipowners son now that we have caught you we are going to see that you get where you belongin prison  you send me to prison and my father will make it hot for you  you stop threatening us link ordered dave sternly  all right but youll see  much against his will link merwell was forced to place his hands behind him and in a few minutes phil and dave had secured the fishline around his wrists then they picked up his cap which had fallen off and placed it on his head  now then march ordered dave and no funny work and he led the way back along the brook with merwell following and phil bringing up the rear with the fishing outfits  say how do you expect a fellow to get over these rocks with his hands tied behind him grumbled link merwell after he had slipped several times  youll have to do the best you can returned phil coldly a jailbird like you cant expect much consideration  bah you make me tired phil lawrence growled the prisoner i dont think youll be able to send me to prison not for long anyhow my fathers got plenty of money hell get me out some way  if he spends any money on you hell be foolish returned the shipowners son now go ahead we are not going to waste all our time on you  it was not long after this when they came in sight of the other boys ben and roger were still fishing while luke and shadow were resting on the rocks the latter telling one of his favorite stories  hello what luck called ben looking up and then he added great cæsars ghost if it isnt link merwell  where did you run across him cried luke leaping to his feet followed by shadow  we found him running away from some kind of a wild man answered dave  the wild man who scared us into fits the other day queried roger  we dont know if it was that fellow or somebody else answered phil  link merwell was much crestfallen to confront so many of his former schoolmates of oak hall he realized that he was in the camp of the enemy in more ways than one at one time or another he had played each of them some sort of a scurvy trick and he realized that not one of them would have a good word to say for him  well i see they have made you a prisoner remarked luke as he noticed that links hands were tied behind him  humph they had no right to do it growled the prisoner where are you going to take me anyhow  we are going to take you to our bungalows announced dave there you will have the pleasure of talking the matter over with mr wadsworth  at the mention of the name of the man he had robbed link merwell winced and his face paled evidently he did not relish what was in store for him  say having his hands tied behind him puts me in mind of a story began shadow once there was a fellow and then as the wouldbe story teller saw a look of disgust coming over the faces of his chums he added hastily oh well never mind ill tell you that story some other time  is mr wadsworth staying up here with you asked link while ben and the others prepared to return to the bungalows  he is answered dave  is his family with him  yes we are all up here for a short vacation dave looked at his enemy squarely in the eyes link do you think you are treating me just right i never put a straw in your way and yet you have done everything you could to make things unpleasant for me i tried to help you down on cave island and in return for that you have been sending letters to nat poole asking him to help you in hurting me and then the other day you sent that note calling me a poorhouse nobody  oh dont preach to me dave porter growled the youth who had been made a prisoner i hate that kind of talk you always tried to set yourself up as being better than any one else maybe you could get on the soft side of gus plum but you cant play any such game as that on me i know what i am doing  link im sorry to hear you talk that way went on dave earnestly do you want to spend all your life in prison  bah dont talk to me didnt i tell you i dont want any preaching if ive got to go to jail ill go but it wont be for long mark my words my father has got lots of money and i guess the lawyers will know what to do but let me tell you something dave porterand now link merwells face showed both cunning and hatredyou found fault with that note i sent to you calling you a poorhouse nobody well that is all you are a poorhouse nobody  see here link began our hero his temper rising  oh now just wait dave porter just wait a little and youll find out what i mean you are a poorhouse nobody and nothing else dave porter why you are not dave porter at all you are a poorhouse nobody thats all you are     chapter xx  back in camp   whats this you are saying link demanded phil who had overheard the conversation just recorded you ought to be ashamed of yourself to talk that way just because dave spent part of his life in the poorhouse after he was stolen away from his parents is no reason why you should speak as you do  and that isnt the reason why i am talking this way retorted the prisoner ive got another reason and dave porter will find out what it is before very long  you just said that i was not dave porter remarked our hero what do you mean by that  never mind what i mean youll find out sooner or later answered link with an expression of cunning on his countenance  oh dont listen to him broke in roger he is only trying to worry you dave let us get back to the bungalows and tell mr wadsworth about this capture  im not going back with you retorted link merwell and now with his hands tied behind him he made a leap over the rocks in the direction of the woods  the sudden movement on the part of the prisoner surrounded as he was by all of the boys came somewhat as a surprise but dave roger and phil were quick to recover and away they bounded in pursuit of the fleeing one  terror lent speed to link merwells feet and soon he gained the edge of the growth which at this point was quite heavy  hurry up or hell hide himself called dave who was in advance of his chums  the runaway might have made good his escape had it not been for the fact that his hands were so tightly bound behind him as he dashed between the first of the trees his foot caught on an outcropping root unable to throw out his hands to save himself he came down heavily striking his forehead on another tree root  ive got him come on cried dave and in a few seconds more was beside the fallen one to his surprise link merwell lay motionless  collar him dont let him get away again yelled roger as he came up with phil beside him  i think he hurt himself when he fell answered our hero how about it link and he bent over his enemy as he asked the question  there was no reply and getting down on their knees the three boys raised link merwell up and turned him over he was unconscious and the blood was flowing from a cut on his left temple  illustration you just said that i was not dave porter remarked our hero what do you mean by thatpage 201  he came down pretty hard i imagine said dave let us carry him down to the brook  not without some difficulty the three lads raised the unconscious form and carried it toward the brook meeting the other boys on the way  hello what did you do sock him one queried luke  no he fell and as he couldnt use his hands he hit his head on a tree root answered dave get a little water somebody and well see if we can revive him  the water was soon brought and with this they washed off the wound after which they bound up link merwells head with several handkerchiefs the sufferer groaned and gasped several times and finally opened and closed his eyes  say he may be hurt worse than we think remarked roger gravely  i guess he ought to have a doctor added dave but where to get one around here i dont know i dont believe there is one at carpen falls  i know there isnt because i heard my mother asking about it added ben but i think we ought to get him down to the bungalows  all of the boys were agreed that this was the best thing to do and so after putting up their fishing outfit they began the return to the lake shore taking turns at carrying the unconscious youth  o dear who is hurt cried laura as she saw the party approaching  its link merwell answered her brother call mr wadsworth will you  oh dave so youve caught him have you cried jessie while laura ran off on her errand did you have a fight  not much of a one jessie he got hurt through a fall  what a very foolish boy he has been was belles comment but i think his father is partly to blame he always allowed link to do as he pleased on the ranch and when link went to the city he always gave him more spending money than was good for him at least so my father said  it was up to link to do the square thing on his own account broke in roger he had all the chance in the world to make a man of himself but he preferred the company of fellows like jasniff and this is the result  mr wadsworth was in his bungalow writing a letter he was surprised and gratified at the news brought by laura and quickly followed her outside a little later mrs wadsworth and mrs basswood joined the group the boys had unbound link and now they placed him on a large hammock with a comfortable pillow under his head as the jewelry manufacturer approached the sufferer opened his eyes and then struggled to sit up  hello i guess he isnt hurt as much as we thought remarked shadow in a low tone  maybe hes only playing possum was lukes comment  no he was hurt thats sure the cut on his forehead shows it answered dave  well merwell so they have caught you have they began mr wadsworth as he stepped up in front of the youth i thought we would get you sooner or later  ii cant talk to you nonow faltered the prisoner  i dont think it will be necessary to do much talking merwell went on the jewelry manufacturer we can do our talking laterpossibly in the police court  all right have your own way about it growled the prisoner youve got me and im down and out so you can do your worst and with this he rolled over on the hammock once more and again closed his eyes  talk about nerve whispered ben doesnt that take the cake  id like to know whether he is really hurt so much or only shamming added phil he always was a sly one  tell me how you came to capture him said mr wadsworth  thereupon dave and phil related how they had gone up the brook to the vicinity of the cliff and there heard the words between link and the socalled wild man  o dear is that awful creature around here again cried jessie  yes answered dave and i wish he would keep away  then dave and phil related how link merwell had plunged over the cliff and had been made a prisoner and then how later on he had tried to escape struck his head on the tree root and how all of the boys had brought him to the bungalows  i am glad he didnt get away from you said oliver wadsworth i think he ought to be in prison to keep jasniff company  how will you get him to jail questioned phil  i dont know what we can do except to march him down to carpen falls but we cant do that today for he seems too weak perhaps we can take him down there tomorrow or else some of us can go down and get an officer to come up here and take charge of him  the matter was talked over at some length and it was finally decided that nothing more should be done that day link merwell did not join in the discussion nor even open his eyes to look at them but by close observation dave became satisfied that the prisoner was listening intently to every word that was said  what will you do with him tonight asked roger  we might lock him up in one of the rooms in the bungalow suggested dave  i dont think well give up one of our rooms to that fellow put in mr wadsworth i think a bunk in the woodshed will be plenty good enough for him  oh pa wouldnt that be rather hard on him questioned jessie who did not want to see even a rascal like merwell suffer physical discomfort  i dare say he has been putting up with worse than that in the woods here and while he was on cave island and in the far west returned her father well place an old couch and some blankets in a corner of the shed and that will be plenty good enough for him  but somebody will have to watch him answered dave ill do it if you want me to  that wouldnt be quite fair dave broke in phil if he has got to be watched let us take turns at doing it  we might bind him fast to the cot suggested mr wadsworth  hes so slick id be afraid to risk that answered dave ill not mind staying up watching him  let us all take a hand at it broke in ben every fellow can go on guardduty for two hours and call the next fellow and so after a little discussion the matter was arranged  i suppose im not to have anything to eat grumbled link merwell a little later when they were arranging to place him in the woodshed which was a small leanto of the wadsworth bungalow this place was used for the storage of firewood but just now was almost empty  oh yes well see to it that you get something to eat answered mrs wadsworth quickly  i havent had a square meal for twentyfour hours went on the prisoner  give him all he wants but nothing fancy said mr wadsworth he deserves nothing but the plainest kind of victuals  where have you kept yourself since you ran away from mr applebys camp questioned phil curiously  oh i just roamed around in the woods was the somewhat sullen answer  did you meet that wild man more than once questioned roger  no if it hadnt been for that fellow whoever he is you wouldnt have caught me added link bitterly  i wonder what the pooles will do when mr basswood tells them what we think that it is mr wilbur poole came from dave perhaps they will send some of the sanitarium authorities up to try to catch him  i hope they do catch him came from jessie ill never feel safe as long as that man is at large     chapter xxi  the escape   mr dunston porter had been down to carpen falls for a walk and to get the mail he returned late that evening bringing several letters with him he was of course much surprised to learn of the capture of link merwell and listened with interest to the details concerning the affair  among the letters which his uncle had brought along was one for dave which he read with deep interest it was from nat poole who evidently had not yet heard anything regarding his missing uncle        i want to tell you of what has happened here lately       wrote nat i have received two visits from a young fellow       named ward porton who is i believe a movingpicture       actor and the same fellow that you helped to rescue from a       burning steam yacht this fellow was in town once with link       merwell and then came here alone he has been visiting a       number of people who are well acquainted with you and also       visited the poorhouse here and talked to several of those in       authority and those who used to have the running of the       poorhouse years ago when you were an inmate there this       ward porton acted as if he had something of great importance       on his mind but what it was he would not tell but he did       let slip that it was something concerning youthat there       was a big surprise in store for you he also let slip that       he too had been in a poorhouse when he was a little boy       and that he had never been able to learn where he had really       come from        i am writing this to put you on your guard in case he       should show himself either at your camp or at the wadsworth       mansion after your return i must confess that i dont like       the fellows manner and i rather surmise he is laying pipes       to play you some trick  dave read this letter over several times and was much perplexed he had not forgotten what link merwell had said to him shortly after being captured nor had he forgotten the fact that he had seen link and ward porton in crumville at the old potts farm  those fellows are certainly up to something our hero told himself link said that i was not dave porter now what did he mean by that those fellows must be hatching up some plot against me  dave you look rather worried remarked phil as he caught the youth reading the communication for the third time no bad news i hope  i cant tell whether it is or not phil was the reply and dave handed the letter to his chum  phew this looks like a mystery was the comment of the shipowners son dave do you think this had anything to do with what link merwell said when we caught himthat you were not dave porter  thats the way it looks to me phil  but thats rank nonsense we all know you are dave porter  well ive always thought i was dave porter ever since i met my uncle dunston out in those south sea islands  why of course you are dont you look just like your uncle dunston this is some game dave  i think so myself  what are you fellows confabbing about asked roger walking up  were talking about a letter i just received answered dave and then the senators son also read the communication  say this is a mystery and no mistake was rogers comment and so nat thinks that ward porton is mixed up in it eh that is strange  what do you suppose he has to do with it roger questioned phil  i am sure i dont know but come to think of it he did look like and then roger broke off in confusion  look like what roger asked dave quickly  oh never mind dave lets drop the subject and talk about what we are going to do with link merwell  i think i know what you were going to say went on our hero and he tried to speak calmly although his heart gave a sudden jump you were going to say that ward porton looked like my uncle dunston and like me  well if you must know it dave that is what did come into my mind i dont think he resembles you quite as much as he resembles your uncle to be really honest  oh say roger drop that interposed phil hastily i think dave looks a good deal more like his uncle than porton looks like mr porter  its a queer mystery thats certain returned dave slowly i dont like it i must say and his face showed more concern than it had for a long while  dont you take this too seriously dave cried roger i believe at the most its only some game gotten up by link merwell now that we have him a prisoner and can send him to jail for that robbery more than likely you wont hear anything further about it  i sincerely hope you speak the truth was our heros sober reply  after a plain but substantial meal link merwell was taken to the woodshed and told he would have to remain there until morning then the boys cast lots to find out who should go on guard first  im number one announced phil after drawing one of a number of slips of paper placed in a cap  and i follow you announced luke  im guard number three came from ben and the other boys announced what slips they had drawn  usually the woodshed was dark but now a lantern had been hung on a nail to illuminate the place there were two doors one connecting with the bungalow proper and the other leading into the backyard of the place there was also a small window over which in times past several stout wooden bars had been nailed to keep out prowling wild animals  think ill run away eh remarked link merwell as he sat down on the couch which had been placed in the woodshed  youll not get the chance returned phil who had armed himself with one of the doublebarreled shotguns if you try to get away link youll get a dose of shot in you just as sure as fate  humph i dont think ill want to run away grumbled the prisoner there is no place to run to in this forsaken section of the country what you folks can find here to make it pleasant is a mystery to me  the door leading to the outside had been closed and bolted the other door leading to the bungalow proper was left open for ventilation and phil sat on a low stool beside it with the shotgun across his knees  are you quite sure you can manage him phil questioned mr wadsworth as he came to the doorway after the others in both bungalows had retired  yes i can manage him easily enough returned the shipowners son ive got this you see and he tapped the shotgun suggestively  well dont have any shooting unless it becomes absolutely necessary answered the jewelry manufacturer and then he too retired  for a short while link merwell lay down on the couch and turned over as if to go to sleep but he was restless and presently when all was quiet he turned over again and sat up  what are you going to do with me when you get me to carpen falls he questioned  we are going to hand you over to the authorities  is dave porter going along to the falls  i dont know about that thats for mr wadsworth to say answered phil by the way he continued what did you mean by telling dave that he was not dave porter  never you mind youll find out soon enough grumbled the prisoner  very well link if you dont want to tell me you dont have to just the same if you are trying to hatch out some plot against dave i warn you to be careful he has stood about as much as he intends to stand  this is no plot this is something real grumbled link merwell just you wait thats all and then he lay down on the couch once more and pretended to go to sleep  at the proper time luke came to relieve phil and was followed by ben and then by shadow  say its cold tonight remarked the former storyteller of oak hall as he took the shotgun and sat down on the stool if this weather keeps on before long well have frost up here and well all be thinking of going home  better put on an extra coat here is one answered ben and passed the garment over then he returned to the other bungalow for he was tired  shadow had expected to have quite a talk with the prisoner but in this he was disappointed for link appeared to be asleep and he did not have the heart to awaken the prisoner he sat on the stool thinking over several of the stories he had told from time to time and trying to invent one or two new ones  in the midst of his revery a sound from outside startled him it was the hooting of an owl and so close that the mournful sound made shadow shiver  id like to shoot that owl he told himself as the hooting continued if i brought him down i could have him stuffed he thought with some satisfaction  shadow looked at the motionless form on the couch and then arising from the stool tiptoed his way into the big livingroom of the bungalow one of the windows was wide open and he looked out of this to see if he could locate the owl the hooting was now closer than before and seemed to come from a tree not twentyfive feet away  say theres a chance for a shot murmured the youth to himself if i could only spot that owl im sure i could  thump shadow received a staggering blow in the back of the neck and then felt himself hurled to one side while the shotgun was wrenched from his grasp then before he could recover from his astonishment a figure leaped through the open window and dashed across the moonlit dooryard  hi stop yelled shadow as soon as he could recover his breath stop help  whats the racket the cry came from roger and then he and dave burst into the room followed by phil  merwell hes escaped he got the gun away from me and jumped through the window panted poor shadow oh what a fool i was to think he was asleep  where did he go questioned dave and at the same time bounded back into the bedroom to don his shoes and part of his clothing  he jumped out of the window with the gun thats all i know about it answered shadow  didnt you have a fight questioned phil  no i came to the window to look at an owl that was hooting around here link came behind me and gave me a fierce crack in the neck then he grabbed the gun and went through the window like a flash and i thought he was asleep  by this time dave had returned partly dressed and catching up another one of the fowling pieces in the bungalow he too leaped through the window followed by shadow a few seconds later the other boys joined them  have you any idea which way he went questioned our hero  i dont know exactly dave but i think he went that way and the former storyteller of oak hall pointed with his hand  lets scatter a little ordered dave and while he passed in the direction pointed out the other boys separated to both sides of him all advanced to the edge of the woods and there came to a halt while the moon made it fairly bright in the open space surrounding the bungalows beneath the trees it was dark and consequently little could be seen  might as well look for a pin in a haystack grumbled roger if he got into these woods its goodbye to him we might search all night and not get a trace of the rascal  i guess youre right roger answered dave but lets search around a little anyway  long before this the alarm had become general and now dunston porter and mr wadsworth appeared followed shortly by mrs wadsworth and mrs basswood and the girls  let us take the flashlights and lanterns and see if we cant get on the track of him ordered the jewelry manufacturer we must capture him if it is possible to do so  and then the search began in earnest     chapter xxii  more of a mystery   did you see anything of him  not a thing did you  i saw something move under the trees but i guess it was a wild animal  hes gotten away and that is all there is to it said dave as he looked at his chums and at the men who had also joined in the search for link merwell  this is certainly too bad remarked mr wadsworth with a shake of his head  and it was all my fault broke out shadow bitterly oh i could kick myself full of holes every time i think of it  over an hour had been spent in the woods surrounding the clearing on mirror lake during that time the men and the boys had stirred up several small wild animals but that had been all  he must have legged it for all he was worth after he jumped through the window was rogers comment for all we know he may be miles away from here by now  if he ran straight into those woods it was a hazardous proceeding said dunston porter hell become hopelessly lost in the darkness and when daylight comes he wont know how to turn to get out  oh perhaps hell climb a tree and locate his surroundings that way suggested dave you must remember that link isnt like a city fellow he was brought up in the wild west and knows how to do for himself in the open  we may as well give up the hunt said mr wadsworth and turned toward bear camp followed by the others  oh dave did you catch him the cry came from jessie who stood on the porch with the others awaiting their return  no he got away  thats too bad  you should have kept him bound dave said laura  thats it dave added belle in the west they would tie a rascal like link fast to a tree with a lariat if you secured him properly he would stay there until you freed him  well there is no use in crying over spilt milk remarked mrs basswood i suppose we may as well go to bed again and on this the others agreed  several days including sunday passed and nothing more was seen or heard of link merwell or ward porton during that time the young folks went out on the lake several times and also went fishing swimming was mentioned but as the weather was getting colder rapidly only dave and phil went in for a plunge one day they planned to visit the movingpicture people but it rained and they did not go  it will soon be time for hunting announced roger i hope we do get a chance to bring down something before we have to go back  well id like to have a crack at a deer myself answered dave who had not forgotten the sport he had had on squirrel island and at other places in the vicinity of oak hall  whats the matter with a crack at a bear interposed phil a great big shaggy fellow that would weigh eight hundred or a thousand pounds  say phil you dont want much in life cried ben why dont you make it a twothousandpound bear while you are at it  say speaking about heavy bears puts me in mind of a story i heard cried shadow his face lighting up for the first time since the escape of link merwell this yarn was told by an old western hunter and trapper and he said it was strictly true he said he was out on the ranges one day when he found himself suddenly pursued by three modoc indians he shot at them several times without hitting anybody and then to his consternation he found that his ammunition had given out he legged it up a mountainside and the three modocs came after him yelling to beat the band just as they were following him up the steep trail he saw a monstrous bear come plunging out from a thicket near by he was so upset that he hardly knew what to do but he grabbed up a big rock and sent it at the bear it struck the monstrous animal on the head and keeled him over and the bear rolled down the steep mountainside and knocked over the three modoc indians smashing every one of them  wow thats some bear story exclaimed luke  shadow how could you bear to tell such a story asked dave reproachfully  that knocks out all the dime novels ever written said ben  why ben do you mean to say you have read them all cried our hero in pretended surprise  all i dont read any of them snorted ben just the same thats the biggest whopper i ever heard  well im not vouching for the story interposed shadow dryly im just telling it as it was told to me  speaking about being frightened by a bear puts me in mind that its queer we havent seen or heard anything more of that wild man remarked roger  we dont want to see or hear anything more of him burst out laura one scare was enough  its queer that the pooles dont send some one up here to look for him remarked jessie if he were my uncle i certainly wouldnt want him to be roaming around in the woods that way  if he is just roaming around i wonder how he manages to live said dave and where does he get all that outlandish outfit  he must have some sort of a habitation here returned phil maybe he has taken possession of some bungalow or cabin that was locked up if he has wont the owners of the place be mad when they find it out especially if he is using their things  i wonder if we couldnt go up to that cliff and track him in some way from there said phil he may have left some sort of trail behind him unless he follows some kind of paths through the woods he would be apt to get lost just like anybody else  if he really is wilbur poole id like to capture him and send him back to the sanitarium where he belongs remarked roger i think nat would like us to do it  what do you say about starting on a regular hunt tomorrow asked dave we might go out directly after breakfast and carry our lunch with us who knows but what in looking for the wild man we might run across some trace of link merwell  oh dave you mustnt get into any trouble cried jessie hastily  if we go out well go armed and be on our guard he replied  the matter was talked over for some time and at last it was decided that the boys should start out in a body directly after breakfast the following morning provided it remained clear they were to carry a shotgun and a rifle and also a substantial lunch and were not to return to bear camp until evening  id like to go on such a tramp myself announced belle it would be lots of fun climbing over the rocks and up the mountains  i think you girls had better remain around the bungalows said mrs wadsworth you can go out some other time when the boys are not looking for that wild man and link merwell  during the past few days those at bear camp had seen but little of the movingpicture company that afternoon the old hunter tad rason stopped at the dock in his rowboat and made the announcement that the company had gone to the other end of the lake to take pictures for several more dramas  mr appleby wanted me to tell you that that young feller ward porton aint goin to be with em no more announced tad rason to dave he says the young feller writ a letter sayin that he was on the track of his parentage and he guessed as how hed have plenty of money of his own when he could prove who he was  this announcement was of great interest to dave and he immediately questioned tad rason to learn if the old hunter knew anything further but that was all rason could tell he even did not know how long ward porton had remained with the movingpicture company after his arrival in the adirondacks  the huntin season will be openin tomorrow announced tad rason in reply to a question from phil im bound down the lake now to meet a party of hunters comin from albany i take em out every season actin as guide  perhaps well get you to go out with us some day said roger  all right boys ill be glad to go if i aint got any job with them other fellows announced the old hunter  although he was not willing to admit it to the others dave was greatly worried over the news brought by tad rason coupling it with what he had heard from link merwell and nat poole he could reach but one conclusion which was that in some way ward porton was going to try to prove that the boy from the crumville poorhouse was not the real dave porter  maybe hell come along with a story that he is the real dave thought our hero bitterly he said he was raised in a poorhouse just like myself but he also said it was away down east and not anywhere near the vicinity of crumville how he is going to get around that is beyond me i dont think hell be able to make anybody believe his story just the same i wish this thing hadnt come up id like to forget those poorhouse days entirely and at the remembrance of those bitter times dave sighed deeply  dave you look awfully worried said jessie that evening when the boys were getting ready for their next days tramp what is the trouble  oh it isnt much he answered evasively i was just thinking over what link merwell said  dave dont let him worry you so cried the girl sympathetically he is a bad boy and everybody knows it  but he said some things that i dont like at all jessie i dont like him to call me a poorhouse nobody  dave dont you mind him i dont care if you did come from the poorhouse i think just as much of you anyway and jessies eyes showed her earnestness  its splendid of you to say that he returned in a low tone and catching both her hands he squeezed them tightly its a grand good thing to have somebody who believes in you  early in the evening there was a slight shower and some of the boys thought they were in for a steady rain but soon the clouds passed and the moon and stars came out as brightly as ever  a perfect day announced roger on arising the next morning just cool enough to make mountain climbing a pleasure  the servants had an early breakfast ready for the boys and by the time the girls and the others appeared they had partaken of the repast and were ready to depart dave carried the rifle and roger the shotgun while the others were loaded down with several knapsacks of provisions and some extra wraps and a blanket or two  you want to take plenty of things with you dunston porter had cautioned them you may get farther away from home than you anticipate and may have to stay out all night  thats true uncle dunston dave had answered and that being so if we dont turn up at a reasonable hour dont worry about us  but what will you do if you capture that wild man asked mrs basswood  if its wilbur poole well make him a prisoner and bring him with us announced dave  well good luck to you cried dunston porter as the boys prepared to leave remember the hunting season opens today so if you get a chance at any game dont let it slip you  trust us for that uncle dunston cried dave  with shouts of goodbye the boys turned away from the bungalows and a few minutes later disappeared along the path running beside the brook     chapter xxiii  shooting a wildcat   less than half an hour later the boys found themselves at the top of the cliff where dave and phil had seen the encounter between link merwell and the socalled wild man a brief look around convinced them that the locality was deserted  now to find the wild mans trail if he left one announced dave and the boys scattered in several directions looking at the ground and the brushwood with great care  if we only had one of those reservation indians with us he might help us pick up the trail declared roger as it is i must confess im not much of a trailfinder  oh dont give up so soon returned dave remember we have the whole day before us  presently ben and luke who had turned southward on the cliff let out a shout  here is something of a trail announced ben when the others came hurrying in that direction and he pointed to footprints which led through some soft soil between a number of low bushes a little further on they could see where somebodys shoes or boots had carried some of the mud up on to the rocks beyond  that certainly does look like a trail declared dave let us follow it up a bit and see where it leads to  this was considered good advice and soon led by our hero the whole party was moving through the brushwood and over the rocks then they came once again to the woods and here discovered a welldefined trail running southwestward  this may be an animal trail for all we know remarked shadow for my part i cant tell one kind of trail from another  its quite likely that a fellow like that wild man would use any trail he came across and so would anybody else trying to move around in a wilderness like this answered dave i dont think it will do any harm to follow it for some distance  better keep your eyes open dave cautioned phil it may lead us into danger  ive got my eyes wide open and ive got the rifle handy too answered our hero as he once more led the march forward  the trail was very narrow in places so that they had to walk in single file it made a long curve through the forest and then came out in a little clearing backed up by a series of jagged rocks here there was a small stream and behind it a spring of pure cold water  it looks to me as if the animals used this trail when they wanted a drink was lukes comment that water looks pretty good to me and bending down he took a deep draught its fine he went on try it  the others did as requested and agreed with luke that the water was as good as any they had ever tasted then began more searching and before long they found another trail this time veering to the westward  the boys pushed forward once again dave still in the lead and thus a half mile more was covered then they found themselves between a number of rocks where presently the trail seemed to lose itself  say dave we dont seem to be getting anywhere announced phil as having climbed over several very rough rocks he stopped to regain his breath  thats right broke in luke and say we had better go slow unless somebody wants to sprain an ankle this is the roughest ground i ever tried to get over  it is easier walking just ahead announced dave who now stood on the top of one of the rocks gazing forward come on i think i see the trail too and he made a leap from one rock to another and was soon some distance in advance  the rough rocks left behind the boys came out on a trail which seemed to come from the north and lead directly up a steep hillside well covered with tall trees here the shade was very thick and the slight breeze that was stirring made the atmosphere decidedly cool  wonder what time it is remarked luke and drew out his watch as he spoke well i never only ten oclock i thought it must be about noon  getting hungry already laughed dave if you are we might stop for a bite  thats it lets have a bite to eat and rest at the same time cried phil we brought plenty of lunch alongenough for several meals  the boys sat in a sort of circle on some rocks and a fallen tree and while thus resting partook of a light lunch from one of the knapsacks then they moved forward up the hillside and presently found themselves on the top of the rise  here is quite a view announced shadow and they spent a little time in taking in the panorama spread before them on one side they could see mirror lake and on the other the nearby mountains and also a faraway wagonroad which they rightly guessed was that running to carpen falls and the villages beyond  see anything worth looking at outside of the scenery questioned roger of our hero  i see some smoke down in yonder hollow announced dave that must come either from some campfire or else from some cabin and whether it is from a campfire or a cabin it means that some human being must be there  right you are dave and that human being may be that wild man or link merwell answered ben quickly  how far do you think it is to that smoke asked phil  various guesses were made and the consensus of opinion was that the smoke was not over half a mile distant  let us take the trail leading off in that direction said dave and a few minutes later the boys struck out once more  much to their surprise getting down into the hollow between the hills and the nearby mountain was by no means as easy as they had anticipated the way proved exceedingly rough and more than once one or another of them was in danger of a serious tumble as it was shadow slipped on the rocks and scraped his hands in several places then luke gave a grunt announcing that he had barked his left shin  dave was still in advance and now he made a leap from a rock into some low brushwood as he did this there came a sudden cry and a snarl followed by the movement of some body through the brushwood a short distance ahead  hello what was that cried phil who was nearest to our hero  i didnt get a very good view of it phil answered dave who now had his rifle ready for use but unless i was much mistaken it was a wildcat  a wildcat great cæsar we dont want to run into any such beast as that dave  did you see a wildcat where is it demanded roger quickly as he too reached daves side  it went off in that direction answered dave pointing with the barrel of his rifle see there it is  as dave uttered the last words roger and phil saw a small tawnycolored body creep out of some distant bushes and make a leap onto a flat rock the beast was indeed a wildcat and as it came from cover it swung around for a brief instant to gaze savagely at the boys then it crouched low preparatory to making a leap to another rock higher up  crack it was daves rifle that rang out and following the report the wildcat was seen to leap into the air and then fall back on the rock where it whirled over and over several times  you hit it dave yelled phil and roger simultaneously  what did you shoot at called out ben as he came plunging forward followed by luke and shadow  a wildcat see there it is on the rocks cried roger  a wildcat i didnt know there were any left around here returned ben and then he added quickly there it goes you didnt kill it after all dave  as ben spoke the wildcat gave another whirl on the rock and then slipped off through the bushes out of sight of the boys  ill give him a shot from my gun if he needs it announced roger as he hurried forward  be careful that he doesnt get at you first cried dave warningly if hes only slightly wounded hell be a dangerous customer to tackle  the other boys followed roger and having reloaded his weapon dave followed suit soon all were standing close to the flat rock where the wildcat had been hit  where is it  i dont see him anywhere  be careful he may land on you before you know it  there there look yonder the last cry came from luke and at his words all turned quickly to see the wildcat crouch between two trees growing close to the rocks with a snarl the beast leaped out toward them the blood flowing from a wound along one forequarter  roger had the shotgun ready and without taking time to bring the weapon to his shoulder he pulled the trigger  bang went the piece and then with a final leap the wildcat sprang toward the boys only to drop dead at their feet  good thats the way to do it cried phil enthusiastically that wildcat wont bother us any more  dave hit him in the forequarter announced roger after an examination of the dead animal more than likely the beast would have died from that wound  i dont know about that returned our hero modestly you are the one who settled him that was a fine shot roger it couldnt have been better and on this the others agreed  as no one cared to take the trouble to skin the wildcat the beast was left where it had fallen and the boys once more took their way along the trail leading to the spot where they had seen the smoke soon the trail made another turn and then came out on a path which was wider and showed considerable usage  here are footprints said ben pointing to them i believe we are getting close to some sort of a house or cabin  a few minutes later the broad path they had discovered made another turn and then in the distance they saw a neat log cabin located on the bank of a small mountain torrent from the chimney of the cabin a thin wreath of smoke was curling  thats the smoke we must have seen announced dave now the question is who lives there  and how will they take our arrival added phil  wait a minute ordered dave and put out his hand to stop his chums from advancing he had seen a man come limping from the mountain torrent with a bucket of water in his hand now the man stopped in front of the door to the cabin as if to look around before entering  well that isnt the wild man thats sure and it isnt link merwell either announced roger  say ive seen that man before cried phil in sudden excitement  you have phil questioned dave who is he  who is he unless i am greatly mistaken that is my missing uncle lester lawrence     chapter xxiv  the man at the cabin   that man is your uncle  do you mean the man who disappeared so mysteriously after that robbery  thats the man phils manner showed increased excitement isnt this the strangest thing that ever happened to think of my running across my uncle in this outoftheway place  you want to make sure that he is your uncle first warned dave perhaps he is only somebody who looks like your relative the same as that ward porton resembles me added our hero with a grim smile  oh i am sure that man is my uncle declared the shipowners son  do you think he is the same fellow we saw beforethe wild man queried roger  i dont know as to that maybe he is and phils face now showed worriment i do hope my uncle hasnt lost his mind  well he might do that because of his troubles was shadows comment it was trouble that affected wilbur poole if youll remember  during the course of this conversation the boys had withdrawn to the shelter of some trees and brushwood in the meantime the man with the bucket of water had disappeared within the cabin  i noticed he limped considerably remarked dave  yes and he had his left foot bound up announced luke more than likely he hurt it in some way  it would be an easy matter for somebody to hurt his foot if he cut up like that fellow who nearly scared the girls and link merwell to death remarked ben  i am going to the cabin and see what he has to say for himself declared phil resolutely starting forward  if you go we had better go with you announced dave but be careful phil if that man is out of his head he may be dangerous  i dont think my uncle lester would hurt me even if he was out of his mind answered the shipowners son as he moved toward the cabin followed closely by the others  the boys were still a hundred feet or more away from the habitation when the man reappeared at the doorway on catching sight of the newcomers he uttered a sudden cry of dismay and then disappeared like a flash banging the cabin door shut behind him  evidently hes not very sociable remarked luke dryly i guess he doesnt want any visitors  advancing to the door phil knocked loudly  go away from here i dont want to see any of you cried a heavy voice from within go away i tell you  open the door please i want to speak with you answered phil as calmly as he could  i wont talk to you i dont want any one around this place came angrily from within the cabin go away or ill shoot  say i dont like this cried shadow in a low voice i guess we had better get out and he started to retreat followed by luke and ben phil however stood his ground and not to desert their chum dave and roger did the same  we are not going to molest you called out phil after several seconds of silence all i want to do is to talk to you  i wont talk to anybody i tell you go away if you dont ill use a shotgun on you returned the man in the cabin  arent you mr lester lawrence demanded phil  whats that and now the voice of the man showed sudden interest  i say arent you mr lester lawrence repeated phil  who said i was lester lawrence demanded the man suspiciously  if you are i must talk to you i am phil lawrence your nephew  phil lawrence the boys outside heard the man mutter to himself phil lawrence oh it cant be then he raised his voice you are trying to play some trick on me he shouted  it isnt any trick put in dave this young man here is philip lawrence and he is looking for his uncle lester lawrence he has good news for him  good news i cant believe it it is some trick i want you all to go away  uncle lester it isnt any trick i am phil your nephew i want to talk to you ive got the best kind of news for you something that youll be glad to hear wont you please open the door and let me talk to you  its a trick i know its a trick came from the man in almost a whine nevertheless he advanced toward the door and with trembling hands threw off the bolt that had been shot into place then with great caution he opened the door several inches and peered out  who says he is philip lawrence he questioned sharply  i am uncle lester announced the shipowners son dont you remember me you used to think the world and all of me some years ago when you lived across the street from us  the man opened the door a little wider and gazed sharply into phils face then his manner seemed to change and allowing the door to swing wide open he tottered back and sank down on a bench  its phillittle phil sure enough he murmured how in the world did you come to follow me to this faraway place  i didnt follow you uncle lester returned the youth i and my friends were looking for a wild man who is roaming around in this vicinity scaring people and we reached this place by accident we saw you coming to the cabin with a bucket of water and i easily recognized you at once  i thought i was safe heresafe from the whole world muttered lester lawrence but you said you had good news for me he added quickly what is it  its the best kind of news uncle lester dont you know that shortly after you disappeared the bank authorities and the police found the guilty parties  they did and now the mans face showed his amazement  why sure they did and then of course they knew that you were innocent  oh phil can this be true  it certainly is true uncle lester every word of it you are an innocent man and everybody at home knows it father has been trying his best to get into communication with you he inserted personals in the newspapers and even put detectives on your track but as you know without avail  then the world knows that i am innocent thank god for that exclaimed the man with fervor oh how i have suffered and for such a long time too and tears stood in his eyes  but why didnt you communicate with father asked the nephew you ought to have known that he would be tremendously worried about you  i was bitter bitter against the whole world i didnt think i had a friend left cried lester lawrence i didnt want to see anybody and i didnt want anybody to see me i was afraid that they might catch me and put me in jail and then if i could not prove my innocenceand there was to my mind no way of doing thatthey would send me to prison for a long term of years thats why i made up my mind to disappear  and youve been up here ever since asked phil  no ive been here only since last summer before that i was in another section of the adirondacks  lester lawrence looked at dave and roger who had followed phil into the cabin and at the other boys who were crowded around the doorway  who are these some of your school chums he questioned  yes uncle lester answered the shipowners son and introduced his friends one after another they are all good fellows and i hope you will consider them as friends  i will do that phil if you want me to was the reply your revelation has lifted a great weight from my shoulders tell me all the particulars  sitting down beside his relative the shipowners son related all that he knew of the occurrences of the past mr lawrence listened to the recital with close attention and asked many questions his face meanwhile showing his intense satisfaction  what you have told me makes me feel ten years younger he declared if all this is trueand i have no reason to doubt your wordi can once more face the world and those who are dear to me  phil has got another surprise for you mr lawrence put in dave when the recital was at an end you will not only be a free man when you return to your former home but you will also have a good deal of money coming to you  indeed and how is that  its this way uncle lester answered phil and thereupon gave a few of the details concerning the land which the rival railroads wished to purchase from the uncle and phils father  that certainly is splendid news declared lester lawrence his eyes lighting up what a wonderful change the last hour has brought before you came i thought i was doomed to live here unknown and alone for perhaps the rest of my life  but how have you managed to live asked dave curiously  oh that has been easy you see when i left home i had quite a little money that belonged to me i buy necessary provisions down in one of the towns and also do some hunting and fishing this cabin belongs to the daughter of an old hunter who lived here for years and as she did not wish to occupy it she let me have it at a very reasonable rental  do you know anything of that wild man who is in this vicinity queried roger  at this direct question lester lawrence dropped his eyes and showed much confusion  i am afraid i do he answered shamefacedly the fact of the matter is it was i who played the wild man dressing myself up in some old outfits that were left in this cabin by those who used to live here  but what was your purpose questioned luke  i wanted to scare the folks in this vicinity so they would not come near this cabin i was afraid if too many people came to this neighborhood sooner or later somebody might recognize me and inform the authorities  you nearly scared the ladies and girls in our bungalows to death said ben bluntly  i am very sorry for it now was the reply but you see what phil has told me has put an entirely different face on the matter i looked at all strangers as enemies i was very bitter against everybody  well i guess you had a right to feel bitter uncle lester returned phil who could realize how his relative had suffered but its all past now and you must give up your life here and come home with me  i am willing to go home now that i know my name is cleared answered lester lawrence but i cant travel just yet he added ruefully looking down at his bandaged foot  what is the trouble questioned dave kindly  i sprained my ankle the day i followed one of you boysthat is i suppose it was one of your crowd i mean the chap who fell over the cliff  link merwell ejaculated phil he is no friend of ours he is an enemy by the way uncle lester have you seen him since then  he is an enemy you say cried mr lawrence is that so yes i saw him he was here early this morning and i chased him away     chapter xxv  two deer   he was here and you chased him away exclaimed dave have you any idea where he went to  i think he took the trail back of the house the one leading to carpen falls answered lester lawrence i slipped on my most outlandish costume and i must have scared him out of his wits for he ran like a deer he added with a smile  in that case there is no use in our looking for him around here announced roger  i think ill give the hunt up said phil finding my uncle has changed matters completely what i want to do is to send word to my father that my uncle is found then as soon as he is able to travel ill leave you fellows and take him home  i think ill be able to walk on the foot in a day or two answered lester lawrence you see i can already hobble around but that sprain was a pretty bad one i can assure you  after this the situation was discussed for some timein fact until well after the noon hour then one of the boys suggested that they have dinner and while phil and his uncle continued to talk over their personal affairs dave and his chums set about getting ready the meal  while all in the cabin partook of the midday meal the boys told the hermit about their life in camp and also of their adventures at oak hall and in other places lester lawrence listened interestedly to the recital and asked innumerable questions concerning their doings and also questioned phil regarding conditions at home  ill leave the matter of that land deal entirely to your father he said to his nephew he always had a better head for business than ive got hell know the right thing to do  after the meal it was decided that phil should remain at the cabin with his uncle while the other boys returned to bear camp phil wrote out a message which he asked dave and the others to send to carpen falls from which point it might be transmitted by telephone and telegraph to his parents announcing the finding of the longlost uncle  now that i have found uncle lester i dont want to leave him said phil to dave and roger as he drew his two particular chums to one side out of hearing of the others uncle lester may be all right in his mindin fact i hope he isbut at the same time he has acted so queerly that i dont want to give him any chance to get away from me besides i think he ought to rest so that his lame ankle can get well ill do all the work around here and stay until some of you get back which i suppose will be in a day or two  all right phil you stay with him by all means answered our hero well attend to this message and well wait to see if any message comes back from your father  the boys to return to bear camp had thought they must go by the way they had come but lester lawrence told them to follow the mountain torrent for a distance of a quarter of a mile and then they would reach a broad and welldefined trail leading to the brook which flowed into mirror lake  its a much shorter route he said and you will find the traveling much easier  it was about half an hour later when dave and the others bid phil and mr lawrence goodbye and set out on the return to bear camp our hero still had possession of the rifle and roger carried the shotgun under the heavy trees it was both dark and cold and the boys hurried along as rapidly as possible not only to make time but also to keep warm dave and roger were in advance discussing the finding of phils uncle  im mighty glad on phils account that his uncle has been found remarked dave the selling of that land at a handsome profit will be a big lift for the lawrence family  yes and how it will please phils parents to have mr lawrences brother back responded roger as it was they did not know whether he was dead or alive its a terrible thing to  roger broke off short for at that instant dave clapped his hand over his chums mouth and drew him quickly behind a nearby tree they were well in advance of their friends and now our hero motioned the others to keep back  what is it what is the trouble called out ben  its a deer keep quiet answered dave in a low tone  a deer where questioned roger  over yonder by the white birch  the senators son looked in the direction indicated but for the moment saw nothing out of the ordinary then however a head appeared from between some bushes back of the white birch and presently a beautiful deer stalked into view  i see him whispered roger excitedly there is your chance dave plug him  our hero already had the rifle raised he was about to pull the trigger when he paused for he had seen the bushes back of the deer move  whats up why dont you shoot whispered roger his voice betraying excitement  i think theres another deer there roger whispered our hero in return yes there he is now then you will have a shot yourself take the one on the left and ill take the one on the right  all right returned the senators son and raised the doublebarreled shotgun are you ready  yes when i say three fire answered dave quickly one two three  crack bang the two pieces rang out in quick succession and as the reports echoed through the forest both deer gave a wild leap into the air then the animal at which dave had shot plunged forward on its knees and fell into some brushwood kicking wildly the other deer whirled around and started to run for cover  give it the other barrel roger yelled dave as he ran forward  there was no need of this advice for while dave was yet speaking the second barrel of the shotgun was discharged at the flying deer rogers aim this time proved to be better than before and plunging forward the deer ran full tilt into a tree and then pitched over on its side where it soon breathed its last  long before dave reached his quarry he was ready for a second shot should the game require it but when he reached the deers side he found that the end of the animal was close at hand then he rejoined his chum who was watching the other deer  is he dead roger he asked quickly  i think he is dave was the answer and rogers tone showed his exaltation my but this is luck isnt it  i should say yes two deer at a clip  how about the one you hit is it dead  just about was daves reply and then he hurried over to the game to note that it was breathing its last  how did you make out the cry came from ben as he came running forward followed by luke and shadow  did you hit anything queried the former storyteller of oak hall  did they hit anything yelled luke say this is great they got two of them  this is what i call wholesale hunting announced ben  you fellows certainly opened the hunting season in great shape was shadows comment a wildcat and two deer all in one day  the boys dragged the two deer together and it must be confessed that dave and roger looked at their quarry with great pride  illustration crack bang the two pieces rang out in quick succession page 253  how are we going to get those down to the bungalows asked the senators son  i think the best thing to do will be to tie their feet together and slip each of them on a long pole returned dave  a small hatchet had been brought along for possible use in cutting firewood and with this the boys cut down two long and slender saplings then they tied up the deer as our hero had mentioned and a sapling was thrust between the front and hind legs of each of the game allowing the body to hang below  here ben you can carry the rifle announced dave ill take one end of one load  and ill help carry with you announced luke  ill carry my share of the load offered roger and he picked up one end of the second sapling while shadow took the other thus carrying the loads between them and with ben going ahead with the rifle they continued on the return to bear camp  progress with such heavy loads was necessarily slow and several times the boys stopped to rest it was well toward nightfall when they reached the stream flowing into mirror lake  having gained the watercourse it was an easy matter for them to continue onward until they reached the vicinity of the two bungalows as soon as they came in sight of the camp several set up a shout which quickly brought laura and belle into view  home again and with lots of good news cried dave swinging his cap  oh look they have two deer exclaimed the girl from the west isnt that grand  it certainly is returned laura but her voice had little of enthusiasm in it  where is uncle dunston cried dave i want him to look at what roger and i shot  your uncle has gone home answered belle at the same time laura turned away  gone home repeated dave in bewilderment why what made him do that i didnt know he was going until next week  he went with mr wadsworth continued belle they had some very important business to attend to  what was it laura do you know  yes i know dave answered the girl and now her voice had a curious uncertain ring in it oh dave its the most awful thing i ever heard of i dont see how i am ever going to tell you she burst out and then of a sudden began to cry and ran into the bungalow     chapter xxvi  startling news   dave was so surprised that for the moment he knew not what to say or do his eyes followed laura as she disappeared within the bungalow and then he turned in bewilderment to belle  laura takes it awfully hard but i dont think she ought toat least not yet said the girl from star ranch there may not be a word of truth in the story anyway im not going to believe it until they prove it  but what are you talking about belle questioned dave his face still showing his perplexity what is it all about has anything happened at home it isnt my father is it  no there is nothing wrong at your home daveat least not in the way you think belle paused for a moment as if not knowing how to go on you remember what link merwell said dont you  about me  yes of course i dont believe it at all but this young fellow ward porton sent word to your father and that has upset him a great deal so that he sent word to your uncle dunston and laura as well as to mr wadsworth the word came in this morning a couple of hours after you had left and after talking the matter over your uncle and mr wadsworth made up their minds to return to crumville without delay  and what did this ward porton have to say questioned our hero and it was with an effort that he steadied his voice  i cant give you all the particulars because laura did not show me the letter poor dear it just broke her up completely and ive had an awful time with herand ive had an awful time with jessie too  but you must know something went on dave while the others gathered around their faces showing their intense curiosity  well as near as i can make out this ward porton has been investigating matters connected with himself and with you and he claims that he is the real dave porter and that you are somebody else  oh say thats nonsense burst out phil quickly why we proved daves identity beyond question when we came back from our trip to the south seas  sure we did added roger daves uncle went into all of the details with the crumville poorhouse authorities and also got the particulars of how that fellow named sandy margot the goodfornothing husband of that crazy nurse polly margot abducted dave and took him on a railroad train and then got scared and put him off at crumville  i am sure i hope what you say is true roger responded the girl from the west what this porton bases his claim on i dont know as i said before i didnt read the letter daves uncle turned over to laura  i must go in and find out about this said dave in a curiously unnatural voice his mind was in a whirl and for the time being his good luck at hunting and the finding of phils uncle and the clearing up of the mystery of the wild man were completely forgotten  he found laura in one of the bedrooms of the bungalow sitting in a chair by the window with her hands clasped tightly together and her face firmset and drawn as she looked up at him two fresh tears stood out on her cheeks  they tell me that uncle dunston got a letter about me said the youth doing his best to steady his voice will you let me see it  its on the table returned the girl motioning with her hand and then she added impetuously oh dave i cant believe its true i simply cant why its the most dreadful thing that ever came up i am sure there must be some mistake  ii cant understand it dave stammered in return and then picked up the communication which had been sent by special messenger from carpen falls the letter ran as follows        dear dunston        a most astonishing thing has come up and i wish you would       return to crumville at once and it might be well to bring       mr wadsworth with you        i cannot go into all the details because i am completely       upset briefly stated the matter is this a young man named       ward portonthe same fellow who was in crumville some time       ago with link merwellhas written to me stating that he       has every reason to believe that he is the real dave porter       and that our dave is somebody else his story is that he was       left in a poorhouse at lumberville maine by an old woman       who obtained him from sandy margot who told her the child       had been under the care of polly his wife the claim is       also made that sandy margot had in reality stolen two       children little boys at about the same time and the       theory is advanced that the other boy was the one dropped       from the train at crumville the young man states that he       has gone into the matter very carefully and has a number of       proofs which he will submit whenever called on to do so he       adds that he feels sorry for dave but hopes that i will       find in him as good a son and also hopes that laura will       like him as well as a brother        i am so upset that i hardly know what to think or what to       do if this young mans story is true then all of us have       made a sad mistake and what dave is to do in the matter i       dont know come on as soon as possible and help me to get       to the bottom of this terrible mixup        your affectionate brother        david breslow porter  dave read this letter with care and then allowed the communication to slip from his fingers if his mind had been in a whirl before it was more so now and for the moment he could hardly think straight if he was not dave porter who was he a thousand ideas ran riot through his brain  oh dave it cant be true can it came halfpleadingly from laura  i dont know he answered dumbly i dont know  but dave i thought that you and uncle dunston proved your identity completely even before you found father and met me  i always supposed we did prove it laura he answered we went into the matter very carefully at that time nothing was ever said about sandy margot stealing two little boys i always supposed he had taken only one child  and to think this other young man is a perfect stranger went on laura dolefully there is no telling what sort of a person he is  hes no stranger to me i helped to pull him out of the water when the steam yacht was on fire answered dave i guess hes all right as far as that goes although i dont think much of his keeping company with link merwell  do you suppose it can be a plot hatched up by link merwell  i dont know what to think this news stuns me ive got to consider it maybe i had better go back to crumville too  no uncle dunston said you had better stay hereat least for the present he said if they wanted you they could send you word  oh all right and now daves voice showed a faint trace of bitterness maybe they dont want me around if they have really settled it that i am not the real dave porter  oh dave dont want you around laura sprang to her feet and coming over to him caught both his hands in her own dont talk that way even if they should prove that you are not my brother i shall always think just as much of you  thank you for saying that laura he returned with much emotion its nice to know that there is somebody who wont go back on me  i dont believe anybody will go back on you daveyou have always been so good oh i think this is dreadfuljust dreadful and laura showed signs of bursting into tears once more  where are jessie and mrs wadsworth and mrs basswood  i think jessie went over to the other bungalow with her mother she was as much upset as i was  does she think the story is true  she hopes it isnt but of course she cant do anythingand i cant do anything either  well i dont see what i can do dave took a turn up and down the room and then sank on a chair this just knocks me endwise i cant even seem to think straight he added helplessly  you poor boy laura came over and brushed back the hair from his forehead you dont know how this hurts dave oh it cant be true  i wonder how long ive got to wait before i hear from crumville  i am sure i dont know i think though well get word just as soon as they know anything definite  at that moment came a timid knock on the door and laura opened it to admit jessie the appearance of the girl showed that she was much upset her face was tearstained and her hair awry  oh dave was all she said and then coming straight toward him she threw her head on his shoulder and burst into a fit of weeping  there there jessie dont you cry so he said soothingly i am sure it will be all right  but dadave hasnt laura totold you  yes she has told me  and did you read that letter  yes  but it cant be true dave oh tell me it cant be true went on the girl pleadingly  i cant tell you whether it is true or not jessie for i dont know answered the boy as bravely as he could i suppose theyll investigate the matter at crumville and at that place in maine and let me know he looked at her curiously what if they prove i am not the real dave porter jessiewill you care very much  care of course ill care dave but dont misunderstand me she added quickly even if they prove you are not the real dave porter it wont make any difference to me i shall think just as much of you no matter who you are  do you really mean that and he clutched her tightly  i certainly do what difference will it really make you will be yourself no matter what your name is  i know jessie ill be myself but who will i be perhaps ill be a poorhouse nobody after all and he smiled bitterly  never returned the girl emphatically youll never be a nobody dave you are too true both to yourself and to those around you youll make a name for yourself in this world even if they take your present name away from you and as she spoke the girls words rang with earnestness  a great and peculiar joy seemed to creep over dave and despite the blackness of the situation his heart for the moment felt light he gazed with emotion at both laura and jessie  if thats the way you feel about itand laura says she feels the sameim not going to worry just yet he answered     chapter xxvii  what happened in the night   that evening the sole topic of conversation at bear camp was the news concerning dave the other lads could not bear to question laura or jessie on the subject knowing how badly both of them must feel but they asked belle to tell all she knew and also quizzed mrs wadsworth and mrs basswood  its the worst state of affairs i have ever known was the way the jewelry manufacturers wife expressed herself in private to roger and phil we as you know think the world and all of dave and we dont want him to drop back and become a nobody even in name he is a splendid boy and no matter what happens we shall always think as much of him as we ever did  i think all his friends will stick to him answered roger at the same time this will cut him to the heart and what hell do if they really prove he isnt dave porter i dont know  maybe the porters will continue to keep him in the family as an adopted son suggested phil that is if this report really proves to be true which i dont believe will happen  i have always thought a great deal of dave ever since he saved jessie from that gasoline explosion returned mrs wadsworth should they find out that he is not a porter i think i would be strongly in favor of my husband adopting him  say that wouldnt be half bad burst out phil and the suggestion does you credit mrs wadsworth personally i think dave is the finest fellow in the world  i am sure we all think that added roger since he went to oak hall he has made a host of real friends and i dont think one of them will desert him  while this conversation was going on the other boys were talking to our hero doing their best to cheer him up and to convince him that no matter what happened they would stick to him  you take it from me declared luke this is some scheme gotten up by link merwell and this other fellow  certainly its a scheme added shadow it puts me in mind of a story i once heard about a fellow down south who stole three watermelons andbut oh pshaw whats the use of trying to tell a story now im going to cut them out until we get this thing settled he added in disgust  dont you worry dave i am sure it will come out all right in the end was what ben said speaking with an apparent conviction that he did not by any means feel  youre all kind fellows and i appreciate it very much answered dave but this is a blow to me if youll excuse me id like to take a little walk by myself and think it over and thus speaking the youth withdrew from the crowd and walked slowly to the lake and along a footpath bordering the shore  its the rankest shame i ever knew declared ben when the others were left to themselves if i had that ward porton here id wring his neck  i guess wed all like to do that responded shadow nevertheless if he is the real dave porter you cant blame him for trying to prove it  there is only one thing about it that troubles me said luke dont you remember that all of those who saw this ward porton agreed that he looked very much like mr dunston porter  yes but dave looks like dunston porter too came quickly from ben  its queer that he resembles his uncle more than he does his father was shadows comment maybe this ward porton resembles mr david porter  well its fierce thats all ive got to say declared ben and what dave is going to do if they prove he isnt the real dave porter is something i dont like to think about in those days when we first went to oak hall youll remember how bitter he felt when some of his enemies referred to him as that poorhouse nobody and how eager he was to clear up the mystery of his identity even though it cost him a trip to the south sea islands  dave walked on and on along the lake shore paying little attention to where he was going his mind was in a state bordering on bewilderment in a faint uncertain way he had anticipated some such calamity but now that the blow had fallen the matter looked almost hopeless to him had he followed his own inclinations he would have made preparations to return to crumville at once  but evidently they dont want me there he told himself bitterly they want to solve this mystery without my interference and if they do make up their minds that i am not the real dave porter i wonder how they will treat me of course they may be very kind to methe same as laura and jessie and the others up here but kindness of that sort isnt everything i dont want any one to support me if i havent some claim on him and then dave shut his teeth hard clenched his hands and walked on faster than ever  finally tired out because he had been on his feet since early morning dave sat down on a flat rock to rest as he did this he heard the putput of a motor and presently around a bend of the shore showed the headlight of mr applebys motorboat  i wonder if they are simply going down to the end of the lake or whether they are going to stop at our place said dave to himself id rather they wouldnt stop at bear camp tonight when everything is so upset  as the motorboat swung around the headlight flashed full upon our hero and there followed an exclamation from the manager of the movingpicture company who was at the wheel of the craft with two men beside him  hello there porter what are you doingfishing  no i just came down here to sit on the rock and do a little thinking answered dave  we are making a little trip around the lake went on mr appleby i was going to stop at your dock and deliver a letter that came in our mail by mistake its a letter for you so i might as well give it to you now  a letter for me eh answered dave  yes here you are went on mr appleby as the motorboat came to a standstill close by ill put it in the newspaper and you can have that too as we have read it and suiting the action to the word the man placed the letter in the folds of the paper and tossed the latter ashore  will you stop questioned dave  not tonight we are going to make a call on the other side of the lake i just thought id give you the letter thats all and then with a pleasant goodbye the manager steered his motorboat out into mirror lake again  it was too dark to read the letter without a light and as dave did not happen to have even a match he walked back to the bungalows the lanterns were hung out on the porches as was the custom and under the light of one of these he looked at the communication he had received  its from crumville he exclaimed to himself eagerly as he looked at the postmark but then as he recognized the handwriting his face fell its only from nat poole  the communication from the moneylenders son was a long one containing much news which it will be unnecessary to give here there was however one paragraph in the letter which dave read with great interest        i am sorry if you put yourselves out trying to catch that       wild man thinking he was my uncle wilbur as i told you my       uncle got away from the sanitarium and they had quite a job       to locate him they found him up in the vicinity of oak       hall at one of the houses where he had once stayed they       got him to return to the sanitarium without any trouble and       the doctors think that he is now doing finely  hello dave what are you reading remarked roger coming up  heres a letter from nat poole and our hero told how he had received it you can read it for yourself they have found wilbur poole and have put him back in the sanitarium  is that so well i am glad they caught him and then roger read the letter and went off to spread the news among the other boys  the next day was a long one for dave while ben and luke went to carpen falls with a letter directed to phils father he spent part of the time dressing the two deer but his heart was not in the work and his friends noted his absentmindedness several times he looked down in the direction of the trail leading to carpen falls and they knew he was hoping for some messenger to appear summoning him to come to crumville  it makes me sick to see dave so downcast whispered ben to roger that evening i wish we could cheer him up  i dont see how we are going to do it we cant lift that burden from his mind we have simply got to wait until some word comes from the porters at crumville i dont believe theyll keep dave waiting any longer than necessary  but think of the terrible suspense  i know it its too bad  the afternoon had been cloudy and late in the evening it began to rain then the wind came up moaning through the forest in melancholy fashion and sending thousands of whitecaps across the surface of the lake  it isnt mirror lake tonight said belle with a little shiver its more like foamy lake  i dont think id want to go out in a canoe tonight returned phil who was beside her  i think we are going to have quite a storm said laura just listen to that wind  with fitful gusts tearing around the bungalows no one felt much like going to bed about ten oclock came a hard downpour lasting for half an hour then the wind died away and gradually the rain ceased  i guess the worst of it is over announced mrs wadsworth presently i think we may as well retire and shortly after that all of the inmates of both bungalows were in bed  for a long while dave could not sleep as had been the case the night previous he tumbled and tossed on his couch thinking of the trouble that had come to him but at last tired nature claimed its own and he sank into a profound slumber from which he did not awaken until some time after sunrise  hello i must have overslept he declared as he leaped up to see that his chums were almost dressed  dave was just finishing his toilet and the other boys and some of the girls had started to walk down to the dock to look at the lake when a cry came from the kitchen of the bungalow  mrs wadsworth mr porter came a call from the hired girl please come here  what is it mary asked mrs wadsworth as she appeared from her own room  sure maam a whole lot of things are missing declared the girl  missing what is missing  sure maam almost everything in the kitchen is missing maam and the girl pointed around in a helpless sort of fashion all the knives and forks and spoons are gone and so are some of the pots and pans and kettles  is that possible  yes maam and that aint all maam sure and most of the things in the pantry and in the icebox are gone too announced mary running from one place to another sure maam weve been burglarized maam     chapter xxviii  della fords statement   burglars  did they take any of our valuables  oh i wonder if they were in our rooms  mary were all the things here when you went to bed questioned mrs wadsworth of the servant girl who was now in the wildest possible state of excitement wringing her hands and running from one room to another  yes maam when i went to bed everything was in its place im sure of it maam  the boys as well as the girls crowded into the kitchen and then looked into the pantry in a corner of which was located the icebox  how about this pantry window mary did you leave it open last night asked dave pointing to the window in question  sure sir i did not i always lock up well before i go to bed answered the girl  you didnt open the window this morning  no sir  then that is where the thief must have come in remarked roger  i think we had better take a look around and see just how much is missing advised phil the thief may have cleaned us out more than we imagine  upon this a systematic search was made through all the rooms of the bungalow in the midst of the work ben came running over from the other place  say what do you know about this he called out somebody visited our bungalow last night and took nearly all our victuals and our tableware and our kitchen utensils  the same thing happened here ben answered dave we are just sizing up the situation to find out how much is gone  the others are at that now over at our bungalow i thought id run over to tell you ill go back and tell them you are in the same fix this is fierce isnt it and then ben hurried away  an examination of the premises showed that all the tableware of value had disappeared along with two rings which laura had left on the mantelpiece in the livingroom from the kitchen nearly everything used in cooking was gone and likewise almost everything from the pantry and the icebox  oh my two rings burst out laura the diamond that dad gave me and the beautiful ruby from uncle dunston  its too bad laura declared jessie  thats what it is said dave well have to get after that burglar whoever he is  this looks to me like the work of some of these people who are camping out in the adirondacks announced roger what would an ordinary burglar do with a lot of kitchen utensils not to mention canned goods and stuff from an icebox  maybe they took the stuff from the icebox to eat suggested dave it might be that they would rather camp out than run the risk of going to carpen falls or to some of the hotels for their meals  having completed the search in the bungalows the boys followed by the others went outside here they discovered a great number of footprints leading back and forth from the pantry window to the edge of the forest among some jagged rocks the trail was lost  looks to me as if there must have been half a dozen fellows in this raid announced roger what do you think of it dave  either that or else the fellow who did the job made a dozen trips or more to me the footprints look very much alike  presently the crowd went over to the basswood bungalow and there learned that among other things some solid silver tableware which mrs basswood had brought along had vanished  i was foolish to bring such expensive silver declared the lady of the house but i thought we could use it if we happened to have visitors i never dreamed of being robbed up here  at the basswood bungalow an entrance to the kitchen and pantry had been effected through the woodshed the door of which had been broken open from this shed a trail led up to the jagged rocks previously mentioned  the same rascal or the same crowd that did one job did both declared dave  i dont know what we are going to do for breakfast declared mrs wadsworth rather helplessly we have next to nothing to cook and nothing to cook it in  we are in the same fix answered mrs basswood it certainly is a terrible state of affairs i wish my husband was here to tell us what to do  oh dont worry about something to eat cried dave we can go down to carpen falls and get whatever we want and also get some extra kitchen utensils and dont forget the deermeat what worries me is the loss of lauras rings and mrs basswoods silverware  we might go up into the woods and look around suggested ben although its mighty wet up there from the rain  the matter was talked over for a while longer and in the meantime the ladies and the girls aided by the hired help made an inventory of what was left in the way of eatables  we can give all of you some coffee and some fancy crackers said mrs wadsworth  and we have found two cans of baked beans added mrs basswood theyll go some distance toward filling up the boys and she smiled faintly  ill tell you what we might do cried roger supposing four of us fellows jump into the fouroared boat and row up to the appleby camp i am sure they have plenty of provisions and theyll lend us some until we can get in a new lot from carpen falls and maybe theyll lend us a few cooking utensils too  thats the thing to do returned ben come on lets go up there at once and so it was settled  dave and luke accompanied ben and roger on the trip and as the four youths had often rowed together on the leming river at oak hall they soon covered the distance to the camp of the movingpicture people they saw the crowd getting ready to depart for the enacting of the final drama in that locality  hello youre out bright and early in your boat cried mr appleby as he waved his hand to them taking a little exercise eh  no we came for assistance called back ben  assistance repeated the manager whats the trouble  we have been burglarized and we have hardly anything left to eat broke in luke and at this announcement all of those in the appleby camp came down to the dock to learn the particulars of what had occurred  in one way you have come at just the right time to get those things said the manager of the movingpicture company to the boys we are going to leave here tomorrow to go back to boston so we shall want but little of the food that is on hand and youll be welcome to use our tableware and kitchen utensils they belong here in the cottage so all youll have to do when you get through with them will be to bring them back  while rowing to the appleby camp dave had been giving serious thought to his own affairs he remembered what he had heard concerning ward porton and della ford and resolved to question the young lady and the other members of the movingpicture company about the young man who claimed to be the real dave porter our heros chance came when the other boys were busy placing some provisions and cooking utensils in the rowboat he motioned della ford and her aunt to one side and the three walked out of hearing of the others present  if you dont mind i would like to ask you something about mr ward porton said our hero to the girl  o dear i thought i was done with that young man cried della with a toss of her head  he bothered my niece so much while he was a member of the company she got quite sick of him declared mrs ford he was a very forward young man  id like very much to find out about his past history where he came from and all that went on dave its something very important  i know more about mr porton than he thinks i do announced della thats one reason why i dropped him  but della you dont want to get into any trouble interposed the girls aunt quickly  if youll tell me what you know about ward porton ill promise that it wont get you into any trouble answered dave quickly i want if possible to find out where he came from and who brought him up  who brought him up queried mrs ford didnt he live with his parents  he says not he claims to have come from a poorhouse in a town down in maine  why you dont tell me mr porter exclaimed the lady in astonishment he told me once that he had lived with his folks up to the time he was about ten years old and that then his parents had died and he had gone to live with an uncle  yes and he did live with an uncleor at least some man he called his uncle added della  are you certain of this asked our hero eagerly  i am mr porter  and may i ask what the thing was that you knew about him that caused you to drop him continued dave  wait a minute della before you answer that question interposed mrs ford hastily i think we ought to know why mr porter is after this information  since we have gone so far i may as well tell you returned dave and in as few words as possible he related how it had come about that ward porton was now claiming to be the real dave porter  why what a queer story declared mrs ford it sounds like some novel  i dont believe its true mr porter cried della ford i believe he is a faker at first i thought he was quite nice but i soon discovered otherwise he is addicted to gambling and when he gets the fever he gambles away the very clothing on his back  then that is why you broke with him  that was one reason but as i said before i know more about mr porton than he imagined one day we had been out walking and after he left me i picked up a letter which must have dropped from his pocket when he pulled out his cigarette case as the letter had no envelope i did not know whose it was and read it it was evidently written by a very angry man the writer who signed himself obadiah jones said that he was sick and tired of putting up for ward that ward could no longer expect any assistance from him that he cast the young man off and never wanted to hear from him again  and you say that letter was signed by a man named obadiah jones asked dave eagerly  yes rather an oldfashioned name isnt it  did the man give his address  no there was no address of any kind on the letter answered della ford  was this obadiah jones the man he said was his uncle continued our hero  i dont know about that answered the girl     chapter xxix  the big bear   dave was very thoughtful as the four boys rowed back to the bungalows with the things procured from mr appleby his talk with della ford and her aunt had lasted until the others were ready to depart but he had gained little information beyond that already known to the reader  if only i had the address of that obadiah jones i might go and see him and listen to what he has to say about ward porton he told himself of course he may not be portons uncle at alli know lots of children taken from poorhouses and orphan asylums who call the folks aunt and uncle but even if he isnt he may be able to give me some information that will put me on the right track regarding this affair  the morning was spent by those at the bungalows in getting settled once more the provisions brought from the appleby camp were divided between the two places and likewise the kitchen utensils  id like to set some sort of a trap and catch those burglars declared ben  i dont see how youre going to do it returned our hero i doubt very much whether they will show themselves in this vicinity again more than likely they are miles away  dave do you think link merwell had anything to do with this  its possible ben although i dont see how he would have the nerve to come back here after what happened i should think he would feel like quitting this territory entirely  another day went by bringing no word from crumville our hero and roger had tramped all the way to carpen falls hoping for letters but the only one to come in was a redirected epistle for ben inviting him to become a subscriber to some local charity  o shucks i suppose the charity is all right said ben when he got this letter but id like to get some real news from dad or somebody else at home  dave said little but he felt more downcast than ever he had thought that a letter would surely come by now roger noticed how he felt and placed a kindly hand on our heros shoulder  dont you worry dave old man he said feelingly this will come out all right in the end  i hope so roger was the answer but this suspense wears on a fellow  perhaps if you went to maine to that town where the poorhouse is located that ward porton says he came from you might be able to find out something about that obadiah jones went on the senators son who had been told of what the fords had revealed  i was thinking something of that roger and if i cant get on the track any other way ill go there was the reply but i hate to think of leaving here until i get some kind of word from crumville  well some things move slowly dave dont forget that more than likely your unci mean the folks down in crumvilleare doing all they can to get to the bottom of the matter most likely they are investigating the proofs that ward porton said he was willing to present  on the following morning there was something of a surprise about eleven oclock while some of the lads were fishing and dave had jessie out in a canoe there came a shout from up the brook and looking in that direction our hero saw phil approaching with his uncle beside him leaning on the youths shoulder  hello mr lawrences ankle must have got better quickly cried dave  and is that the socalled wild man returned jessie he doesnt seem to be very wild now  youve heard us tell why he acted in that outlandish way was the answer as dave paddled toward the dock  soon the boys were surrounding the new arrivals and mr lawrence was led to a couch upon which he was glad to sit down and thus rest his injured ankle the ladies and the girls were introduced and the man shook hands with them rather shamefacedly  ill have to apologize to you for acting so rudely said lester lawrence after the introductions were over i suppose the boys have told you why i did it  yes mr lawrence answered mrs wadsworth kindly and under the circumstances we are quite willing to let bygones be bygones  can we do anything for your ankle questioned laura who was a naturalborn nurse  i guess about all it needs is rest answered lester lawrence it was quite a journey from my shack to this place but i saw that phil was getting anxious to rejoin you so i told him we might as well make the venture today rather than wait he has been hoping that you would have some word for him from my brother  no word yet phil answered dave but there may be in the mail today  say we had some scare this morning just before we left the cabin declared the shipowners son i was nearly frightened into a fit  what was that came from several of the others  i was cleaning the dishes after breakfast and i went outdoors to throw some scraps in a heap behind some bushes just as i got there with my panful of stuff up jumpedwhat do you thinka great big bear  a bear shrieked the girls  did you shoot him broke in shadow  shoot him what witha fryingpan  then the bear got away asked roger  i dont know whether the bear got away or i got away i dropped that fryingpan and i legged it for the cabin for all i was worth in the meantime the bear disappeared among the trees just back of the cabin i got my uncles rifle and went out to look for him but it was no use  o dear a bear murmured jessie suppose he comes down here and she gave a slight shiver  why that would be fun declared belle id like to see that bear and get a shot at him too went on the girl from star ranch  if that bear is anywhere in this vicinity we might organize a hunt for him suggested luke who on the day previous had gone out with ben and shadow and brought down a partridge  thats the talk cried roger come on let us go on a hunt it will give us something to do  the matter was discussed for a quarter of an hour and during that time roger and ben managed to take phil to one side and tell him about the news from crumville the shipowners son was of course much astonished  i believe its a fake he declared flatly dave is dave porter and no mistake we cleared that matter up directly after our return from the south seas  just what i said phil responded roger at the same time i suppose the porters have got to listen to ward portons claim  bah its a conspiracy i tell youa conspiracy gotten up by this fellow porton and by link merwell you cant tell me any different and phils face showed his earnestness  it was decided that all of the boys should go out directly after lunch in a hunt for the bear the number of shotguns and rifles on hand was enough to go around so that each of them would be armed they also provided themselves with some provisions not knowing how late it would be before they got back  oh dave do be careful pleaded jessie when the boys were ready to depart dont let that bear eat you up  dont worry he answered ill take care of myself and then he added with something of a sigh i hope you have good news for me when i get back  i hope so too dave but just remember what i said she went on looking him straight in the eyes ill think just as much of you even if they prove that you are not dave porter  phil was with the crowd and all headed up the brook and then along the trail leading to the cabin which had been occupied by lester lawrence arriving there a hunt was made through the forest back of the cabin  its a good deal like hunting for the proverbial needle in a haystack remarked roger  where did you see the bear last phil questioned luke  just about here was the reply and the shipowners son pointed with his hand i think he went in that direction he added  the boys spread out in a long straight line and in this fashion proceeded through the forest for the best part of a mile during that time they thought they saw a deer in the distance and roger might have taken a shot but dave imperatively stopped him  we cant shoot at anything if we want to get close to that bear announced our hero bears are very scary creatures and if you make too much noise that beast will run for miles and miles before he stops  late afternoon found the boys still on the search they had seen nothing to shoot at and some of them were growing disheartened luke was limping slightly having caught his foot between a crevice in the rocks  i move we rest and have something to eat announced ben and this suggestion was quickly seconded by the others then when the sun was well down in the west they decided to turn back toward the bungalows  it was a tramp of over a mile and a half and as the footing in many places was uncertain they had to proceed with great care  such a hunt grumbled ben its been all hunting and no shooting  which puts me in mind of a story cried shadow oh this is a short one so you neednt frown at it he went on quickly glancing around its about a fellow who came along and saw an old man fishing in a lake hows fishing he asked of the old man couldnt be better was the answer catch anything no then what do you mean by saying the fishing is good so it is i didnt say anything about the catching and at this a grin went around  we ought to be getting in sight of the bungalows soon remarked roger after they had climbed over some rough rocks and were walking through a dense patch of the forest  say this is a fine place to get lost in remarked phil  it will be all right as long as the sunlight lasts answered dave i am using that for a compass  soon they came to the edge of a clearing on the other side of which were a series of rocks with vines and brushwood the boys were about to advance across the clearing when suddenly shadows arms went up into the air  stststop he spluttered in a low tone drdrdrop down all of you  the others saw that he was much in earnest and immediately sank down behind the trees and rocks then all gazed inquiringly at the former storyteller of oak hall  its the bebebear spluttered shadow sasay dont you think we had bebebetter run for it  the bear where is it demanded dave  i saw him just lift his head up among the rocks yonder returned shadow say he looked like an awful big fellow  well if he is there you bet we are not going to run away from him declared phil come on lets see if we cant shoot him  wait a minute phil advised dave if the bear is among yonder rocks as shadow says we had better spread out a little and thus get a better chance at him  seeing that his companions were not frightened shadow regained some of his composure and followed them although keeping a little to the rear with great caution and holding their firearms ready for use the whole crowd of boys crossed the clearing and gained the first of the rocks beyond fortunately the breeze was coming from ahead of them thus carrying their scent away from where the bear was supposed to be  it had been agreed that when necessary dave should give the signal to fire he was slightly in advance and now with great caution he looked over some rocks just ahead of him the sight that met his gaze was an interesting one there was a slight depression there partly filled with brushwood and in the midst of this stood a big bear he had his head down in a hole and was digging out various things with his forepaws flinging them to one side and behind him out came a kettle a fryingpan some knives and forks cups saucers a pieplate a dishpan and numerous other articles which clattered over the rocks  great hambones dave what kind of a noise is that asked phil who was beside our hero  its our stolen stuff thats what it is phil cried dave those burglars must have thrown the stuff in that hole  but what would the bear be doing among that stuff questioned luke  hes after grub answered our hero they must have thrown some of the food in there with the other stuff come on boys get ready to fire  fortunately for the lads the bear was so interested in what he was trying to accomplish that he did not notice their approach the noise of the flying kettles and pans drowned out the voices  whats the matter with all taking a shot at him at the same time questioned phil  all right im willing responded dave quickly we might as well all have the glory of killing himif we have that luck  every rifle and every shotgun was quickly raised and aimed at the bear just as dave was on the point of giving the order to fire the beast came out of the hole and looked around then in alarm he raised up on his hind legs a truly terrifying animal to behold  bang crack bang went the rifles and shotguns in an irregular volley and then as the report died away the huge beast gave a leap into the air and coming down sprang directly toward the boys     chapter xxx  good newsconclusion   here he comes  give him another shot boys  crack bang crack again the shotguns and rifles rang out  whether the shots were absolutely necessary or not it would be hard to say for just as the boys discharged their various weapons the huge bear was seen to stumble and fall he gave several convulsive shudders and then lay still  is heis he dedead gasped shadow who was still a few feet in the rear of the others  i think he is responded dave load up again as quickly as you can and well watch him and then he proceeded to take care of his own firearm  but watching was unnecessary for the huge beast had breathed his last it was a proud crowd of boys that surrounded the game  say thats some shooting declared phil his eyes glistening wont the others be surprised when they hear of it  he certainly is a big one said ben i dont believe they grow them much bigger than that anywhere around here and this assertion proved true as the boys learned when later on tad rason saw the game at the bungalows  well weve got our kitchen utensils and most of the tableware back anyway declared roger after an inspection of the hollow where they had first discovered the bear at work hello heres the stuff mr bruin was after he added holding up a chunk of meat which still lay in a pan in the hollow this meat had been taken from the wadsworth icebox but why it had been placed in the hollow was a mystery  but its a good thing the burglars put it there declared luke that is what attracted the bear and made him dig  a careful search of the hollow revealed nearly everything that had been taken from the two bungalows except lauras rings and mrs basswoods silverware  i guess they thought those things too valuable to leave here was daves comment i am convinced of one thing he added  what is that questioned ben  i believe link merwell is at the bottom of this no ordinary burglar would bother his head about that kitchen stuff merwell did it just to cause us trouble maybe he thought wed have to give up camping here for the time being  by jove dave i think you have solved it declared roger  all of which doesnt give my mother her silverware nor laura her rings returned ben  a sapling with some stout branches attached was cut down and on to this the boys rolled the bear and tied him fast thus they managed after a good deal of hard labor to haul the carcass down to the bungalows  oh here they come and theyve got a bear shrieked belle who saw them first and all the inmates of the bungalows hurried to the scene even mr lawrence hobbling up with the aid of a cane  yes we got a bear and we got more than that cried ben excitedly weve found all the kitchen stuff and he and the other youths gave the particulars  a little later some of the boys returned to the hollow and transferred the stolen stuff back to the bungalows a good deal of the canned provisions was still in perfect condition the other things including the meat the bear had scented were thrown away  oh dave cried jessie as soon as she could motion our hero to one side ive got something i want to tell you i think maybe it will be of assistance in proving your identity and the girls eyes glowed with anticipation  what is it jessie he asked quickly have you heard something from home  no but ive heard something from mr lawrence phils uncle isnt it the strangest thing ever i was talking to him after you left and told him what trouble you were having and mentioned ward porton and that man the fords told you about obadiah jones and would you believe it years ago mr lawrence had some business dealings with a man named obadiah jones and he is quite sure that man had a nephew who was named ward  jessie can this be true exclaimed dave with pardonable excitement  thats what mr lawrence told me i think you had better speak to him and without delay  i certainly will declared our hero and going up to the crowd that was still around the bear he touched phils uncle on the arm  what is it porter oh i suppose you want to see me about that man obadiah jones well ill tell you all i know come on back to where i can sit down this lame ankle of mine is still rather weak and thus speaking mr lawrence led the way around to the front porch of the bungalow  what i want to know is if this ward porton was really a nephew of obadiah jones said dave  yes thats what miss jessie wanted to know too of course i dont know for sure but i do know the boys name was ward and that he called jones uncle obadiah you might write to obadiah jones and find out he lives in burlington vermont and thats not so very far from herejust on the other side of lake champlain his full name is obadiah l l jones we used to always call him old l l about everybody in burlington knows him  perhaps id better go and call on mr jones suggested dave id hate to wait for an answer to a letter  it was not long before the others in the camp knew what dave had learned concerning ward porton and his supposed uncle obadiah l l jones the boys agreed with dave that it might pay to make a trip to burlington to see him and phil and roger volunteered to go along  you might want a witness or two declared the senators son  the upshot of the matter was that the following day found the three boys bound for burlington the other lads helped to row them to the upper end of the lake and there at a camp belonging to a rich new yorker they managed to obtain a horse and buckboard on which they rode to the nearest railroad station they were in time to catch the midday train for plattsburg where they had to remain over night then they caught the first boat across lake champlain to the city for which they were bound  dave had been told by mr lawrence where they might find obadiah jones who was interested in a coal lumber and real estate business our hero accompanied by his two chums found the man in his office a small dingy coop of a place surrounded by huge piles of lumber he was a short stout baldheaded individual wearing large spectacles and he looked up rather uninvitingly as they entered  is this mr obadiah jones questioned dave politely  thats my name young man what can i do for you demanded the lumber dealer brusquely  i came to get a little information from you mr jones if youll give it to me went on our hero my name is dave porter i came to see if you have a nephew named ward porton  well i did have a nephew by that name but hes a nephew of mine no longer cried obadiah jones his face showing sudden anger if you came here in his behalf the sooner you get out the better i wrote to him and told him i never wanted to see him nor hear from him again  i didnt come in his behalf mr jones i came on my own account answered dave all i want to know is is he a real nephew of yours or not  yes hes my real nephewthe son of my youngest sister who married a goodfornothing army man but that doesnt make any difference to me young man i wont do a thing more for him nephew though he is hes a young scamp and as i said before i never want to see him nor hear from him again  the reason i ask is because there has come up a question regarding ward portons identity continued dave who could scarcely conceal his satisfaction over the turn the conversation had taken porton declared to me that he had been brought up in a maine poorhouse  thats all tommyrot young man it isnt so at all stormed obadiah jones after his father ran away to join some revolutionists in mexico his mother was hard put to it to support herself and when she took sick and died he was placed in the lumberville poorhouse by some neighbors as soon as i heard of it i sent for him to come to montpelier where i was then doing business after that i brought him here i gave him a good education and did everything i could to set him on his feet but he began to smoke and drink and gamble and get into bad company generally and finally he left here and went on the stage as an actor i heard he didnt do very well at that business and so he got into the movingpicture business obadiah jones looked sharply at dave but what do you want to know all this for he questioned quickly  ill tell you why mr jones answered dave and without waiting to be invited he sat down on a chair beside the lumber dealer and told the man the particulars of the trouble ward porton had caused him  humph snorted obadiah jones at the conclusion of the recital that sounds just like one of wards fairy tales dont you take any stock in that story because there is absolutely nothing in it i have disowned him it is true but nevertheless he is my nephew the son of my youngest sister clarice jones porton her goodfornothing husband was lieutenant jarvey porton of the army who was discharged because of irregularities in his accounts i never wanted her to marry the lieutenant but she wouldnt listen to me for a minute  after this a conversation lasting the best part of half an hour ensued the lumber dealer became quite interested in daves case and readily consented to sign a document stating the facts concerning ward porton as he knew them roger phil and an office clerk witnessed the lumber dealers signature and then the boys bade obadiah jones goodbye and left  dave let me congratulate you cried roger grasping our heros hand warmly  oh i knew it would all come out right in the end cried phil as he placed a loving arm over daves shoulder say youll have one on ward porton when you show him that document he continued with a chuckle  you dont know what a weight this has lifted from my shoulders murmured dave and despite his efforts to control himself two tears stood in his eyes the thought that i might not be the real dave porter after all was something terrible he murmured  what will you do send word to crumville and then go back to camp asked roger  i suppose that would be best answered dave ill first send word home and wait in burlington for a reply  it was not long after this when they entered a local telegraph office and there dave wrote out a telegram addressed to his father at crumville he asked that a reply to the communication be addressed to a leading hotel of burlington where the three lads afterwards went for dinner  a telegram for mr david porter called out one of the hotel boys just after the lads had finished eating and he passed the communication over to our hero  its from crumville and from my father said dave as he glanced at the communication which ran as follows  your telegram received glad to know the truth we had suspected porton of trickery merwell is in the game  its just as i thought said dave when he allowed his friends to read the communication link merwell told porton about how i had come from the poorhouse and then the pair hatched up this game between them i only hope my folks catch them and give them what they deserve  that afternoon found the lads again on the way to plattsburg and early on the following morning they set out on the return to bear camp  oh dave did you learn anything cried laura when the boys appeared  yes laura its all cleared up he exclaimed in a voice filled with joy ward porton is nothing but a faker he is the real nephew of obadiah jones and the son of joness youngest sister ive got a document in my pocket to prove it  oh dave im so glad so glad was the cry of the sister and she threw herself into his arms and kissed him several times then jessie came up and kissed him too and so did belle followed by mrs basswood and finally mrs wadsworth who held him closely to her  im very very glad for your sake dave said the wife of the jewelry manufacturer but if you hadnt proved to be dave porter i should have been only too glad to have adopted you as my son  it was certainly a happy return and that evening both bungalows were lit up brightly in honor of the occasion shadow was allowed to tell some of his best stories luke played on his banjo and his guitar and the young folks sang one familiar song after another  three days including sunday passed and then came another surprise late in the evening dave heard a wellknown whistle on the trail leading to carpen falls and a little later one of the old stage coaches came into view all in the bungalows ran out to meet the newcomers who proved to be daves father his uncle mr wadsworth and mr basswood  dad yelled dave and rushing to his parent he caught him tightly in his arms  my boy my boy murmured mr porter how very glad i am that this black cloud has passed away but dave dont think that i believed that story i thought it was a fake from the start  and so did i said dunston porter there couldnt be any dave porter but you and he gave dave a goodnatured thump between the shoulders that nearly knocked the wind out of the youth  weve got more news declared mr wadsworth as he too came up for a handshake followed by bens father they have collared link merwell at last  is that so cried our hero  yes they caught him in a pawnbrokers shop said mr basswood and the best part of it is that they caught him trying to pawn my wifes silver spoons and lauras two rings the pawnbroker got suspicious and as he happened to be an honest man he called in a detective this detective remembered the picture he had seen printed of link at the time he and jasniff stole the jewelry and he at once placed link under arrest  and then i went to see link in prison broke in daves father i had a long talk with him about the burglary up here and he admitted that he had thrown all that other stuff in the hollow just to inconvenience you then i made him confess that he and ward porton had concocted this scheme concerning portons identity between them merwell tried to bribe me by saying he wouldnt tell the truth about porton unless i aided him to get clear of the charge made against him by mr wadsworth of course i wouldnt agree to do that  it wont be necessary to have link merwell testify against porton declared dave ive got a document here that shows up porton for just what he is and later on he allowed his father and the others to read the paper which he had had obadiah l l jones sign  oh to think im to have my rings back and mrs basswood is to have her silverware cried laura with satisfaction isnt it perfectly lovely  the days to follow at bear camp were happy ones indeed the boys went hunting and fishing to their hearts content and often took the girls out in the boats or in the canoes in the meanwhile some of the men folks returned to crumville and phil took his uncle home  it may be stated here that phils father and mother were filled with joy to have lester lawrence once more with them and later on the land that the rival railroads wanted was sold to one of the roads for an even sixty thousand dollars threequarters of which amount went to phils father and the other quarter to the boys uncle  i dont believe ward porton will ever bother you again dave said roger one day but the surmise of the senators son proved incorrect when ward porton learned that our hero had visited obadiah jones he lost no time in disappearing for awhile but then he got back to his old tricks and what he did will be related in another volume to be entitled dave porter and his double or the disappearance of the basswood fortune  when link merwell was brought to trial his father came forward and did everything he could for the wayward son but it was proved beyond a doubt that merwell had been as guilty as jasniff and he received an equal sentence of imprisonment  poor link i feel sorry for him was daves comment he might have made quite a man of himself  the weather was now growing colder every day and soon there was a trace of snow in the air  well have to leave bear camp very soon unless we want to be snowed in declared mrs wadsworth and then after a conference it was decided by all hands to pack up and go home  well in spite of our troubles its been a grand outing declared roger  one of the best ever added phil  ive had a perfectly lovely time came from jessie but i do hope dave never again runs into such trouble as he had up here  well a fellow has got to take things as they come answered our hero  and here with the future looking cloudless and bright we will leave dave porter and say goodbye   the end     dave porter series  by edward stratemeyer   mr stratemeyer has seldom
