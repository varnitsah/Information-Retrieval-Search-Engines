75282138	the papers and writings of abraham lincoln  volume four  constitutional edition  by abraham lincoln   edited by arthur brooks lapsley      the writings of abraham lincoln volume four     the lincolndouglas debates ii     lincoln and douglas fourth debate at charleston september 18 1858   ladies and gentlemenit will be very difficult for an audience so large as this to hear distinctly what a speaker says and consequently it is important that as profound silence be preserved as possible  while i was at the hotel today an elderly gentleman called upon me to know whether i was really in favor of producing a perfect equality between the negroes and white people while i had not proposed to myself on this occasion to say much on that subject yet as the question was asked me i thought i would occupy perhaps five minutes in saying something in regard to it i will say then that i am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races that i am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intermarry with white people and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which i believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality and in as much as they cannot so live while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior and i as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race i say upon this occasion i do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything i do not understand that because i do not want a negro woman for a slave i must necessarily want her for a wife my understanding is that i can just let her alone i am now in my fiftieth year and i certainly never have had a black woman for either a slave or a wife so it seems to me quite possible for us to get along without making either slaves or wives of negroes i will add to this that i have never seen to my knowledge a man woman or child who was in favor of producing a perfect equality social and political between negroes and white men i recollect of but one distinguished instance that i ever heard of so frequently as to be entirely satisfied of its correctness and that is the case of judge douglass old friend colonel richard m johnson i will also add to the remarks i have made for i am not going to enter at large upon this subject that i have never had the least apprehension that i or my friends would marry negroes if there was no law to keep them from it but as judge douglas and his friends seem to be in great apprehension that they might if there were no law to keep them from it i give him the most solemn pledge that i will to the very last stand by the law of this state which forbids the marrying of white people with negroes i will add one further word which is this that i do not understand that there is any place where an alteration of the social and political relations of the negro and the white man can be made except in the state legislaturenot in the congress of the united states and as i do not really apprehend the approach of any such thing myself and as judge douglas seems to be in constant horror that some such danger is rapidly approaching i propose as the best means to prevent it that the judge be kept at home and placed in the state legislature to fight the measure i do not propose dwelling longer at this time on this subject  when judge trumbull our other senator in congress returned to illinois in the month of august he made a speech at chicago in which he made what may be called a charge against judge douglas which i understand proved to be very offensive to him the judge was at that time out upon one of his speaking tours through the country and when the news of it reached him as i am informed he denounced judge trumbull in rather harsh terms for having said what he did in regard to that matter i was traveling at that time and speaking at the same places with judge douglas on subsequent days and when i heard of what judge trumbull had said of douglas and what douglas had said back again i felt that i was in a position where i could not remain entirely silent in regard to the matter consequently upon two or three occasions i alluded to it and alluded to it in no other wise than to say that in regard to the charge brought by trumbull against douglas i personally knew nothing and sought to say nothing about it that i did personally know judge trumbull that i believed him to be a man of veracity that i believed him to be a man of capacity sufficient to know very well whether an assertion he was making as a conclusion drawn from a set of facts was true or false and as a conclusion of my own from that i stated it as my belief if trumbull should ever be called upon he would prove everything he had said i said this upon two or three occasions upon a subsequent occasion judge trumbull spoke again before an audience at alton and upon that occasion not only repeated his charge against douglas but arrayed the evidence he relied upon to substantiate it this speech was published at length and subsequently at jacksonville judge douglas alluded to the matter in the course of his speech and near the close of it he stated in regard to myself what i will now read  judge douglas proceeded to remark that he should not hereafter occupy his time in refuting such charges made by trumbull but that lincoln having indorsed the character of trumbull for veracity he should hold him lincoln responsible for the slanders  i have done simply what i have told you to subject me to this invitation to notice the charge i now wish to say that it had not originally been my purpose to discuss that matter at all but inasmuch as it seems to be the wish of judge douglas to hold me responsible for it then for once in my life i will play general jackson and to the just extent i take the responsibility  i wish to say at the beginning that i will hand to the reporters that portion of judge trumbulls alton speech which was devoted to this matter and also that portion of judge douglass speech made at jacksonville in answer to it i shall thereby furnish the readers of this debate with the complete discussion between trumbull and douglas i cannot now read them for the reason that it would take half of my first hour to do so i can only make some comments upon them trumbulls charge is in the following words  now the charge is that there was a plot entered into to have a constitution formed for kansas and put in force without giving the people an opportunity to vote upon it and that mr douglas was in the plot  i will state without quoting further for all will have an opportunity of reading it hereafter that judge trumbull brings forward what he regards as sufficient evidence to substantiate this charge  it will be perceived judge trumbull shows that senator bigler upon the floor of the senate had declared there had been a conference among the senators in which conference it was determined to have an enabling act passed for the people of kansas to form a constitution under and in this conference it was agreed among them that it was best not to have a provision for submitting the constitution to a vote of the people after it should be formed he then brings forward to show and showing as he deemed that judge douglas reported the bill back to the senate with that clause stricken out he then shows that there was a new clause inserted into the bill which would in its nature prevent a reference of the constitution back for a vote of the peopleif indeed upon a mere silence in the law it could be assumed that they had the right to vote upon it these are the general statements that he has made  i propose to examine the points in judge douglass speech in which he attempts to answer that speech of judge trumbulls when you come to examine judge douglass speech you will find that the first point he makes is  suppose it were true that there was such a change in the bill and that i struck it outis that a proof of a plot to force a constitution upon them against their will  his striking out such a provision if there was such a one in the bill he argues does not establish the proof that it was stricken out for the purpose of robbing the people of that right i would say in the first place that that would be a most manifest reason for it it is true as judge douglas states that many territorial bills have passed without having such a provision in them i believe it is true though i am not certain that in some instances constitutions framed under such bills have been submitted to a vote of the people with the law silent upon the subject but it does not appear that they once had their enabling acts framed with an express provision for submitting the constitution to be framed to a vote of the people then that they were stricken out when congress did not mean to alter the effect of the law that there have been bills which never had the provision in i do not question but when was that provision taken out of one that it was in more especially does the evidence tend to prove the proposition that trumbull advanced when we remember that the provision was stricken out of the bill almost simultaneously with the time that bigler says there was a conference among certain senators and in which it was agreed that a bill should be passed leaving that out judge douglas in answering trumbull omits to attend to the testimony of bigler that there was a meeting in which it was agreed they should so frame the bill that there should be no submission of the constitution to a vote of the people the judge does not notice this part of it if you take this as one piece of evidence and then ascertain that simultaneously judge douglas struck out a provision that did require it to be submitted and put the two together i think it will make a pretty fair show of proof that judge douglas did as trumbull says enter into a plot to put in force a constitution for kansas without giving the people any opportunity of voting upon it  but i must hurry on the next proposition that judge douglas puts is this  but upon examination it turns out that the toombs bill never did contain a clause requiring the constitution to be submitted  this is a mere question of fact and can be determined by evidence i only want to ask this question why did not judge douglas say that these words were not stricken out of the toombs bill or this bill from which it is alleged the provision was stricken outa bill which goes by the name of toombs because he originally brought it forward i ask why if the judge wanted to make a direct issue with trumbull did he not take the exact proposition trumbull made in his speech and say it was not stricken out trumbull has given the exact words that he says were in the toombs bill and he alleges that when the bill came back they were stricken out judge douglas does not say that the words which trumbull says were stricken out were not so stricken out but he says there was no provision in the toombs bill to submit the constitution to a vote of the people we see at once that he is merely making an issue upon the meaning of the words he has not undertaken to say that trumbull tells a lie about these words being stricken out but he is really when pushed up to it only taking an issue upon the meaning of the words now then if there be any issue upon the meaning of the words or if there be upon the question of fact as to whether these words were stricken out i have before me what i suppose to be a genuine copy of the toombs bill in which it can be shown that the words trumbull says were in it were in fact originally there if there be any dispute upon the fact i have got the documents here to show they were there if there be any controversy upon the sense of the wordswhether these words which were stricken out really constituted a provision for submitting the matter to a vote of the peopleas that is a matter of argument i think i may as well use trumbulls own argument he says that the proposition is in these words  that the following propositions be and the same are hereby offered to the said convention of the people of kansas when formed for their free acceptance or rejection which if accepted by the convention and ratified by the people at the election for the adoption of the constitution shall be obligatory upon the united states and the said state of kansas  now trumbull alleges that these last words were stricken out of the bill when it came back and he says this was a provision for submitting the constitution to a vote of the people and his argument is this  would it have been possible to ratify the land propositions at the election for the adoption of the constitution unless such an election was to be held  this is trumbulls argument now judge douglas does not meet the charge at all but he stands up and says there was no such proposition in that bill for submitting the constitution to be framed to a vote of the people trumbull admits that the language is not a direct provision for submitting it but it is a provision necessarily implied from another provision he asks you how it is possible to ratify the land proposition at the election for the adoption of the constitution if there was no election to be held for the adoption of the constitution and he goes on to show that it is not any less a law because the provision is put in that indirect shape than it would be if it were put directly but i presume i have said enough to draw attention to this point and i pass it by also  another one of the points that judge douglas makes upon trumbull and at very great length is that trumbull while the bill was pending said in a speech in the senate that he supposed the constitution to be made would have to be submitted to the people he asks if trumbull thought so then what ground is there for anybody thinking otherwise now fellowcitizens this much may be said in reply that bill had been in the hands of a party to which trumbull did not belong it had been in the hands of the committee at the head of which judge douglas stood trumbull perhaps had a printed copy of the original toombs bill i have not the evidence on that point except a sort of inference i draw from the general course of business there what alterations or what provisions in the way of altering were going on in committee trumbull had no means of knowing until the altered bill was reported back soon afterwards when it was reported back there was a discussion over it and perhaps trumbull in reading it hastily in the altered form did not perceive all the bearings of the alterations he was hastily borne into the debate and it does not follow that because there was something in it trumbull did not perceive that something did not exist more than this is it true that what trumbull did can have any effect on what douglas did suppose trumbull had been in the plot with these other men would that let douglas out of it would it exonerate douglas that trumbull did nt then perceive he was in the plot he also asks the question why did nt trumbull propose to amend the bill if he thought it needed any amendment why i believe that everything judge trumbull had proposed particularly in connection with this question of kansas and nebraska since he had been on the floor of the senate had been promptly voted down by judge douglas and his friends he had no promise that an amendment offered by him to anything on this subject would receive the slightest consideration judge trumbull did bring to the notice of the senate at that time the fact that there was no provision for submitting the constitution about to be made for the people of kansas to a vote of the people i believe i may venture to say that judge douglas made some reply to this speech of judge trumbulls but he never noticed that part of it at all and so the thing passed by i think then the fact that judge trumbull offered no amendment does not throw much blame upon him and if it did it does not reach the question of fact as to what judge douglas was doing i repeat that if trumbull had himself been in the plot it would not at all relieve the others who were in it from blame if i should be indicted for murder and upon the trial it should be discovered that i had been implicated in that murder but that the prosecuting witness was guilty too that would not at all touch the question of my crime it would be no relief to my neck that they discovered this other man who charged the crime upon me to be guilty too  another one of the points judge douglas makes upon judge trumbull is that when he spoke in chicago he made his charge to rest upon the fact that the bill had the provision in it for submitting the constitution to a vote of the people when it went into his judge douglass hands that it was missing when he reported it to the senate and that in a public speech he had subsequently said the alterations in the bill were made while it was in committee and that they were made in consultation between him judge douglas and toombs and judge douglas goes on to comment upon the fact of trumbulls adducing in his alton speech the proposition that the bill not only came back with that proposition stricken out but with another clause and another provision in it saying that until the complete execution of this act there shall be no election in said territorywhich trumbull argued was not only taking the provision for submitting to a vote of the people out of the bill but was adding an affirmative one in that it prevented the people from exercising the right under a bill that was merely silent on the question now in regard to what he says that trumbull shifts the issue that he shifts his groundand i believe he uses the term that it being proven false he has changed ground i call upon all of you when you come to examine that portion of trumbulls speech for it will make a part of mine to examine whether trumbull has shifted his ground or not i say he did not shift his ground but that he brought forward his original charge and the evidence to sustain it yet more fully but precisely as he originally made it then in addition thereto he brought in a new piece of evidence he shifted no ground he brought no new piece of evidence inconsistent with his former testimony but he brought a new piece tending as he thought and as i think to prove his proposition to illustrate a man brings an accusation against another and on trial the man making the charge introduces a and b to prove the accusation at a second trial he introduces the same witnesses who tell the same story as before and a third witness who tells the same thing and in addition gives further testimony corroborative of the charge so with trumbull there was no shifting of ground nor inconsistency of testimony between the new piece of evidence and what he originally introduced  but judge douglas says that he himself moved to strike out that last provision of the bill and that on his motion it was stricken out and a substitute inserted that i presume is the truth i presume it is true that that last proposition was stricken out by judge douglas trumbull has not said it was not trumbull has himself said that it was so stricken out he says i am now speaking of the bill as judge douglas reported it back it was amended somewhat in the senate before it passed but i am speaking of it as he brought it back now when judge douglas parades the fact that the provision was stricken out of the bill when it came back he asserts nothing contrary to what trumbull alleges trumbull has only said that he originally put it in not that he did not strike it out trumbull says it was not in the bill when it went to the committee when it came back it was in and judge douglas said the alterations were made by him in consultation with toombs trumbull alleges therefore as his conclusion that judge douglas put it in then if douglas wants to contradict trumbull and call him a liar let him say he did not put it in and not that he did nt take it out again it is said that a bear is sometimes hard enough pushed to drop a cub and so i presume it was in this case i presume the truth is that douglas put it in and afterward took it out that i take it is the truth about it judge trumbull says one thing douglas says another thing and the two dont contradict one another at all the question is what did he put it in for in the first place what did he take the other provision out of the bill forthe provision which trumbull argued was necessary for submitting the constitution to a vote of the people what did he take that out for and having taken it out what did he put this in for i say that in the run of things it is not unlikely forces conspire to render it vastly expedient for judge douglas to take that latter clause out again the question that trumbull has made is that judge douglas put it in and he dont meet trumbull at all unless he denies that  in the clause of judge douglass speech upon this subject he uses this language toward judge trumbull he says  he forges his evidence from beginning to end and by falsifying the record he endeavors to bolster up his false charge  well that is a pretty serious statementtrumbull forges his evidence from beginning to end now upon my own authority i say that it is not true what is a forgery consider the evidence that trumbull has brought forward when you come to read the speech as you will be able to examine whether the evidence is a forgery from beginning to end he had the bill or document in his hand like that holding up a paper he says that is a copy of the toombs billthe amendment offered by toombs he says that is a copy of the bill as it was introduced and went into judge douglass hands now does judge douglas say that is a forgery that is one thing trumbull brought forward judge douglas says he forged it from beginning to end that is the beginning we will say does douglas say that is a forgery let him say it today and we will have a subsequent examination upon this subject trumbull then holds up another document like this and says that is an exact copy of the bill as it came back in the amended form out of judge douglass hands does judge douglas say that is a forgery does he say it in his general sweeping charge does he say so now if he does not then take this toombs bill and the bill in the amended form and it only needs to compare them to see that the provision is in the one and not in the other it leaves the inference inevitable that it was taken out  but while i am dealing with this question let us see what trumbulls other evidence is one other piece of evidence i will read trumbull says there are in this original toombs bill these words  that the following propositions be and the same are hereby offered to the said convention of the people of kansas when formed for their free acceptance or rejection which if accepted by the convention and ratified by the people at the election for the adoption of the constitution shall be obligatory upon the united states and the said state of kansas  now if it is said that this is a forgery we will open the paper here and see whether it is or not again trumbull says as he goes along that mr bigler made the following statement in his place in the senate december 9 1857  i was present when that subject was discussed by senators before the bill was introduced and the question was raised and discussed whether the constitution when formed should be submitted to a vote of the people it was held by those most intelligent on the subject that in view of all the difficulties surrounding that territory the danger of any experiment at that time of a popular vote it would be better there should be no such provision in the toombs bill and it was my understanding in all the intercourse i had that the convention would make a constitution and send it here without submitting it to the popular vote  then trumbull follows on  in speaking of this meeting again on the 21st december 1857 congressional globe same vol page 113 senator bigler said  nothing was further from my mind than to allude to any social or confidential interview the meeting was not of that character indeed it was semiofficial and called to promote the public good my recollection was clear that i left the conference under the impression that it had been deemed best to adopt measures to admit kansas as a state through the agency of one popular election and that for delegates to this convention this impression was stronger because i thought the spirit of the bill infringed upon the doctrine of nonintervention to which i had great aversion but with the hope of accomplishing a great good and as no movement had been made in that direction in the territory i waived this objection and concluded to support the measure i have a few items of testimony as to the correctness of these impressions and with their submission i shall be content i have before me the bill reported by the senator from illinois on the 7th of march 1856 providing for the admission of kansas as a state the third section of which reads as follows  that the following propositions be and the same are hereby offered to the said convention of the people of kansas when formed for their free acceptance or rejection which if accepted by the convention and ratified by the people at the election for the adoption of the constitution shall be obligatory upon the united states and the said state of kansas  the bill read in his place by the senator from georgia on the 25th of june and referred to the committee on territories contained the same section word for word both these bills were under consideration at the conference referred to but sir when the senator from illinois reported the toombs bill to the senate with amendments the next morning it did not contain that portion of the third section which indicated to the convention that the constitution should be approved by the people the words and ratified by the people at the election for the adoption of the constitution had been stricken out  now these things trumbull says were stated by bigler upon the floor of the senate on certain days and that they are recorded in the congressional globe on certain pages does judge douglas say this is a forgery does he say there is no such thing in the congressional globe what does he mean when he says judge trumbull forges his evidence from beginning to end so again he says in another place that judge douglas in his speech december 9 1857 congressional globe part i page 15 stated  that during the last session of congress i mr douglas reported a bill from the committee on territories to authorize the people of kansas to assemble and form a constitution for themselves subsequently the senator from georgia mr toombs brought forward a substitute for my bill which after having been modified by him and myself in consultation was passed by the senate  now trumbull says this is a quotation from a speech of douglas and is recorded in the congressional globe is it a forgery is it there or not it may not be there but i want the judge to take these pieces of evidence and distinctly say they are forgeries if he dare do it  a voice he will  well sir you had better not commit him he gives other quotationsanother from judge douglas he says  i will ask the senator to show me an intimation from any one member of the senate in the whole debate on the toombs bill and in the union from any quarter that the constitution was not to be submitted to the people i will venture to say that on all sides of the chamber it was so understood at the time if the opponents of the bill had understood it was not they would have made the point on it and if they had made it we should certainly have yielded to it and put in the clause that is a discovery made since the president found out that it was not safe to take it for granted that that would be done which ought in fairness to have been done  judge trumbull says douglas made that speech and it is recorded does judge douglas say it is a forgery and was not true trumbull says somewhere and i propose to skip it but it will be found by any one who will read this debate that he did distinctly bring it to the notice of those who were engineering the bill that it lacked that provision and then he goes on to give another quotation from judge douglas where judge trumbull uses this language  judge douglas however on the same day and in the same debate probably recollecting or being reminded of the fact that i had objected to the toombs bill when pending that it did not provide for a submission of the constitution to the people made another statement which is to be found in the same volume of the globe page 22 in which he says that the bill was silent on this subject was true and my attention was called to that about the time it was passed and i took the fair construction to be that powers not delegated were reserved and that of course the constitution would be submitted to the people  whether this statement is consistent with the statement just before made that had the point been made it would have been yielded to or that it was a new discovery you will determine  so i say i do not know whether judge douglas will dispute this and yet maintain his position that trumbulls evidence was forged from beginning to end i will remark that i have not got these congressional globes with me they are large books and difficult to carry about and if judge douglas shall say that on these points where trumbull has quoted from them there are no such passages there i shall not be able to prove they are there upon this occasion but i will have another chance whenever he points out the forgery and says i declare that this particular thing which trumbull has uttered is not to be found where he says it is then my attention will be drawn to that and i will arm myself for the contest stating now that i have not the slightest doubt on earth that i will find every quotation just where trumbull says it is then the question is how can douglas call that a forgery how can he make out that it is a forgery what is a forgery it is the bringing forward something in writing or in print purporting to be of certain effect when it is altogether untrue if you come forward with my note for one hundred dollars when i have never given such a note there is a forgery if you come forward with a letter purporting to be written by me which i never wrote there is another forgery if you produce anything in writing or in print saying it is so and so the document not being genuine a forgery has been committed how do you make this forgery when every piece of the evidence is genuine if judge douglas does say these documents and quotations are false and forged he has a full right to do so but until he does it specifically we dont know how to get at him if he does say they are false and forged i will then look further into it and presume i can procure the certificates of the proper officers that they are genuine copies i have no doubt each of these extracts will be found exactly where trumbull says it is then i leave it to you if judge douglas in making his sweeping charge that judge trumbulls evidence is forged from beginning to end at all meets the caseif that is the way to get at the facts i repeat again if he will point out which one is a forgery i will carefully examine it and if it proves that any one of them is really a forgery it will not be me who will hold to it any longer i have always wanted to deal with everyone i meet candidly and honestly if i have made any assertion not warranted by facts and it is pointed out to me i will withdraw it cheerfully but i do not choose to see judge trumbull calumniated and the evidence he has brought forward branded in general terms a forgery from beginning to end this is not the legal way of meeting a charge and i submit it to all intelligent persons both friends of judge douglas and of myself whether it is  the point upon judge douglas is this the bill that went into his hands had the provision in it for a submission of the constitution to the people and i say its language amounts to an express provision for a submission and that he took the provision out he says it was known that the bill was silent in this particular but i say judge douglas it was not silent when you got it it was vocal with the declaration when you got it for a submission of the constitution to the people and now my direct question to judge douglas is to answer why if he deemed the bill silent on this point he found it necessary to strike out those particular harmless words if he had found the bill silent and without this provision he might say what he does now if he supposes it was implied that the constitution would be submitted to a vote of the people how could these two lines so encumber the statute as to make it necessary to strike them out how could he infer that a submission was still implied after its express provision had been stricken from the bill i find the bill vocal with the provision while he silenced it he took it out and although he took out the other provision preventing a submission to a vote of the people i ask why did you first put it in i ask him whether he took the original provision out which trumbull alleges was in the bill if he admits that he did take it i ask him what he did it for it looks to us as if he had altered the bill if it looks differently to himif he has a different reason for his action from the one we assign himhe can tell it i insist upon knowing why he made the bill silent upon that point when it was vocal before he put his hands upon it  i was told before my last paragraph that my time was within three minutes of being out i presume it is expired now i therefore close     mr lincolns rejoinder  fellowcitizens it follows as a matter of course that a halfhour answer to a speech of an hour and a half can be but a very hurried one i shall only be able to touch upon a few of the points suggested by judge douglas and give them a brief attention while i shall have to totally omit others for the want of time  judge douglas has said to you that he has not been able to get from me an answer to the question whether i am in favor of negro citizenship so far as i know the judge never asked me the question before he shall have no occasion to ever ask it again for i tell him very frankly that i am not in favor of negro citizenship this furnishes me an occasion for saying a few words upon the subject i mentioned in a certain speech of mine which has been printed that the supreme court had decided that a negro could not possibly be made a citizen and without saying what was my ground of complaint in regard to that or whether i had any ground of complaint judge douglas has from that thing manufactured nearly everything that he ever says about my disposition to produce an equality between the negroes and the white people if any one will read my speech he will find i mentioned that as one of the points decided in the course of the supreme court opinions but i did not state what objection i had to it but judge douglas tells the people what my objection was when i did not tell them myself now my opinion is that the different states have the power to make a negro a citizen under the constitution of the united states if they choose the dred scott decision decides that they have not that power if the state of illinois had that power i should be opposed to the exercise of it that is all i have to say about it  judge douglas has told me that he heard my speeches north and my speeches south that he had heard me at ottawa and at freeport in the north and recently at jonesboro in the south and there was a very different cast of sentiment in the speeches made at the different points i will not charge upon judge douglas that he wilfully misrepresents me but i call upon every fairminded man to take these speeches and read them and i dare him to point out any difference between my speeches north and south while i am here perhaps i ought to say a word if i have the time in regard to the latter portion of the judges speech which was a sort of declamation in reference to my having said i entertained the belief that this government would not endure half slave and half free i have said so and i did not say it without what seemed to me to be good reasons it perhaps would require more time than i have now to set forth these reasons in detail but let me ask you a few questions have we ever had any peace on this slavery question when are we to have peace upon it if it is kept in the position it now occupies how are we ever to have peace upon it that is an important question to be sure if we will all stop and allow judge douglas and his friends to march on in their present career until they plant the institution all over the nation here and wherever else our flag waves and we acquiesce in it there will be peace but let me ask judge douglas how he is going to get the people to do that they have been wrangling over this question for at least forty years this was the cause of the agitation resulting in the missouri compromise this produced the troubles at the annexation of texas in the acquisition of the territory acquired in the mexican war again this was the trouble which was quieted by the compromise of 1850 when it was settled forever as both the great political parties declared in their national conventions that forever turned out to be just four years when judge douglas himself reopened it when is it likely to come to an end he introduced the nebraska bill in 1854 to put another end to the slavery agitation he promised that it would finish it all up immediately and he has never made a speech since until he got into a quarrel with the president about the lecompton constitution in which he has not declared that we are just at the end of the slavery agitation but in one speech i think last winter he did say that he did nt quite see when the end of the slavery agitation would come now he tells us again that it is all over and the people of kansas have voted down the lecompton constitution how is it over that was only one of the attempts at putting an end to the slavery agitationone of these final settlements is kansas in the union has she formed a constitution that she is likely to come in under is not the slavery agitation still an open question in that territory has the voting down of that constitution put an end to all the trouble is that more likely to settle it than every one of these previous attempts to settle the slavery agitation now at this day in the history of the world we can no more foretell where the end of this slavery agitation will be than we can see the end of the world itself the nebraskakansas bill was introduced four years and a half ago and if the agitation is ever to come to an end we may say we are four years and a half nearer the end so too we can say we are four years and a half nearer the end of the world and we can just as clearly see the end of the world as we can see the end of this agitation the kansas settlement did not conclude it if kansas should sink today and leave a great vacant space in the earths surface this vexed question would still be among us i say then there is no way of putting an end to the slavery agitation amongst us but to put it back upon the basis where our fathers placed it no way but to keep it out of our new territoriesto restrict it forever to the old states where it now exists then the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction that is one way of putting an end to the slavery agitation  the other way is for us to surrender and let judge douglas and his friends have their way and plant slavery over all the states cease speaking of it as in any way a wrong regard slavery as one of the common matters of property and speak of negroes as we do of our horses and cattle but while it drives on in its state of progress as it is now driving and as it has driven for the last five years i have ventured the opinion and i say today that we will have no end to the slavery agitation until it takes one turn or the other i do not mean that when it takes a turn toward ultimate extinction it will be in a day nor in a year nor in two years i do not suppose that in the most peaceful way ultimate extinction would occur in less than a hundred years at least but that it will occur in the best way for both races in gods own good time i have no doubt but my friends i have used up more of my time than i intended on this point  now in regard to this matter about trumbull and myself having made a bargain to sell out the entire whig and democratic parties in 1854 judge douglas brings forward no evidence to sustain his charge except the speech matheny is said to have made in 1856 in which he told a cockandbull story of that sort upon the same moral principles that judge douglas tells it here today this is the simple truth i do not care greatly for the story but this is the truth of it and i have twice told judge douglas to his face that from beginning to end there is not one word of truth in it i have called upon him for the proof and he does not at all meet me as trumbull met him upon that of which we were just talking by producing the record he did nt bring the record because there was no record for him to bring when he asks if i am ready to indorse trumbulls veracity after he has broken a bargain with me i reply that if trumbull had broken a bargain with me i would not be likely to indorse his veracity but i am ready to indorse his veracity because neither in that thing nor in any other in all the years that i have known lyman trumbull have i known him to fail of his word or tell a falsehood large or small it is for that reason that i indorse lyman trumbull  mr james brown douglas postmaster what does fords history say about him  some gentleman asks me what fords history says about him my own recollection is that ford speaks of trumbull in very disrespectful terms in several portions of his book and that he talks a great deal worse of judge douglas i refer you sir to the history for examination  judge douglas complains at considerable length about a disposition on the part of trumbull and myself to attack him personally i want to attend to that suggestion a moment i dont want to be unjustly accused of dealing illiberally or unfairly with an adversary either in court or in a political canvass or anywhere else i would despise myself if i supposed myself ready to deal less liberally with an adversary than i was willing to be treated myself judge douglas in a general way without putting it in a direct shape revives the old charge against me in reference to the mexican war he does not take the responsibility of putting it in a very definite form but makes a general reference to it that charge is more than ten years old he complains of trumbull and myself because he says we bring charges against him one or two years old he knows too that in regard to the mexican war story the more respectable papers of his own party throughout the state have been compelled to take it back and acknowledge that it was a lie  here mr lincoln turned to the crowd on the platform and selecting hon orlando b ficklin led him forward and said  i do not mean to do anything with mr ficklin except to present his face and tell you that he personally knows it to be a lie he was a member of congress at the only time i was in congress and ficklin knows that whenever there was an attempt to procure a vote of mine which would indorse the origin and justice of the war i refused to give such indorsement and voted against it but i never voted against the supplies for the army and he knows as well as judge douglas that whenever a dollar was asked by way of compensation or otherwise for the benefit of the soldiers i gave all the votes that ficklin or douglas did and perhaps more  mr ficklin my friends i wish to say this in reference to the matter mr lincoln and myself are just as good personal friends as judge douglas and myself in reference to this mexican war my recollection is that when ashmuns resolution amendment was offered by mr ashmun of massachusetts in which he declared that the mexican war was unnecessary and unconstitutionally commenced by the presidentmy recollection is that mr lincoln voted for that resolution  that is the truth now you all remember that was a resolution censuring the president for the manner in which the war was begun you know they have charged that i voted against the supplies by which i starved the soldiers who were out fighting the battles of their country i say that ficklin knows it is false when that charge was brought forward by the chicago times the springfield register douglass organ reminded the times that the charge really applied to john henry and i do know that john henry is now making speeches and fiercely battling for judge douglas if the judge now says that he offers this as a sort of setoff to what i said today in reference to trumbulls charge then i remind him that he made this charge before i said a word about trumbulls he brought this forward at ottawa the first time we met face to face and in the opening speech that judge douglas made he attacked me in regard to a matter ten years old is nt he a pretty man to be whining about people making charges against him only two years old  the judge thinks it is altogether wrong that i should have dwelt upon this charge of trumbulls at all i gave the apology for doing so in my opening speech perhaps it did nt fix your attention i said that when judge douglas was speaking at placewhere i spoke on the succeeding day he used very harsh language about this charge two or three times afterward i said i had confidence in judge trumbulls veracity and intelligence and my own opinion was from what i knew of the character of judge trumbull that he would vindicate his position and prove whatever he had stated to be true this i repeated two or three times and then i dropped it without saying anything more on the subject for weeksperhaps a month i passed it by without noticing it at all till i found at jacksonville judge douglas in the plenitude of his power is not willing to answer trumbull and let me alone but he comes out there and uses this language he should not hereafter occupy his time in refuting such charges made by trumbull but that lincoln having indorsed the character of trumbull for veracity he should hold him lincoln responsible for the slanders what was lincoln to do did he not do right when he had the fit opportunity of meeting judge douglas here to tell him he was ready for the responsibility i ask a candid audience whether in doing thus judge douglas was not the assailant rather than i here i meet him face to face and say i am ready to take the responsibility so far as it rests on me  having done so i ask the attention of this audience to the question whether i have succeeded in sustaining the charge and whether judge douglas has at all succeeded in rebutting it you all heard me call upon him to say which of these pieces of evidence was a forgery does he say that what i present here as a copy of the original toombs bill is a forgery does he say that what i present as a copy of the bill reported by himself is a forgery or what is presented as a transcript from the globe of the quotations from biglers speech is a forgery does he say the quotations from his own speech are forgeries does he say this transcript from trumbulls speech is a forgery  he didnt deny one of them  i would then like to know how it comes about that when each piece of a story is true the whole story turns out false i take it these people have some sense they see plainly that judge douglas is playing cuttlefish a small species of fish that has no mode of defending itself when pursued except by throwing out a black fluid which makes the water so dark the enemy cannot see it and thus it escapes aint the judge playing the cuttlefish  now i would ask very special attention to the consideration of judge douglass speech at jacksonville and when you shall read his speech of today i ask you to watch closely and see which of these pieces of testimony every one of which he says is a forgery he has shown to be such not one of them has he shown to be a forgery then i ask the original question if each of the pieces of testimony is true how is it possible that the whole is a falsehood  in regard to trumbulls charge that he douglas inserted a provision into the bill to prevent the constitution being submitted to the people what was his answer he comes here and reads from the congressional globe to show that on his motion that provision was struck out of the bill why trumbull has not said it was not stricken out but trumbull says he douglas put it in and it is no answer to the charge to say he afterwards took it out both are perhaps true it was in regard to that thing precisely that i told him he had dropped the cub trumbull shows you that by his introducing the bill it was his cub it is no answer to that assertion to call trumbull a liar merely because he did not specially say that douglas struck it out suppose that were the case does it answer trumbull i assert that you pointing to an individual are here today and you undertake to prove me a liar by showing that you were in mattoon yesterday i say that you took your hat off your head and you prove me a liar by putting it on your head that is the whole force of douglass argument  now i want to come back to my original question trumbull says that judge douglas had a bill with a provision in it for submitting a constitution to be made to a vote of the people of kansas does judge douglas deny that fact does he deny that the provision which trumbull reads was put in that bill then trumbull says he struck it out does he dare to deny that he does not and i have the right to repeat the questionwhy judge douglas took it out bigler has said there was a combination of certain senators among whom he did not include judge douglas by which it was agreed that the kansas bill should have a clause in it not to have the constitution formed under it submitted to a vote of the people he did not say that douglas was among them but we prove by another source that about the same time douglas comes into the senate with that provision stricken out of the bill although bigler cannot say they were all working in concert yet it looks very much as if the thing was agreed upon and done with a mutual understanding after the conference and while we do not know that it was absolutely so yet it looks so probable that we have a right to call upon the man who knows the true reason why it was done to tell what the true reason was when he will not tell what the true reason was he stands in the attitude of an accused thief who has stolen goods in his possession and when called to account refuses to tell where he got them not only is this the evidence but when he comes in with the bill having the provision stricken out he tells us in a speech not then but since that these alterations and modifications in the bill had been made by him in consultation with toombs the originator of the bill he tells us the same today he says there were certain modifications made in the bill in committee that he did not vote for i ask you to remember while certain amendments were made which he disapproved of but which a majority of the committee voted in he has himself told us that in this particular the alterations and modifications were made by him upon consultation with toombs we have his own word that these alterations were made by him and not by the committee now i ask what is the reason judge douglas is so chary about coming to the exact question what is the reason he will not tell you anything about how it was made by whom it was made or that he remembers it being made at all why does he stand playing upon the meaning of words and quibbling around the edges of the evidence if he can explain all this but leaves it unexplained i have the right to infer that judge douglas understood it was the purpose of his party in engineering that bill through to make a constitution and have kansas come into the union with that constitution without its being submitted to a vote of the people if he will explain his action on this question by giving a better reason for the facts that happened than he has done it will be satisfactory but until he does thatuntil he gives a better or more plausible reason than he has offered against the evidence in the casei suggest to him it will not avail him at all that he swells himself up takes on dignity and calls people liars why sir there is not a word in trumbulls speech that depends on trumbulls veracity at all he has only arrayed the evidence and told you what follows as a matter of reasoning there is not a statement in the whole speech that depends on trumbulls word if you have ever studied geometry you remember that by a course of reasoning euclid proves that all the angles in a triangle are equal to two right angles euclid has shown you how to work it out now if you undertake to disprove that proposition and to show that it is erroneous would you prove it to be false by calling euclid a liar they tell me that my time is out and therefore i close     fifth joint debate at galesburgh october 7 1858  mr lincolns reply  my fellowcitizens a very large portion of the speech which judge douglas has addressed to you has previously been delivered and put in print i do not mean that for a hit upon the judge at allif i had not been interrupted i was going to say that such an answer as i was able to make to a very large portion of it had already been more than once made and published there has been an opportunity afforded to the public to see our respective views upon the topics discussed in a large portion of the speech which he has just delivered i make these remarks for the purpose of excusing myself for not passing over the entire ground that the judge has traversed i however desire to take up some of the points that he has attended to and ask your attention to them and i shall follow him backwards upon some notes which i have taken reversing the order by beginning where he concluded  the judge has alluded to the declaration of independence and insisted that negroes are not included in that declaration and that it is a slander upon the framers of that instrument to suppose that negroes were meant therein and he asks you is it possible to believe that mr jefferson who penned the immortal paper could have supposed himself applying the language of that instrument to the negro race and yet held a portion of that race in slavery would he not at once have freed them i only have to remark upon this part of the judges speech and that too very briefly for i shall not detain myself or you upon that point for any great length of time that i believe the entire records of the world from the date of the declaration of independence up to within three years ago may be searched in vain for one single affirmation from one single man that the negro was not included in the declaration of independence i think i may defy judge douglas to show that he ever said so that washington ever said so that any president ever said so that any member of congress ever said so or that any living man upon the whole earth ever said so until the necessities of the present policy of the democratic party in regard to slavery had to invent that affirmation and i will remind judge douglas and this audience that while mr jefferson was the owner of slaves as undoubtedly he was in speaking upon this very subject he used the strong language that he trembled for his country when he remembered that god was just and i will offer the highest premium in my power to judge douglas if he will show that he in all his life ever uttered a sentiment at all akin to that of jefferson  the next thing to which i will ask your attention is the judges comments upon the fact as he assumes it to be that we cannot call our public meetings as republican meetings and he instances tazewell county as one of the places where the friends of lincoln have called a public meeting and have not dared to name it a republican meeting he instances monroe county as another where judge trumbull and jehu baker addressed the persons whom the judge assumes to be the friends of lincoln calling them the free democracy i have the honor to inform judge douglas that he spoke in that very county of tazewell last saturday and i was there on tuesday last and when he spoke there he spoke under a call not venturing to use the word democrat turning to judge douglas what think you of this  so again there is another thing to which i would ask the judges attention upon this subject in the contest of 1856 his party delighted to call themselves together as the national democracy but now if there should be a notice put up anywhere for a meeting of the national democracy judge douglas and his friends would not come they would not suppose themselves invited they would understand that it was a call for those hateful postmasters whom he talks about  now a few words in regard to these extracts from speeches of mine which judge douglas has read to you and which he supposes are in very great contrast to each other those speeches have been before the public for a considerable time and if they have any inconsistency in them if there is any conflict in them the public have been able to detect it when the judge says in speaking on this subject that i make speeches of one sort for the people of the northern end of the state and of a different sort for the southern people he assumes that i do not understand that my speeches will be put in print and read north and south i knew all the while that the speech that i made at chicago and the one i made at jonesboro and the one at charleston would all be put in print and all the reading and intelligent men in the community would see them and know all about my opinions and i have not supposed and do not now suppose that there is any conflict whatever between them but the judge will have it that if we do not confess that there is a sort of inequality between the white and black races which justifies us in making them slaves we must then insist that there is a degree of equality that requires us to make them our wives now i have all the while taken a broad distinction in regard to that matter and that is all there is in these different speeches which he arrays here and the entire reading of either of the speeches will show that that distinction was made perhaps by taking two parts of the same speech he could have got up as much of a conflict as the one he has found i have all the while maintained that in so far as it should be insisted that there was an equality between the white and black races that should produce a perfect social and political equality it was an impossibility this you have seen in my printed speeches and with it i have said that in their right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness as proclaimed in that old declaration the inferior races are our equals and these declarations i have constantly made in reference to the abstract moral question to contemplate and consider when we are legislating about any new country which is not already cursed with the actual presence of the evilslavery i have never manifested any impatience with the necessities that spring from the actual presence of black people amongst us and the actual existence of slavery amongst us where it does already exist but i have insisted that in legislating for new countries where it does not exist there is no just rule other than that of moral and abstract right with reference to those new countries those maxims as to the right of a people to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness were the just rules to be constantly referred to there is no misunderstanding this except by men interested to misunderstand it i take it that i have to address an intelligent and reading community who will peruse what i say weigh it and then judge whether i advanced improper or unsound views or whether i advanced hypocritical and deceptive and contrary views in different portions of the country i believe myself to be guilty of no such thing as the latter though of course i cannot claim that i am entirely free from all error in the opinions i advance  the judge has also detained us awhile in regard to the distinction between his party and our party his he assumes to be a national party ours a sectional one he does this in asking the question whether this country has any interest in the maintenance of the republican party he assumes that our party is altogether sectional that the party to which he adheres is national and the argument is that no party can be a rightful partyand be based upon rightful principlesunless it can announce its principles everywhere i presume that judge douglas could not go into russia and announce the doctrine of our national democracy he could not denounce the doctrine of kings and emperors and monarchies in russia and it may be true of this country that in some places we may not be able to proclaim a doctrine as clearly true as the truth of democracy because there is a section so directly opposed to it that they will not tolerate us in doing so is it the true test of the soundness of a doctrine that in some places people wont let you proclaim it is that the way to test the truth of any doctrine why i understood that at one time the people of chicago would not let judge douglas preach a certain favorite doctrine of his i commend to his consideration the question whether he takes that as a test of the unsoundness of what he wanted to preach  there is another thing to which i wish to ask attention for a little while on this occasion what has always been the evidence brought forward to prove that the republican party is a sectional party the main one was that in the southern portion of the union the people did not let the republicans proclaim their doctrines amongst them that has been the main evidence brought forwardthat they had no supporters or substantially none in the slave states the south have not taken hold of our principles as we announce them nor does judge douglas now grapple with those principles we have a republican state platform laid down in springfield in june last stating our position all the way through the questions before the country we are now far advanced in this canvass judge douglas and i have made perhaps forty speeches apiece and we have now for the fifth time met face to face in debate and up to this day i have not found either judge douglas or any friend of his taking hold of the republican platform or laying his finger upon anything in it that is wrong i ask you all to recollect that judge douglas turns away from the platform of principles to the fact that he can find people somewhere who will not allow us to announce those principles if he had great confidence that our principles were wrong he would take hold of them and demonstrate them to be wrong but he does not do so the only evidence he has of their being wrong is in the fact that there are people who wont allow us to preach them i ask again is that the way to test the soundness of a doctrine  i ask his attention also to the fact that by the rule of nationality he is himself fast becoming sectional i ask his attention to the fact that his speeches would not go as current now south of the ohio river as they have formerly gone there i ask his attention to the fact that he felicitates himself today that all the democrats of the free states are agreeing with him while he omits to tell us that the democrats of any slave state agree with him if he has not thought of this i commend to his consideration the evidence in his own declaration on this day of his becoming sectional too i see it rapidly approaching whatever may be the result of this ephemeral contest between judge douglas and myself i see the day rapidly approaching when his pill of sectionalism which he has been thrusting down the throats of republicans for years past will be crowded down his own throat  now in regard to what judge douglas said in the beginning of his speech about the compromise of 1850 containing the principles of the nebraska bill although i have often presented my views upon that subject yet as i have not done so in this canvass i will if you please detain you a little with them i have always maintained so far as i was able that there was nothing of the principle of the nebraska bill in the compromise of 1850 at allnothing whatever where can you find the principle of the nebraska bill in that compromise if anywhere in the two pieces of the compromise organizing the territories of new mexico and utah it was expressly provided in these two acts that when they came to be admitted into the union they should be admitted with or without slavery as they should choose by their own constitutions nothing was said in either of those acts as to what was to be done in relation to slavery during the territorial existence of those territories while henry clay constantly made the declaration judge douglas recognizing him as a leader that in his opinion the old mexican laws would control that question during the territorial existence and that these old mexican laws excluded slavery how can that be used as a principle for declaring that during the territorial existence as well as at the time of framing the constitution the people if you please might have slaves if they wanted them i am not discussing the question whether it is right or wrong but how are the new mexican and utah laws patterns for the nebraska bill i maintain that the organization of utah and new mexico did not establish a general principle at all it had no feature of establishing a general principle the acts to which i have referred were a part of a general system of compromises they did not lay down what was proposed as a regular policy for the territories only an agreement in this particular case to do in that way because other things were done that were to be a compensation for it they were allowed to come in in that shape because in another way it was paid for considering that as a part of that system of measures called the compromise of 1850 which finally included halfadozen acts it included the admission of california as a free state which was kept out of the union for half a year because it had formed a free constitution it included the settlement of the boundary of texas which had been undefined before which was in itself a slavery question for if you pushed the line farther west you made texas larger and made more slave territory while if you drew the line toward the east you narrowed the boundary and diminished the domain of slavery and by so much increased free territory it included the abolition of the slave trade in the district of columbia it included the passage of a new fugitive slave law all these things were put together and though passed in separate acts were nevertheless in legislation as the speeches at the time will show made to depend upon each other each got votes with the understanding that the other measures were to pass and by this system of compromise in that series of measures those two billsthe new mexico and utah billswere passed and i say for that reason they could not be taken as models framed upon their own intrinsic principle for all future territories and i have the evidence of this in the fact that judge douglas a year afterward or more than a year afterward perhaps when he first introduced bills for the purpose of framing new territories did not attempt to follow these bills of new mexico and utah and even when he introduced this nebraska bill i think you will discover that he did not exactly follow them but i do not wish to dwell at great length upon this branch of the discussion my own opinion is that a thorough investigation will show most plainly that the new mexico and utah bills were part of a system of compromise and not designed as patterns for future territorial legislation and that this nebraska bill did not follow them as a pattern at all  the judge tells in proceeding that he is opposed to making any odious distinctions between free and slave states i am altogether unaware that the republicans are in favor of making any odious distinctions between the free and slave states but there is still a difference i think between judge douglas and the republicans in this i suppose that the real difference between judge douglas and his friends and the republicans on the contrary is that the judge is not in favor of making any difference between slavery and liberty that he is in favor of eradicating of pressing out of view the questions of preference in this country for free or slave institutions and consequently every sentiment he utters discards the idea that there is any wrong in slavery everything that emanates from him or his coadjutors in their course of policy carefully excludes the thought that there is anything wrong in slavery all their arguments if you will consider them will be seen to exclude the thought that there is anything whatever wrong in slavery if you will take the judges speeches and select the short and pointed sentences expressed by himas his declaration that he dont care whether slavery is voted up or downyou will see at once that this is perfectly logical if you do not admit that slavery is wrong if you do admit that it is wrong judge douglas cannot logically say he dont care whether a wrong is voted up or voted down judge douglas declares that if any community wants slavery they have a right to have it he can say that logically if he says that there is no wrong in slavery but if you admit that there is a wrong in it he cannot logically say that anybody has a right to do wrong he insists that upon the score of equality the owners of slaves and owners of propertyof horses and every other sort of propertyshould be alike and hold them alike in a new territory that is perfectly logical if the two species of property are alike and are equally founded in right but if you admit that one of them is wrong you cannot institute any equality between right and wrong and from this difference of sentimentthe belief on the part of one that the institution is wrong and a policy springing from that belief which looks to the arrest of the enlargement of that wrong and this other sentiment that it is no wrong and a policy sprung from that sentiment which will tolerate no idea of preventing the wrong from growing larger and looks to there never being an end to it through all the existence of thingsarises the real difference between judge douglas and his friends on the one hand and the republicans on the other now i confess myself as belonging to that class in the country who contemplate slavery as a moral social and political evil having due regard for its actual existence amongst us and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way and to all the constitutional obligations which have been thrown about it but nevertheless desire a policy that looks to the prevention of it as a wrong and looks hopefully to the time when as a wrong it may come to an end  judge douglas has again for i believe the fifth time if not the seventh in my presence reiterated his charge of a conspiracy or combination between the national democrats and republicans what evidence judge douglas has upon this subject i know not inasmuch as he never favors us with any i have said upon a former occasion and i do not choose to suppress it now that i have no objection to the division in the judges party he got it up himself it was all his and their work he had i think a great deal more to do with the steps that led to the lecompton constitution than mr buchanan had though at last when they reached it they quarreled over it and their friends divided upon it i am very free to confess to judge douglas that i have no objection to the division but i defy the judge to show any evidence that i have in any way promoted that division unless he insists on being a witness himself in merely saying so i can give all fair friends of judge douglas here to understand exactly the view that republicans take in regard to that division dont you remember how two years ago the opponents of the democratic party were divided between fremont and fillmore i guess you do any democrat who remembers that division will remember also that he was at the time very glad of it and then he will be able to see all there is between the national democrats and the republicans what we now think of the two divisions of democrats you then thought of the fremont and fillmore divisions that is all there is of it  but if the judge continues to put forward the declaration that there is an unholy and unnatural alliance between the republicans and the national democrats i now want to enter my protest against receiving him as an entirely competent witness upon that subject i want to call to the judges attention an attack he made upon me in the first one of these debates at ottawa on the 21st of august in order to fix extreme abolitionism upon me judge douglas read a set of resolutions which he declared had been passed by a republican state convention in october 1854 at springfield illinois and he declared i had taken part in that convention it turned out that although a few men calling themselves an antinebraska state convention had sat at springfield about that time yet neither did i take any part in it nor did it pass the resolutions or any such resolutions as judge douglas read so apparent had it become that the resolutions which he read had not been passed at springfield at all nor by a state convention in which i had taken part that seven days afterward at freeport judge douglas declared that he had been misled by charles h lanphier editor of the state register and thomas l harris member of congress in that district and he promised in that speech that when he went to springfield he would investigate the matter since then judge douglas has been to springfield and i presume has made the investigation but a month has passed since he has been there and so far as i know he has made no report of the result of his investigation i have waited as i think sufficient time for the report of that investigation and i have some curiosity to see and hear it a fraud an absolute forgery was committed and the perpetration of it was traced to the threelanphier harris and douglas whether it can be narrowed in any way so as to exonerate any one of them is what judge douglass report would probably show  it is true that the set of resolutions read by judge douglas were published in the illinois state register on the 16th of october 1854 as being the resolutions of an antinebraska convention which had sat in that same month of october at springfield but it is also true that the publication in the register was a forgery then and the question is still behind which of the three if not all of them committed that forgery the idea that it was done by mistake is absurd the article in the illinois state register contains part of the real proceedings of that springfield convention showing that the writer of the article had the real proceedings before him and purposely threw out the genuine resolutions passed by the convention and fraudulently substituted the others lanphier then as now was the editor of the register so that there seems to be but little room for his escape but then it is to be borne in mind that lanphier had less interest in the object of that forgery than either of the other two the main object of that forgery at that time was to beat yates and elect harris to congress and that object was known to be exceedingly dear to judge douglas at that time harris and douglas were both in springfield when the convention was in session and although they both left before the fraud appeared in the register subsequent events show that they have both had their eyes fixed upon that convention  the fraud having been apparently successful upon the occasion both harris and douglas have more than once since then been attempting to put it to new uses as the fishermans wife whose drowned husband was brought home with his body full of eels said when she was asked what was to be done with him take the eels out and set him again so harris and douglas have shown a disposition to take the eels out of that stale fraud by which they gained harriss election and set the fraud again more than once on the 9th of july 1856 douglas attempted a repetition of it upon trumbull on the floor of the senate of the united states as will appear from the appendix of the congressional globe of that date  on the 9th of august harris attempted it again upon norton in the house of representatives as will appear by the same documentsthe appendix to the congressional globe of that date on the 21st of august last all threelanphier douglas and harrisreattempted it upon me at ottawa it has been clung to and played out again and again as an exceedingly high trump by this blessed trio and now that it has been discovered publicly to be a fraud we find that judge douglas manifests no surprise at it at all he makes no complaint of lanphier who must have known it to be a fraud from the beginning he lanphier and harris are just as cozy now and just as active in the concoction of new schemes as they were before the general discovery of this fraud now all this is very natural if they are all alike guilty in that fraud and it is very unnatural if any one of them is innocent lanphier perhaps insists that the rule of honor among thieves does not quite require him to take all upon himself and consequently my friend judge douglas finds it difficult to make a satisfactory report upon his investigation but meanwhile the three are agreed that each is a most honorable man  judge douglas requires an indorsement of his truth and honor by a reelection to the united states senate and he makes and reports against me and against judge trumbull day after day charges which we know to be utterly untrue without for a moment seeming to think that this one unexplained fraud which he promised to investigate will be the least drawback to his claim to belief harris ditto he asks a reelection to the lower house of congress without seeming to remember at all that he is involved in this dishonorable fraud the illinois state register edited by lanphier then as now the central organ of both harris and douglas continues to din the public ear with this assertion without seeming to suspect that these assertions are at all lacking in title to belief  after all the question still recurs upon us how did that fraud originally get into the state register lanphier then as now was the editor of that paper lanphier knows lanphier cannot be ignorant of how and by whom it was originally concocted can he be induced to tell or if he has told can judge douglas be induced to tell how it originally was concocted it may be true that lanphier insists that the two men for whose benefit it was originally devised shall at least bear their share of it how that is i do not know and while it remains unexplained i hope to be pardoned if i insist that the mere fact of judge douglas making charges against trumbull and myself is not quite sufficient evidence to establish them  while we were at freeport in one of these joint discussions i answered certain interrogatories which judge douglas had propounded to me and then in turn propounded some to him which he in a sort of way answered the third one of these interrogatories i have with me and wish now to make some comments upon it it was in these words if the supreme court of  states cannot exclude slavery from their limits are you in favor of acquiescing in adhering to and following such decision as a rule of political action  to this interrogatory judge douglas made no answer in any just sense of the word he contented himself with sneering at the thought that it was possible for the supreme court ever to make such a decision he sneered at me for propounding the interrogatory i had not propounded it without some reflection and i wish now to address to this audience some remarks upon it  in the second clause of the sixth article i believe it is of the constitution of the united states we find the following language  this constitution and the laws of the united states which shall be made in pursuance thereof and all treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding  the essence of the dred scott case is compressed into the sentence which i will now read  now as we have already said in an earlier part of this opinion upon a different point the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution  i repeat it the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution what is it to be affirmed in the constitution made firm in the constitution so made that it cannot be separated from the constitution without breaking the constitution durable as the constitution and part of the constitution now remembering the provision of the constitution which i have readaffirming that that instrument is the supreme law of the land that the judges of every state shall be bound by it any law or constitution of any state to the contrary notwithstanding that the right of property in a slave is affirmed in that constitution is made formed into and cannot be separated from it without breaking it durable as the instrument part of the instrumentwhat follows as a short and even syllogistic argument from it i think it follows and i submit to the consideration of men capable of arguing whether as i state it in syllogistic form the argument has any fault in it  nothing in the constitution or laws of any state can destroy a right distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution of the united states  the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution of the united states  therefore nothing in the constitution or laws of any state can destroy the right of property in a slave  i believe that no fault can be pointed out in that argument assuming the truth of the premises the conclusion so far as i have capacity at all to understand it follows inevitably there is a fault in it as i think but the fault is not in the reasoning but the falsehood in fact is a fault of the premises i believe that the right of property in a slave is not distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution and judge douglas thinks it is i believe that the supreme court and the advocates of that decision may search in vain for the place in the constitution where the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed i say therefore that i think one of the premises is not true in fact but it is true with judge douglas it is true with the supreme court who pronounced it they are estopped from denying it and being estopped from denying it the conclusion follows that the constitution of the united states being the supreme law no constitution or law can interfere with it it being affirmed in the decision that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution the conclusion inevitably follows that no state law or constitution can destroy that right i then say to judge douglas and to all others that i think it will take a better answer than a sneer to show that those who have said that the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the constitution are not prepared to show that no constitution or law can destroy that right i say i believe it will take a far better argument than a mere sneer to show to the minds of intelligent men that whoever has so said is not prepared whenever public sentiment is so far advanced as to justify it to say the other this is but an opinion and the opinion of one very humble man but it is my opinion that the dred scott decision as it is never would have been made in its present form if the party that made it had not been sustained previously by the elections my own opinion is that the new dred scott decision deciding against the right of the people of the states to exclude slavery will never be made if that party is not sustained by the elections i believe further that it is just as sure to be made as tomorrow is to come if that party shall be sustained i have said upon a former occasion and i repeat it now that the course of arguement that judge douglas makes use of upon this subject i charge not his motives in this is preparing the public mind for that new dred scott decision i have asked him again to point out to me the reasons for his first adherence to the dred scott decision as it is i have turned his attention to the fact that general jackson differed with him in regard to the political obligation of a supreme court decision i have asked his attention to the fact that jefferson differed with him in regard to the political obligation of a supreme court decision jefferson said that judges are as honest as other men and not more so and he said substantially that whenever a free people should give up in absolute submission to any department of government retaining for themselves no appeal from it their liberties were gone i have asked his attention to the fact that the cincinnati platform upon which he says he stands disregards a timehonored decision of the supreme court in denying the power of congress to establish a national bank i have asked his attention to the fact that he himself was one of the most active instruments at one time in breaking down the supreme court of the state of illinois because it had made a decision distasteful to hima struggle ending in the remarkable circumstance of his sitting down as one of the new judges who were to overslaugh that decision getting his title of judge in that very way  so far in this controversy i can get no answer at all from judge douglas upon these subjects not one can i get from him except that he swells himself up and says all of us who stand by the decision of the supreme court are the friends of the constitution all you fellows that dare question it in any way are the enemies of the constitution now in this very devoted adherence to this decision in opposition to all the great political leaders whom he has recognized as leaders in opposition to his former self and history there is something very marked and the manner in which he adheres to itnot as being right upon the merits as he conceives because he did not discuss that at all but as being absolutely obligatory upon every one simply because of the source from whence it comes as that which no man can gainsay whatever it may bethis is another marked feature of his adherence to that decision it marks it in this respect that it commits him to the next decision whenever it comes as being as obligatory as this one since he does not investigate it and wont inquire whether this opinion is right or wrong so he takes the next one without inquiring whether it is right or wrong he teaches men this doctrine and in so doing prepares the public mind to take the next decision when it comes without any inquiry in this i think i argue fairly without questioning motives at all that judge douglas is most ingeniously and powerfully preparing the public mind to take that decision when it comes and not only so but he is doing it in various other ways in these general maxims about liberty in his assertions that he dont care whether slavery is voted up or voted down that whoever wants slavery has a right to have it that upon principles of equality it should be allowed to go everywhere that there is no inconsistency between free and slave institutionsin this he is also preparing whether purposely or not the way for making the institution of slavery national i repeat again for i wish no misunderstanding that i do not charge that he means it so but i call upon your minds to inquire if you were going to get the best instrument you could and then set it to work in the most ingenious way to prepare the public mind for this movement operating in the free states where there is now an abhorrence of the institution of slavery could you find an instrument so capable of doing it as judge douglas or one employed in so apt a way to do it  i have said once before and i will repeat it now that mr clay when he was once answering an objection to the colonization society that it had a tendency to the ultimate emancipation of the slaves said that  those who would repress all tendencies to liberty and ultimate emancipation must do more than put down the benevolent efforts of the colonization society they must go back to the era of our liberty and independence and muzzle the cannon that thunders its annual joyous return they must blow out the moral lights around us they must penetrate the human soul and eradicate the light of reason and the love of liberty  and i do thinki repeat though i said it on a former occasionthat judge douglas and whoever like him teaches that the negro has no share humble though it may be in the declaration of independence is going back to the era of our liberty and independence and so far as in him lies muzzling the cannon that thunders its annual joyous return that he is blowing out the moral lights around us when he contends that whoever wants slaves has a right to hold them that he is penetrating so far as lies in his power the human soul and eradicating the light of reason and the love of liberty when he is in every possible way preparing the public mind by his vast influence for making the institution of slavery perpetual and national  there is my friends only one other point to which i will call your attention for the remaining time that i have left me and perhaps i shall not occupy the entire time that i have as that one point may not take me clear through it  among the interrogatories that judge douglas propounded to me at freeport there was one in about this language  are you opposed to the acquisition of any further territory to the united states unless slavery shall first be prohibited therein  i answered as i thought in this way that i am not generally opposed to the acquisition of additional territory and that i would support a proposition for the acquisition of additional territory according as my supporting it was or was not calculated to aggravate this slavery question amongst us i then proposed to judge douglas another interrogatory which was correlative to that are you in favor of acquiring additional territory in disregard of how it may affect us upon the slavery question judge douglas answeredthat is in his own way he answered it i believe that although he took a good many words to answer it it was a little more fully answered than any other the substance of his answer was that this country would continue to expand that it would need additional territory that it was as absurd to suppose that we could continue upon our present territory enlarging in population as we are as it would be to hoop a boy twelve years of age and expect him to grow to mans size without bursting the hoops i believe it was something like that consequently he was in favor of the acquisition of further territory as fast as we might need it in disregard of how it might affect the slavery question i do not say this as giving his exact language but he said so substantially and he would leave the question of slavery where the territory was acquired to be settled by the people of the acquired territory thats the doctrine may be it is let us consider that for a while this will probably in the run of things become one of the concrete manifestations of this slavery question if judge douglass policy upon this question succeeds and gets fairly settled down until all opposition is crushed out the next thing will be a grab for the territory of poor mexico an invasion of the rich lands of south america then the adjoining islands will follow each one of which promises additional slavefields and this question is to be left to the people of those countries for settlement when we get mexico i dont know whether the judge will be in favor of the mexican people that we get with it settling that question for themselves and all others because we know the judge has a great horror for mongrels and i understand that the people of mexico are most decidedly a race of mongrels i understand that there is not more than one person there out of eight who is pure white and i suppose from the judges previous declaration that when we get mexico or any considerable portion of it that he will be in favor of these mongrels settling the question which would bring him somewhat into collision with his horror of an inferior race  it is to be remembered though that this power of acquiring additional territory is a power confided to the president and the senate of the united states it is a power not under the control of the representatives of the people any further than they the president and the senate can be considered the representatives of the people let me illustrate that by a case we have in our history when we acquired the territory from mexico in the mexican war the house of representatives composed of the immediate representatives of the people all the time insisted that the territory thus to be acquired should be brought in upon condition that slavery should be forever prohibited therein upon the terms and in the language that slavery had been prohibited from coming into this country that was insisted upon constantly and never failed to call forth an assurance that any territory thus acquired should have that prohibition in it so far as the house of representatives was concerned but at last the president and senate acquired the territory without asking the house of representatives anything about it and took it without that prohibition they have the power of acquiring territory without the immediate representatives of the people being called upon to say anything about it and thus furnishing a very apt and powerful means of bringing new territory into the union and when it is once brought into the country involving us anew in this slavery agitation it is therefore as i think a very important question for due consideration of the american people whether the policy of bringing in additional territory without considering at all how it will operate upon the safety of the union in reference to this one great disturbing element in our national politics shall be adopted as the policy of the country you will bear in mind that it is to be acquired according to the judges view as fast as it is needed and the indefinite part of this proposition is that we have only judge douglas and his class of men to decide how fast it is needed we have no clear and certain way of determining or demonstrating how fast territory is needed by the necessities of the country whoever wants to go out filibustering then thinks that more territory is needed whoever wants wider slavefields feels sure that some additional territory is needed as slave territory then it is as easy to show the necessity of additional slaveterritory as it is to assert anything that is incapable of absolute demonstration whatever motive a man or a set of men may have for making annexation of property or territory it is very easy to assert but much less easy to disprove that it is necessary for the wants of the country  and now it only remains for me to say that i think it is a very grave question for the people of this union to consider whether in view of the fact that this slavery question has been the only one that has ever endangered our republican institutions the only one that has ever threatened or menaced a dissolution of the union that has ever disturbed us in such a way as to make us fear for the perpetuity of our libertyin view of these facts i think it is an exceedingly interesting and important question for this people to consider whether we shall engage in the policy of acquiring additional territory discarding altogether from our consideration while obtaining new territory the question how it may affect us in regard to this the only endangering element to our liberties and national greatness the judges view has been expressed i in my answer to his question have expressed mine i think it will become an important and practical question our views are before the public i am willing and anxious that they should consider them fully that they should turn it about and consider the importance of the question and arrive at a just conclusion as to whether it is or is not wise in the people of this union in the acquisition of new territory to consider whether it will add to the disturbance that is existing amongst uswhether it will add to the one only danger that has ever threatened the perpetuity of the union or our own liberties i think it is extremely important that they shall decide and rightly decide that question before entering upon that policy  and now my friends having said the little i wish to say upon this head whether i have occupied the whole of the remnant of my time or not i believe i could not enter upon any new topic so as to treat it fully without transcending my time which i would not for a moment think of doing i give way to judge douglas     sixth joint debate at quincy october 13 1858  ladies and gentlemen i have had no immediate conference with judge douglas but i will venture to say that he and i will perfectly agree that your entire silence both when i speak and when he speaks will be most agreeable to us  in the month of may 1856 the elements in the state of illinois which have since been consolidated into the republican party assembled together in a state convention at bloomington they adopted at that time what in political language is called a platform in june of the same year the elements of the republican party in the nation assembled together in a national convention at philadelphia they adopted what is called the national platform in june 1858the present yearthe republicans of illinois reassembled at springfield in state convention and adopted again their platform as i suppose not differing in any essential particular from either of the former ones but perhaps adding something in relation to the new developments of political progress in the country  the convention that assembled in june last did me the honor if it be one and i esteem it such to nominate me as their candidate for the united states senate i have supposed that in entering upon this canvass i stood generally upon these platforms we are now met together on the 13th of october of the same year only four months from the adoption of the last platform and i am unaware that in this canvass from the beginning until today any one of our adversaries has taken hold of our platforms or laid his finger upon anything that he calls wrong in them  in the very first one of these joint discussions between senator douglas and myself senator douglas without alluding at all to these platforms or any one of them of which i have spoken attempted to hold me responsible for a set of resolutions passed long before the meeting of either one of these conventions of which i have spoken and as a ground for holding me responsible for these resolutions he assumed that they had been passed at a state convention of the republican party and that i took part in that convention it was discovered afterward that this was erroneous that the resolutions which he endeavored to hold me responsible for had not been passed by any state convention anywhere had not been passed at springfield where he supposed they had or assumed that they had and that they had been passed in no convention in which i had taken part the judge nevertheless was not willing to give up the point that he was endeavoring to make upon me and he therefore thought to still hold me to the point that he was endeavoring to make by showing that the resolutions that he read had been passed at a local convention in the northern part of the state although it was not a local convention that embraced my residence at all nor one that reached as i suppose nearer than one hundred and fifty or two hundred miles of where i was when it met nor one in which i took any part at all he also introduced other resolutions passed at other meetings and by combining the whole although they were all antecedent to the two state conventions and the one national convention i have mentioned still he insisted and now insists as i understand that i am in some way responsible for them  at jonesboro on our third meeting i insisted to the judge that i was in no way rightfully held responsible for the proceedings of this local meeting or convention in which i had taken no part and in which i was in no way embraced but i insisted to him that if he thought i was responsible for every man or every set of men everywhere who happen to be my friends the rule ought to work both ways and he ought to be responsible for the acts and resolutions of all men or sets of men who were or are now his supporters and friends and gave him a pretty long string of resolutions passed by men who are now his friends and announcing doctrines for which he does not desire to be held responsible  this still does not satisfy judge douglas he still adheres to his proposition that i am responsible for what some of my friends in different parts of the state have done but that he is not responsible for what his have done at least so i understand him but in addition to that the judge at our meeting in galesburgh last week undertakes to establish that i am guilty of a species of double dealing with the public that i make speeches of a certain sort in the north among the abolitionists which i would not make in the south and that i make speeches of a certain sort in the south which i would not make in the north i apprehend in the course i have marked out for myself that i shall not have to dwell at very great length upon this subject  as this was done in the judges opening speech at galesburgh i had an opportunity as i had the middle speech then of saying something in answer to it he brought forward a quotation or two from a speech of mine delivered at chicago and then to contrast with it he brought forward an extract from a speech of mine at charleston in which he insisted that i was greatly inconsistent and insisted that his conclusion followed that i was playing a double part and speaking in one region one way and in another region another way i have not time now to dwell on this as long as i would like and wish only now to requote that portion of my speech at charleston which the judge quoted and then make some comments upon it this he quotes from me as being delivered at charleston and i believe correctly  i will say then that i am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races that i am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intermarry with white people and i will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality and inasmuch as they cannot so live while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior i am as much as any other man in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race  this i believe is the entire quotation from charleston speech as judge douglas made it his comments are as follows  yes here you find men who hurrah for lincoln and say he is right when he discards all distinction between races or when he declares that he discards the doctrine that there is such a thing as a superior and inferior race and abolitionists are required and expected to vote for mr lincoln because he goes for the equality of races holding that in the declaration of independence the white man and negro were declared equal and endowed by divine law with equality and down south with the oldline whigs with the kentuckians the virginians and the tennesseeans he tells you that there is a physical difference between the races making the one superior the other inferior and he is in favor of maintaining the superiority of the white race over the negro  those are the judges comments now i wish to show you that a month or only lacking three days of a month before i made the speech at charleston which the judge quotes from he had himself heard me say substantially the same thing it was in our first meeting at ottawaand i will say a word about where it was and the atmosphere it was in after a whilebut at our first meeting at ottawa i read an extract from an old speech of mine made nearly four years ago not merely to show my sentiments but to show that my sentiments were long entertained and openly expressed in which extract i expressly declared that my own feelings would not admit a social and political equality between the white and black races and that even if my own feelings would admit of it i still knew that the public sentiment of the country would not and that such a thing was an utter impossibility or substantially that that extract from my old speech the reporters by some sort of accident passed over and it was not reported i lay no blame upon anybody i suppose they thought that i would hand it over to them and dropped reporting while i was giving it but afterward went away without getting it from me at the end of that quotation from my old speech which i read at ottawa i made the comments which were reported at that time and which i will now read and ask you to notice how very nearly they are the same as judge douglas says were delivered by me down in egypt after reading i added these words  now gentlemen i dont want to read at any great length but this is the true complexion of all i have ever said in regard to the institution of slavery or the black race and this is the whole of it anything that argues me into his idea of perfect social and political equality with the negro is but a specious and fantastical arrangement of words by which a man can prove a horsechestnut to be a chestnut horse i will say here while upon this subject that i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution in the states where it exists i believe i have no right to do so i have no inclination to do so i have no purpose to introduce political and social equality between the white and black races there is a physical difference between the two which in my judgment will probably forever forbid their living together on the footing of perfect equality and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there must be a difference i as well as judge douglas am in favor of the race to which i belong having the superior position i have never said anything to the contrary but i hold that notwithstanding all this there is no reason in the world why the negro is not entitled to all the rights enumerated in the declaration of independencethe right of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness i hold that he is as much entitled to these as the white man i agree with judge douglas that he is not my equal in many respects certainly not in color perhaps not in intellectual and moral endowments but in the right to eat the bread without the leave of anybody else which his own hand earns he is my equal and the equal of judge douglas and the equal of every other man  i have chiefly introduced this for the purpose of meeting the judges charge that the quotation he took from my charleston speech was what i would say down south among the kentuckians the virginians etc but would not say in the regions in which was supposed to be more of the abolition element i now make this comment that speech from which i have now read the quotation and which is there given correctlyperhaps too much so for good tastewas made away up north in the abolition district of this state par excellence in the lovejoy district in the personal presence of lovejoy for he was on the stand with us when i made it it had been made and put in print in that region only three days less than a month before the speech made at charleston the like of which judge douglas thinks i would not make where there was any abolition element i only refer to this matter to say that i am altogether unconscious of having attempted any doubledealing anywhere that upon one occasion i may say one thing and leave other things unsaid and vice versa but that i have said anything on one occasion that is inconsistent with what i have said elsewhere i deny at least i deny it so far as the intention is concerned i find that i have devoted to this topic a larger portion of my time than i had intended i wished to show but i will pass it upon this occasion that in the sentiment i have occasionally advanced upon the declaration of independence i am entirely borne out by the sentiments advanced by our old whig leader henry clay and i have the book here to show it from but because i have already occupied more time than i intended to do on that topic i pass over it  at galesburgh i tried to show that by the dred scott decision pushed to its legitimate consequences slavery would be established in all the states as well as in the territories i did this because upon a former occasion i had asked judge douglas whether if the supreme court should make a decision declaring that the states had not the power to exclude slavery from their limits he would adopt and follow that decision as a rule of political action and because he had not directly answered that question but had merely contented himself with sneering at it i again introduced it and tried to show that the conclusion that i stated followed inevitably and logically from the proposition already decided by the court judge douglas had the privilege of replying to me at galesburgh and again he gave me no direct answer as to whether he would or would not sustain such a decision if made i give him his third chance to say yes or no he is not obliged to do either probably he will not do either but i give him the third chance i tried to show then that this result this conclusion inevitably followed from the point already decided by the court the judge in his reply again sneers at the thought of the court making any such decision and in the course of his remarks upon this subject uses the language which i will now read speaking of me the judge says  he goes on and insists that the dred scott decision would carry slavery into the free states notwithstanding the decision itself says the contrary and he adds  mr lincoln knows that there is no member of the supreme court that holds that doctrine he knows that every one of them in their opinions held the reverse  i especially introduce this subject again for the purpose of saying that i have the dred scott decision here and i will thank judge douglas to lay his finger upon the place in the entire opinions of the court where any one of them says the contrary it is very hard to affirm a negative with entire confidence i say however that i have examined that decision with a good deal of care as a lawyer examines a decision and so far as i have been able to do so the court has nowhere in its opinions said that the states have the power to exclude slavery nor have they used other language substantially that i also say so far as i can find not one of the concurring judges has said that the states can exclude slavery nor said anything that was substantially that the nearest approach that any one of them has made to it so far as i can find was by judge nelson and the approach he made to it was exactly in substance the nebraska billthat the states had the exclusive power over the question of slavery so far as they are not limited by the constitution of the united states i asked the question therefore if the nonconcurring judges mclean or curtis had asked to get an express declaration that the states could absolutely exclude slavery from their limits what reason have we to believe that it would not have been voted down by the majority of the judges just as chases amendment was voted down by judge douglas and his compeers when it was offered to the nebraska bill  also at galesburgh i said something in regard to those springfield resolutions that judge douglas had attempted to use upon me at ottawa and commented at some length upon the fact that they were as presented not genuine judge douglas in his reply to me seemed to be somewhat exasperated he said he would never have believed that abraham lincoln as he kindly called me would have attempted such a thing as i had attempted upon that occasion and among other expressions which he used toward me was that i dared to say forgery that i had dared to say forgery turning to judge douglas yes judge i did dare to say forgery but in this political canvass the judge ought to remember that i was not the first who dared to say forgery at jacksonville judge douglas made a speech in answer to something said by judge trumbull and at the close of what he said upon that subject he dared to say that trumbull had forged his evidence he said too that he should not concern himself with trumbull any more but thereafter he should hold lincoln responsible for the slanders upon him when i met him at charleston after that although i think that i should not have noticed the subject if he had not said he would hold me responsible for it i spread out before him the statements of the evidence that judge trumbull had used and i asked judge douglas piece by piece to put his finger upon one piece of all that evidence that he would say was a forgery when i went through with each and every piece judge douglas did not dare then to say that any piece of it was a forgery so it seems that there are some things that judge douglas dares to do and some that he dares not to do  a voice it is the same thing with you  yes sir it is the same thing with me i do dare to say forgery when it is true and dont dare to say forgery when it is false now i will say here to this audience and to judge douglas i have not dared to say he committed a forgery and i never shall until i know it but i did dare to sayjust to suggest to the judgethat a forgery had been committed which by his own showing had been traced to him and two of his friends i dared to suggest to him that he had expressly promised in one of his public speeches to investigate that matter and i dared to suggest to him that there was an implied promise that when he investigated it he would make known the result i dared to suggest to the judge that he could not expect to be quite clear of suspicion of that fraud for since the time that promise was made he had been with those friends and had not kept his promise in regard to the investigation and the report upon it i am not a very daring man but i dared that much judge and i am not much scared about it yet when the judge says he would nt have believed of abraham lincoln that he would have made such an attempt as that he reminds me of the fact that he entered upon this canvass with the purpose to treat me courteously that touched me somewhat it sets me to thinking i was aware when it was first agreed that judge douglas and i were to have these seven joint discussions that they were the successive acts of a drama perhaps i should say to be enacted not merely in the face of audiences like this but in the face of the nation and to some extent by my relation to him and not from anything in myself in the face of the world and i am anxious that they should be conducted with dignity and in the good temper which would be befitting the vast audiences before which it was conducted but when judge douglas got home from washington and made his first speech in chicago the evening afterward i made some sort of a reply to it his second speech was made at bloomington in which he commented upon my speech at chicago and said that i had used language ingeniously contrived to conceal my intentions or words to that effect now i understand that this is an imputation upon my veracity and my candor i do not know what the judge understood by it but in our first discussion at ottawa he led off by charging a bargain somewhat corrupt in its character upon trumbull and myselfthat we had entered into a bargain one of the terms of which was that trumbull was to abolitionize the old democratic party and i lincoln was to abolitionize the old whig party i pretending to be as good an oldline whig as ever judge douglas may not understand that he implicated my truthfulness and my honor when he said i was doing one thing and pretending another and i misunderstood him if he thought he was treating me in a dignified way as a man of honor and truth as he now claims he was disposed to treat me even after that time at galesburgh when he brings forward an extract from a speech made at chicago and an extract from a speech made at charleston to prove that i was trying to play a double part that i was trying to cheat the public and get votes upon one set of principles at one place and upon another set of principles at another placei do not understand but what he impeaches my honor my veracity and my candor and because he does this i do not understand that i am bound if i see a truthful ground for it to keep my hands off of him as soon as i learned that judge douglas was disposed to treat me in this way i signified in one of my speeches that i should be driven to draw upon whatever of humble resources i might haveto adopt a new course with him i was not entirely sure that i should be able to hold my own with him but i at least had the purpose made to do as well as i could upon him and now i say that i will not be the first to cry hold i think it originated with the judge and when he quits i probably will but i shall not ask any favors at all he asks me or he asks the audience if i wish to push this matter to the point of personal difficulty i tell him no he did not make a mistake in one of his early speeches when he called me an amiable man though perhaps he did when he called me an intelligent man it really hurts me very much to suppose that i have wronged anybody on earth i again tell him no i very much prefer when this canvass shall be over however it may result that we at least part without any bitter recollections of personal difficulties  the judge in his concluding speech at galesburgh says that i was pushing this matter to a personal difficulty to avoid the responsibility for the enormity of my principles i say to the judge and this audience now that i will again state our principles as well as i hastily can in all their enormity and if the judge hereafter chooses to confine himself to a war upon these principles he will probably not find me departing from the same course  we have in this nation this element of domestic slavery it is a matter of absolute certainty that it is a disturbing element it is the opinion of all the great men who have expressed an opinion upon it that it is a dangerous element we keep up a controversy in regard to it that controversy necessarily springs from difference of opinion and if we can learn exactlycan reduce to the lowest elementswhat that difference of opinion is we perhaps shall be better prepared for discussing the different systems of policy that we would propose in regard to that disturbing element i suggest that the difference of opinion reduced to its lowest of terms is no other than the difference between the men who think slavery a wrong and those who do not think it wrong the republican party think it wrong we think it is a moral a social and a political wrong we think it as a wrong not confining itself merely to the persons or the states where it exists but that it is a wrong in its tendency to say the least that extends itself to the existence of the whole nation because we think it wrong we propose a course of policy that shall deal with it as a wrong we deal with it as with any other wrong in so far as we can prevent its growing any larger and so deal with it that in the run of time there may be some promise of an end to it we have a due regard to the actual presence of it amongst us and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way and all the constitutional obligations thrown about it i suppose that in reference both to its actual existence in the nation and to our constitutional obligations we have no right at all to disturb it in the states where it exists and we profess that we have no more inclination to disturb it than we have the right to do it we go further than that we dont propose to disturb it where in one instance we think the constitution would permit us we think the constitution would permit us to disturb it in the district of columbia still we do not propose to do that unless it should be in terms which i dont suppose the nation is very likely soon to agree tothe terms of making the emancipation gradual and compensating the unwilling owners where we suppose we have the constitutional right we restrain ourselves in reference to the actual existence of the institution and the difficulties thrown about it we also oppose it as an evil so far as it seeks to spread itself we insist on the policy that shall restrict it to its present limits we dont suppose that in doing this we violate anything due to the actual presence of the institution or anything due to the constitutional guaranties thrown around it  we oppose the dred scott decision in a certain way upon which i ought perhaps to address you a few words we do not propose that when dred scott has been decided to be a slave by the court we as a mob will decide him to be free we do not propose that when any other one or one thousand shall be decided by that court to be slaves we will in any violent way disturb the rights of property thus settled but we nevertheless do oppose that decision as a political rule which shall be binding on the voter to vote for nobody who thinks it wrong which shall be binding on the members of congress or the president to favor no measure that does not actually concur with the principles of that decision we do not propose to be bound by it as a political rule in that way because we think it lays the foundation not merely of enlarging and spreading out what we consider an evil but it lays the foundation for spreading that evil into the states themselves we propose so resisting it as to have it reversed if we can and a new judicial rule established upon this subject  i will add this that if there be any man who does not believe that slavery is wrong in the three aspects which i have mentioned or in any one of them that man is misplaced and ought to leave us while on the other hand if there be any man in the republican party who is impatient over the necessity springing from its actual presence and is impatient of the constitutional guaranties thrown around it and would act in disregard of these he too is misplaced standing with us he will find his place somewhere else for we have a due regard so far as we are capable of understanding them for all these things this gentlemen as well as i can give it is a plain statement of our principles in all their enormity i will say now that there is a sentiment in the country contrary to mea sentiment which holds that slavery is not wrong and therefore it goes for the policy that does not propose dealing with it as a wrong that policy is the democratic policy and that sentiment is the democratic sentiment if there be a doubt in the mind of any one of this vast audience that this is really the central idea of the democratic party in relation to this subject i ask him to bear with me while i state a few things tending as i think to prove that proposition in the first place the leading mani think i may do my friend judge douglas the honor of calling him such advocating the present democratic policy never himself says it is wrong he has the high distinction so far as i know of never having said slavery is either right or wrong almost everybody else says one or the other but the judge never does if there be a man in the democratic party who thinks it is wrong and yet clings to that party i suggest to him in the first place that his leader dont talk as he does for he never says that it is wrong in the second place i suggest to him that if he will examine the policy proposed to be carried forward he will find that he carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in it if you will examine the arguments that are made on it you will find that every one carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery perhaps that democrat who says he is as much opposed to slavery as i am will tell me that i am wrong about this i wish him to examine his own course in regard to this matter a moment and then see if his opinion will not be changed a little you say it is wrong but dont you constantly object to anybody else saying so do you not constantly argue that this is not the right place to oppose it you say it must not be opposed in the free states because slavery is not here it must not be opposed in the slave states because it is there it must not be opposed in politics because that will make a fuss it must not be opposed in the pulpit because it is not religion then where is the place to oppose it there is no suitable place to oppose it there is no place in the country to oppose this evil overspreading the continent which you say yourself is coming frank blair and gratz brown tried to get up a system of gradual emancipation in missouri had an election in august and got beat and you mr democrat threw up your hat and hallooed hurrah for democracy so i say again that in regard to the arguments that are made when judge douglas says he dont care whether slavery is voted up or voted down whether he means that as an individual expression of sentiment or only as a sort of statement of his views on national policy it is alike true to say that he can thus argue logically if he dont see anything wrong in it but he cannot say so logically if he admits that slavery is wrong he cannot say that he would as soon see a wrong voted up as voted down when judge douglas says that whoever or whatever community wants slaves they have a right to have them he is perfectly logical if there is nothing wrong in the institution but if you admit that it is wrong he cannot logically say that anybody has a right to do wrong when he says that slave property and horse and hog property are alike to be allowed to go into the territories upon the principles of equality he is reasoning truly if there is no difference between them as property but if the one is property held rightfully and the other is wrong then there is no equality between the right and wrong so that turn it in anyway you can in all the arguments sustaining the democratic policy and in that policy itself there is a careful studied exclusion of the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery let us understand this i am not just here trying to prove that we are right and they are wrong i have been stating where we and they stand and trying to show what is the real difference between us and i now say that whenever we can get the question distinctly stated can get all these men who believe that slavery is in some of these respects wrong to stand and act with us in treating it as a wrongthen and not till then i think we will in some way come to an end of this slavery agitation     mr lincolns rejoinder  my friendssince judge douglas has said to you in his conclusion that he had not time in an hour and a half to answer all i had said in an hour it follows of course that i will not be able to answer in half an hour all that he said in an hour and a half  i wish to return to judge douglas my profound thanks for his public annunciation here today to be put on record that his system of policy in regard to the institution of slavery contemplates that it shall last forever we are getting a little nearer the true issue of this controversy and i am profoundly grateful for this one sentence judge douglas asks you why cannot the institution of slavery or rather why cannot the nation part slave and part free continue as our fathers made it forever in the first place i insist that our fathers did not make this nation half slave and half free or part slave and part free i insist that they found the institution of slavery existing here they did not make it so but they left it so because they knew of no way to get rid of it at that time when judge douglas undertakes to say that as a matter of choice the fathers of the government made this nation part slave and part free he assumes what is historically a falsehood more than that when the fathers of the government cut off the source of slavery by the abolition of the slavetrade and adopted a system of restricting it from the new territories where it had not existed i maintain that they placed it where they understood and all sensible men understood it was in the course of ultimate extinction and when judge douglas asks me why it cannot continue as our fathers made it i ask him why he and his friends could not let it remain as our fathers made it  it is precisely all i ask of him in relation to the institution of slavery that it shall be placed upon the basis that our fathers placed it upon mr brooks of south carolina once said and truly said that when this government was established no one expected the institution of slavery to last until this day and that the men who formed this government were wiser and better than the men of these days but the men of these days had experience which the fathers had not and that experience had taught them the invention of the cottongin and this had made the perpetuation of the institution of slavery a necessity in this country judge douglas could not let it stand upon the basis which our fathers placed it but removed it and put it upon the cottongin basis it is a question therefore for him and his friends to answer why they could not let it remain where the fathers of the government originally placed it i hope nobody has understood me as trying to sustain the doctrine that we have a right to quarrel with kentucky or virginia or any of the slave states about the institution of slaverythus giving the judge an opportunity to be eloquent and valiant against us in fighting for their rights i expressly declared in my opening speech that i had neither the inclination to exercise nor the belief in the existence of the right to interfere with the states of kentucky or virginia in doing as they pleased with slavery or any other existing institution then what becomes of all his eloquence in behalf of the rights of states which are assailed by no living man  but i have to hurry on for i have but a half hour the judge has informed me or informed this audience that the washington union is laboring for my election to the united states senate this is news to menot very ungrateful news either turning to mr w h carlin who was on the standi hope that carlin will be elected to the state senate and will vote for me mr carlin shook his head carlin dont fall in i perceive and i suppose he will not do much for me but i am glad of all the support i can get anywhere if i can get it without practicing any deception to obtain it in respect to this large portion of judge douglass speech in which he tries to show that in the controversy between himself and the administration party he is in the right i do not feel myself at all competent or inclined to answer him i say to him give it to themgive it to them just all you can and on the other hand i say to carlin and jake davis and to this man wogley up here in hancock give it to douglas just pour it into him  now in regard to this matter of the dred scott decision i wish to say a word or two after all the judge will not say whether if a decision is made holding that the people of the states cannot exclude slavery he will support it or not he obstinately refuses to say what he will do in that case the judges of the supreme court as obstinately refused to say what they would do on this subject before this i reminded him that at galesburgh he said the judges had expressly declared the contrary and you remember that in my opening speech i told him i had the book containing that decision here and i would thank him to lay his finger on the place where any such thing was said he has occupied his hour and a half and he has not ventured to try to sustain his assertion he never will but he is desirous of knowing how we are going to reverse that dred scott decision judge douglas ought to know how did not he and his political friends find a way to reverse the decision of that same court in favor of the constitutionality of the national bank didnt they find a way to do it so effectually that they have reversed it as completely as any decision ever was reversed so far as its practical operation is concerned  and let me ask you did nt judge douglas find a way to reverse the decision of our supreme court when it decided that carlins fatherold governor carlin had not the constitutional power to remove a secretary of state did he not appeal to the mobs as he calls them did he not make speeches in the lobby to show how villainous that decision was and how it ought to be overthrown did he not succeed too in getting an act passed by the legislature to have it overthrown and did nt he himself sit down on that bench as one of the five added judges who were to overslaugh the four old ones getting his name of judge in that way and no other if there is a villainy in using disrespect or making opposition to supreme court decisions i commend it to judge douglass earnest consideration i know of no man in the state of illinois who ought to know so well about how much villainy it takes to oppose a decision of the supreme court as our honorable friend stephen a douglas  judge douglas also makes the declaration that i say the democrats are bound by the dred scott decision while the republicans are not in the sense in which he argues i never said it but i will tell you what i have said and what i do not hesitate to repeat today i have said that as the democrats believe that decision to be correct and that the extension of slavery is affirmed in the national constitution they are bound to support it as such and i will tell you here that general jackson once said each man was bound to support the constitution as he understood it now judge douglas understands the constitution according to the dred scott decision and he is bound to support it as he understands it i understand it another way and therefore i am bound to support it in the way in which i understand it and as judge douglas believes that decision to be correct i will remake that argument if i have time to do so let me talk to some gentleman down there among you who looks me in the face we will say you are a member of the territorial legislature and like judge douglas you believe that the right to take and hold slaves there is a constitutional right the first thing you do is to swear you will support the constitution and all rights guaranteed therein that you will whenever your neighbor needs your legislation to support his constitutional rights not withhold that legislation if you withhold that necessary legislation for the support of the constitution and constitutional rights do you not commit perjury i ask every sensible man if that is not so that is undoubtedly just so say what you please now that is precisely what judge douglas says that this is a constitutional right does the judge mean to say that the territorial legislature in legislating may by withholding necessary laws or by passing unfriendly laws nullify that constitutional right does he mean to say that does he mean to ignore the proposition so long and well established in law that what you cannot do directly you cannot do indirectly does he mean that the truth about the matter is this judge douglas has sung paeans to his popular sovereignty doctrine until his supreme court cooperating with him has squatted his squatter sovereignty out but he will keep up this species of humbuggery about squatter sovereignty he has at last invented this sort of donothing sovereigntythat the people may exclude slavery by a sort of sovereignty that is exercised by doing nothing at all is not that running his popular sovereignty down awfully has it not got down as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death but at last when it is brought to the test of close reasoning there is not even that thin decoction of it left it is a presumption impossible in the domain of thought it is precisely no other than the putting of that most unphilosophical proposition that two bodies can occupy the same space at the same time the dred scott decision covers the whole ground and while it occupies it there is no room even for the shadow of a starved pigeon to occupy the same ground  judge douglas in reply to what i have said about having upon a previous occasion made the speech at ottawa as the one he took an extract from at charleston says it only shows that i practiced the deception twice now my friends are any of you obtuse enough to swallow that judge douglas had said i had made a speech at charleston that i would not make up north and i turned around and answered him by showing i had made that same speech up northhad made it at ottawa made it in his hearing made it in the abolition districtin lovejoys districtin the personal presence of lovejoy himselfin the same atmosphere exactly in which i had made my chicago speech of which he complains so much  now in relation to my not having said anything about the quotation from the chicago speech he thinks that is a terrible subject for me to handle why gentlemen i can show you that the substance of the chicago speech i delivered two years ago in egypt as he calls it it was down at springfield that speech is here in this book and i could turn to it and read it to you but for the lack of time i have not now the time to read it read it read it no gentlemen i am obliged to use discretion in disposing most advantageously of my brief time the judge has taken great exception to my adopting the heretical statement in the declaration of independence that all men are created equal and he has a great deal to say about negro equality i want to say that in sometimes alluding to the declaration of independence i have only uttered the sentiments that henry clay used to hold allow me to occupy your time a moment with what he said mr clay was at one time called upon in indiana and in a way that i suppose was very insulting to liberate his slaves and he made a written reply to that application and one portion of it is in these words  what is the foundation of this appeal to me in indiana to liberate the slaves under my care in kentucky it is a general declaration in the act announcing to the world the independence of the thirteen american colonies that men are created equal now as an abstract principle there is no doubt of the truth of that declaration and it is desirable in the original construction of society and in organized societies to keep it in view as a great fundamental principle  when i sometimes in relation to the organization of new societies in new countries where the soil is clean and clear insisted that we should keep that principle in view judge douglas will have it that i want a negro wife he never can be brought to understand that there is any middle ground on this subject i have lived until my fiftieth year and have never had a negro woman either for a slave or a wife and i think i can live fifty centuries for that matter without having had one for either i maintain that you may take judge douglass quotations from my chicago speech and from my charleston speech and the galesburgh speechin his speech of todayand compare them over and i am willing to trust them with you upon his proposition that they show rascality or doubledealing i deny that they do  the judge does not seem at all disposed to have peace but i find he is disposed to have a personal warfare with me he says that my oath would not be taken against the bare word of charles h lanphier or thomas l harris well that is altogether a matter of opinion it is certainly not for me to vaunt my word against oaths of these gentlemen but i will tell judge douglas again the facts upon which i dared to say they proved a forgery i pointed out at galesburgh that the publication of these resolutions in the illinois state register could not have been the result of accident as the proceedings of that meeting bore unmistakable evidence of being done by a man who knew it was a forgery that it was a publication partly taken from the real proceedings of the convention and partly from the proceedings of a convention at another place which showed that he had the real proceedings before him and taking one part of the resolutions he threw out another part and substituted false and fraudulent ones in their stead i pointed that out to him and also that his friend lanphier who was editor of the register at that time and now is must have known how it was done now whether he did it or got some friend to do it for him i could not tell but he certainly knew all about it i pointed out to judge douglas that in his freeport speech he had promised to investigate that matter does he now say that he did not make that promise i have a right to ask why he did not keep it i call upon him to tell here today why he did not keep that promise that fraud has been traced up so that it lies between him harris and lanphier there is little room for escape for lanphier lanphier is doing the judge good service and douglas desires his word to be taken for the truth he desires lanphier to be taken as authority in what he states in his newspaper he desires harris to be taken as a man of vast credibility and when this thing lies among them they will not press it to show where the guilt really belongs now as he has said that he would investigate it and implied that he would tell us the result of his investigation i demand of him to tell why he did not investigate it if he did not and if he did why he wont tell the result i call upon him for that  this is the third time that judge douglas has assumed that he learned about these resolutions by harriss attempting to use them against norton on the floor of congress i tell judge douglas the public records of the country show that he himself attempted it upon trumbull a month before harris tried them on norton that harris had the opportunity of learning it from him rather than he from harris i now ask his attention to that part of the record on the case my friends i am not disposed to detain you longer in regard to that matter  i am told that i still have five minutes left there is another matter i wish to call attention to he says when he discovered there was a mistake in that case he came forward magnanimously without my calling his attention to it and explained it i will tell you how he became so magnanimous when the newspapers of our side had discovered and published it and put it beyond his power to deny it then he came forward and made a virtue of necessity by acknowledging it now he argues that all the point there was in those resolutions although never passed at springfield is retained by their being passed at other localities is that true he said i had a hand in passing them in his opening speech that i was in the convention and helped to pass them do the resolutions touch me at all it strikes me there is some difference between holding a man responsible for an act which he has not done and holding him responsible for an act that he has done you will judge whether there is any difference in the spots and he has taken credit for great magnanimity in coming forward and acknowledging what is proved on him beyond even the capacity of judge douglas to deny and he has more capacity in that way than any other living man  then he wants to know why i wont withdraw the charge in regard to a conspiracy to make slavery national as he has withdrawn the one he made may it please his worship i will withdraw it when it is proven false on me as that was proven false on him i will add a little more than that i will withdraw it whenever a reasonable man shall be brought to believe that the charge is not true i have asked judge douglass attention to certain matters of fact tending to prove the charge of a conspiracy to nationalize slavery and he says he convinces me that this is all untrue because buchanan was not in the country at that time and because the dred scott case had not then got into the supreme court and he says that i say the democratic owners of dred scott got up the case i never did say that i defy judge douglas to show that i ever said so for i never uttered it one of mr douglass reporters gesticulated affirmatively at mr lincoln i dont care if your hireling does say i did i tell you myself that i never said the democratic owners of dred scott got up the case i have never pretended to know whether dred scotts owners were democrats or abolitionists or freesoilers or border ruffians i have said that there is evidence about the case tending to show that it was a madeup case for the purpose of getting that decision i have said that that evidence was very strong in the fact that when dred scott was declared to be a slave the owner of him made him free showing that he had had the case tried and the question settled for such use as could be made of that decision he cared nothing about the property thus declared to be his by that decision but my time is out and i can say no more     last debate at alton october 15 1858     mr lincolns reply  ladies and gentlemeni have been somewhat in my own mind complimented by a large portion of judge douglass speechi mean that portion which he devotes to the controversy between himself and the present administration this is the seventh time judge douglas and myself have met in these joint discussions and he has been gradually improving in regard to his war with the administration at quincy day before yesterday he was a little more severe upon the administration than i had heard him upon any occasion and i took pains to compliment him for it i then told him to give it to them with all the power he had and as some of them were present i told them i would be very much obliged if they would give it to him in about the same way i take it he has now vastly improved upon the attack he made then upon the administration i flatter myself he has really taken my advice on this subject all i can say now is to recommend to him and to them what i then commendedto prosecute the war against one another in the most vigorous manner i say to them again go it husbandgo it bear  there is one other thing i will mention before i leave this branch of the discussionalthough i do not consider it much of my business anyway i refer to that part of the judges remarks where he undertakes to involve mr buchanan in an inconsistency he reads something from mr buchanan from which he undertakes to involve him in an inconsistency and he gets something of a cheer for having done so i would only remind the judge that while he is very valiantly fighting for the nebraska bill and the repeal of the missouri compromise it has been but a little while since he was the valiant advocate of the missouri compromise i want to know if buchanan has not as much right to be inconsistent as douglas has has douglas the exclusive right in this country of being on all sides of all questions is nobody allowed that high privilege but himself is he to have an entire monopoly on that subject  so far as judge douglas addressed his speech to me or so far as it was about me it is my business to pay some attention to it i have heard the judge state two or three times what he has stated today that in a speech which i made at springfield illinois i had in a very especial manner complained that the supreme court in the dred scott case had decided that a negro could never be a citizen of the united states i have omitted by some accident heretofore to analyze this statement and it is required of me to notice it now in point of fact it is untrue i never have complained especially of the dred scott decision because it held that a negro could not be a citizen and the judge is always wrong when he says i ever did so complain of it i have the speech here and i will thank him or any of his friends to show where i said that a negro should be a citizen and complained especially of the dred scott decision because it declared he could not be one i have done no such thing and judge douglas so persistently insisting that i have done so has strongly impressed me with the belief of a predetermination on his part to misrepresent me he could not get his foundation for insisting that i was in favor of this negro equality anywhere else as well as he could by assuming that untrue proposition let me tell this audience what is true in regard to that matter and the means by which they may correct me if i do not tell them truly is by a recurrence to the speech itself i spoke of the dred scott decision in my springfield speech and i was then endeavoring to prove that the dred scott decision was a portion of a system or scheme to make slavery national in this country i pointed out what things had been decided by the court i mentioned as a fact that they had decided that a negro could not be a citizen that they had done so as i supposed to deprive the negro under all circumstances of the remotest possibility of ever becoming a citizen and claiming the rights of a citizen of the united states under a certain clause of the constitution i stated that without making any complaint of it at all i then went on and stated the other points decided in the case namely that the bringing of a negro into the state of illinois and holding him in slavery for two years here was a matter in regard to which they would not decide whether it would make him free or not that they decided the further point that taking him into a united states territory where slavery was prohibited by act of congress did not make him free because that act of congress as they held was unconstitutional i mentioned these three things as making up the points decided in that case i mentioned them in a lump taken in connection with the introduction of the nebraska bill and the amendment of chase offered at the time declaratory of the right of the people of the territories to exclude slavery which was voted down by the friends of the bill i mentioned all these things together as evidence tending to prove a combination and conspiracy to make the institution of slavery national in that connection and in that way i mentioned the decision on the point that a negro could not be a citizen and in no other connection  out of this judge douglas builds up his beautiful fabrication of my purpose to introduce a perfect social and political equality between the white and black races his assertion that i made an especial objection that is his exact language to the decision on this account is untrue in point of fact  now while i am upon this subject and as henry clay has been alluded to i desire to place myself in connection with mr clay as nearly right before this people as may be i am quite aware what the judges object is here by all these allusions he knows that we are before an audience having strong sympathies southward by relationship place of birth and so on he desires to place me in an extremely abolition attitude he read upon a former occasion and alludes without reading today to a portion of a speech which i delivered in chicago in his quotations from that speech as he has made them upon former occasions the extracts were taken in such a way as i suppose brings them within the definition of what is called garblingtaking portions of a speech which when taken by themselves do not present the entire sense of the speaker as expressed at the time i propose therefore out of that same speech to show how one portion of it which he skipped over taking an extract before and an extract after will give a different idea and the true idea i intended to convey it will take me some little time to read it but i believe i will occupy the time that way  you have heard him frequently allude to my controversy with him in regard to the declaration of independence i confess that i have had a struggle with judge douglas on that matter and i will try briefly to place myself right in regard to it on this occasion i saidand it is between the extracts judge douglas has taken from this speech and put in his published speeches  it may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities and impose them upon us and to the extent that a necessity is imposed upon a man he must submit to it i think that was the condition in which we found ourselves when we established this government we had slaves among us we could not get our constitution unless we permitted them to remain in slavery we could not secure the good we did secure if we grasped for more and having by necessity submitted to that much it does not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties let the charter remain as our standard  now i have upon all occasions declared as strongly as judge douglas against the disposition to interfere with the existing institution of slavery you hear me read it from the same speech from which he takes garbled extracts for the purpose of proving upon me a disposition to interfere with the institution of slavery and establish a perfect social and political equality between negroes and white people  allow me while upon this subject briefly to present one other extract from a speech of mine more than a year ago at springfield in discussing this very same question soon after judge douglas took his ground that negroes were not included in the declaration of independence  i think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all men but they did not mean to declare all men equal in all respects they did not mean to say all men were equal in color size intellect moral development or social capacity they defined with tolerable distinctness in what they did consider all men created equalequal in certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness this they said and this they meant they did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality or yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them in fact they had no power to confer such a boon they meant simply to declare the right so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit  they meant to set up a standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to allconstantly looked to constantly labored for and even though never perfectly attained constantly approximated and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colors everywhere  there again are the sentiments i have expressed in regard to the declaration of independence upon a former occasionsentiments which have been put in print and read wherever anybody cared to know what so humble an individual as myself chose to say in regard to it  at galesburgh the other day i said in answer to judge douglas that three years ago there never had been a man so far as i knew or believed in the whole world who had said that the declaration of independence did not include negroes in the term all men i reassert it today i assert that judge douglas and all his friends may search the whole records of the country and it will be a matter of great astonishment to me if they shall be able to find that one human being three years ago had ever uttered the astounding sentiment that the term all men in the declaration did not include the negro do not let me be misunderstood i know that more than three years ago there were men who finding this assertion constantly in the way of their schemes to bring about the ascendency and perpetuation of slavery denied the truth of it i know that mr calhoun and all the politicians of his school denied the truth of the declaration i know that it ran along in the mouth of some southern men for a period of years ending at last in that shameful though rather forcible declaration of pettit of indiana upon the floor of the united states senate that the declaration of independence was in that respect a selfevident lie rather than a selfevident truth but i say with a perfect knowledge of all this hawking at the declaration without directly attacking it that three years ago there never had lived a man who had ventured to assail it in the sneaking way of pretending to believe it and then asserting it did not include the negro i believe the first man who ever said it was chief justice taney in the dred scott case and the next to him was our friend stephen a douglas and now it has become the catchword of the entire party i would like to call upon his friends everywhere to consider how they have come in so short a time to view this matter in a way so entirely different from their former belief to ask whether they are not being borne along by an irresistible currentwhither they know not  in answer to my proposition at galesburgh last week i see that some man in chicago has got up a letter addressed to the chicago times to show as he professes that somebody had said so before and he signs himself an oldline whig if i remember correctly in the first place i would say he was not an oldline whig i am somewhat acquainted with oldline whigs from the origin to the end of that party i became pretty well acquainted with them and i know they always had some sense whatever else you could ascribe to them i know there never was one who had not more sense than to try to show by the evidence he produces that some men had prior to the time i named said that negroes were not included in the term all men in the declaration of independence what is the evidence he produces i will bring forward his evidence and let you see what he offers by way of showing that somebody more than three years ago had said negroes were not included in the declaration he brings forward part of a speech from henry claythe part of the speech of henry clay which i used to bring forward to prove precisely the contrary i guess we are surrounded to some extent today by the old friends of mr clay and they will be glad to hear anything from that authority while he was in indiana a man presented a petition to liberate his negroes and he mr clay made a speech in answer to it which i suppose he carefully wrote out himself and caused to be published i have before me an extract from that speech which constitutes the evidence this pretended oldline whig at chicago brought forward to show that mr clay did nt suppose the negro was included in the declaration of independence hear what mr clay said  and what is the foundation of this appeal to me in indiana to liberate the slaves under my care in kentucky it is a general declaration in the act announcing to the world the independence of the thirteen american colonies that all men are created equal now as an abstract principle there is no doubt of the truth of that declaration and it is desirable in the original construction of society and in organized societies to keep it in view as a great fundamental principle but then i apprehend that in no society that ever did exist or ever shall be formed was or can the equality asserted among the members of the human race be practically enforced and carried out there are portions large portions women minors insane culprits transient sojourners that will always probably remain subject to the government of another portion of the community  that declaration whatever may be the extent of its import was made by the delegations of the thirteen states in most of them slavery existed and had long existed and was established by law it was introduced and forced upon the colonies by the paramount law of england do you believe that in making that declaration the states that concurred in it intended that it should be tortured into a virtual emancipation of all the slaves within their respective limits would virginia and other southern states have ever united in a declaration which was to be interpreted into an abolition of slavery among them did any one of the thirteen colonies entertain such a design or expectation to impute such a secret and unavowed purpose would be to charge a political fraud upon the noblest band of patriots that ever assembled in councila fraud upon the confederacy of the revolution a fraud upon the union of those states whose constitution not only recognized the lawfulness of slavery but permitted the importation of slaves from africa until the year 1808  this is the entire quotation brought forward to prove that somebody previous to three years ago had said the negro was not included in the term all men in the declaration how does it do so in what way has it a tendency to prove that mr clay says it is true as an abstract principle that all men are created equal but that we cannot practically apply it in all eases he illustrates this by bringing forward the cases of females minors and insane persons with whom it cannot be enforced but he says it is true as an abstract principle in the organization of society as well as in organized society and it should be kept in view as a fundamental principle let me read a few words more before i add some comments of my own mr clay says a little further on  i desire no concealment of my opinions in regard to the institution of slavery i look upon it as a great evil and deeply lament that we have derived it from the parental government and from our ancestors i wish every slave in the united states was in the country of his ancestors but here they are and the question is how can they be best dealt with if a state of nature existed and we were about to lay the foundations of society no man would be more strongly opposed than i should be to incorporate the institution of slavery amongst its elements  now here in this same book in this same speech in this same extract brought forward to prove that mr clay held that the negro was not included in the declaration of independence is no such statement on his part but the declaration that it is a great fundamental truth which should be constantly kept in view in the organization of society and in societies already organized but if i say a word about it if i attempt as mr clay said all good men ought to do to keep it in view if in this organized society i ask to have the public eye turned upon it if i ask in relation to the organization of new territories that the public eye should be turned upon it forthwith i am vilified as you hear me today what have i done that i have not the license of henry clays illustrious example here in doing have i done aught that i have not his authority for while maintaining that in organizing new territories and societies this fundamental principle should be regarded and in organized society holding it up to the public view and recognizing what he recognized as the great principle of free government  and when this new principlethis new proposition that no human being ever thought of three years agois brought forward i combat it as having an evil tendency if not an evil design i combat it as having a tendency to dehumanize the negro to take away from him the right of ever striving to be a man i combat it as being one of the thousand things constantly done in these days to prepare the public mind to make property and nothing but property of the negro in all the states of this union  but there is a point that i wish before leaving this part of the discussion to ask attention to i have read and i repeat the words of henry clay  i desire no concealment of my opinions in regard to the institution of slavery i look upon it as a great evil and deeply lament that we have derived it from the parental government and from our ancestors i wish every slave in the united states was in the country of his ancestors but here they are and the question is how can they be best dealt with if a state of nature existed and we were about to lay the foundations of society no man would be more strongly opposed than i should be to incorporate the institution of slavery amongst its elements  the principle upon which i have insisted in this canvass is in relation to laying the foundations of new societies i have never sought to apply these principles to the old states for the purpose of abolishing slavery in those states it is nothing but a miserable perversion of what i have said to assume that i have declared missouri or any other slave state shall emancipate her slaves i have proposed no such thing but when mr clay says that in laying the foundations of society in our territories where it does not exist he would be opposed to the introduction of slavery as an element i insist that we have his warranthis licensefor insisting upon the exclusion of that element which he declared in such strong and emphatic language was most hurtful to him  judge douglas has again referred to a springfield speech in which i said a house divided against itself cannot stand the judge has so often made the entire quotation from that speech that i can make it from memory i used this language  we are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to the slavery agitation under the operation of this policy that agitation has not only not ceased but has constantly augmented in my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the states old as well as new north as well as south  that extract and the sentiments expressed in it have been extremely offensive to judge douglas he has warred upon them as satan wars upon the bible his perversions upon it are endless here now are my views upon it in brief  i said we were now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to the slavery agitation is it not so when that nebraska bill was brought forward four years ago last january was it not for the avowed object of putting an end to the slavery agitation we were to have no more agitation in congress it was all to be banished to the territories by the way i will remark here that as judge douglas is very fond of complimenting mr crittenden in these days mr crittenden has said there was a falsehood in that whole business for there was no slavery agitation at that time to allay we were for a little while quiet on the troublesome thing and that very allaying plaster of judge douglass stirred it up again but was it not understood or intimated with the confident promise of putting an end to the slavery agitation surely it was in every speech you heard judge douglas make until he got into this imbroglio as they call it with the administration about the lecompton constitution every speech on that nebraska bill was full of his felicitations that we were just at the end of the slavery agitation the last tip of the last joint of the old serpents tail was just drawing out of view but has it proved so i have asserted that under that policy that agitation has not only not ceased but has constantly augmented when was there ever a greater agitation in congress than last winter when was it as great in the country as today  there was a collateral object in the introduction of that nebraska policy which was to clothe the people of the territories with a superior degree of selfgovernment beyond what they had ever had before the first object and the main one of conferring upon the people a higher degree of selfgovernment is a question of fact to be determined by you in answer to a single question have you ever heard or known of a people anywhere on earth who had as little to do as in the first instance of its use the people of kansas had with this same right of selfgovernment  in its main policy and in its collateral object it has been nothing but a living creeping lie from the time of its introduction till today  i have intimated that i thought the agitation would not cease until a crisis should have been reached and passed i have stated in what way i thought it would be reached and passed i have said that it might go one way or the other we might by arresting the further spread of it and placing it where the fathers originally placed it put it where the public mind should rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction thus the agitation may cease it may be pushed forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the states old as well as new north as well as south i have said and i repeat my wish is that the further spread of it may be arrested and that it may be where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinctioni have expressed that as my wish i entertain the opinion upon evidence sufficient to my mind that the fathers of this government placed that institution where the public mind did rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction let me ask why they made provision that the source of slaverythe african slavetradeshould be cut off at the end of twenty years why did they make provision that in all the new territory we owned at that time slavery should be forever inhibited why stop its spread in one direction and cut off its source in another if they did not look to its being placed in the course of its ultimate extinction  again the institution of slavery is only mentioned in the constitution of the united states two or three times and in neither of these cases does the word slavery or negro race occur but covert language is used each time and for a purpose full of significance what is the language in regard to the prohibition of the african slavetrade it runs in about this way  the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit shall not be prohibited by the congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight  the next allusion in the constitution to the question of slavery and the black race is on the subject of the basis of representation and there the language used is  representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union according to their respective numbers which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons including those bound to service for a term of years and excluding indians not taxed threefifths of all other persons  it says persons not slaves not negroes but this threefifths can be applied to no other class among us than the negroes  lastly in the provision for the reclamation of fugitive slaves it is said  no person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof escaping into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due  there again there is no mention of the word negro or of slavery in all three of these places being the only allusions to slavery in the instrument covert language is used language is used not suggesting that slavery existed or that the black race were among us and i understand the contemporaneous history of those times to be that covert language was used with a purpose and that purpose was that in our constitution which it was hoped and is still hoped will endure foreverwhen it should be read by intelligent and patriotic men after the institution of slavery had passed from among usthere should be nothing on the face of the great charter of liberty suggesting that such a thing as negro slavery had ever existed among us this is part of the evidence that the fathers of the government expected and intended the institution of slavery to come to an end they expected and intended that it should be in the course of ultimate extinction and when i say that i desire to see the further spread of it arrested i only say i desire to see that done which the fathers have first done when i say i desire to see it placed where the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction i only say i desire to see it placed where they placed it it is not true that our fathers as judge douglas assumes made this government part slave and part free understand the sense in which he puts it he assumes that slavery is a rightful thing within itselfwas introduced by the framers of the constitution the exact truth is that they found the institution existing among us and they left it as they found it but in making the government they left this institution with many clear marks of disapprobation upon it they found slavery among them and they left it among them because of the difficultythe absolute impossibilityof its immediate removal and when judge douglas asks me why we cannot let it remain part slave and part free as the fathers of the government made it he asks a question based upon an assumption which is itself a falsehood and i turn upon him and ask him the question when the policy that the fathers of the government had adopted in relation to this element among us was the best policy in the world the only wise policy the only policy that we can ever safely continue upon that will ever give us peace unless this dangerous element masters us all and becomes a national institutioni turn upon him and ask him why he could not leave it alone i turn and ask him why he was driven to the necessity of introducing a new policy in regard to it he has himself said he introduced a new policy he said so in his speech on the 22d of march of the present year 1858 i ask him why he could not let it remain where our fathers placed it i ask too of judge douglas and his friends why we shall not again place this institution upon the basis on which the fathers left it i ask you when he infers that i am in favor of setting the free and slave states at war when the institution was placed in that attitude by those who made the constitution did they make any war if we had no war out of it when thus placed wherein is the ground of belief that we shall have war out of it if we return to that policy have we had any peace upon this matter springing from any other basis i maintain that we have not i have proposed nothing more than a return to the policy of the fathers  i confess when i propose a certain measure of policy it is not enough for me that i do not intend anything evil in the result but it is incumbent on me to show that it has not a tendency to that result i have met judge douglas in that point of view i have not only made the declaration that i do not mean to produce a conflict between the states but i have tried to show by fair reasoning and i think i have shown to the minds of fair men that i propose nothing but what has a most peaceful tendency the quotation that i happened to make in that springfield speech that a house divided against itself cannot stand and which has proved so offensive to the judge was part and parcel of the same thing he tries to show that variety in the democratic institutions of the different states is necessary and indispensable i do not dispute it i have no controversy with judge douglas about that i shall very readily agree with him that it would be foolish for us to insist upon having a cranberry law here in illinois where we have no cranberries because they have a cranberry law in indiana where they have cranberries i should insist that it would be exceedingly wrong in us to deny to virginia the right to enact oyster laws where they have oysters because we want no such laws here i understand i hope quite as well as judge douglas or anybody else that the variety in the soil and climate and face of the country and consequent variety in the industrial pursuits and productions of a country require systems of law conforming to this variety in the natural features of the country i understand quite as well as judge douglas that if we here raise a barrel of flour more than we want and the louisianians raise a barrel of sugar more than they want it is of mutual advantage to exchange that produces commerce brings us together and makes us better friends we like one another the more for it and i understand as well as judge douglas or anybody else that these mutual accommodations are the cements which bind together the different parts of this union that instead of being a thing to divide the housefiguratively expressing the unionthey tend to sustain it they are the props of the house tending always to hold it up  but when i have admitted all this i ask if there is any parallel between these things and this institution of slavery i do not see that there is any parallel at all between them consider it when have we had any difficulty or quarrel amongst ourselves about the cranberry laws of indiana or the oyster laws of virginia or the pinelumber laws of maine or the fact that louisiana produces sugar and illinois flour when have we had any quarrels over these things when have we had perfect peace in regard to this thing which i say is an element of discord in this union we have sometimes had peace but when was it it was when the institution of slavery remained quiet where it was we have had difficulty and turmoil whenever it has made a struggle to spread itself where it was not i ask then if experience does not speak in thundertones telling us that the policy which has given peace to the country heretofore being returned to gives the greatest promise of peace again you may say and judge douglas has intimated the same thing that all this difficulty in regard to the institution of slavery is the mere agitation of officeseekers and ambitious northern politicians he thinks we want to get his place i suppose i agree that there are officeseekers amongst us the bible says somewhere that we are desperately selfish i think we would have discovered that fact without the bible i do not claim that i am any less so than the average of men but i do claim that i am not more selfish than judge douglas  but is it true that all the difficulty and agitation we have in regard to this institution of slavery spring from officeseeking from the mere ambition of politicians is that the truth how many times have we had danger from this question go back to the day of the missouri compromise go back to the nullification question at the bottom of which lay this same slavery question go back to the time of the annexation of texas go back to the troubles that led to the compromise of 1850 you will find that every time with the single exception of the nullification question they sprung from an endeavor to spread this institution there never was a party in the history of this country and there probably never will be of sufficient strength to disturb the general peace of the country parties themselves may be divided and quarrel on minor questions yet it extends not beyond the parties themselves but does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles does it not enter into the churches and rend them asunder what divided the great methodist church into two parts north and south what has raised this constant disturbance in every presbyterian general assembly that meets what disturbed the unitarian church in this very city two years ago what has jarred and shaken the great american tract society recently not yet splitting it but sure to divide it in the end is it not this same mighty deepseated power that somehow operates on the minds of men exciting and stirring them up in every avenue of societyin politics in religion in literature in morals in all the manifold relations of life is this the work of politicians is that irresistible power which for fifty years has shaken the government and agitated the people to be stifled and subdued by pretending that it is an exceedingly simple thing and we ought not to talk about it if you will get everybody else to stop talking about it i assure you i will quit before they have half done so but where is the philosophy or statesmanship which assumes that you can quiet that disturbing element in our society which has disturbed us for more than half a century which has been the only serious danger that has threatened our institutionsi say where is the philosophy or the statesmanship based on the assumption that we are to quit talking about it and that the public mind is all at once to cease being agitated by it yet this is the policy here in the north that douglas is advocating that we are to care nothing about it i ask you if it is not a false philosophy is it not a false statesmanship that undertakes to build up a system of policy upon the basis of caring nothing about the very thing that everybody does care the most abouta thing which all experience has shown we care a very great deal about  the judge alludes very often in the course of his remarks to the exclusive right which the states have to decide the whole thing for themselves i agree with him very readily that the different states have that right he is but fighting a man of straw when he assumes that i am contending against the right of the states to do as they please about it our controversy with him is in regard to the new territories we agree that when the states come in as states they have the right and the power to do as they please we have no power as citizens of the freestates or in our federal capacity as members of the federal union through the general government to disturb slavery in the states where it exists we profess constantly that we have no more inclination than belief in the power of the government to disturb it yet we are driven constantly to defend ourselves from the assumption that we are warring upon the rights of the sates what i insist upon is that the new territories shall be kept free from it while in the territorial condition judge douglas assumes that we have no interest in themthat we have no right whatever to interfere i think we have some interest i think that as white men we have do we not wish for an outlet for our surplus population if i may so express myself do we not feel an interest in getting to that outlet with such institutions as we would like to have prevail there if you go to the territory opposed to slavery and another man comes upon the same ground with his slave upon the assumption that the things are equal it turns out that he has the equal right all his way and you have no part of it your way if he goes in and makes it a slave territory and by consequence a slave state is it not time that those who desire to have it a free state were on equal ground let me suggest it in a different way how many democrats are there about here a thousand who have left slave states and come into the free state of illinois to get rid of the institution of slavery another voice a thousand and one i reckon there are a thousand and one i will ask you if the policy you are now advocating had prevailed when this country was in a territorial condition where would you have gone to get rid of it where would you have found your free state or territory to go to and when hereafter for any cause the people in this place shall desire to find new homes if they wish to be rid of the institution where will they find the place to go to  now irrespective of the moral aspect of this question as to whether there is a right or wrong in enslaving a negro i am still in favor of our new territories being in such a condition that white men may find a homemay find some spot where they can better their condition where they can settle upon new soil and better their condition in life i am in favor of this not merely i must say it here as i have elsewhere for our own people who are born amongst us but as an outlet for free white people everywhere the world overin which hans and baptiste and patrick and all other men from all the world may find new homes and better their conditions in life  i have stated upon former occasions and i may as well state again what i understand to be the real issue in this controversy between judge douglas and myself on the point of my wanting to make war between the free and the slave states there has been no issue between us so too when he assumes that i am in favor of producing a perfect social and political equality between the white and black races these are false issues upon which judge douglas has tried to force the controversy there is no foundation in truth for the charge that i maintain either of these propositions the real issue in this controversythe one pressing upon every mindis the sentiment on the part of one class that looks upon the institution of slavery as a wrong and of another class that does not look upon it as a wrong the sentiment that contemplates the institution of slavery in this country as a wrong is the sentiment of the republican party it is the sentiment around which all their actions all their arguments circle from which all their propositions radiate they look upon it as being a moral social and political wrong and while they contemplate it as such they nevertheless have due regard for its actual existence among us and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way and to all the constitutional obligations thrown about it yet having a due regard for these they desire a policy in regard to it that looks to its not creating any more danger they insist that it should as far as may be be treated as a wrong and one of the methods of treating it as a wrong is to make provision that it shall grow no larger they also desire a policy that looks to a peaceful end of slavery at some time these are the views they entertain in regard to it as i understand them and all their sentiments all their arguments and propositions are brought within this range i have said and i repeat it here that if there be a man amongst us who does not think that the institution of slavery is wrong in any one of the aspects of which i have spoken he is misplaced and ought not to be with us and if there be a man amongst us who is so impatient of it as a wrong as to disregard its actual presence among us and the difficulty of getting rid of it suddenly in a satisfactory way and to disregard the constitutional obligations thrown about it that man is misplaced if he is on our platform we disclaim sympathy with him in practical action he is not placed properly with us  on this subject of treating it as a wrong and limiting its spread let me say a word has anything ever threatened the existence of this union save and except this very institution of slavery what is it that we hold most dear amongst us our own liberty and prosperity what has ever threatened our liberty and prosperity save and except this institution of slavery if this is true how do you propose to improve the condition of things by enlarging slavery by spreading it out and making it bigger you may have a wen or cancer upon your person and not be able to cut it out lest you bleed to death but surely it is no way to cure it to engraft it and spread it over your whole body that is no proper way of treating what you regard a wrong you see this peaceful way of dealing with it as a wrong restricting the spread of it and not allowing it to go into new countries where it has not already existed that is the peaceful way the oldfashioned way the way in which the fathers themselves set us the example  on the other hand i have said there is a sentiment which treats it as not being wrong that is the democratic sentiment of this day i do not mean to say that every man who stands within that range positively asserts that it is right that class will include all who positively assert that it is right and all who like judge douglas treat it as indifferent and do not say it is either right or wrong these two classes of men fall within the general class of those who do not look upon it as a wrong and if there be among you anybody who supposes that he as a democrat can consider himself as much opposed to slavery as anybody i would like to reason with him you never treat it as a wrong what other thing that you consider as a wrong do you deal with as you deal with that perhaps you say it is wrongbut your leader never does and you quarrel with anybody who says it is wrong although you pretend to say so yourself you can find no fit place to deal with it as a wrong you must not say anything about it in the free states because it is not here you must not say anything about it in the slave states because it is there you must not say anything about it in the pulpit because that is religion and has nothing to do with it you must not say anything about it in politics because that will disturb the security of my place there is no place to talk about it as being a wrong although you say yourself it is a wrong but finally you will screw yourself up to the belief that if the people of the slave states should adopt a system of gradual emancipation on the slavery question you would be in favor of it you would be in favor of it you say that is getting it in the right place and you would be glad to see it succeed but you are deceiving yourself you all know that frank blair and gratz brown down there in st louis undertook to introduce that system in missouri they fought as valiantly as they could for the system of gradual emancipation which you pretend you would be glad to see succeed now i will bring you to the test after a hard fight they were beaten and when the news came over here you threw up your hats and hurrahed for democracy more than that take all the argument made in favor of the system you have proposed and it carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in the institution of slavery the arguments to sustain that policy carefully exclude it even here today you heard judge douglas quarrel with me because i uttered a wish that it might sometime come to an end although henry clay could say he wished every slave in the united states was in the country of his ancestors i am denounced by those pretending to respect henry clay for uttering a wish that it might sometime in some peaceful way come to an end the democratic policy in regard to that institution will not tolerate the merest breath the slightest hint of the least degree of wrong about it try it by some of judge douglass arguments he says he dont care whether it is voted up or voted down in the territories i do not care myself in dealing with that expression whether it is intended to be expressive of his individual sentiments on the subject or only of the national policy he desires to have established it is alike valuable for my purpose any man can say that who does not see anything wrong in slavery but no man can logically say it who does see a wrong in it because no man can logically say he dont care whether a wrong is voted up or voted down he may say he dont care whether an indifferent thing is voted up or down but he must logically have a choice between a right thing and a wrong thing he contends that whatever community wants slaves has a right to have them so they have if it is not a wrong but if it is a wrong he cannot say people have a right to do wrong he says that upon the score of equality slaves should be allowed to go in a new territory like other property this is strictly logical if there is no difference between it and other property if it and other property are equal this argument is entirely logical but if you insist that one is wrong and the other right there is no use to institute a comparison between right and wrong you may turn over everything in the democratic policy from beginning to end whether in the shape it takes on the statute book in the shape it takes in the dred scott decision in the shape it takes in conversation or the shape it takes in short maximlike argumentsit everywhere carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in it  that is the real issue that is the issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of judge douglas and myself shall be silent it is the eternal struggle between these two principlesright and wrongthroughout the world they are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time and will ever continue to struggle the one is the common right of humanity and the other the divine right of kings it is the same principle in whatever shape it develops itself it is the same spirit that says you work and toil and earn bread and ill eat it no matter in what shape it comes whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation and live by the fruit of their labor or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race it is the same tyrannical principle i was glad to express my gratitude at quincy and i reexpress it here to judge douglasthat he looks to no end of the institution of slavery that will help the people to see where the struggle really is it will hereafter place with us all men who really do wish the wrong may have an end and whenever we can get rid of the fog which obscures the real question when we can get judge douglas and his friends to avow a policy looking to its perpetuationwe can get out from among that class of men and bring them to the side of those who treat it as a wrong then there will soon be an end of it and that end will be its ultimate extinction whenever the issue can be distinctly made and all extraneous matter thrown out so that men can fairly see the real difference between the parties this controversy will soon be settled and it will be done peaceably too there will be no war no violence it will be placed again where the wisest and best men of the world placed it brooks of south carolina once declared that when this constitution was framed its framers did not look to the institution existing until this day when he said this i think he stated a fact that is fully borne out by the history of the times but he also said they were better and wiser men than the men of these days yet the men of these days had experience which they had not and by the invention of the cottongin it became a necessity in this country that slavery should be perpetual i now say that willingly or unwillinglypurposely or without purpose judge douglas has been the most prominent instrument in changing the position of the institution of slaverywhich the fathers of the government expected to come to an end ere this and putting it upon brookss cottongin basis placing it where he openly confesses he has no desire there shall ever be an end of it  i understand i have ten minutes yet i will employ it in saying something about this argument judge douglas uses while he sustains the dred scott decision that the people of the territories can still somehow exclude slavery the first thing i ask attention to is the fact that judge douglas constantly said before the decision that whether they could or not was a question for the supreme court but after the court had made the decision he virtually says it is not a question for the supreme court but for the people and how is it he tells us they can exclude it he says it needs police regulations and that admits of unfriendly legislation although it is a right established by the constitution of the united states to take a slave into a territory of the united states and hold him as property yet unless the territorial legislature will give friendly legislation and more especially if they adopt unfriendly legislation they can practically exclude him now without meeting this proposition as a matter of fact i pass to consider the real constitutional obligation let me take the gentleman who looks me in the face before me and let us suppose that he is a member of the territorial legislature the first thing he will do will be to swear that he will support the constitution of the united states his neighbor by his side in the territory has slaves and needs territorial legislation to enable him to enjoy that constitutional right can he withhold the legislation which his neighbor needs for the enjoyment of a right which is fixed in his favor in the constitution of the united states which he has sworn to support can he withhold it without violating his oath and more especially can he pass unfriendly legislation to violate his oath why this is a monstrous sort of talk about the constitution of the united states there has never been as outlandish or lawless a doctrine from the mouth of any respectable man on earth i do not believe it is a constitutional right to hold slaves in a territory of the united states i believe the decision was improperly made and i go for reversing it judge douglas is furious against those who go for reversing a decision but he is for legislating it out of all force while the law itself stands i repeat that there has never been so monstrous a doctrine uttered from the mouth of a respectable man  i suppose most of us i know it of myself believe that the people of the southern states are entitled to a congressional fugitive slave lawthat is a right fixed in the constitution but it cannot be made available to them without congressional legislation in the judges language it is a barren right which needs legislation before it can become efficient and valuable to the persons to whom it is guaranteed and as the right is constitutional i agree that the legislation shall be granted to it and that not that we like the institution of slavery we profess to have no taste for running and catching niggers at least i profess no taste for that job at all why then do i yield support to a fugitive slave law because i do not understand that the constitution which guarantees that right can be supported without it and if i believed that the right to hold a slave in a territory was equally fixed in the constitution with the right to reclaim fugitives i should be bound to give it the legislation necessary to support it i say that no man can deny his obligation to give the necessary legislation to support slavery in a territory who believes it is a constitutional right to have it there no man can who does not give the abolitionists an argument to deny the obligation enjoined by the constitution to enact a fugitive state law try it now it is the strongest abolition argument ever made i say if that dred scott decision is correct then the right to hold slaves in a territory is equally a constitutional right with the right of a slaveholder to have his runaway returned no one can show the distinction between them the one is express so that we cannot deny it the other is construed to be in the constitution so that he who believes the decision to be correct believes in the right and the man who argues that by unfriendly legislation in spite of that constitutional right slavery may be driven from the territories cannot avoid furnishing an argument by which abolitionists may deny the obligation to return fugitives and claim the power to pass laws unfriendly to the right of the slaveholder to reclaim his fugitive i do not know how such an arguement may strike a popular assembly like this but i defy anybody to go before a body of men whose minds are educated to estimating evidence and reasoning and show that there is an iota of difference between the constitutional right to reclaim a fugitive and the constitutional right to hold a slave in a territory provided this dred scott decision is correct i defy any man to make an argument that will justify unfriendly legislation to deprive a slaveholder of his right to hold his slave in a territory that will not equally in all its length breadth and thickness furnish an argument for nullifying the fugitive slave law why there is not such an abolitionist in the nation as douglas after all such an abolitionist in the nation as douglas after all
