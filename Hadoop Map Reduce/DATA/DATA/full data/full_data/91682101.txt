days i had been cooling my heels about the vatican vexed by suspense it fretted me that i should have been so lightly dealt with after i had discharged the mission that had brought me all the way from pesaro and i wondered how long it might be ere his most illustrious excellency the cardinal of valencia might see fit to offer me the honourable employment with which madonna lucrezia had promised me that he would reward the service i had rendered the house of borgia by my journey  three days were sped yet nought had happened to signify that things would shape the course by me so ardently desired that the means would be afforded me of mending my miserable ways and repairing the wreck my life had suffered on the shoals of fate true i had been housed and fed and the comforts of indolence had been mine but for the rest i was still clothed in the livery of folly which i had worn on my arrival and wherever i might roam there followed ever at my heels a crowd of underlings seeking to have their tedium lightened by jests and capers and voting mewhen their hopes proved barrenthe sorriest fool that had ever worn the motley  on that third day i speak of my patience tried to its last strand i had beaten a lacquey with my hands and fled from the cursed gibes his fellows aimed at me out into the misty gardens and the chill january air whose sting i could perhaps the better disregard by virtue of the heat of indignation that consumed me was it ever to be so with me could nothing lift the curse of folly from me that i must ever be a fool and worse the sport of other fools  it was there on one of the terraces crowning the splendid heights above immortal rome that messer gianluca found me he greeted me courteously i answered with a snarl deeming him come to pursue the plaguing from which i had fled  his most illustrious excellency the cardinal of valencia is asking for you messer boccadoro he announced and so despairing had been my mood of ever hearing such a summons that for a moment i accounted it some fresh jest of theirs but the gravity of his fat countenance reassured me  let us go then i answered with alacrity and so confident was i that the interview to which he bade me was the first step along the road to better fortune that i permitted myself a momentary return to the fools estate from which i thought myself on the point of being for ever freed  i shall use the interview to induce his excellency to submit a tenth beatitude to the approval of our holy father blessed are the bearers of good tidings come on messer the seneschal  i led the way in my impatience forgetful of his great paunch and little legs so that he was sorely tried to keep pace with me yet who would not have been in haste urged by such a spur as had i here then was the end of my shameful travesty tomorrow a soldiers harness should replace the motley of a jester the name by which i should be known again to men would be that of lazzaro biancomonte and no longer boccadorothe fool of the golden mouth  thus much had madonna lucrezias promises led me to expect and it was with a soul full of joyous expectation that i entered the great mans closet  he received me in a manner calculated to set me at my ease and yet there was about him a something that overawed me cesare borgia cardinal of valencia was then in his twentythird year for all that there hung about him the semblance of a greater age just as his cardinalitial robes lent him the appearance of a height far above the middle stature that was his own his face was pale and framed in a silky auburn beard his nose was aquiline and strong his eyes the keenest that i have ever seen his forehead lofty and intelligent he seemed pervaded by an air of feverish restlessness something surpassing the vivida vis animi something that marked him to discerning eyes for a man of incessant action of body and of mind  my sister tells me he said in greeting that you are willing to take service under me messer biancomonte  such was the hope that guided me to rome most excellent i answered him  surprise flashed into his eyes and was gone as quickly as it had come his thin lips parted in a smile whose meaning was inscrutable  as some reward for the safe delivery of the letter you brought me from her he questioned mildly  precisely illustrious i answered in all frankness  his open hand smote the table of woodmosaics at which he sat  praised be heaven he cried you seem to promise that i shall have in you a follower who deals in truth  could your excellency to whom my real name is known expect ought else of one who bears ithowever unworthily  there was amusement in his glance  can you still swagger it after having worn that livery for three years he asked and his lean forefinger pointed at my hideous motley of red and black and yellow  i flushed and hung my head andas if to mock that very expression of my shamethe bells on my cap gave forth a silvery tinkle at the movement  excellency spare me i murmured did you know all my miserable story you would be merciful did you know with what joy i turned my back on the court of pesaro  aye he broke in mockingly when giovanni sforza threatened to have you hanged for the overboldness of your tongue not until then did it occur to you to turn from the shameful life in which the best years of your manhood were being wasted there just now i commended your truthfulness but the truth that dwells in you is no more it seems than the truth we may look for in the mouth of folly at heart i fear you are a hypocrite messer biancomonte the worst form of hypocritea hypocrite to your own self  did your excellency know all i cried  i know enough he answered with stern sorrow enough to make me marvel that the son of ettore biancomonte of biancomonte should play the fool to costanzo sforza lord of pesaro oh you will tell me that you went there for revenge to seek to right the wrong his father did your father  it was it was i cried with heated vehemence be flames everlasting the dwelling of my soul if any other motive drove me to this shameful trade  there was a pause his beautiful eyes flamed with a sudden light as they rested on me then the lids drooped demurely and he drew a deep breath but when he spoke there was scorn in his voice  and no doubt it was that same motive kept you there at peace for three whole years in slothful ease the motleyed fool jesting and capering for his enemys delectationyou a man with the knightly memory of your foullywronged parent to cry hourly shame upon you no doubt you lacked the opportunity to bring the tyrant to account or was it that you were content to let him make a mock of you so long as he housed and fed you and clothed you in your garish livery of shame  spare me excellency i cried again of your charity let my past be done with when he drove me forth with threats of hanging from which your gracious sister saved me i turned my steps to rome at her bidding to  to find honourable employment at my hands he interrupted quietly then suddenly rising and speaking in a voice of thunderand what then of your revenge he cried  it has been frustrated i answered lamely sufficient do i account the ruin that already i have wrought in my life by the pursuit of that phantom i was trained to arms my lord let me discard for good these tawdry rags and strap a soldiers harness to my back  how came you to journey hither thus he asked suddenly turning the subject  it was madonna lucrezias wish she held that my errand would be safer so for a fool may travel unmolested  he nodded that he understood and paced the chamber with bowed head for a spell there was silence broken only by the soft fall of his slippered feet and the swish of his silken purple at last he paused before me and looked up into my facefor i was a good head taller than he was his fingers combed his auburn beard and his beautiful eyes were full on mine  that was a wise precaution of my sisters he approved i will take a lesson from her in the matter i have employment for you messer biancomonte  i bowed my head in token of my gratitude  you shall find me diligent and faithful my lord i promised him  i know it he sniffed else should i not employ you  he turned from me and stepped back to his table he took up a package fingered it a moment then dropped it again and shot me one of his quiet glances  that is my answer to madonna lucrezias letter he said slowly his voice as smooth as silk and i desire that you shall carry it to pesaro for me and deliver it safely and secretly into her hands  i could do no more than stare at him it seemed as if my mind were stricken numb  well he asked at last and in his voice there was now a suggestion of steel beneath the silk do you hesitate  and if i do i answered suddenly finding my voice i do no more than might a bolder man how can i who am banned by punishment of death contrive to penetrate again into the court of pesaro and reach the lady lucrezia  that is a matter that i shall leave to the shrewd wit which all italy says is the heritage of boccadoro the prince of fools does the task daunt you his glance and voice were alike harsh  in very truth it did and i told him so but in the terms which the shrewd wit he said was mine dictated  i hesitate my lord indeed but more because i fear the frustration of your own endswhatever they may bethan because i dread to earn a broken neck by again adventuring into pesaro would not some other messengerunknown at the court of giovanni sforzabe in better case to acquit himself of such a task  yes if i had one i could trust he answered frankly  i will be open with you biancomonte there are such grave matters at issue there are such secrets confided to that paper that i would not for a kingdom not for our holy fathers triple crown that they should fall into alien hands  he approached me again and his slender hand upon which the sacred amethyst was glowing fell lightly on my shoulder he lowered his voice you are the man the one man in italy whose interests are bound up with mine in this therefore are you the one man to whom i can entrust that package  i i gasped in amazementas well i might for what interests had boccadoro the fool in common with cesare borgia cardinal of valencia  you he answered vehemently you lazzaro biancomonte of biancomonte whose father costanzo of pesaro stripped of his domains the matters in those papers mean the ruin of the lord of pesaro we are all but ripe to strike at him from rome and when we strike he shall be so disfigured by the blow that all italy shall hold its sides to laugh at the sorry figure he will cut i would not say so much to any other living man but you and if i tell it you it is because i need your aid  the lion and mouse i murmured  why yes if you will  and this man is the husband of your sister i exclaimed almost involuntarily  does that imply a doubt of what i have said he flashed his head thrown back his brows drawn suddenly together  no no i hastened to assure him he smiled softly  maddonna lucrezia knows allor nearly all of what else she may need to learn that letter will inform her it is the last thread the last knot needed before we can complete the net in which we are to hold that tyrant now will you bear the letter  would i bear it dear god to achieve the end in view i would have spent my remaining days in motley making sport for grooms and kitchen wenches some such answer did i make him and he smiled his satisfaction  you shall journey as you are he bade me i am guided by my sister assured that the coat of a fool is stouter protection than the best hauberk ever tempered when you have done your errand come you back to me and you shall have employment better suited to one who bears the name of biancomonte  you may depend upon me in this my lord i promised gravely i shall not fail you  it is well said he and those wondrous eyes of his rested again upon my face how soon can you set out  at once my lord does not the byword say that a fool makes little preparation for a journey  he nodded and moved to a coffer a beautiful piece of venetian work in ultramarine and gold from this he took a heavy bag  there said he you will find the best of all travelling companions i thanked him and set the bag on the crook of my left arm and by its weight i knew how true he was to the notorious splendour of his race and this said he is a talisman that may serve to help you out of any evil plight and open many a door that you may find locked and he handed me a signet ring on which was graven the steer that is the emblem of the house of borgia  he raised aloft the hand on which was glistening the sacred amethysttwo fingers crooked and two erect wondering what this should mean i stared inquiry  kneel he bade me and realising what he would be about i sank on to my knees whilst he murmured the apostolic benediction over my bowed head the rushes of the floor were the only witnesses of the smile that crept to my lips at this sudden assumption of his churchly office by that most worldly prince     chapter ii the liveries of santafior   such preparations as i had to make were soon complete  although it was agreed that i was to travel in the motley yet in my latelyborn shame of that apparel i decided that i would conceal it as best might be revealing it only should the need arise moreover it was incumbent that i should afford myself more protection against the inclement january night than that of my foliated cape my crested cap and silken hose so a black cloak heavy and ample a broadbrimmed hat and a pair of riding boots of untanned leather were my further equipment in the lining of one of those boots i concealed the lord cesares package his moneysome twenty ducatsi carried in a belt about my waist and his ring i set boldly on my finger  few moments did it need me to make ready yet fewer it seems would the borgia impatience have had me employ for scarce was i booted when someone knocked at my door i opened and there entered a very mountain of a man whose corselet flashed back the yellow light of my tapers as might have done a mirror and whose harsh voice barked out to ask if i was ready  i had had some former acquaintance with this fellow having first met him during the previous year on the occasion of the court of pesaros sojourn at rome his name was ramiro del orca and throughout the papal army it stood synonymous for masterfulness and grim brutality he was as i have said an enormous man of prodigious bodily strength heavy yet of good proportions of his face one gathered the impression of a blazing furnace his cheeks and nose were of a vivid red and still more fiery was the hair now hidden neath his morion and the beard that tapered to a daggers point his very eyes kept tune with the red harmony of his ferocious countenance for the whites were ever bloodshot as a drunkardswhich with no want of truth men said he was  come grunted that fiery selfsufficient vassal be stirring sir fool i have orders to see you to the gates there is a horse ready saddled for you it is the lord cardinals parting gift resolve me now which will be the greater assthe one that rides or the one that is ridden  o monstrous riddle i exclaimed as i took up my cloak and hat who am i that i should solve it  it baffles you sir fool quoth he  in very truth it does i ruefully wagged my head so that my bells set up a jangle for the rider is a man and the ridden a horse but i pursued in that backbiting strain which is the very essence of the jesters wit were you to make a trio of us including messer ramiro del orca captain in the army of his holiness no doubt would then afflict me i should never hesitate which of the three to pronounce the ass  what shall that mean he asked with darkening brows  that its meaning proves obscure to you confirms the verdict i was hinting at i taunted him for asses are notoriously of dull perceptions then stepping forward briskly come sir i sharply urged him whilst we engage upon this pretty play of wit his excellencys business waits which is an ill thing where is this horse you spoke of  he showed me his strong white teeth in a very evil smile  were it not for that same business he began  you would do fine things i am assured i interrupted him  would i not he snarled by the host i should be wringing your pert neck or laying bare your bones with a thong of bullockhide you ill conditioned fool  i looked at him with pleasant smiling eyes  you confirm the opinion that is popularly held of you said i  what may that be quoth he his eyes very evil in rome im told they call you hangman  he growled in his throat like an angered cur and his hands were jerked to the level of his breast the fingers bending talonwise  body of god he muttered fiercely ill teach one fool at least  let us cease these pleasantries i entreat you i laughed saints defend me if your mood incline to raillery youll find your match in some lad of the stables as for me i have not the time had i the will to engage you further let me remind you that i would be gone  the reminder was welltimed he bethought him of the journey i must go on which he was charged to see me safely started  come on then he growled in a white heat of passion that was only curbed by the consideration of that slender pale young cardinal his master  still some of his rage he vented in roughly taking me by the collar of my doublet and dragging the almost headlong from the room and so adown a flight of steps out into the courtyard meet treatment for a foola treatment to which time might have inured me for had i not for three years already been exposed to rough usage of this kind at the hands of every man above the rank of groom and had i once rebelled in act as i did in soul and used the strength wherewith god endowed me to punish my illusers a whip would have reminded me into what sorry slavery had i sold myself when i put on the motley  it had been snowing for the past hour and the ground was white in the courtyard when we descended  at our appearance there was a movement of servingmen and a fall of hoofs muffled by the snow some held torches that cast a ruddy glare upon the allencompassing whiteness and a groom was leading forward the horse that was destined to bear me i donned my broadbrimmed hat and wrapped my cloak about me some murmurs of farewell caught my ears from those minions with whom i had herded during my three days at the vatican then messer del orca thrust me forward  mount fool and be off he rasped  i mounted and turned to him he was a surly dog if ever surly dog wore human shape and the shape was the only human thing about captain ramiro  brother farewell i simpered  no brother of yours fool snarled he  truemy cousin only the fool of art is no brother to the fool of nature  a whip he roared to his grooms fetch me a whip  i left him calling for it as i urged my nag across the snow and over the narrow drawbridge beyond i stayed a moment to look over my shoulder they stood gazing after me a group of some halfdozen men looking black against the whiteness of the ground behind them rose the brown walls of the rocca illumined by the flare of torches from which the smell of rosin reached my nostrils as i paused i waved my hat to them in token of farewell and digging my spurless heels into the flanks of my horse i ambled down through the biting wind and drifting snow into the town  the streets were deserted and dark save for the ray that here fell from a window and there stole through the chink of a door to glow upon the snow in earnest of the snug warmth within silence reigned broken only by the moan of the wind under the eaves for although it was no more than approaching the second hour of night yet who but the wight whom necessity compelled would be abroad in such weather  all night i rode despite that weathers foulnessa foulness that might have given pause to one whose haste to bear a letter was less attuned to his own supreme desires  betimes next morning i paused at a small locanda on the road to magliano and there i broke my fast and took some rest my horse had suffered by the journey more than had i and i would have taken a fresh one at magliano but there was none to be hadso they told methis side of narni wherefore i was forced to set out once more upon that poor jaded beast that had carried me all night  it was high noon when i came at last to narni the last league of the journey accomplished at a walk for my nag could go no faster here i paused to dine but here again they told me that no horses might be had and so leading by the bridle the animal i dared no longer ride lest i should kill it outright i entered the territory of urbino on foot and trudged wearily amain through the snow that was some inches deep by now in this miserable fashion i covered the seven leagues or so to spoleto where i arrived exhausted as night was falling  there at the osteria del sole i supped and lay i found a company of gentlemen in the commonroom who upon espying my motleywhen i had thrown off my sodden cloak and hatpressed me willynilly into amusing them and so i spent the night at my fools trade giving them drolleries from the works of boccacci and sacchettithe hornbooks of all jesters  i obtained a fresh horse next morning and i set out betimes intending to travel with a better speed the snow was thick and soft at first but as i approached the hills it grew more crisp overhead the sky was of an unbroken blue and for all that the air was sharp there was warmth in the sunshine all day i rode hard and never rested until towards nightfall i found myself on the spurs of the apennines in the neighborhood of gualdo the better half of my journey wellaccomplished the weather had changed again at sunset it was snowing anew and the north wind was howling like a choir of the damned  before me gleamed the lights of a little wayside tavern and since it might suit me better to lie there than to journey on to gualdo i drew rein before that humble door and got down from my wearied horse despite the early hour the door was already barred for the bedding of travellers formed no part of the traffic of so lowly a house as this nameless wayside wineshop theirs was a trade that ended with the daylight nevertheless i was assured they could be made to find me a rag of straw to lie on and so i knocked boldly with my whip  the taverner who opened for me and stood a moment surveying me by the light of the torch he held aloft was a slim mildmannered man not overclean behind him surged the figure of his wife just such a woman as you might look to find the mate of such a man broad and tall of frame and most scurvily crossgrained of face it may well be that had he bidden me welcome she had driven me back into the night but since he made some demur when i asked for lodging and protested that in his house was but accommodation too rude to offer my magnificence the woman thrust him aside and loudly bade me enter  i obeyed her readily hat on head and cloak about me lest my interests should suffer were my trade disclosed i bade the man see to my horse and then escorted by the woman i made my way to the single room above which in obedience to my demand she made haste to set at my convenience  it was an evilsmelling squalid hole a bed of wattles in a corner and in the centre a greasy table with a threelegged stool and a crazy chair beside it the floor was black with age and filth and broken everywhere by ratholes she set her noisome smoking oil lamp on the table and with some apology for the rudeness of the chamber she asked in tones almost defiant if my excellency would be content  perforce said i ungraciously perceiving surliness to be the key to the respect of such a creature a king might thank heaven for a kennel on such a night as this  she bent her back in a clumsy bow and with a growing humility wondered had i supped i had not but sooner would i have starved than have been poisoned by such foulnesses as they might have set before me so i answered her that all i needed was a cup of wine  when she had brought me that and at last i was alone i closed the door it had no lock nor any sort of fastening so i set the three legged stool against it that it might give me warning of intrusion next i threw off my cloak and hat and boots and all dressed as i was i flung myself upon my miserable couch but jaded though i might be it was not yet my intent to sleep now that the half of my journey was accomplished i found myself beset by doubts which had not before assailed me touching the manner in which this mission of mine was to be accomplished it would prove no easy thing for me to penetrate unnoticed into the town of pesaro much less into the sforza court where for three years i had pursued my fools trade there was scarce a man a woman or a child in the entire domains of giovanni sforza to whom boccadoro the fool was not known and many a villano who had never noticed the features of the lord of pesaro could have told you the very colour of his jesters eyes which after all is no strange thing forsad reflectionin a world in which wisdom may be overlooked folly goes never disregarded  the garments i wore might be well enough to journey in but if i would gain the presence of lucrezia borgia i must see that i arrived in others and then my thoughts wandered into speculation what might be this momentous letter that i carried what was this secret traffic twixt cesare borgia and his sister since cesare had said that it meant the ruin of giovanni sforzaa ruin so utter so complete and humiliating that it must provoke the scornful mirth of all italythe knowledge of it must soon be mine meanwhile i was an agent of that ruin dear god how that reflection warmed me what joy i took in the thought that though he knew it not nor could come to know it i lazzaro biancomonte whom he had abused and whose spirit he had brokenwas become a tool to expedite the work of abasement and destruction that was ripening for him and realizing all this that letter i vowed to heaven i would carry suffering no obstacle to daunt me suffering nothing to turn me from my path  and then another voice seemed to arise within me to cry out impatiently yes yes but how  i rose and approaching the table i took up the jug of wine and poured myself a draught i drank it off and cast the dregs at an inquisitive rat that had thrust its head above the boards then i quenched the light and flung myself once more upon my bed in the hope that darkness would prove a stimulant to thought and bring me to the solution i was seeking it brought me sleep instead unconsciously i sank to it my riddle all unsolved  i did not wake until the pale sun of that january morning was drawing the pattern of my lattice on the ceiling the stormy night had been succeeded by a calm and sunlit day and by its light the place wore a more loathsome look than it had done last night so that at the very sight of it i leapt from my couch and grew eager to be gone i set a ducat on the table and going to the door i called my hostess the stairs creaked presently neath her portentous weight and panting slightly she stood before me  at sight of me for i was without my cloak and my motley was revealed in the cold morning light she cried out in amazement first and then in ragedeeming me one of those parasites who tramp the world in the garb of folly seeking here a dinner there a bed in exchange for some scurvy tumbling or some witless jests  ossa di cristo was her cry have i housed a fool  if i am the first you have housed your tumbling ruin of a tavern has been a singularly choice resort woman  would you woman me she stormed  why no said i politely i was at fault ill keep the title for your husbandgod help him  she smiled grimly  and are these she asked with a ferocious sarcasm the jests with which you pay the score  jests quoth i score pish more eyes less tongue would more befit a hostess who has never housed a fool and with a splendid gesture i pointed to the ducat gleaming on the table at sight of the gold her eyes grew big with greed  my master she began and coming forward took the piece in her hand to assure herself that she was not the dupe of magic a fool with gold she marvelled  is a shame to his calling i acknowledged thenget me a needle and a length of thread said i she scuttled off to do my bidding like nothing so much as one of the rats that tenanted her unclean sty she was back in a moment all servility and wondering whether there was a rent about me she might make bold to stitch what a key to courtesy is gold my masters i drove her out and eager to conciliate me she went at once  with my own hands i effected in my doublet the slight repair of which it stood in need then i donned my hat and cloak on shoulder made my way below calling for my horse as i descended  i scorned the wine they proffered me ere i departed that last nights draught had quenched my thirst for ever of such grapejuice as it was theirs to tender i urged the taverner to hasten with my horse and stood waiting in the squalid commonroom my mind divided twixt impatience to resume the road to pesaro and fresh speculations upon the means i was to adopt to enter it and yet save my neckfor this was now become an obsessing problem  as i stood waiting there broke upon my ears the sound of an approaching cavalcade the noise of voices and the soft fall of hoofs upon the thick snow carpet the company halted at the door and a loud gruff voice was raised to cry  locandiere afoot sluggard  i stepped to the door with very natural curiosity a company of four mounted men escorting a mulelitter the curtains of which were drawn so that nothing might be seen of him or her that rode within grooms were those four as all the world might see at the first glance and the livery they wore was that of the noble house of santafiorthe holy white flower of the quince being embroidered on the breast of their gabardines  they bore upon them such signs of hard and hasty travelling that it was soon guessed they had spent the night in the saddle their horses were in a foam of sweat and the men themselves were splashed with mud from foot to cap  even as i was going forward to regard them the taverner appeared leading my horse by the bridle now at an inn the traveller that arrives is ever of more importance than he that departs at sight of those horsemen the taverner forgot my impatience for he paused to bow in welcome to the one that seemed the leader  most magnificent said he to that liveried hind command me  we need a guide the fellow answered with an ill grace  a guide illustrious quoth the host a guide  i said a guide fool answered him the groom heard you never of such animals we need a man who knows the hills to lead us by the shortest road to cagli  the taverner shook his grey head stupidly he bowed again until i fancied i could hear the creak of his old joints  here be no guides magnificent he deplored perhaps at gualdo  animal was the retortfor true courtesy commend me to a lacqueyit is not our wish to pursue the road as far as gualdo else had we not stopped at this kennel of yours  i scarce know what it can have been that moved me to act as i then did for in the truth the manner of that rascal of a groom was little prepossessing and his master i doubted could be little better that he left the fellow to hector it thus over that wretched tavern oaf but i stepped forward  did you say that you were journeying to cagli questioned i  he eyed me sourly suspicion writ athwart his round illfavoured face but my motley was hidden from his sight my cloak my hat and boots allowed naught of my true condition to appear and might as well have covered a lordling as a jester yet his inveterate surliness the rascal could not wholly conquer  what may be the purpose of your question he growled  to serve your master whoever he may be i answered him serenely although it is a service i do not press upon him i too am journeying to cagli and like yourselves i am in haste and go the shorter way across the hills with which i am well acquainted if it so please you to follow me your need of a guide may thus be satisfied  it was the tone to take if i would be respected had i proposed that we should journey in company i should not have earned me the half of the deference which was accorded to my haughtily granted leave that they might follow me if they so chose  with marked submission did he give me thanks in his masters name  i mounted and set out and at my heels came now the litter and its escort thus did we quit the plain and breast the slopes where the snow grew deeper and firmer underfoot as we advanced and as i went still plaguing my mind to devise a means by which i might penetrate to the court of pesaro little did i dream that the matter was being solved for methe solution having begun with my offer to guide that company across the hills     chapter iii madonna paola   we gained the heights in the forenoon and there we dismounted and paused awhile to breathe our horses ere we took the path that was to lead us down to cagli the air was sharp and cold for all that overhead was spread a cloudless cobalt dome of sky and the sun poured down its light upon the wide expanse of snowclad earth of a whiteness so dazzling as to be hurtful to the sight  hitherto i had ridden stolidly ahead as unheeding of that following company as if i had been unconscious of its existence but now that we paused their fat whitefaced leader whose name was giacopo approached me and sought to draw me into conversation i yielded readily enough for i scented a mystery about that closelycurtained litter and mysteries are ever provoking to such a mind as mine for all that it might profit me naught to learn who rode there and why with all this haste yet these were matters i confess on which my curiosity was aroused  are you journeying beyond cagli i asked him presently in an idle tone  he cocked his head and eyed me aslant the suspicion in his eyes confirming the existence of the mystery i scented  yes he answered after a pause we hope to reach urbino before night and you are you journeying far  that far at least i answered him emulating the caution he had shown  and then ere more might pass between us the leather curtains of the litter were sharply drawn aside at the sound i turned my head and so far was the vision different from that whichfor no reason that i can givei had expected that i was stricken with surprise and wonder a ladya very child indeedhad leapt nimbly to the ground ere any of those grooms could offer her assistance  she was i thought the most beautiful woman that i had ever seen and to one who had read the famous work of messer firenzuola on feminine beauty it might seem at first that here stood the incarnation of that writers catalogue of womanly perfections she was of a good shape and stature despite her tender years her face was oval delicately featured and of an ivory pallor her eyesblue as the heavens overheadwere not of the colour most approved by firenzuola nor was her hair of the golden brown which that arbiter commends had firenzuola seen her it may well be that he had altered or modified his views she was sumptuously arrayed in a loosesleeved camorra of grey velvet that was heavy with costly furs above the lenza of fine linen on her head gleamed the gold thread of a jewelled net and at her waist a girdle of surpassing richness all set with gems glowed like a thing of fire in the bright sunshine  she took a deep breath of the sharp invigorating air then looked about her and espying me in conversation with giacopo she approached us across the gleaming snow  is this she inquired and her sweet melodious voice was a perfect match to the graceful charm of her whole presence the traveller who so kindly consented to fill for us the office of a guide  giacopo answered briefly that i was that man  i am in your debt sir she protested with an odd earnestness you do not know how great a service you have rendered me but if at any time paola sforza di santafior may be able to discharge this obligation you shall find me very willing  whitefaced blackbrowed giacopo scowled at this proclamation of her identity  i made her a low bow and answered coldly brusquely almost for i hated the very name of sforza and every living thing that bore it  madonna you overrate my service it so chanced that i was travelling this way  she looked more closely at me as if she would have sought the reason of my churlish tone and i was strangely thankful that she could not see the motley worn by the muffled stranger who confronted her no doubt she accounted me a clown whose nature inclined to surliness and so she turned away telling giacopo that as soon as the horses were breathed they might push on  we must rest them yet awhile madonna answered he if they are to carry us as far as cagli heaven send that we may obtain fresh cattle there else is all lost  her frown proclaimed how much his words displeased her  you forget that if there are no horses for us neither are there any for those others and she waved her hand towards the valley below and the road by which we had come from this and from what was said i gathered that they were a party of fugitives with pursuers at their heels  they have a warrant which we have not was giacopos answer gloomily delivered and they will seize cattle where they can find it  with a little gesture of impatience more at his fears than at the peril that aroused them she moved away towards her litter  your horse would be better for the loan of your cloak sir stranger said giacopo to me  i knew him to be right but shrugged my shoulders  better the horse should die of cold than i i answered gruffly and turning from him i set myself to pace the snow and stir the blood that was chilling in my veins  there was a beauty in the white sunlit landscape spread before me that compelled my glance to some it might compare but ill with the luxuriant splendour that is of the vernal season but to me there was a wondrously impressive charm about that solemn silent virginal expanse of snow expressionless as the sphinx and imposing and majestic by virtue of that very lack of expression from fabriano at our feet was spread to the east the broad plain that lies twixt the esino and the masone as far as mount comero which in the distance lifted its round shoulder from the haze of sea to the west the country lay under the same windingsheet of snow as far as eye might range to the towers of distant perugia to the lake trasimenoa silver sheen that broke the white monotonyto etruscan cortona perched like an eyrie on its mountain top and to the line of tuscan hills like heavy lowlying clouds upon the blue horizon  lost was i in the contemplation of that scene when a cry succeeded by a volley of horrid blasphemy drew my attention of a sudden to my companions they stood grouped together and their eyes were on the road by which we had scaled those heights their first expression of loud astonishment had been succeeded by an utter silence i stepped forward to command a better view of what they contemplated and in the plain below midway between narni and the slopes a mile or so behind us i caught a glitter as of a hundred mirrors in the sunshine a company of some dozen menatarms it was riding briskly along the tracks we had left behind us in the snow could these be the pursuers  even as i formed the question in my mind the ladys silvery voice behind me put it into words she had drawn aside the curtains of her litter and she was leaning out her eyes upon those dancing points of brilliance  madonna cried one of her grooms in a quaver of alarm they are borgia soldiers  your fear is father to that opinion she answered scornfully how can you descry it at this distance  now either god had given that knave an eagles sight or else as she suggested fear spurred his imagination and begot his certainty of what he thought he saw  the leaders bannerol bears the device of a red bull he answered promptly  i thought she paled a little and her brows contracted  in gods name let us get forward then cried giacopo orsu to horse knaves  no second bidding did they need in the twinkling of an eye they were in the saddle and one of them had caught the bridle of the leading mule of the litter giacopo called to me to lead the way with him with no more ceremony than if i had been one of themselves but i made no ado a chase is an interesting business whatever your point of view and if a greater safety lies with the hunter there is a keener excitement with the hunted  down that steep and slippery hillside we blundered making for cagli at a pace in which there lay a myriadfold more danger than could menace us from any party of pursuers but fear was spur and whip to the unreasoning minds of those poltroons and so from the danger behind us we fled and courted a more deadly and certain peril in the fleeing at first i sought to remonstrate with giacopo but he was deaf to the wisdom that i spoke he turned upon me a face which terror had rendered whiter than its natural habit white as the egg of a duck with a hint of blue or green behind it i had besides an ugly impression of teeth and eyeballs  death is behind us sir he snarled let us get on  death is more assuredly before you i answered grimly if you will court it go your way as for me i am overyoung to break my neck and be left on the mountainside to fatten crows i shall follow at my leisure  gesu he cried through chattering teeth are you a coward then  the taunt would have angered me had his condition been other than it was but coming from one so possessed of the devil of terror it did no more than provoke my mirth  come on then valiant runagate i laughed at him  and on we went our horses now plunging now sliding down yard upon yard of moving snow snorting and trembling more reasoning far than these rational animals that bestrode them twice did it chance that a man was flung from his saddle yet i know not what prayers madonna may have been uttering in her litter to obtain for us the miracle of reaching the plain with never so much as a broken bone  thus far had we come but no farther it seemed was it possible to go the horses which by dint of slipping and sliding had encompassed the descent at a good pace were so winded that we could get no more than an amble out of them saving mine which was tolerably fresh  at this a new terror assailed the timorous giacopo his head was ever turned to look behindunfailing index of a frightened spirit his eyes were ever on the crest of the hills expecting at every moment to behold the flash of the pursuers steel the end soon followed he drew rein and called a halt sullenly sitting his horse like a man deprived of witwhich is to pay him the compliment of supposing that he ever had wit to be deprived of  instantly the curtainrings rasped and madonna paolas head appeared her voice inquiring the reason of this fresh delay  sullenly giacopo moved his horse nearer and sullenly he answered her  madonna our horses are done it is useless to go farther  useless she cried and i had an instance of how sharply could ring the voice that i had heard so gentle of what do you talk you knave ride on at once  it is vain to ride on he answered obdurately insolence rising in his voice another halfleagueanother league at most and we are taken  cagli is less than a league distant she reminded him once there we can obtain fresh horses you will not fail me now giacopo  there will be delays perforce at cagli he reminded her and meanwhile there are these to guide the borgia sbirri and he pointed to the tracks we were leaving in the snow  she turned from him and addressed herself to the other three  you will stand by me my friends she cried giacopo here is a coward but you are better men they stirred and one of them was momentarily moved into a faint semblance of valour  we will go with you madonna he exclaimed let giacopo remain behind if so he will  but giacopo was a very illconditioned rogue neither true himself nor tolerant it seemed of truth in others  you will be hanged for your pains when you are caught he exclaimed as caught you will be and within the hour if you would save your necks stay here and make surrender  his speech was not without effect upon them beholding which madonna leapt from the litter the better to confront them the corners of her sensitive little mouth were quivering now with the emotion that possessed her and on her eyes there was a film of tears  you cowards she blazed at them you hinds that lack the spirit even to run were i asking you to stand and fight in defence of me you could not show yourselves more palsied i was a fool she sobbed stamping her foot so that the snow squelched under it i was a fool to entrust myself to you  madonna answered one of them if flight could still avail us you should not find us stubborn but it were useless i tell you again madonna that when i espied them from the hilltop yonder they were but a halfleague behind soon we shall have them over the mountain and we shall be seen  fool she cried a halfleague behind you say and you forget that we were on the summit and they had yet to scale it if you but press on we shall treble that distance at least ere they begin the descent besides giacopo she added turning again to the leader you may be at fault you may be scared by a shadow you may be wrong in accounting them our pursuers  the man shrugged his shoulders shook his head and grunted  arnaldo there made no mistake he told us what he saw  now heaven help a poor deserted maid who set her trust in curs she exclaimed between grief and anger  i had been no better than those hinds of hers had i remained unmoved i have said that i hated the very name of sforza but what had this tender child to do with my wrongs that she should be brought within the compass of that hatred i had inferred that her pursuers were of the house of borgia and in a flash it came to me that were i so inclined i might prove by virtue of the ring i carried the one man in italy to serve her in this extremity and to be of service to her her winsome beauty had already inflamed me for there was i know not what about this child that seemed to take me in its toils and so wrought upon me that there and then i would have risked my life in her good service oh you may laugh who read indeed deep down in my heart i laughed myself i think at the heroics to which i was yieldingi the fool most base of lacqueysover a damsel of the noble house of santafior it was shame of my motley maybe that caused me to draw my cloak more tightly about me as i urged forward my horse until i had come into their midst  lady said i bluntly and without preamble can i assist you i have inferred your case from what i have overheard  all eyes were on me gaping with surprisehers no less than her grooms  what can you do alone sir she asked her gentle glance upraised to mine  if as i gather your pursuers are servants of the house of borgia i may do something  they are she answered without hesitation some eagerness even investing her tones  it may seem an odd thing that this lady should so readily have taken a stranger into her confidence yet reflect upon the parlous condition in which she found herself deserted by her dispirited grooms her enemies hot upon her heels she was in no case to trifle with assistance or to despise an offer of services however frail it might seem with both hands she clutched at the slender hope i brought her in the hour of her despair  sir she cried if indeed it lies in your power to help me you could not find it in your heart to be sparing of that power did you but know the details of my sorry circumstance  that power madonna it may be that i have said i and at those words of mine her servants seemed to honour me with a greater interest they leaned forward on their horses and eyed me with eyes grown of a sudden hopeful and i continued if you will have utter faith in me i see a way to render doubly certain your escape  she looked up into my face and what she saw there may have reassured her that i promised no more than i could accomplish for the rest she had to choose between trusting me and suffering capture  sir said she i do not know you nor why you should interest yourself in the concerns of a desolated woman but heaven knows i am in no case to stand pondering the aid you offer nor indeed do i doubt the good faith that moves you let me hear sir how you would propose to serve me  whence are you i inquired  from rome she informed me without hesitation to seek at my cousins court of pesaro shelter from a persecution to which the borgia family is submitting me  at her cousins court of pesaro an odd coincidence thisand while i was pondering it it flashed into my mind that by helping her i might assist myself had aught been needed o strengthen my purpose to serve her i had it now  yet said i surprise investing my voice at pesaro there is madonna lucrezia of that same house of borgia  she smiled away the doubt my words implied  madonna lucrezia is my friend said she as sweet and gentle a friend as ever woman had and she will stand by me even against her own family  since she was satisfied of that i waived the point and returned to what was of more immediate interest  and you fled said i with these and i indicated her attendants not content to leave the clearest of tracks behind you in the snow you have had yourself attended by four grooms in the livery of santafior so that by asking a few questions any that were so inclined might follow you with ease  she opened wide her eyes at that oftentimes have i observed that it needs a fool to teach some elementary wisdom to the wise ones of this world i leapt from my saddle and stood in the road beside her the bridle on my arm  listen now madonna if you would make good your escape it first imports that you should rid yourself of this valiant escort separate from it for a little while take you my horseit is a very gentle beast and it wilt carry you with safetyand ride on alone to cagli  alone quoth she in some surprise  why yes i answered gruffly what of that at the inn of the full moon ask for the hostess and tell her that you are to await an escort there begging her meanwhile to place you under her protection she is a worthy soul or else i do not know one and she will befriend you readily but see to it that you tell her nothing of your affairs  and then she inquired eagerly  then wait you there until tonight or even until tomorrow morning for these knaves to rejoin you to the end that you may resume your journey  but we began giacopo scenting his protest i cut him short  you four said i shall escort mefor i shall replace madonna in the litteryou shall escort me towards fabriano thus shall we draw the pursuit upon ourselves and assure your lady a clear road of escape  they swore most roundly and with great circumstance of oaths that they would lend themselves to no such madness and it took me some moments to persuade them that i was possessed of a talisman that should keep us all from harm  were it otherwise dolts do you think i should be eager to go with you would any chance wayfarer so wantonly imperil his neck for the sake of a lady with whom he can scarce be called acquainted  it was an argument that had weight with them as indeed it must have had with the dullest i flashed my ring before their eyes  this escutcheon said i is the shield that shall stand between us and danger from any of the house that bears these arms  thus i convinced and wrought upon them until they were ready to obey methe more ready since any alternative was really to be preferred to their present situation in danger they already stood from those that followed as they well knew and now it seemed to them that by obeying one who was armed with such credentials it might be theirs to escape that danger but even as i was convincing them by the same arguments was i sowing doubts in the ladys subtler mind  you are attached to that house quoth she in accents of mistrust she wanted to say more i saw it in her eyes that she was wondering was there treachery underlying an action so singularly disinterested as to justify suspicion  madonna said i if you would save yourself i implore that you will trust me very soon your pursuers will be appearing on those heights and then your chance of flight will be lost to you i will ask you but this did i propose to betray you into their hands could i have done better than to have left you with your grooms  her face lighted a sunny smile broke on me from her heavenly eyes  i should have thought of that said she and what more she would have added i put off by urging her to mount  sitting the mans saddle as best she mightwell enough indeed to fill us all with surprise and admirationshe took her leave of me with pretty words of thanks which again i interrupted  you have but to follow the road said i and it will bring you straight to cagli the distance is a short league and you should come there safely farewell madonna  may i not know she asked at parting the name of him that has so generously befriended me  i hesitated a second thenthey call me boccadoro answered i  if your mouth be as truly golden as your heart then are you wellnamed said she then gathering her mantle about her and waving me farewell she rode off without so much as a glance at the cowardly hinds who had failed her in the hour of her need  a moment i stood watching her as she cantered away in the sunshine then stepping to the litter i vaulted in  now rogues said i to the escort strike me that road to fabriano  i know you not sir protested giacopo but this i knowthat if you intend us treachery you shall have my knife in your gullet for your pains  fool i scorned him since when has it been worth the while of any man to betray such creatures as are you plague me no more be moving else i leave you to your cowards fate  it was the tone best understood by hinds of their lilylivered quality it quelled their faint spark of mutiny and a moment later one of those knaves had caught the bridle of the leading mule and the litter moved forward whilst giacopo and the others came on behind at as brisk a pace as their weary horses would yield in this guise we took the road south in the direction opposite to that travelled by the lady as we rode i summoned giacopo to my side  take your daggers i bade him and rip me that blazon from your coats see that you leave no sign about you to proclaim you of the house of santafior or all is lost it is a precaution you would have taken earlier if god had given you the wit of a grasshopper  he nodded that he understood my order and scowled his disapproval of my comment on his wit for the rest they did my bidding there and then  having satisfied myself that no betraying sign remained about them i drew the curtains of my litter and reclining there i gave myself up to pondering the manner in which i should greet the borgia sbirri when they overtook me from that i passed on to the contemplation of the position in which i found myself and the thing that i had done and the proportions of the jest that i was perpetrating afforded me no little amusement it was a burla not unworthy the peerless gifts of boccadoro and a fitting one on which to close his wild career of folly for had i not vowed that boccadoro i would be no more once the errand on which i travelled was accomplished by cesare borgias grace i looked to  a sudden jolt brought me back to the immediate present and the realisation that in the last few moments we had increased our pace i put out my head  giacopo i shouted he was at my side in an instant why are we galloping  they are behind he answered and fear was again overspreading his fat face we caught a glimpse of them as we mounted the last hill  you caught a glimpse of whom quoth i  why of the borgia soldiers  animal i answered him what have we to do with them they may have mistaken us for some party of which they are in pursuit but since we are not that party let your jaded beasts travel at a more reasonable speed we do not wish to have the air of fugitives  he understood me and i was obeyed for a halfhour we rode at a more gentle pace that was about the time they took to come up with us still a league or so from fabriano we heard their cantering hoofs crushing the snow and then a loud imperious voice shouting to us a command to stay instantly we brought up in unconcerned obedience and they thundered alongside with cries of triumph at having run their prey to earth  i cast aside my hat and thrust my motleyed head through the curtains with a jangle of bells to inquire into the reason of this halt whom my appearance astounded the morewhether the lacqueys of santafior or the borgia menatarms that now encircled usi cannot guess but in the crowd of faces that confronted me there was not one but wore a look of deep amazement     chapter iv the cozening of ramiro   the cavalcade that had overtaken us proved to number some twenty menatarms whose leader was no less a person than ramiro del orcathat same mountain of a man who had attended my departure from the vatican three nights ago from the circumstance that so important a personage should have been charged with the pursuit of the lady of santafior i inferred that great issues were at stake  he was clad in mail and leather and from his lance fluttered the bannerol bearing the borgia arms which had announced his quality to madonnas servants  at sight of me his bloodshot eyes grew round with wonder and for a little season a deathly calm preceded the thunder of his voice  sainted host he roared at last what trickery may this be and sidling his horse nearer he tore aside the curtains of my litter  out of faces pale as death the craven grooms looked on to behold me reclining there my cloak flung down across my legs to hide my boots and my motley garb of red and black and yellow all revealed i believe their astonishment by far surpassed the captains own  you are choicely met ser ramiro i greeted him then seeing that he only stared and made no shift to speak maybe quoth i youll explain why you detain me i am in haste  explain he thundered sangue di cristo the burden of explaining lies with you what make you here  why answered i in tones of deep astonishment i am about the business of the lord cardinal of valencia our master  davvero he jeered he stretched out a mighty paw and took me by the collar of my doublet now bethink you how you answer me or there will be a fool the less in the world  indeed the world might spare more  he scowled at my pleasantry to him apparently the situation afforded no scope for philosophical reflections  where is the girl he asked abruptly  girl quoth i what girl am i a motherabbess that you should set me such a question  two dark lines showed between his brows his voice quivered with passion  i ask you againwhere is the girl  i laughed like one who is a little wearied by the entertainment provided for him  here be no girls messer del orca i answered him in the same tone nor can i think what this babble of girls portends  my seeming innocence and the assurance with which i maintained the expression of it whispered a doubt into his mind he released me and turned upon his men a baffled look in his eyes  was not this the party he inquired ferociously have you misled me beasts  it seemed the party illustrious answered one of them  do you dare tell me that it seemed he roared seeking to father upon them the blunder he was beginning to fear that he had made butwhat is the livery of these knaves  they wear none someone answered him and at that answer he seemed to turn limp and lose his fierce assurance  then he bridled afresh  yet the party ill swear is this he insisted and turning once more to me explain animal he bade me in terrifying tones explain or by the host be you ignorant or not ill have you hanged  i accounted it high time to take another tone with him hanging was a discomfort i was never less minded to suffer  draw nearer fool said i contemptuously and at the epithet so greatly did my audacity amaze him he mildly did my bidding  i know not what doubts are battling in your thick head sir captain i pursued but this i knowthat if you persist in hindering me or commit the egregious folly of offering me violence you will answer for it hereafter to the lord cardinal of valencia  i am going upon a secret missionand here i sank my voice to a whisper for his ears alonein the service of the house that hires you as for yourself you might easily have inferred behold and i revealed my ring detain me longer at your peril  he must have had some notion of the fact that i was journeying in cesare borgias service and this coupled with the sight of that talisman effected in his manner a swift and wholesome change had i arrayed in the panoply of mother church defied the devil my victory could not have been more complete  he looked about him like a man whose wits have been scattered suddenly to the four winds of heaven  but this litter he mumbled riveting his dazed eyes upon me and these four knaves  tell me i questioned with sudden earnestness are you in quest of just such a party  aye that i am he answered sharply intelligence returning to his glance inquiry burning in it  and would the men peradventure be wearing the livery of the house of santafior  his quick assent came almost choked in a company of oaths  why then if that be your quarry you are but wasting time such a party passed us at the gallop about an hour ago it would be an hour would it not giacopo  i should say an hour answered the lacquey dully  in what direction came ramiros frenzied question he doubted me no longer  in the direction of fabriano i should say i answered although it may well be that they were making for sinigaglia the road branches farther on  he waited for no more without word of thanks for the priceless information i had given him he wheeled his horse and shouted a hoarse command to his followers a moment later and they were cantering past us the snow flying beneath their hoofs within five minutes the last of them had vanished round an angle of the road and the only indication of the halt they had made was the broad path of dirty brown where their horses had crushed the snow  i have been an actor in few more entertaining comedies than the cozening of ser ramiro and a witness of nothing that afforded me at once so much relief and relish as his abrupt departure i sank back on the cushions of my litter and gave myself over to a burst of fullsouled laughter which was interrupted ere it was half done by giacopo who had dismounted and approached me  you have fooled us finely said he with venom  i quenched my laughter to regard him of what did he babble was he and were his fellows too so ungrateful as to bear a grudge against the man who had saved them  you have fooled us finely he insisted in a louder voice  that knave is my trade said i but it rather seems to me that it was messer ramiro del orca whom i fooled  aye he answered querulously but what when he discerns how you have played upon him what when he discovers the trick by which you have thrown him off the scent what when he returns  spare me i begged i am but indifferently skilful at conjecture  nay but you shall answer me he cried livid with a passion that my bantering tone had quickened  can it be that you are indeed curious to know what will befall when he returns i questioned meekly  i am he snorted with an angry twist of the lips  it should be easy to gratify the morbid spirit of curiosity that actuates you remain here and await his return thus shall you learn  that will not i he vowed  nor i nor i nor i chorused his followers  then why plague me with unprofitable questions what concern is it of ours how messer del orca shall vent his wrath when he is disillusioned your duty now is to rejoin your mistress ride hard for cagli seek her at the sign of the full moon and then away for pesaro if you are brisk you will gain the shelter of the lord giovanni sforzas fortress long before messer del orca again picks up the scent if indeed he ever does so  giacopo laughed derisively till his fat body shook with the scornful mirth of him  by my faith im done with the business he cried and the other three expressed a very hearty agreement with that attitude  how done with it i asked  i shall make my way back across the hills and so retrace my steps to rome ill risk my head no more for any lady or any fool  if you should ever chance to risk it for yourself said i with unmeasured scorn youll risk it for the greatest fool and the cowardliest rogue that ever shamed the name of man and your mistress is she to wait at cagli until doomsday if anywhere within the bulk of that elephants body there lurks the heart of a rabbit youll get you to horse and ride to the help of that poor lady  they resented my tone and showed their resentment plainly messer giacopo went the length of raising his hand to me but i am a man of amazing strengthamazing inasmuch as being slender of shape i do not have the air of it leaping suddenly from the litter i caught that miserable vassal by the breast of his doublet shook him once or twice then tossed him headlong into a drift of snow by the roadside  at that they bared their knives and made shift to attack me but i flung myself on to one of the mules of the litter and showing them the stout pistoja dagger that i carried i presented with it a bold and truculent front no whit intimidated by their numbers four to one though they were they thought better of it a moment they stood off consulting among themselves then giacopo mounted and with some mocking counsel as to how i should dispose of the litter and the mules they made off no doubt to find their way back to rome giacopo as i was afterwards to discover was madonna paolas pursebearer so that they would not lack for means  awhile i stayed there cursing them for the whitelivered cravens that they were and thinking of that poor child who had ridden on to cagli and who would await them in vain there on the mule i sat in the noontide sunlight and pondered this so absorbed in her affairs as to have grown forgetful of my own at last i resolved to ride on to cagli alone and inform her that her men were fled  there was no time to lose for as that rogue giacopo had said ramiro del orca might discover at any moment how he had been tricked and return hotfoot to find me and extort the truth from me by such means as i had no stomach for enduring  first then it was of moment thoroughly to efface our tracks leaving no sign that might guide meser ramiro to repair the error into which i had tricked him slowly says the proverb one journeys far and safely slowly then did i consider the escort was no doubt on its way back to rome and if i could but rid myself of that cumbrous litter ser ramiro would find himself mightily hard put to it to again pick up the trail i remembered a ravine a little way behind and i rode my mule back to that as fast as it would travel with the litter and the other mule attached to it arrived there i unharnessed the beasts on the very edge of that shallow precipice then exerting all my strength i contrived to roll the litter over down that steep incline it went over and over gathering more snow to itself at every revolution and sinking at last into the drift at the bottom there were signs enough to show its presence but those signs would hardly be read by any but the sharpest eyes or by such as might be looking for it in precisely such a position i must trust to luck that it escaped the notice of messer ramiro but even if he did discover it i did not think that it would tell him overmuch  that done i resumed my hat and cloakwhich i had retainedmounted once more and urging the other mule along i proceeded thus as fast as might be for a halfleague or so in the direction of cagli that distance covered again i halted there was not a soul in sight i stripped one of the mules of all its harness which i buried in the snow behind a hedge then i drove the beast loose into a field the peasantowner of that land might conclude upon the morrow that it had rained asses in the night  and now i was able to travel at a brisker pace and in an hour or so i had passed the point where the road diverged and i caught a glimpse of the four grooms already high up in the hills which they were crossing whether they saw me or not i do not know but with a last curse at their cowardice i put them from my mind and cantered briskly on towards cagli it was a short league farther and in little more than half an hour my mule halfdead i halted at the door of the full moon  flinging my reins to the ostler i strode into the inn swaddled in my cloak and called for the hostess the place was empty as indeed all cagli had seemed when i rode up she came forwarda woman with a brown full face and large kindly eyesand i asked her whether a lady had arrived there in safety that morning at first she seemed mistrustful but when i had assured her that i was in that ladys service she frankly owned that madonna was safe in her own room thither i allowed her to lead me at once eager and reluctant eager with my own eyes to assure myself of her perfect safety reluctant that since a man may not penetrate to a ladys chamber hat on head by uncovering i must disclose my shameful trade yet there was nothing for it but a bold face and as i mounted the stairs in the womans wake i told myself that i was doubly a fool to be tormented by qualms of such a nature  hat in hand i followed the hostess into madonnas room the lady rose from the windowseat to greet me her face pale and her gentle eyes wearing an anxious look at sight of my head crowned with the crested horned hood of folly a frown of bewilderment drew her brows together and she looked more closely to see whether i was indeed the man who had befriended her that morning in her extremity in the eyes of the hostess i caught a gleam of recognition she knew me for the merry loon who had entertained her guests one night a fortnight since when on my way from pesaro to rome but before she could give expression to this discovery of hers the lady spoke  leave us awhile my woman she commanded but i stayed the hostess as she was withdrawing  this lady said i will need an escort of three or four stout knaves upon a journey that she is going she will be setting out as soon as may be  but what of my grooms cried the lady  madonna i informed her they have deserted you that is the reason of my presence here you shall hear the story of it presently meanwhile we must arrange to replace them and i turned again to the hostess  she was standing in thought a doubtful expression on her face but as i looked at her she shook her head  there is no such escort to be found today in cagli she made answer the town is all but empty and every lusty man is either gone on the pilgrimage to the holy house of loretto or else is at pesaro for the feast of the epiphany  it was in vain that i protested that a couple of knaves might surely be found she answered me that such as were in cagli were there because they would not be elsewhere  the ladys face grew clouded as she listened for from my insistence she shrewdly inferred that it imported to be gone  there is your ostler quoth i at last he will do for one  he is the only man i have my husband and my sons are gone to pesaro  yet spare us this one and you shall be well paid his services  but no bribe could tempt her to give way and no doubt she was welladvised for she contended that there was work to be done such as was beyond her years and strength and that if she sent her ostler off as well might she close her inna thing that was impossible  here then was an obstacle with which i had not reckoned it was impossible to send the lady off alone to travel a distance of some ten leagues and the most of it by nightfor if she would make sure of escaping she must journey now without pause until she came to pesaro  and then in a flash it occurred to me that here lay the means ready to my hand by avail of which i might boldly reenter pesaro despite my banishment and discharge my errand to lucrezia borgia for surely considering the mission on which ostensibly i should be returningas the saviour and protector of his kinswomangiovanni sforza could not enforce that ban against me next i bethought me of the other aspect that the business wore in fooling ramiro i had thwarted the borgia ends in rescuing madonna paola i had perhaps set at naught the cardinal of valencias aims if so what then it would seem that because the ladys eyes were mild and sweet and because her beauty had so deeply wrought upon me i had indeed fooled away my chance of salvation from the life and trade that were grown hateful to me for back to rome and cesare borgia i should dare go no more clearly i had burned my boats and i had done it almost unthinkingly acting upon the good impulse to befriend this lady and never reckoning the cost down to its total for all that the thing i had done and what i might yet do should offer me the means i needed to enter pesaro without danger to my neck i did not see that i was to derive great profit in the endunless my profit lay in knowing that i had advanced the ruin of giovanni sforza by delivering my letter to lucrezia that at any rate was enough incentive clearly to define for me the line that i should take through this tangle into which the everjesting fates had thrust me  i was still at my thoughts still pondering this most perplexing situation the hostess standing silent by the door when suddenly madonna paola spoke  sir said she in faltering accents ii have not the right to ask you and i stand already so deeply in your debt not a doubt of it but it will have inconvenienced you to have journeyed thus far to inform me of the flight of my grooms yet if you could she paused timid of proceeding and her glance fell  the hostess was all ears struck by the respectful manner in which this very evidently noble lady addressed a fool i opened the door for her  you may leave us now said i i will come to you presently  when she was gone i turned once more to the lady my course resolved upon my hate had conquered my last doubt what first imported was that i should get to pesaro and to madonna lucrezia  you were about to ask me said i that i should accompany you to pesaro  i hesitated sir she murmured i bowed respectfully  there was not the need madonna i assured her i am at your service  but messer boccadoro i have no claim upon you  surely said i the claim that every distressed lady has upon a man of heart let us say no more it were best not to delay in setting out although i can scarcely think that there is any imminent danger from ramiro del orca now  who is he she inquired  i told her whereupon  did they come up with you she asked what passed between you  succinctly i related what had chanced and how i had sent ramiro on a fools errand adding the particulars of the flight of her grooms and of how i had rid myself of the litter and the second mule she heard me her eyes sparkling and at times she clapped her hands with a glee that was almost childish vowing that this was splendid that was brave i allayed what little fears remained her by pointing out how effectively we had effaced our tracks and how vainly now messer del orca might beat the country in quest of a lady in a litter escorted by four grooms  and now she beset me with fresh thanks and fresh expressions of wonder at my generous readiness to befriend hera wonder all devoid of suspicion touching the singlemindedness of my purpose but i reminded her that we had little leisure to stand talking and left her to make her preparations for the journey whilst i went below to see that my mule and her horse were saddled i made bold to pay the reckoning and when presently she spoke of it with flaming cheeks and would have pledged me a jewel i bade her look upon it as a loan which anon she might repay me when i had brought her safely to her kinsmans court at pesaro  thus at last we left cagli and took the road north riding side by side and talking pleasantly the while ever concerning the matter of her flight and of her hopes of shelter at pesaro which being nearest to her heart found readiest expression i went wrapped in my cloak once more my headdress hidden neath my broadbrimmed hat so that the few wayfarers we chanced on need not marvel to see a lady in such friendly intercourse with a fool and so dull was i that day as not to marvel myself at such a state of things  the sun was declining a red ball of fire towards the mountains on our left casting a bloodred glow upon the snow that everywhere encompassed us as we cantered briskly on towards fossombrone  in that hour i fell to pondering and i even caught myself hoping that messer ramiro del orca might not chance upon the discovery of how egregiously i had fooled him he was dullwitted and slow at inference and upon that i built the hope that he might fail to associate me with madonna paolas elusion of his pursuit thus the chance might yet be mine of returning to rome and the honourable employment cesare borgia had promised me if only that were so to fall out i might yet contrive to mend the wreckage of my life i was returned it seems to the ways of early youth when we build our hopes of future greatness upon untenable foundations  great hopes and great ambitions rose within my breast that january evening fired by the gentle child that rode beside me fate had sent me to her aid that day and i seemed to have acquired by virtue of that circumstance a certain right in her had fate no other favours for me in her lap i bethought me of the very house of sforza to which i had been so shamefully attached and of its humble source in that peasant giacomuzzo attendolo surnamed sforza for his abnormal strength of body who rose to great and princely heights  assuredly i had the advantage of such an one and were the chance but given me  i went no further down in my heart i laughed to scorn my own wild musings cesare borgia would come to knowhe must whether ramiro told him or whether he inferred it for himself from the account ramiro must give him of our meetinghow i had thwarted him in one thing whilst i had served him in another fate was against me i had fallen too low to ever rise again and no dreams indulged in a sunset hour and inspired perhaps by a child who was beautiful as one of the saints of god would ever come to be realised by poor boccadoro  night was falling as we clattered through the slippery streets of fossombrone     chapter v madonnas ingratitude   we stayed in fossombrone little more than a halfhour and having made a hasty supper we resumed our way giving out that we wished to reach fano ere we slept and so by the first hour of night fossombrone was a league or so behind us and we were advancing briskly towards the sea overhead a moon rode at the full in a clear sky and its light was reflected by the snow so that we were not discomforted by any darkness we fell presently into a gentler pace for after all there could be no advantage in reaching pesaro before morning and as we rode we talked and i made bold to ask her the cause of her flight from rome  she told me then that she was madonna paola sforza di santafior and that pope alexander in his nepotism and his desire to make rich and powerful alliances for his family had settled upon her as the wife for his nephew ignacio borgia he had been emboldened to this step by the fact that her only protector was her brother filippo di santafior whom they had sought to coerce it was her brother who seeing himself in a dangerous and unenviable position had secretly suggested flight to her urging her to repair to her kinsman giovanni sforza at pesaro her flight however must have been speedily discovered and the borgias who saw in that act a defiance of their supreme authority had ordered her pursuit  but for me she concluded that pursuits must have resulted in her capture and once they had her back in rome willing or unwilling they would have driven her into the alliance by means of which they sought to bring her fortune into their own house this drew her into fresh protestations of the undying gratitude she entertained towards me protestations which i would have stemmed but that she persisted in them  it is a good and noble thing that you have done said she and i think that heaven must have directed you to my aid for it is scarce likely that in all italy i should have found another man who would have done so much  why what after all is this much that i have done i cried it is no less than my manhood bade me do no less than any other would have done seeing you so beset  nay that is more than i can ever think she answered who for the sake of an unknown would have suffered such inconveniences as have you who would have returned as you have returned to advise me of the defection of my grooms who when other escort failed would have gone the length of journeying all this way to render a service that is beyond repayment and above all who for the sake of an unknown maid would have submitted to this travesty of yours  travesty quoth i so struck by that as to interrupt her at last what travesty madonna  why this garb of motley that you donned the better to fool my pursuers and that you still wear in my poor service  i turned in the saddle to stare at her and in the moonlight i clearly saw her eyes meet mine so that was the reason of her kindness and of the easy familiarity of her speech with me she deemed me some knighterrant who caracoled through italy in quest of imperilled maidens needing aid of a certainty she had gathered her knowledge of the world from the works of messer bojardo or perhaps from the amadis of gaul of messer bernardo tasso and no doubt she thought that suits of motley grew on bushes by the roadside whence those who had a fancy for disguise might cull them  well well it were better she should know the truth at once and choose such a demeanour as she considered fitting towards a fool i had no stomach for the courtesies that were meant for such a man as i was not  madonna you are in error i informed her speaking slowly this garb is no travesty it is my usual raiment  there was a pause and i saw the slackening of her reins no doubt had we been afoot she would have halted the better to confront me  how she asked and a new note imperious and chill was sounding already in her voice you would not have me understand that you are by trade a fool  allowing that i am not a fool by birth under what other circumstances think you i should be likely to wear the garments of a fool  but this morning she protested after a brief pause when first i met you you were not so arrayed  i was arrayed even as i am now in a cloak and hat and boots that hid my motley from such undiscerning eyes as were yours and your groomsall taken up with your own fears as you then were  there was in the tail of that a sting as i meant there should be for the sudden haughtiness of her tone was cutting into me was i less worthy of thanks because i was a fool had i on that account done less to serve and save her or was it that the action which in a spurred and armoured knight had been accounted noble was deemed unworthy of thanks in a crested motleyed jester it seemed indeed that some such reasoning she followed for after that we spoke no more until we were approaching fano  a many times before had i felt the shame of my ignoble trade but never so acutely as at that moment it had seared my soul when giovanni sforza had told my story to his court ere he had driven me from pesaro with threats of hanging and it had burned even deeper when later madonna lucrezia upon entrusting me with her letter to her brother had upbraided me with the supineness that so long had held me in that vile bondage but deepest of all went now the burning iron of that disgrace for my companions silence seemed to argue that had she known my quality she would have scorned the aid of which she had availed herself to such good purpose if any doubt of this had mercifully remained me her next words would have served to have resolved it it was when the lights of fano gleamed ahead we were coming to a crossroads and i urged the turning to the left  but fano is in front she remonstrated coldly  this way we can avoid the town and gain the pesaro road beyond it answered i my tone as cool as hers  yet may it not be that at fano i might find an escort  i could have cried out at her cruelty for in her words i could but read my dismissal from her service there had been no more talk of an escort other than that which i afforded and with which at first she had been well content  i sat my mule in silence for a moment she had been very justly served had i been the vassal that she deemed me and had i borne myself in that character without consideration of her sex her station or her years she had been very justly served had i wheeled about and left her there to make her way to fano and thence to pesaro as best she might she was without money as i knew and she would have found in fano such a reception as would have brought the bitter tears of late repentance to her pretty eyes  but i was softhearted and so i reasoned with her yet in a manner that was to leave her no doubt of the true nature of her situation and the need to use me with a little courtesy for the sake of what i might yet do if she lacked the grace to treat me with gratitude for the sake of that which i had done already  madonna said i it were wiser to choose the byroad and forego the escort since we have dispensed with it so far there are many reasons why a lady should not seek to enter fano at this hour of night  i know of none she interrupted me  that may well be nevertheless they exist  this nightriding in so lonely a fashion is little to my taste she told me sullenly i am for fano  she had the mercy to spare me the actual words yet her tone told me as plainly as if she had uttered them that i could go with her or not as i should choose in silence very sore at heart i turned my mules head once more towards the lights of the town  since you are resolved so be it was all my answer and we proceeded  no word did we exchange until we had entered the main street when she curtly asked me which was the best inn  the golden fish said i as curtly and to the golden fish we went  arrived there madonna paola took affairs into her own hands she dismounted leaving the reins with a groom and entering the commonroom she proclaimed her needs to those that occupied it by loudly calling upon the landlord to find her an escort of three or four knaves to accompany her at once to pesaro where they should be well rewarded by the lord giovanni her cousin  i had followed her in and i ground my teeth at such an egregious piece of folly her hood was thrown back displaying the lenza of fine linen on her sable hair and over this a net of purest gold all set with jewels her camorra too was open and in her girdle there were gems for all to see there were but a halfdozen men in the room two of these had a venerable airthey may have been traders journeying to milanwhilst a third who sat apart was a slender effeminatelooking youth the remaining three were fellows of rough aspect and when one of thema blackbrowed ruffianraised his eyes and fastened them upon the riches that madonna paola with such indifference displayed i knew what was to follow  he rose upon the instant and stepping forward he made her a low bow  illustrious lady said he if these two friends of mine and i find favour with you here is an escort ready found we are stout fellows and very faithful  faithful to their cutthroat trade i made no doubt he meant  his fellows now rose also and she looked them over giving herself the airs of having spent her virgin life in judging men by their appearance it was in vain i tugged her cloak in vain i murmured the word wait under cover of my hand she there and then engaged them and bade them make ready to set out at once one more attempt i made to induce her to alter her resolve  madonna said i it is an unwise thing to go ajourneying by night with three unknown men and of such villainous appearance to me they seem no better than bandits  we were standing apart from the others and she was sipping a cup of spiced wine that the host had mulled for her she looked at me with a tolerant smile  they are poor men said she would you have them robed in velvet  my quarrel is with their looks madonna not their garments i answered patiently she laughed lightly carelessly even i thought a trifle scornfully  you are very fanciful said she then addedbut if so be that you are afraid to trust yourself in their company why then sir i need bring you no farther out of the road that you were following when first we met  did the child think that some jealousy actuated me and prompted me to inspire her with mistrust of my supplanters she angered me yet now more than ever was i resolved to journey with her leave her at the mercy of those ruffians whom in her ignorance she was mad enough to trust i could notnot even had she whipped me she was so young so frail and slight that none but a craven could have found it in his heart to have deserted her just then  if it please you madonna i answered smoothly i will make bold to travel on with you  it may be that my even accents stung her perhaps she read in them some measure of reproof of the ingratitude that lay in her altered bearing towards me her eyes met mine across the table and seemed to harden as she looked her answer came in a vastly altered tone  why if you are bent that way i shall be glad to have you avail yourself of my escort boccadoro  i had suffered the scorn now of her speech now of her silence for some hours but never was i so near to turning on her as at that moment never so near to consigning her to the fate to which her headstrong folly was compelling her that she should take that tone with me  the violence of the sudden choler i suppressed turned me pale under her steady glance so that seeing it her own cheeks flamed crimson and her eyes fell as if in token that she realised the meanness of her bearing to some natures there can be nothing more odious than such a realisation and of those i think was she for she stamped her foot in a sudden pet and curtly asked the host why there was such delay with the horses  they are at the door madonna he protested bowing as he spoke and your escort is already waiting in the saddle  she turned and strode abruptly towards the threshold over her shoulder she called to me  if you come with us boccadoro you had best be brisk  i follow madonna said i with a grim relish so soon as i have paid the reckoning  she halted and half turned and i thought i saw a slight droop at the corners of her mouth  you are keeping count of what i owe you she muttered  aye madonna i answered more grimly still i am keeping count and i thought that my wits were vastly at fault if that account were not to be greatly swelled ere pesaro was reached haply indeed my own life might go to swell it i almost took a relish in that thought perhaps then when i was stiff and colddone to death in her servicethis handsome ungrateful child would come to see how much discomfort i had suffered for her sake  my thoughts still ran in that channel as we rode out of pesaro for i misliked the way in which those knaves disposed themselves about us in front went madonna paola and immediately behind her so that their horses heads were on a level with her saddlebow one on each side went two of those ruffians the third whom i had heard them call stefano and who was the one who had made her the offer of their services ambled at my side a few paces in the rear and sought to draw me into conversation haply by way of throwing me off my guard  mistrust is a fine thing at times forewarned is forearmed says the proverb and of all forewarnings there is none we are more likely to heed than our own mistrust for whereas we may leave unheeded the warnings of a friend we seldom leave unheeded the warnings of our spirit  and so while my amiable and garrulous ser stefano engaged me in pleasant conversationaddressing me ever as messer the fool since he knew me not by namei wrapped my cloak about me and under cover of it kept my fingers on the hilt of my stout pistoja dagger ready to draw and use it at the first sign of mischief for that sign i was all eyes and had i been argus himself i could have kept no better watch meanwhile i plied my tongue and maintained as merry a conversation with ser stefano as you could wish to hear for he seemed a readywitted knave of a most humorous turn of fancygod rest his rascally soul and so it came to pass that i did by him the very thing he sought to do by me i lulled him into a careless confidence  at last the sign i had been waiting for was given i saw it as plainly as if it had been meant for me i believe i saw it before the man for whom it was intended and but for my fears concerning madonna paola i could have laughed outright at their clumsy assurance the man who rode on madonnas right turned in his saddle and put up his hand as if to beckon stefano i was regaling him with one of the choicest of messer sacchettis paradoxes gurgling myself at the humour of the thing i told i paid no heed to the sign i continued to expound my quip as though we had the night before us in which to make its elusive humour clear but out of the tail of my eye i watched my good friend stefano and i saw his right hand steal round to the region of his back where i knew his dagger to be slung yet was i patient there should be no blundering through an excessive precipitancy i talked on until i saw that my suspicions were amply realised i caught the cold gleam of steel in the hand that he brought back as stealthily as he had carried it to his poniard sant iddio what a coward he was for all his bulk to go so slyly about the business of stabbing a poor helpless defenceless fool  but sacchetti makes his point clear i babbled on most blandly almost as clear as comprehensive and as penetrating as should be to you the point of this and with a swift movement i swung halfround in my saddle and sank my dagger to the hilt in his side even as he was in the act of raising his  he made no sound beyond the faintest gurglethe first vowel of a suddenly choked word of wonder and surprise he rocked a second in his saddle then crashed over and lay with arms flung wide like a huge black crucifix upon the white ground at the same moment a piercing scream broke from madonna paola  i tremble still to think what might have been her fate had not those ruffians who had laid hands on her fallen into the sorry error of holding their single adversary too lightly they heard the thud of the gallant stefanos fall and they never doubted that mine was the body that had gone down they heard the rapid hoofbeats of my approach yet they never turned their heads to ascertain whether they might not be mistaken in their firm conviction that it was messer stefano who was joining them  i kissed my blade for luck and drove it straight and full into the back of the fellow on madonna paolas right he cried out essayed to turn in his saddle that he might deal with this unlookedfor assailant then overcome he lurched forward on to the withers of his horse and thence rolled over and was dragged away at the gallop his foot caught in a stirrup by the suddenly startled brute he rode  so far things had gone with an amazing and delightful ease if only the last of them had had the amiability to be intimidated by my prowess and to have taken to his heels i might have issued from that contest with the unscathed glory of a very mars but from his throat there came in answer to his comrades cry a roar of rage he fell back from madonna and wheeled his horse to come at me drawing his sword as he advanced  ride on madonna i shouted i will rejoin you presently  the fellow laughed a mighty ugly and discomposing laugh which may or may not have shaken her faith in my promise to rejoin her it certainly went near to shaking mine however she displayed a presence of mind full worthy of the haughtiness and ingratitude of which she had showed herself capable she urged her mule forward and so left him a clear road to attack me i made a mistake then that went mighty near to costing me my life i paused to twist my cloak about my left arm intending to use it as a buckler had i but risked the arm itself all unprotected in that task it may well be that it had served me better as it was my preparations were far from complete when already he was upon me with the result that the waving slack of my cloak was in my way to hamper and retard the movements of my arm  his sword leapt at me a murderous bluewhite flash of moonlit steel i put up my halfswaddled arm to divert the thrust holding my dagger ready in my right and gripping my mule with all the strength of my two knees i caught the blade it is true and turned aside the stroke intended for my heart but the slack of the cloak clung to the neck of my mule so that i could not carry my arm far enough to send his point clear of my body it took me in the shoulder stinging me first icy cold then burning hot as it went tearing its way through for just a second was i daunted more at knowing myself touched than by the actual pain then i flung my whole body forward to reach him at the close quarters to which he had come and i buried my dagger in his breast high up at the base of his dirty throat  the force of the blow carried me forward even as it bore him backward and so with his swordblade in my shoulder and my dagger where i had planted it we hurtled over together and lay a second amidst what seemed a forest of equine legs then something smote me across the head and i was knocked senseless  conceive me if you can a sorrier or more useless thing a senseless fool     chapter vi fools luck   my return to consciousness seemed to afford me such sensations as a diver may experience as he rises up and up through the depth of water he has plumbedor as a disembodied soul may know in its gentle ascent towards heaven indeed the latter parallel may be more apt for through the mist that suffused my senses there penetrated from overhead a voice that seemed to invoke every saint in the calendar on the behalf of some poor mortal a very litany of intercession was it not quite it would appear devoid of selfseeking  sainted virgin restore him good st paul who wert done to death with a sword let him not perish else am i lost indeed came the voice  i took a deep breath and opened my eyes whereat the voice cried out gladly that its intercessions had been heard and i knew that it was on my behalf that the saints of heaven had been disturbed in their beatific peace my head was pillowed in a womans lap and it took me a moment or two to realise that that lap was madonna paulas as was hers the voice that had reached my awakening senses the voice that now welcomed me back to life in terms that were very different from the last that i could remember her having used towards me  thank god messer boccadoro she exclaimed as she bent over me  her face was black with shadow but in her voice i caught a hint of tears and i wondered whether they were shed on my behalf or on her own  i do i answered fervently have you any notion of what hour it is  none she sighed you have been so long unconscious that i was losing hope of ever hearing your voice again  i became aware of a dull ache on the right side of my head i put up my hand and withdrew it moist she saw the action  one of the horses must have struck you with its hoof after you fell she explained but i was more concerned for your other wound i withdrew the sword with my own hands  that other wound she spoke of was now making itself felt as well it was a gnawing stinging pain in the region of my left shoulder which seemed to turn me numb to the waist on that side of my body and render powerless my arm i questioned her touching my three adversaries and she silently pointed to three black masses that lay some little distance from us in the snow  not all dead i cried  i do not know she answered with a sob i have not dared go near them they frighten me mother of heaven what a night of horror it has been oh that i had taken your advice messer boccacloro she exclaimed in a passion of selfreproach  i laughed seeking to soften her distress  to me it seems that whether you would or not you have been compelled to take it after all those fellows lie there harmless enough and i am stillas i urged that i should beyour only escort  a nobler protector never woman had she assured me and i felt a hot pearl of moisture fail upon my brow  you were wise at least to journey with a fool i answered her for fools are proverbially lucky folk and tonight has proven me of all fools the luckiest but madonna i suggested in a different tone should we not be better advised to attempt to resume this interesting journey of ours we do not seem to lack horses  a couple of nags were standing by the roadside together with our mules and i was afterwards to learn that she herself it was had tethered them  it must be yet some three leagues to pesaro i added and if we journey slowly as i fear me that we must we should arrive there soon after daybreak  do you think that you can stand she asked a hopeful ring in her voice  i might essay it answered i and i would have done so there and then but that she detained me  first let me see to this hurt in your head said she i have been bathing it with snow while you were unconscious  she gathered a fresh handful as she spoke and very tenderly she wiped away the blood then from her own head she took the fine linen lanza that she wore and made a bandagea bandage sweet with the faint fragrance of marshmallowand bound it about my battered skull when that was done she turned her attention to my shoulder this was a more difficult matter and all that we could do was to attempt to stanch the blood which already had drenched my doublet on that side to this end she passed a long scarf under my arm and wound it several times about my shoulder  at last her gentle ministrations ended i sought to rise a dizziness assailed me scarce was i on my feet and it is odds i had fallen back but that she caught and steadied me  mother in heaven you are too weak to ride she exclaimed you must not attempt it  nay but i will i answered with more stoutness of tone than i felt of body and notwithstanding that my knees were loosening under my weight it is a faintness that will pass  if ever man willed himself to conquer weakness that did i then and with some measure of successor else it was that my faintness passed of itself i drew away from her support and straightening myself i crossed to where the animals were tethered staggering at first but presently with a surer foot she followed me watching my steps with as much apprehension as a mother may feel when her firstborn makes his earliest attempts at walking and as ready to spring to my aid did i show signs of stumbling but i kept up and presently my senses seemed to clear and i stepped out more surely  awhile we stood discussing which of the animals we should take it was my suggestion that we should ride the horses but she wisely contended that the mules would prove the more convenient if the slower i agreed with her and then ere we set out i went to see to my late opponents one of themser stefanowas cold and stiff the other two still lived and from the nature of their wounds seemed likely to survive if only they were not frozen to death before some good samaritan came upon them  i knelt a moment to offer up a prayer for the repose of the soul of him that was dead and i bound up the wounds of the living as best i could to save them greater loss of blood indeed had it lain in my power i would have done more for them but in what case was i to render further aid after all they had brought their fate upon themselves and i doubt not they were paying a score that they had heaped up heavily in the past  i went back to the mules and despite my remonstrances madonna paola insisted upon aiding me to mount urging me to have a care of my wound and to make no violent movement that should set it bleeding again then she mounted too nimble as any boy that ever robbed an orchard and we set out once more and now it was a very contrite and humbled lady that rode with me and one that was at no pains to dissemble her contrition but rather could speak of nothing else  it moved me strangely to have her suing pardon from me as though i had been her equal instead of the sometime jester of the court of pesaro dismissed for an excessive pertness towards one with whom his master curried favour  and presently as was perhaps but natural after all that she had witnessed she fell to questioning me as to how it came to pass that one of such wit resource and courage should follow the mean calling to which i had owned in answer i told her without reservation the full story of my shame it was a thing that i had ever most zealously kept hidden as already i have shown  to be a fool was evil enough in all truth but to let men know that under my motley was buried the identity of a man patricianborn was something infinitely worse for however vile the trade of a fool may be it is not half so vile for a lowborn clod who is too indolent or too sickly to do honest work as for one who has accepted it out of a halfcowardice and persevered in it through very sloth  yet on that night and after all that had chanced no matter how my cheeks might burn in the gloom as i rode beside her i was glad for once to tell that ignominious story glad that she should know what weight of circumstance had driven me to wear my hideous livery  but since my story dealt oddly with that lord of pesaro the kinsman whose shelter she was now upon her way to seek i must first assure myself that the candour to which i was disposed would not offend  does it happen madonna i inquired that you are well acquainted with the lord of pesaro  nay i have never seen him answered she when he was at rome a year ago in the service of the pope i was at my studies in the convent his father was my fathers cousin so that my kinship is none so near why do you ask  because my story deals with him madonna and it is no pretty tale not such a narrative as i should choose wherewith to entertain you still since you have asked for it you shall hear it  it was in the year that giovanni sforza lord of pesaro celebrated his nuptials with the lady lucrezia borgiathree years ago thereforethat one morning there rode into the courtyard of his castle of pesazo a tall and lean young man on a tall and lean old horse he was garbed and harnessed after a fashion that proclaimed him halfknight halfpeasant and caused the castle lacqueys to eye him with amusement and greet him with derision lacqueys are great arbiters of fashion  in a loud imperious voice this cockerel called for giovanni lord of pesaro whereupon resenting the insolence of his manner the menatarms would have driven him out without more ado but it chanced that from one of the windows of his stronghold the tyrant espied his odd visitor he was in a mood that craved amusement and marvelling what madman might be this he made his way below and bade them stand back and let me speakfor i madonna was that lean young man  are you quoth i the lord of pesaro  he answered me courteously that he was whereupon i did my errand to him i flung my gauntlet of buffalohide at his feet in gage of battle  your father said i costanzo of pesaro was a foul brigand who robbed my father of his castle and lands of biancomonte leaving him to a needy and povertystricken old age i am here to avenge upon your fathers son my fathers wrongs i am here to redeem my castle and my lands if so be that you are a true knight you will take up the challenge that i fling you and you will do battle with me on horse or foot and with whatsoever arms you shall decree god defending him that has justice on his side  knowing the world as i know it now madonna i interpolated i realise the folly of that act of mine but in those days my views belonged to a long departed age of chivalry of which i had learnt from such books as came my way at biancomonte and which i believed was the life of today in the world of men it was a thing which some tyrants would have had me broken on the wheel but giovanni sforza never so much as manifested anger there was a complacent smile on his white face and his fingers toyed carelessly with his beard  i waited patiently very haughty of mien and very fierce at heart and when the amusement began to fade from his eyes i begged that he would deliver me his answer  my answer quoth he is that you get you back to the place from whence you came and render thanks to god on your knees every morning of the life i am sparing you that giovanni sforza is more entertained than affronted by your frenzy  at his words i went crimson from chin to brow  do you disdain me i questioned choking with rage he turned with a shrug and a laugh and bade one of his men to give this cavalier his glove and conduct him from the castle several that had stood at hand made shift to obey him whereat i fell into such a blind unreasoning fury that incontinently i drew my sword and laid about me they were many i was but one and they were not long in overpowering me and dragging me from my horse  they bound me fast and giovanni bade them let me have a priest then get me hanged without delay had he done that the world being as it is perhaps none could blame him but he elected to spare my life yet on such terms as i could never have accepted had it not been for the consideration of my poor widowed mother whom i had left in the hills of biancomonte whilst i went forth to seek my fortunesuch was the tale i had told her i was her sole support her only hope in life and my death must have been her own if not from grief why then from very want the thought of that poor old woman crushed my spirit as i sat in durance waiting for my end and when the priest came whom they had sent to shrive me he found me weeping which he took to argue a contrite heart he bore the tale of it to giovanni and the lord of pesaro came to visit me in consequence and found me sorely changed from my furious mood of some hours earlier  i was a very coward i own but it was for my mothers sake if i feared death it was because i bethought me of what it must mean to her  at sight of giovanni i cast myself at his feet and with tears in my eyes and in heartrending tones bespeaking a humility as great as had been my erstwhile arrogance i begged my life of him i told him the truththat for myself i was not afraid to die but that i had a mother in the hills who was dependent on me and who must starve if i were thus cut off  he watched me with his moody eyes a saturnine smile about his lips then of a sudden he shook with a silent mirth whose evil malicious depth i was far indeed from suspecting he asked me would i take solemn oath that if he spared my life i would never again raise my hand against him that oath i took with a greediness born of my fear of the death that was impending  you have been wise said he and you shall have your life on one conditionthat you devote it to my service  even that will i do i answered readily he turned to an attendant and ordered him to go fetch a suit of motley no word passed between us until that man returned with those garish garments then giovanni smiled on me in his mocking infernal way  not that i cried guessing his purpose  aye that he answered me that or the hangmans noose a man who could devise so monstrous a jest as was your challenge to the tyrant of pesaro should be a merry fellow if he would i need such a one there are two fools at my court but they are mere tumblers deformed vermin that excite as much disgust as mirth i need a sprightlier man a man of some learning and more drollery such a man in short as you would seem to be  i recoiled in horror and disgust was this his clemencythis sparing of my life that he might submit it to an eternal shame for a moment my mother was forgotten i thought only of myself and i grew resolved to hang  when you spoke of service said i i thought of service of an honourable sort  the service that i offer you is honourable he said with cold amusement indeed remembering that your life was forfeit you should account yourself most fortunate you shall be well housed and well fed you shall wear silk and lie in fine linen on condition that you are merry if you prove dull our castellan shall have you whippedfor such a one as you could not be dull save out of sullenness of which we shall seek to cure you if you show signs of it  i will not do it i cried it were too base  my friend he answered me the choice is yours you shall have an hour in which to resolve what you will do when they open this door for you at sunset come forth clad as you are and you shall hang if you prefer to live then don me that robe and cap of motley and on condition that you are merry life is yours  i paused a moment our horses were moving slowly for the tale engrossed us both me in the telling her in the hearing presently  i need not harass you with the reflections that were mine during that hour madonna rather let me ask you how should a man so placed make choice to be full worthy of the office proffered him  there was a moments silence while she pondered  why she answered me at last a fool i take it would have chosen death the wise man life since it must hold the hope of better days  and since it asked a man of wit to play the fool to such a tune as the lord giovanni piped that wise young man chose life and folly but was that choice indeed so wise the story ends not there that young men whose early life had been one of hardships found himself indeed wellhoused and fed as the lord giovanni had promised him and so he fell into a slothful spirit and was content to play the fool for bed and board  there were times when conscience knocked loudly at my heart and i was tortured with shame to see myself in the garb of fools the sport of all from prince to scullion but in the three years that i had dwelt at pesaro my identity had been forgotten by the few who had ever been aware of it moreover a court is a place of changes and in three years there had been such comings and goings at the court of giovanni sforza that not more than one or two remained of those that had inhabited it when first i entered on my existence there thus had my position grown steadily more bearable i was just a jester and no more and so in a measurethough i blush to say iti grew content i gathered consolation from the fact that there were not any who now remembered the story of my coming to pesaro or who knew of the cowardliness i had been guilty of when i consented to mask myself in the motley and assume the name of boccadoro i counted on the lord giovannis generosity to let things continue thus and meanwhile i provided for my mother out of the vails that were earned me by my shame but there came a day when giovanni in evil wantonness of spirit chose to make merry at the fools expense  to be held up to scorn and ridicule is a part of the trade of such as i and had it been just boccadoro whom giovanni had exposed to the derision of his court haply i had been his jester still but such sport as that would have satisfied but ill the deepseated malice of his soul the man whom his cruel mockery crucified for their entertainment was lazzaro biancomonte whom he revealed to them relating in his own fashion the tale i have told you  at that i rebelled and i said such things to him in that hour before all his court as a man may not say to a prince and live passion surged up in him and he ordered his castellan to flog me to the bonein short to slay me with a whip  from that punishment i was saved by the intercessions of madonna lucrezia but i was driven out of pesaro that very night and so it happens that i am a wanderer now  at that i left it i had no mind to tell her what motives had impelled lucrezia borgia to rescue me nor on what errand i had gone to rome and was from rome returning  she had heard me in silence and now that i had done she heaved a sigh for which gentle expression of pity out of my heart i thanked her we were silent thereafter for a little while at length she turned her head to regard me in the light of the now declining moon  messer biancomonte said she and the sound of the old name falling from her lips thrilled me with a joy unspeakable and seemed already to reinvest me in my old estate messer biancomonte you have done me in these fourandtwenty hours such service as never did knight of old for any ladyand you did it too out of the most disinterested and noble of motives proving thereby how truly knightly is that heart of yours which for my sake has all but beat its last tonight you must journey on to pesaro with me despite this banishment of which you have told me i will be surety that no harm shall come to you i could not do less and i shall hope to do far more such influence as i may prove to have with my cousin of pesaro shall be exerted all on your behalf my friend and if in the nature of giovanni sforza there be a tithe of the gratitude with which you have inspired me you shall at least have justice and biancomonte shall be yours again  i was silent for a spell so touched was i by the kindness she manifested meso touched indeed and so unused to it that i forgot how amply i had earned it and how rudely she had used me ere that was done  alas i sighed god knows i am no longer fit to sit in the house of the biancomonte i am come too low madonna  that lazzaro after whom you are named she answered had come yet lower but he lived again and resumed his former station take your courage from that  he lived not at the mercy of giovanni of pesaro said i  there was a fresh pause at that thenat least she urged me youll come to pesaro with me  why yes said i i could not let you go alone and in my heart i felt a pang of shame and called myself a cur for making use of her as i was doing to reach the court of giovanni sforza  you need fear no consequences she promised me i can be surety for that at least  in the east a brighter yellower light than the moons began to show it was the dawn from which i gathered that it must be approaching the thirteenth hour pesaro could not be more than a couple of leagues farther and presently when we had gained the summit of the slight hill we were ascending we beheld in the distance a blurred mass looming on the edge of the glittering sea a silver ribbon that uncoiled itself from the western hills disappeared behind it that silvery streak was the river foglia that heap of buildings against the landscapes virgin white the town of pesaro  madonna pointed to it with a sudden cry of gladness see messer biancomonte how near we are courage my friend a little farther and yonder we have rest and comfort for you  she had need in truth to cry me courage for i was weakening fast once more it may have been the much that i had talked or the infernal jolting of my mule but i was losing blood again and as we were on the point of riding forward my senses swam so that i cried out and but for her prompt assistance i might have rolled headlong from my saddle  as it was she caught me about the waist as any mother might have done her son what ails you she inquired her newlyaroused anxiety contrasting sharply with her joyous cry of a moment earlier are you faint my friend it needed no confession on my part my condition was all too plain as i leaned against her frail body for support  it is my wound i gasped then i set my teeth in anguish so near the haven and to fail now it could not be it must not be i summoned all my resolution all my fortitude but in vain nature demanded payment for the abuses she had suffered  if we proceed thus she ventured fearfully you leaning against me and going at a slow paceno faster than a walkthink you you can bear it try good messer biancomonte  i will try madonna i replied perhaps thus and if i am silent we may yet reach pesaro together if notif my strength gives outthe town is yonder and the day is coming you will find your way without me  i will not leave you sir she vowed and it was good to hear her  indeed i hope you may not know the need i answered wearily and thus we started on once more  sant iddio what agonies i suffered ere the sun rose up out of the sea to flood us with his winter glory what agonies were mine during those two hours or so of that last stage of our eventful journey i must bear up until we are at the gates of pesaro i kept murmuring to myself and as if my spirit were inclined to become the servant of my will and hold my battered flesh alive until we got that far pesaros gates i had the joy of entering ere i was constrained to give way  dimly i rememberfor very dim were my perceptions growingthat as we crossed the bridge and passed beneath the archway of the porta romana the officer turned out to see who came at sight of me be gaped a moment in astonishment  boccadoro he exclaimed at last so soon returned  like perseus from the rescue of andromeda answered i in a feeble voice saving that perseus was less bloody than am i behold the madonna paola sforza di santafior the noble cousin of our high and mighty lord  and then as if my task being done i were free to set my weary brain to rest my senses grew confused the officers voice became a hum that gradually waxed fainter as i sank into what seemed the most luxurious and delicious sleep that ever mortal knew  two days later when i was conscious once more i learned what excitement those words of mine had sown with what honours madonna paola was escorted to the castle and how the citizens of pesaro turned out upon hearing the news which ran like fire before us and madonna it seems had loudly proclaimed how gallantly i had served her for as they bore me along in a cloak carried by four menatarms the cry that was heard in the streets of pesaro that morning was boccadoro they had loved me had those good citizens of pesaro and the news of my departure had cast a gloom upon the town to have their hero return in a manner so truly heroic provoked that brave display of their affection and i deeply doubt if ever in the days of greatest loyalty the name of sforza was as loudly cried in pesaro as they tell me was the name of sforzas fool that day     chapter vii the summons from rome   if madonna paola did not achieve quite all that she had promised me so readily yet she achieved more than from my acquaintance with the nature of giovanni sforzaand my knowledge of the deep malice he entertained for mei should have dared to hope  the tyrant of pesaro as i was soon to learn was greatly taken with this fair cousin of his whom that morning he had beheld for the first time and being taken with her it may be that giovanni listened the more readily to her intercessions on my poor behalf since it was she who begged this thing he could not wholly refuse but since he was giovanni sforza he could not wholly grant he promised her that my life at least should be secure and that not only would he pardon me but that he would have his own physician see to it that i was made sound again for the time that was enough he thought first let them bring me back to life when that was achieved it would be early enough to consider what course this life should take thereafter  and she knowing him not and finding him so kind and gracious trusted that he would perform that which he tricked her into believing that he promised  for some ten days i lay abed feverish at first and later very weak from the great loss of blood i had sustained but after the second day when my fever had abated i had some visitors among whom was madonna paola who bore me the news that her intercessions for me with the lord of pesaro were likely to bear fruit and that i might look for my reinstatement yet if i permitted myself to hope as she bade me i did so none too fully  my situation bearing in mind how at once i had served and thwarted the ends of cesare borgia was perplexing  another visitor i had was messer magistrithe pompous seneschal of pesarowho after his own fashion seemed to have a liking for me and a certain pity here was my chance of discharging the true errand on which i was returned  i owe thanks said i to many circumstances for the sparing of my life but above all people and all things do i owe thanks to our gracious lady lucrezia do you think messer magistri that she would consent to see me and permit me again to express the gratitude that fills my heart  mosser magistri thought that he could promise this and consented to bear my message to her within the hour she was at my bedside and divining that haply i had news to give her of the letter i had born her brother she dismissed magistri who was in attendance  once we were alone her first words were of kindly concern for my condition delivered in that sweet musical voice that was by no means the least charm of a princess to whom nature had been prodigal of gifts for without going to that length of exaggerated praise which some have bestowedfor her own ear and with an eye to profitupon madonna lucrezia yet were i less than truthful if i sought to belittle her ample claims to beauty some six years later than the time of which i write she was met on the occasion of her entry into ferrara by a certain clown dressed in the scanty guise of the shepherd paris who proffered her the apple of beauty with the meansouled flattery that since beholding her he had been forced to alter his oldtime judgment in favour of venus  he lied like the brazen selfseeking adulator that he was and for which he should have been soundly whipped her nose was a shade too long her chin a shade too short to admit even remotely of such comparisons still that she had a certain gracious beauty as i have said it is not mine to deny there was an almost childish freshness in her face an almost childish innocence in her fine gray eyes and above all a golden and resplendent hair as brought to mind the tresses of gods angels  that fair childfor no more than a child was shedrew a chair to my bedside  there she sate herself whilst i thanked her for her concern on my behalf and answered that i was doing well enough and should be abroad again in a day or two  brave lad she murmured patting my hand which lay upon the coverlet as though she had been my sister and i anything but a fool count me ever your friend hereafter for what you have done for madonna paola for although it was my own family you thwarted yet you did so to serve one who is more to me than any family more than any sister could be  what i did madonna i answered i did with the better heart since it opened out a way that was barred me solved me a riddle which my lord your illustrious brother set meone that otherwise might well have overtaxed my wits  ah her gray eyes fell on me in a swift and searching glance a glance that revealed to the full their matchless beauty care seemed of a sudden to have aged her face the question of her eyes needed no translation into words  the lord cardinal of valencia entrusted me with a letter for you in answer to your own i informed her and from underneath my pillow i drew the package which during magistris absence i had abstracted from my boot that i might have it in readiness when she came  she sighed as she took it and a wistful smile invested the corners of her mouth  i had hoped he would have found better employment for you she said  his excellency promised that he would more fitly employ me in the future did i discharge this errand with secrecy and despatch but by aiding madonna paola i have burned my boats against returning to claim the redemption of that promise though had it not been for madonna paola and what i did i scarce know how i should have penetrated here to you  she broke the seal and rising crossed to the window where she stood reading the letter her back toward me presently i heard a stifled sob the letter was crushed in her hand then moments passed ere she confronted me once more but her manner as all changed she was agitated and preoccupied and for all that she forced herself to talk of me and my affairs her mind was clearly elsewhere at last she left me nor did i see her again during the time i was confined to my bed  on the eleventh day i rose and the weather being mild and springlike i was permitted by my gravefaced doctor to take the air a little on the terrace that overlooks the sea i found no garments but some suits of motley and so in despite of my repugnance now to reassume that garb i had no choice but to array myself in one of these i selected the least garish onea suit of black and yellow stripes with hose that was half black half yellow too and so leaning upon the crutch they had left me i crept forth into the sunlight the very ghost of the man that i had been a fortnight ago  i found a stone seat in a sheltered corner looking southward towards ancona and there i rested me and breathed the strong invigorating air of the adriatic the snows were gone and between me and the wall some twenty paces offthere was a stretch of soft green turf  i had brought with me a book that madonna lucrezia had sent me while i was yet abed it was a manuscript collection of spanish odes with the proverbs of one domenico lopezall very proper nourishment for a jesters mind the odes seemed to possess a certain quaintness and among the proverbs there were many that were new to me in framing and in substance moreover i was glad of this means of improving my acquaintance with the tongue of spain and i was soon absorbed so absorbed indeed as never to hear the footsteps of the lord giovanni when presently he approached me unattended nor to guess at his presence until his shadow fell athwart my page i raised my eyes and seeing who it was i made shift to get on my feet but he commanded me to remain seated commenting sympathetically upon my weak condition  he asked me what i read and when i had told him a thin smile fluttered across his white face  you choose your reading with rare judgment said he read on and prime your mind with fresh humour prepare yourself with new conceits for our amusement against the time when health shall be more fully restored you  it was in such words as these that he intimated to me that i was pardoned and reinstatedas the fool of the court of pesaro that was to be the sum of his clemency we were precisely where we had been once before had he granted me my life on condition that i should amuse him he did no more than repeat that mercy now i stared at him in wonder openmouthed whereit he laughed  you are agreeably surprised my boccadoro said he his fingers straying to his beard as was his custom my clemency is no more than you deserve in return for the service you have rendered to the house of sforza and he patted my head as though i had been one of his dogs that had borne itself bravely in the chase  i answered nothing i sat there as if i had been a part of the stone from which my seat was hewn for i lacked the strength to rise and strangle him as he deservedmoreover i was bound by an oath which it would have damned my soul to break never to raise my hand against him  and then before he could say more two ladies issued from the doorway on my right they were madonna lucrezia and madonna paola upon espying me they hastened forward with expressions of pleased surprise at seeing me risen and out and when i would have got to my feet they stayed me as giovanni had done madonna paolas words seemed addressed to heaven rather than to me for they were words of thanksgiving for this recovery of my strength  i have no thanks she ended warmly that can match the deeds by which you earned them messer biancomonte  my eyes drifting to giovannis face surprised its sudden darkening  madonna paola said he in an icy voice you have uttered a name that must not be heard within my walls of pesaro if you would prove yourself the friend of boccadoro to remind me of his true identity is to remind me of that which counts not in his favour  she turned to regard him a mild surprise in her blue eyes  but my lord you promised she began  i promised he interposed with an easy smile and manner never so deprecatory that i would pardon him grant him his life and restore him to my favour  but did you not say that if he survived and was restored to strength you would then determine the course his life should take  still smiling he produced his comfitbox and raised the lid  that is a thing he seems to have determined for himself he answered smoothlyhe could be smooth as a cat upon occasion could this bastard of costanzo sforza i came upon him here arrayed as you behold him and reading a book of spanish quips is it not clear that he has chosen  between thumb and forefinger he balanced a sugarcrusted comfit of coriander seed steeped in marjoram vinegar and having put his question he bore the sweetmeat to his mouth the ladies looked at him and from him to me then madonna paola spoke and there seemed a reproachful wonder in her voice  is this indeed your choice she asked me  it is the choice that was forced on me said i in heat they left me no garment save these of folly that i was reading this book it pleases my lord to interpret into a further sign of my intentions  she turned to him again and to the appeal she made was joined that of madonna lucrezia he grew serious and put up his hand in a gesture of rare loftiness  i am more clement than you think said he in having done so much for the rest the restoration that you ask for him is one involving political issues you little dream of what is this  he had turned abruptly a servant was approaching leading a mudsplashed courier whom he announced as having just arrived  whence are you giovanni questioned him  from the holy see answered the courier bowing with letters for the high and mighty lord giovanni sforza tyrant of pesaro and his noble spouse madonna lucrezia borgia  he proffered his letters as he spoke and giovanni whose brow had grown overcast took them with a hand that seemed reluctant then bidding the servant see to the couriers refreshment he dismissed them both  a moment he stood balancing the parchments a if from their weight he would infer the gravity of their contents and the affairs of boccadoro were there and then forgotten by us all for the thought that rose uppermost in our mindssaving always that of madonna lucreziawas that these communications concerned the sheltering of madonna paola and were a command for her immediate return to rome at last giovanni handed his wife the letter intended for her and in silence broke the seal of his own  he unfolded it with a grim smile but scarce had he begun to read when his expression softened into one of terror and his face grew ashen next it flared crimson the veins on his brow stood out like ropes and his eyes flashed furiously upon madonna lucrezia she was reading her bosom rising and falling in token of the excitement that possessed her  madonna he cried in an awful voice i have here a command from the holy see to repair at once to rome to answer certain charges that are preferred against me relating to my marriage madonna know you aught of this  i know sir she answered steadily that i too have here a letter calling me to rome but there is no reason given for the summons  intuitively it flashed across my mind that whatever the matter might be madonna lucrezia had full knowledge of it through the letter i had brought her from her brother  can you conjecture madonna what are these charges to which my letter vaguely alludes giovanni was inquiring  your pardon but the subject is scarcely of a nature to permit discussion in the castle courtyard its character is intimate  he looked at her very searchingly but for all that he was a man of almost twice her years her wits were more than a match for his and his scrutiny can have told him nothing she preserved a calm unruffled front  in five minutes madonna said he very sternly i shall be honoured if you will receive me in your closet  she inclined her head murmuring an unhesitating assent satisfied he bowed to her and to madonna paolawho had been looking on with eyes that wonder had set wide openand turning on his heel he strode briskly away as he passed into the castle madonna lucrezia heaved a sigh and rose  my poor boccadoro she cried i fear me your affairs must wait a while but think of me always as your friend and believe that if i can prevail upon my brother to overlook the illturn you did him when you entered the service of this childand she pointed to madonna paolai shall send for you from rome for in pesaro i fear you have little to hope for but let this be a secret between us  from those words of hers i inferred as perhaps she meant i should that once she left pesaro to obey her fathers summons our little northern state was to know her no more once again only did i see her on the occasion of her departure some four days later and then but for a moment back to pesaro she came no more as you shall learn anon but behind her she left a sweet and fragrant memory which still endures though many years are sped and much calumny has been heaped upon her name  i might pause here to make some attempt at refuting the base falsehoods that had been bruited by that timeserving vassal guicciardini and others of his kidney whom the upstart cardinal giuliano della roveresometime pedlarin his jealous fury at seeing the coveted pontificate pass into the family of borgia bought and hired to do his loathsome work of calumny and besmirch the fame of as sweet a lady as italy has known but this poor chronicle of mine is rather concerned with the history of madonna paola di santafior and it were a divergence wellnigh unpardonable to set my pen at present to that other task moreover there is scarce the need if any there be who doubt me or if future generations should fall into the error of lending credence to the lies of that villain guicciardini of that archvillain giuliano della rovere or of other smaller fry who have lent their helots pens to weave mendacious records of her life dubbing her murderess adulteress and heaven knows what besidesi will but refer them to the archives of ferrara whose duchess she became at the age of oneandtwenty and where she reigned for eighteen years there shall it be found recorded that she was an exemplary godfearing woman a faithful and honoured wife a wise devoted mother and a princess beloved and esteemed by her people for her piety her charity and her wisdom if such records as are there to be read by earnest seekers after truth be not sufficient to convince and to reveal those others whom i have named in the light of their true baseness then were it idle for me to set up in these pages a passing refutation of the falsehoods which it has grieved me so often to hear repeated  it was two days later that the lord giovanni set out for rome obedient to the command he had received but before his departureon the eve of it to be precisethere arrived at pesaro a very wonderful and handsome gentleman this was the brother of madonna paola the high and mighty lord filippo di santafior he had had a hint in rome that his connivance at his sisters defiant escape was suspected at the vatican and he had wisely determined that his health would thrive better in a northern climate for a while  a very splendid creature was this lord filippo all shimmering velvet gleaming jewels costly furs and glittering gold his face was effeminate though finely featured and resembled in much his sisters he rode a creamcoloured horse which seemed to have been steeped in musk so strongly was it scented but of all his affectations the one with which i as taken most was to see one of his grooms approach him when he dismounted to dust his wondrous clothes down to his shoes which he wore in the splayed fashion set by the late king of france who was blessed with twelve toes on each of his deformed feet  the lord giovanni himself not lacking in effeminacy was greatly taken by the wondrous raiment the studied lisp and the hundred affectations of this peerless gallant had he not been overburdened at the time by the papal business that impended he might there and then have cemented the intimacy which was later to spring up between them as it was he made him very welcome and placed at his and his sisters disposal the beautiful palace that his father had begun and he himself had completed which was known as the palazza sforza on the morrow giovanni left pesaro with but a small retinue in which i was thankful not to be included  two days later madonna lucrezia followed her husband the fact that they journeyed not together seeming to wear an ominous significance her eyes had a swollen look such as attends much weeping which afterwards i took as proof that she knew for what purpose she was going and was moved to bitter grief at the act to which her ambitious family was constraining her  after their departure things moved sluggishly at pesaro the nobles of the lord giovannis court repaired to their several houses in the neighboring country and save for the officers of the household the place became deserted  madonna paola remained at the sforza palace and i saw her only once during the two mouths that followed and then it was about the streets and she had little more than a greeting for me as she passed at her side rode her brother a splendid blaze of finery falcon on wrist  my days were spent in reading and reflection for there was naught else to do i might have gone my ways had i so wished it but something kept me there at pesaro curious to see the events with which the time was growing big  we grew sadly stagnant during lent and what with the uneventful course of things and the lean fare proscribed by mother church it was a very dispirited boccadoro that wandered aimlessly whither his dulling fancy took him but in holy week at last we received an abrupt stir which set a whirlpool of excitement in the dead sea of our lives it was the sudden reappearance of the lord giovanni  he came alone duststained and haggard on a horse that dropped dead from exhaustion the moment pesaro was reached and in his pallid cheek and hollow eye we read the tale of some great fear and some disaster  that night we heard the story of how he had performed the feat of riding all the way from rome in fourandtwenty hours fleeing for his life from the peril of assassination of which madonna lucrezia had warned him  he went off to his castle of gradara where he shut himself up with the trouble we could but guess at and so in pesaro that brief excitement spent we stagnated once again  i seemed an anomaly in so gloomy a place and more than once did i think of departing and seeking out my poor old mother in her mountain home contenting myself hereafter with labouring like any honest villano born to the soil but there ever seemed to be a voice that bade me stay and wait and the voice bore a suggestion of madonna paola but why dissemble here why cast out hints of voices heard supernatural in their flavour the voice i doubt not was just my own inclination which bade me hope that once again it might be mine to serve that lady  an eventful year in the history of the families of sforza and borgia was that year of grace 1497  spring came and ere it had quite grown to summer we had news of the assassination of the duke of gandia and the tale that he was done to death by his elder brother cesare borgia a tale which seemed to lack for reasonable substantiation and which despite the many voices that make bold to noise it broadcast may or may not be true  in that same month of june messages passed between rome and pesaro and gradually the burden of the messages leaked out in rumours that pope alexander and his family were pressing the lord giovanni to consent to a divorce at last he left pesaro again this time to journey to milan and seek counsel with his powerful cousin lodovico whom they called the moor when he returned he was more sulky and downcast than ever and at gradara he lived in an isolation that had been worthy of a hermit  and thus that miserable year wore itself out and at last in december we heard that the divorce was announced and that lucrezia borgia was the tyrant of pesaros wife no more the news of it and the reasons that were put forward as having led to it were roared across italy in a great derisive burst of laughter of which the lord giovanni was the unfortunate and contemptible butt     chapter viii mene mene tekel upharsin   and now lest i grow tedious and weary you with this narrative of mine it may be well that i but touch with a fugitive pen upon the events of the next three years of the history of pesaro  early in 1498 the lord giovanni showed himself once more abroad and he seemed again the same weak cruel pleasureloving tyrant he had been before shame overtook him and drove him for a season into hiding madonna paola and her brother filippo di santafior remained in pesaro where they now appeared to have taken up their permanent abode madonna paolafollowing her inclinationswithdrew to the convent of santa caterina there to pursue in peace the studies for which she had a taste whilst her splendid profligate brother became the ornamentthe arbiter elegantiarumof our court  thus were they left undisturbed for in the cauldron of borgia politics a stew was simmering that demanded all that familys attention and of whose import we guessed something when we heard that cesare borgia had flung aside his cardinalitial robes to put on armour and give freer rein to the boundless ambition that consumed him  with me life moved as if that winter excursion and adventure had never been even the memory of it must have faded into a haze that scarce left discernible any semblance of reality for i was once again boccadoro the goldenmouthed fool whose sayings were echoed by every jester throughout italy my shame that for a brief season had risen up in arms seemed to be laid to rest once more and i was content with the burden that was mine money i had in plenty for when i pleased him the lord giovannis vails were often handsome and much of my earnings went to my poor mother who would sooner have died starving than have bought herself bread with those ducats could she have guessed at what manner of trade lazzaro biancomonte had earned them  the lord giovanni was a frequent visitor at the convent of santa caterina whither he went ever attended by filippo di santafior to pay his duty to his fair cousin in the summer of 1500 she being then come to the age of eighteen and as divinely beautiful a lady as you could find in italy she allowed herself to be persuaded by her brotherwho i make no doubt had been in his turn persuaded by the lord of pesaroto leave her convent and her studies and to take up her life at the sforza palace where filippo held by now a sort of petty court of his own  and now it fell out that the lord giovanni was oftener at the palace than at the castle and during that summer pesaro was given over to such merrymaking as it had never known before there was endless lutethrumming and recitation of verses by a score of parasite poets whom the lord giovanni encouraged posing now as a patron of letters there were balls and masques and comedies beyond number and we were as gay as though italy held no cesare borgia duke of valentinois who was sweeping northward with his allconquering flood of mercenaries  but one there was who though the very centre of all these merry doings the very one in whose honour and for whose delectation they were set afoot seemed listless and dispirited in that boisterous crowd this was madonna paola to whom rumour had it that her kinsman the lord giovanni was paying a most ardent suit  i saw her daily now and often would she choose me for her sole companion often sitting apart with me would she unburden her heart and tell me much that i am assured she would have told no other a strange thing may it have seemed this confidence between the fool and the noble lady of santafiormy holy flower of the quince as in my thoughts i grew to name her perhaps it may have been because she found me ever ready to be sober at her bidding when she needed sober company as those other foolsthe greater fools since they accounted themselves wisecould not afford her  that winter adventure betwixt cagli and pesaro was a link that bound us together and caused her to see under my motley and my masking smile the true lazzaro biancomonte whom for a little season she had known and when we were alone it had become her wont to call me lazzaro leaving that other name that they had given me for use when others were at hand yet never did she refer to my condition or wound me by seeking to spur me to the ambition to become myself again haply she was content that i should be as i sas since had i sought to become different it must have entailed my quitting pesaro and this poor lady was so bereft of friends that she could not afford to lose even the sympathy of the despised jester  it was in those days that i first came to love her with as pure a flame as ever burned within the heart of man for the very hopelessness of it preserved its holy whiteness what could i do if i would love her but love her as the dog may love his mistress more was surely not for meand to seek more were surely a madness that must earn me less and so i was content to let things be and keep my heart in check thanking god for the mercy of her company at times and for the precious confidences she made me and praying heavenfor of my love was i grown devoutthat her life might run a smooth and happy course and ready in the furtherance of such an object to lay down my own should the need arise indeed there were times when it seemed to me that it was a good thing to be a fool to know a love of so rare a purity as thatsuch a love as i might never have known had i been of her station and in such case as to have hoped to win her some day for my own  one evening of late august when the vines were heavy with ripe fruit and the scent of roses was permeating the tepid air she drew me from the throng of courtiers that made merry in the palace and led me out into the noble gardens to seek counsel with me she said upon a matter of gravest moment there under the sky of deepest blue crimsoning to saffron where the sun had set we paced awhile in silence my own senses held in thrall by the beauty of the eventide the ambient perfumes of the air and the strains of music that faintly reached us from the palace madonnas head was bent and her eyes were set upon the ground and burdened so my furtive glance assured me with a gentle sorrow at length she spoke and at the words she uttered my heart seemed for a moment to stand still  lazzaro said she they would have me marry  for a little spell there was a silence my wits seeming to have grown too numbed to attempt to seek an answer i might be content indeed to love her from a distance as the cloistered monk may love and worship some particular saint in heaven yet it seems that i was not proof against jealousy for all the abstract quality of my worship  lazzaro she repeated presently did you hear me they would have me marry  i have heard some such talk i answered rousing myself at last and they say that it is the lord giovanni who would prove worthy of your hand  they say rightly then she acknowledged the lord giovanni it is  again there was a silence and again it was she who broke it  well lazzaro she asked have you naught to say  what would you have me say madonna if this wedding accords with your own wishes then am i glad  lazzaro lazzaro you know that it does not  how should i know it madonna  because your wits are shrewd and because you know me think you this petty tyrant is such a man as i should find it in my heart to conceive affection for grateful to him am i for the shelter he has afforded us here but my lovethat is a thing i keep or fain would keep for some very different man when i love i think it will be a valorous knight a gentleman of lofty mind of noble virtues and ready address  an excellent principle on which to go in quest of a husband madonna mia but where in this degenerate world do you look to find him  are there then no such men  in the pages of bojardo and those other poets whom you have read too earnestly there may be  nay there speaks your cynicism she chided me but even if my ideals be too lofty would you have me descend from the height of such a pinnacle to the level of the lord giovannia weakspirited craven as witnesses the manner in which he permitted the borgias to mishandle him a cruel and unjust tyrant as witnesses his dealing with you to seek no further instances a weak ignorant pleasureloving fool devoid of wit and barren of ambition such is the man they would have me wed do not tell me lazzaro that it were difficult to find a better one than this  i do not mean to tell you that after all though it be my trade to jest it is not my way to deal in falsehood i think madonna that if we were to have you write for us such an appreciation of the high and mighty giovanni sforza you would leave a very faithful portrait for the enlightenment of posterity  lazzaro do not jest she cried it is your help i need that is the reason why i am come to you with the tale of what they seek to force me into doing  to force you i cried would they dare so much  aye if i resist them further  why then i answered with a ready laugh do not resist them further  lazzaro she cried her accents telling of a spirit wounded by what she accounted a flippancy  mistake me not i hastened to elucidate it is lest they should employ force and compel you at once to enter into this union that i counsel you to offer no resistance beg for a little time vaguely suggesting that you are not indisposed to the lord giovannis suit  that were deceit she protested  a trusty weapon with which to combat tyranny said i  well and then she questioned such a state of things cannot endure for ever it must end some day  i shook my head and i smiled down upon her a smile that was very full of confidence  that day will never dawn unless the lord giovannis impatience transcends all bounds  she looked at me a puzzled glance in her eyes a bewildered expression knitting her fine brows  i do not take your meaning my friend she complained  then mark the enucleation i will expound this meaning of mine through the medium of a parable in babylon of old there dwelt a king whose name was belshazzar who having fallen into habits of voluptuousness and luxury was so enslaved by them as to feast and make merry whilst a certain darius king of the medes was marching in arms against his capital at a feast one night the fingers of a mans hand were seen to write upon the wall and the words they wrote were a belated warning mene mene tekel upharsin  she looked at me her eyes round with inquiry and a faint smile of uncertainty on her lips  let me confess that your elucidation helps me but little  ponder it madonna i urged her substitute giovanni sforza for belshazzar cesare borgia for king darius and you have the key to my parable  but is it indeed so does danger threaten pesaro from that quarter  aye does it i answered almost impatiently the tide of war is surging up and presently will whelm us utterly yet here sits the lord giovanni making merry with balls and masques and burle and banquets wholly unprepared wholly unconscious of his peril there may be no hand to write a warning on his wallsor else as in the case of babylon the hand will write when it is too late to avert the evilyet there are not wanting other signs for those that have the wit to read them nor is a wondrous penetration needed  and you think then she began  i think that if you are obdurate with him he and your brother may hurry you by force into this union but if you temporise with halfpromises with suggestions that before christmas you may grow reconciled to his wishes he will be patient  but what if christmas comes and finds us still in this position  it will need a miracle for that or at least the death of cesare borgiaan unlikely event for they say he uses great precautions saving the miracle and providing cesare lives i will give the lord giovannis reign in pesaro at most two months  we had halted now and were confronting each other in the descending gloom  lazzaro dear friend she cried almost with gaiety i was wise to take counsel with you you have planted in my heart a very vigorous growth of hope  we turned soon after and started to retrace our steps for she might be illadvised to remain absent overlong  i left her on the terrace in a very different spirit from that in which she had come to me bearing with me her promise that she would act as i had advised her no doubt i had taken a load from her gentle soul and oddly enough i had taken too a load from mine  things fell out as i said they would in far as giovanni sforza and filippo were concerned madonnas seeming amenability to their wishes stayed their insistence and they could but respect her wishes to let the betrothal be delayed yet a little while and during the weeks that followed it was i scarce know whether more pitiable or more amusing to see the efforts that giovanni made to win her ardently desired affection  love has sharp eyes at times and a dullard under the influence of the baby god will turn shrewd and exert rare wiles in the conduct of his wooing giovanni by some intuition usually foreign to his dull nature seemed to divine what manner of man would be madonna paolas ideal and strove to pass himself off as possessed of the attributes of that ideal with an ardour that was pitiably comical he became an actor by the side of whom those comedians that played impromptus for his delectation were the merest bunglers with the art he gathered that madonna paola loved the poets and their stately diction and so to please her better he became a poet for the season  poeta nascitur the proverb runs and that proverbs truth was doubtless forced home upon the lord giovanni at an early stage of his excursions into the flowery meads of prosody fortunately he lacked the supreme vanity that is the attribute of most poetasters and he was able to see that such things as after hours of midnightlabour he contrived to pen would evoke nothing but her amusementunless indeed it were her scornand render him the laughingstock of all his court  so in the wisdom of despair he came to me and with a gentleness that in the past he had rarely manifested for me he asked me was i skilled in writing verse there were not wanting others to whom he might have gone for there was no lack of rhymsters about his court but perhaps he thought he could be more certain of my silence than of theirs  i answered him that were the subject to my taste i might succeed in throwing off some passable lines upon it he pressed gold upon me and bade me there and then set about fashioning an ode to madonna paola and to forget when they were done under pain of a whipping to the bone that i had written them  i obeyed him with a right goodwill for what subject of all subjects possible was there that made so powerful an appeal to my inclinations within an hour he had the odenot perhaps such a poem as might stand comparison with the verses of messer petrarca yet a very passable effusion chaste of conceit and palpitating with sincerity and adoration it was in that that i addressed her as the holy flower of the quince which was the symbol of the house of santafior  so great an impression made that ode that on the morrow the lord giovanni came to me with a second bribe and a second threat of torture i gave him a sonnet of petrarchian manner which went near to outshining the merits of the ode and now these requests of the lord giovannis assumed an almost daily regularity until it came to seem that did affairs continue in this manner for yet a little while i should have earned me enough to have repurchased biancomonte and so ended my troubles and good was the value that i gave him for his gold how good he never knew for how was he the clod to guess that this despised jester of his court was pouring out his very soul into the lines he wrote to the tyrants orders  it is scant wonder that at last madonna paola who had begun by smiling was touched and moved by the ardent worship that sighed from those perfervid verses so touched indeed was she as to believe the lord giovannis love to be the pure and holy thing those lines presented it and to conclude that his love had wrought in him a wondrous and ennobling transformation that so she thought i have the best of all reasons to affirm for i had it from her very lips one day  lazzaro she sighed it is occurring to me that i have done the lord giovanni an injustice i have misgauged his character i held him to be a shallow unlettered clown devoid of any finer feelings yet his verses have a merit that is far above the common note of these writings and they breathe such fine and lofty sentiments as could never spring from any but a fine and lofty soul  how i came to keep my tongue from wagging out the truth i scarcely know it may be that i was frightened of the punishment that might overtake me did i betray my master but i rather think that it was the fear of betraying myself and so being flung into the outer darkness where there was no such radiant presence as madonna paolas for had i told her it was i had penned those poems that were the marvel of the court she must of necessity have guessed my secret for to such quick wits as hers it must have been plain at once that they were no vapourings of artistry but the hot expressions of a burning truth it was in thatin their supreme sinceritythat their chief virtue lay  thus weeks wore on the vintage season came and went the roses faded in the gardens of the palazzo sforza and the trees put on their autumn garb of gold october was upon us and with it came at last the fear that long ago should have spurred us into activity and now that it came it did not come to stimulate but to palsy terrorstricken at the conquering advance of valentinowhich was the name they now gave cesare borgia a name derived from his duchy of valentinoisgiovanni sforza abruptly ceased his revelling and made a hurried appeal for help to francesco gonzaga lord of mantuahis brotherinlaw through the lord of pesaros first marriage the mantuan marquis sent him a hundred mercenaries under the command of an albanian named giacomo as well might he have sent him a hundred figs wherewith to pelt the army of valentino  disaster swooped down swiftly upon the lord of pesaro his very people seeing in what case they were and how unprepared was their tyrant to defend them wisely resolved that they would run no risks of fire and pillage by aiding to oppose the irresistible force that was being hurled against us  it was on the second sunday in october that the storm burst over the lord giovannis head he was on the point of leaving the castle to attend mass at san domenico and in his company were filippo sforza of santafior and madonna paola besides courtiers and attendants amounting in all to perhaps a score of gallant cavaliers and ladies the cavalcade was drawn up in the quadrangle and giovanni was on the point of mounting when of a sudden a rumbling noise as of distant thunder but too continuous for that arrested him his foot already in the stirrup  what is that he asked an ashen pallor overspreading his effeminate face as doubtless the thought of the enemy came uppermost in his mind  men looked at one another with fear in their eyes and some of the ladies raised their voices in querulous beseeching for reassurance they had their answer even as they asked the albanian giacomo who was now virtually the provost of the castle appeared suddenly at the gates with half a score of men he raised a warning hand which compelled the lord giovanni to pause then he rasped out a brisk command to his followers the winches creaked and the drawbridge swung up even as with a clank and rattle of chains the portcullis fell  that done he came forward to impart the ominous news which one of his riders had brought him at the gallop from the porta romana  a party of some fifty men commanded by one of cesares captains had ridden on in advance of the main army to call upon pesaro to yield to the forces of the church and the people without hesitation had butchered the guard and thrown wide the gates inviting the enemy to enter the town and seize the castle and to the end that this might be the better achieved a hundred or so had traitorously taken up arms and were pressing forward to support the little company that came with such contemptuous daring to storm our fortress and prepare the way for valentino  it was a pretty situation this for the lord giovanni and here were fine opportunities for some brave acting under the eyes of his adored madonna paola how would he bear himself now i wondered  he promised mighty well once the first shock of the news was overcome  by god and his saints he roared though it may be all that it is given me to do ill strike a blow to punish these dastards who have betrayed me and to crush the presumption of this captain who attacks us with fifty men it is a contempt which he shall bitterly repent him  then he thundered to giacomo to marshal his men and he called upon those of his courtiers who were knights to put on their armour that they might support him lastly he bade a page go help him to arm that he might lead his little force in person  i saw madonna paolas eyes gleam with a sudden light of admiration and i guessed that in the matter of giovannis valour her opinions were undergoing the same change as the verses had caused them to undergo in the matter of his intellect  myself i was amazed for here was a lord giovanni i seemed never to have known and i was eager to behold the sequel to so fine a prologue     chapter ix the foolatarms   that valorous bearing that the lord giovanni showed whilst with madonna paolas glance upon him his fear of seeming afraid was greater than his actual fear of our assailants he cast aside like a mantle once he was within the walls of his castle and under the eyes of none save the page and myself for i followed idly at a respectful distance  he stood irresolute and livid of countenance his eagerness to arm and to lead his mercenaries and his knights all departed out of him it was that curiosity of mine to see the sequel to his stout words that had led me to follow him and what i saw was after all no more than i might have looked forthe proof that his big talk of sallying forth to battle was but so much acting yet it must have been acting of such a quality as to have deceived even his very self  now however by the main steps he halted in the cool gloom of the gallery and i saw that fear had caught his heart in an icy grip and was squeezing it empty in his irresolution he turned about and his gloomy eye fell upon me loitering in the porch at that he turned to the page who followed in obedience to his command  begone he growled at the lad i will have boccadoro there to help me arm and with a poor attempt at mirththe act is a madness he muttered and so it is fitting that folly should put on my armour for it come with me you he bade me and i obediently gladly went forward and up the wide stone staircase after him leaving the page to speculate as he listed on the matter of his abrupt dismissal  i read the lord giovannis motives as clearly as if they had been written for me by his own hand the opinion in which i might hold him was to him a matter of so small account that he little cared that i should be the witness of the weakness which he feared was about to overcome himnay which had overcome him already was i not the one man in pesaro who already knew his true nature as revealed by that matter of the verses which i had written and of which he had assumed the authorship he had no shame before me for i already knew the very worst of him and he was confident that i would not talk lest he should destroy me at my first word and yet there was more than that in his motive for choosing me to go with him in that hour as i was to learn once we were closeted in his chamber  boccadoro he cried can you not find me some way out of this under his beard i saw the quiver of his lips as he put the question  out of this i echoed scarce understanding him at first  aye manout of this castle out of pesaro bestir those wits of yours is there no way in which it might be done no disguise under which i might escape  escape quoth i looking at him and endeavouring to keep from my eyes the contempt that was in my heart dear god had revenge been all i sought of him how i might have gloated over his miserable downfall  do not stand there staring with those hollow eyes he cried anger and fear blending horridly in his voice and rendering shrill its pitch find me a way come knave find me a way or ill have you broken on the wheel set your wits to save that long lean body from destruction think i bid you  he was moving restlessly as he spoke swayed by the agitation of terror that possessed him like a devil i looked at him now without dissembling my scorn even in such an hour as this the habit of hectoring cruelty remained him  what shall it avail me to think i asked him in a voice that was as cold and steady as his was hot and quavering were you a bird i might suggest flight across the sea to you but you are a man a very human a very mortal man although your father made you lord of pesaro  even as i was speaking the thunder of the besiegers reached our earssuch a dull roar it was as that of a stormy sea in winter time maddened by his terror he stood over me now his eyes flashing wildly in his white face  another word in such a tone he rasped his fingers on his dagger and ill make an end of you i need your help animal  i shook my head my glance meeting his without fear i was of twice his strength we were alone and the hour was one that levelled ranks had he made the least attempt to carry out his threat had he but drawn an inch of the steel he fingered i think i should have slain him with my hands without fear or thought of consequences  i have no help for you such as you need i answered him i am but the fool of pesaro whoever looked to a fool for miracles  but here is death he almost moaned  lord of pesaro i reminded him your mercenaries are under arms by your command and your knights are joining them they wait for the fulfilment of your promise to lead them out against the enemy shall you fail them in such an hour as this  he sank limp as an empty scabbard to a chair  i dare not go it is death he answered miserably  and what but death is it to remain here i asked torturing him with more zest than ever he had experienced over the agonies of some poor victim on the rack in bearing yourself gallantly there lies a slender chance for you your people seeing you in arms and ready to defend them may yet be moved to a return of loyalty  a fig for their loyalty was his peevish craven answer what shall it avail me when im slain  god was there ever such a coward as this such a weaksouled waterhearted dastard  but you may not be slain i urged him and then i sounded a fresh note bethink you of madonna paola and of the brave things you promised her  he flushed a little then paled again then sat very still shame had touched him at last yet its grip was not enough to make a man of him a moment he remained irresolute whilst that shame fought a hard battle with his fears  but those fears proved stronger in the end and his shame was overthrown by them  i dare not he gasped his slender delicate hands clutching at the arms of his chair heaven knows i am not skilled in the use of arms  it asks no skill i assured him put on your armour take a sword and lay about you the most ignorant scullion in your kitchens could perform it given that he had the spirit  he moistened his lips with his tongue and his eyes looked dead as a snakes suddenly he rose and took a step towards the armour that was piled about a great leathern chair then he paused and turned to me once more  help me to put it on he said in a voice that he strove to render steady yet scarcely had i reached the pile and taken up the breastplate when he recoiled again from the task he broke into a torrent of blasphemy  i will not sacrifice myself he almost screamed jesus not i i will find a way out of this i will live to return with an army and regain my throne  a most wise purpose but meanwhile your men are waiting for you madonna paola di santafior is waiting for you andharkthe bellowing crowd is waiting for you  they wait in vain he snarled who cares for them the lord of pesaro am i  care you then nothing for them will you have your name written in history as that of a coward who would not lift his sword to strike one blow for honours sake ere he was driven out like a beast by the mere sound of voices  that touched him his vanity rose in arms  take up that corselet he commanded hoarsely i did his bidding and without a word he raised his arms that i might fit it to his breast yet in the instant that i turned me to pick up the backpiece a crash resounded through the chamber he had hurled the breastplate to the ground in a fresh access of terrorrage he strode towards me his eyes glittering like a madmans  go you he cried and with outstretched arms he pointed wildly across the courtyard you are very ready with your counsels let me behold your deeds do you put on the armour and go out to fight those animals  he raved he ranted he scarce knew what he said or did and yet the words he uttered sank deep into my heart and a sudden wild ambition swelled my bosom  lord of pesaro i cried in a voice so compelling that it sobered him if i do this thing what shall be my reward  he stared at me stupidly for a moment then he laughed in a silly crackling fashion  eh he queried gesu and he passed a hand over his damp brow and threw back the hair that cumbered it what is the thing that you would do fool  why the thing you bade me i answered firmly put on your armour and shut down the visor so that all shall think it is the lord giovanni tyrant of pesaro who rides if i do this thing and put to rout the rabble and the fifty men that cesare borgia has sent what shall be my reward  he watched me with twitching lips his glare fixed upon me and a faint colour kindling in his face he saw how easy the thing might be perhaps he recalled that he had heard that i was skilled in armshaving spent my youth in the exercise of them against the time when i might fling the challenge that had brought me to my fools estate maybe he recalled how i had borne myself against long odds on that adventure with madonna paola years ago just such a vanity as had spurred him to have me write him verses that he might pretend were of his own making moved him now to grasp at my proposal they would all think that giovannis armour contained giovanni himself none would ever suspect boccadoro the fool within that shell of steel his honour would be vindicated and he would not lose the esteem of madonna paola indeed if i returned covered with glory that glory would be his and if he elected to fly thereafter he might do so without hurt to his fair name for he would have amply proved his mettle and his courage  in some such fashion i doubt not that the high and mighty giovanni sforza reasoned during the seconds that we stood face to face and eye to eye in that room the cries of the impatient ones below almost drowned in the roar of the multitude beyond  at last he put out his hands to seize mine and drawing me to the light he scanned my face heaven alone knowing what it was he sought there  if you do this said he biancomonte shall be yours again if it remains in my power to bestow it upon you now or at any future time i swear it by my honour  swear it by your fear of hell or by your hope of heaven and the compact is made i answered and so palsied was he and so fallen in spirit that he showed no resentment at the scorn of his honour my words implied but there and then took the oath i that demanded  and now i urged help me to put on this armour of yours  hurriedly i cast off my jesters doublet and my headdress with its jangling bells and with a wild exultation a joy so fierce as almost to bring tears to my eyes i held my arms aloft whilst that poor craven strapped about my body the back and breast plates of his corselet i the fool stood there as arrogant as any knight whilst with his noble hands the lord of pesaro kneeling made secure the greaves upon my legs the sollerets with golden spurs the cuissarts and the genouilleres then he rose up and with hands that trembled in his eagerness he put on my brassarts and shoulderplates whilst i myself drew on my gauntlets next he adjusted the gorget and handed me last of all the helm a splendid headpiece of black and gold surmounted by the sforza lion  i took it from him and passed it over my head then ere i snapped down the visor and hid the face of boccadoro i bade him unless he would render futile all this masquerade to lock the door of his closet and lie there concealed till my return at that a sudden doubt assailed him  and what quoth he if you do not return  in the fever that had possessed me this was a thing that had not entered into my calculations nor should it now i laughed and from the hollow of my helmet not a doubt but the sound must have seemed charged with mockery i pointed to the cap and doublet i had shed  why then illustrious it will but remain for you to complete the change  dog he cried beast do you deride me  my answer was to point out towards the yard  they are clamouring said i they wax impatient i had better go before they come for you as i spoke i selected a heavy mace for only weapon and swinging it to my shoulder i stepped to the door on the threshold he would have stayed me purged by his fear of what might befall him did i not return but i heeded him not  fare you well my lord of pesaro said i see that none penetrates to your closet make fast the door  stay he called after me do you hear me stay  others will hear you if you commit this folly i called back to him get you to cover and so i left him  below in the courtyard my coming was hailed by a great enthusiastic clamour they had all but abandoned hope of seeing the lord giovanni so long had he been about his arming as they brought forward my charger i sought with my eyes madonna paola i beheld her by her brotherwho it seemed was not going with usin the front rank of the spectators her cheeks were tinged with a slight flush of excitement and her eyes glowed at the brave sight of armed men  i mounted and as i rode past her to take my place at the head of that company i lowered my mace and bowed she detained me a moment setting her hand upon the glossy neck of my black charger  my lord she said in a low voice intended for my ear alone this is a brave and gallant thing you do and however slight may be your hope of prevailing yet your honour will be safeguarded by this act and men will remember you with respect should it come to pass that a usurper shall possess anon your throne bear you that in mind to lend you a glad courage i shall pray for you my lord till you return  i bowed answering never a word lest my voice should betray me and musing on the matter of the strange roads that lead to a womans heart i passed on to gain the van  two months ago knowing giovanni as he was he had been detestable to her and she contemplated with loathing the danger in which she stood of being allied to him by marriage since then he had made good use of a poor jesters mental gifts to incline her by the fervour of some verses to a kindlier frame of mind and now making good use of that same jesters courage he completed her subjection by the display of it she was prepared to wed the lord giovanni with a glad heart and a proud willingness whensoever he should desire it  but giacomo was beside me now and in the quadrangle a silence reigned all waiting for my command from without there came such a din as seemed to argue that all hell was at the castle gates there were shouts of defiance and screams of abuse whilst a constant rain of stones beat against the raised drawbridge  they thought no doubt that giovanni and his followers were at their prayers cowering with terror no notion had they of the armed force some six score strong that waited to pour down upon them i briskly issued my command and four men detached themselves and let down the bridge it fell with a crash and ere those without had well grasped the situation we had hurled ourselves across and into them with the force of a wedge flinging them to right and to left as we crashed through with hideous slaughter the bridge swung up again when the last of giacomos mercenaries was across and we were shut out in the midst of that fierce human maelstrom  for some five minutes there raged such a brief hot fight as will be remembered as long as pesaro stands no longer than that did it take for the crowd of citizens to realise that war was not their trade and that they had better leave the fighting to cesare borgias men and so they fell away and left us a clear road to come at the menatarms but already some forty of our saddles were empty and the fight though brief had proved exhausting to many of us  before us like an array of mirrors in the october sun shone the serried ranks of the steelcased borgia soldiers their lances in rest waiting to receive us their leader a gigantic man whose head was armed by no more than a pot of burnished steel from which escaped the long red ringlets of his hair was that same ramiro del orca who had commanded the party pursuing madonna paola three years ago he was since become the most redoubtable of cesares captains and his name was perhaps the best hated in italy for the grim stories that were connected with it  as we rode on he backed to join the foremost rank of his soldiers and his voicea voice that stentor might have enviedtrumpeted a laugh at sight of us  gesu he roared so that i heard him above the thunder of our hoofs what has come to giovanni sforza has he perchance become a man since madonna lucrezia divorced him i will bear her the news of it my good giovannimy living thunderbolt of jove  his men echoed his boisterous mood infected by it and this i argued boded ill for the courage of those that followed me another moment and we had swept into them and many there were who laughed no more or went to laugh with those in hell  for myself i singled out the blustering ramiro and i let him know it by a swinging blow of my mace upon his morion it was a most finelytempered piece of steel for my stroke made no impression on it though ramiro winced and raised his stout sword to return the compliment  body of god he croaked you become a very god of war giovanni to me then my lusty mars well make a fight of it that poets shall sing of over winter fires look to yourself  his sword caught me a cunning wellaimed blow on the side of my helm and thence glanced to my shoulder but for the quality of giovannis headpiece of a truth there had been an end to the warring of a fool i smote him back a mighty blow upon his epauliere that shore the steel plate from his shoulder and left him a vulnerable spot at that he swore ferociously and his bloodshot eyes grew wicked as the fiends a second time he essayed that sidelong blow upon my helm and with such force and ready address that he burst the fastening of my visor on the left so that it swung down and left my beaver open  with a cry of triumph he closed with me and shortened his sword to stab me in the face and then a second cry escaped him for the countenance he beheld was not the countenance he had looked to see instead of the fair skin the handsome features and the bearded mouth of the lord giovanni he beheld a shaven face a hooked nose and a complexion swarthy as the devils  i know you rogue he roared by the host your valour seemed too fierce for giovanni sforza you are bocca  exerting all the strength that i had been gradually collecting i hurled him back with a force that almost drove him from the saddle and rising in my stirrups i rained blow after blow upon his morion ere he could recover  dog i muttered softly your knowledge shall be the death of you  he drew away from me at last and during the moments that i spent in readjusting my visor he sallied and charged me again his blustering was gone and his face grown pale for such blows as mine could not have been without effect not a doubt of it but he was taken with amazement to find such fighting qualities in a foolan amazement that must have eclipsed even that of finding boccadoro in the armour of giovanni sforza  again he swung his sword in that favourite stroke of his but this time i caught the edge upon my mace and ere he could recover i aimed a blow straight at his face he lowered his head like a bull on the point of charging and so my blow descended again upon his morion but with a force that rolled him senseless from the saddle  before i could take a breathing space i was beset by at least a dozen of his followers who had stood at hand during the encounter never doubting that victory must be ultimately with their invincible captain they drove me back foot by foot fighting lustily and performingit was said afterwards by the anxious ones that watched us from the castle among whom was madonna paolasuch deeds of strength and prowess as never romancer sang of in his wildest flight of fancy  my men had suffered sorely but the brave giacomo still held them together fired by the example that i set him until in the end the day was ours discouraged by the disabling of their captain so soon as they had gathered him up our opponents thought of nothing but retreat and retreat they did hotly pursued by us and never allowed to pause or slacken rein until we had hurled them out of the town of pesaro to get them back to cesare borgia with the tale of their ignominious discomfiture     chapter x the fall of pesaro   as we rode back through the town of pesaro some fifty men of the six score that had sallied from the castle a halfhour ago we found the streets wellnigh deserted the rebellious citizens having fled back to the shelter of their homes like rats to their burrows in time of peril  as we advanced through the shambles that we had left about the castle gates it occurred to me that within the courtyard a crowd would be waiting to receive and welcome me and it became necessary to devise some means of avoiding this reception i beckoned giacomo to my side  let it be given out that i will speak to no man until i have rendered thanks to heaven for this signal victory i muttered to the unsuspecting albanian do you clear a way for me so soon a we are within  he obeyed me so well that when the bridge had been let down he preceded me with a couple of his men and gently but firmly pressed back those that would have approachedamong the first of whom were madonna paola and her brother  way he shouted make way for the high and mighty lord of pesaro  thus i passed through my halfshattered visor sufficiently closed still to conceal my face and in this manner i gained the door of the eastern wing and dismounted two or three attendants sprang forward ready to go with me that they might assist me to disarm but i waved them imperiously back and mounted the stairs alone alone i crossed the antechamber and tapped at the door of the lord giovannis closet instantly it opened for he had watched my return and been awaiting me hastily he drew me in and closed the door  he was flushed with excitement and trembling like a leaf yet at the sight that i presented he lost some of his high colour and recoiled to stare at my armour battered dinted and splashed with browning stains which loudly proclaimed the fray through which i had been  he fell to praising my valour to speaking of the great service i had rendered him and of the gratitude that he would ever entertain for me all in terms of a fawning cloying sweetness that disgusted me more than ever his cruelties had done i took off my helmet whilst he spoke and let it fall with a crash the face i revealed to him was livid with fatigue and blackened with the dust that had caked upon my sweat he came forward again and helped hastily to strip off my harness and when that was done he fetched a great silver basin and a ewer of embossed gold from which he poured me fragrant rosewater that i might wash macerated sweet herbs he found me lupin meal and glasswort the better that i might cleanse myself and when at last i was refreshed by my ablutions he poured me a goblet of a fullbodied golden wine that seemed to infuse fresh life into my veins and all the time he spoke of the prowess i had shown and lamented that all these years he should have had me at his court and never guessed my worth  at length i turned to resume my clothes and since it must excite comment and perhaps arouse suspicion were i to appear in any but my jesters garish livery i once more assumed my foliated cape my cap and bells  wear it yet for a little while he said and thus complete the service you have done me presently you may doff it for all time and resume your true estate biancomonte as i promised you shall be yours again the lord of pesaro does not betray his word  i smiled grimly at the pride of his utterance  it is an easy thing said i freely to give that which is no longer ours  he coloured with the anger that was ever ready  what shall that mean he asked  why that in a few days you will have cesare borgia here and you will be lord of pesaro no more i have saved your honour for you more than that it were idle to attempt  think not that i shall submit he cried i shall find in italy the help i need to return and drive the usurper out you must have faith in that yourself else had you never bargained with me as you have done for the return of your estates  to that i answered nothing but urged him to go below and show himself and the better that he might bear himself among his courtiers i detailed to him the most salient features of that fight  he went not without a certain uneasiness which however was soon dispelled by the thunder of acclamation with which he was received not only by his courtiers but by the soldiers who had fought in that hot skirmish and who believed that it was he had led them  meanwhile i sat above in the closet he had vacated and thence i watched him with such mingling feelings in my heart as baffle now my halting pen scorn there was in my mood and a hot contempt of him that he could stand there and accept their acclamation with an air of humility that i am persuaded was assumed a certain envious anger was there too to think that such a weakkneed lilylivered craven should receive the plaudits of the deeds that i his buffoon had performed for him those acclamations were not for him although those who acclaimed him thought so they were for the man who had routed ramiro del orca and his followers and that man assuredly was i yet there i crouched above behind the velvet curtains where none might see me whilst he stood smiling and toying with his brown beard and listening to the fine words of praise that i could imagine were falling from the lips of madonna paola who had drawn near and was speaking to him  there is in my nature a certain love of effectiveness a certain taste for theatrical parade and the contriving of odd situations this bent of mine was whispering to me then to throw wide the window and stemming their noisy plaudits announce to them the truth of what had passed yet what if i had done so they would have accounted it but a new jest of boccadoro the fool and one so illconceived that they might urge the lord giovanni to have him whipped for it  aye it would have been a folly a futile act that would have earned me unbelief contempt and anger and yet there was a moment when jealousy urged me almost headlong to that rashness for in madonna paolas eyes there was a new expression as they rested on the face of giovanni sforzaan expression that told me she had come to love this man whom a little while ago she had despised  god was there ever such an irony was there ever such a paradox she loved him and yet it was not him she loved the man she loved was the man who had shown the qualities of his mind in the verses with which the court was ringing the man who had that morning given proof of his high mettle and knightly prowess by the deeds of arms he had performed i was that mannot he at whom so adoringly she looked and soi argued in my warped way and with the philosophy worthy of a foolit was i whom she loved and giovanni was but the symbol that stood for me he represented the songs and the deeds that were mine  but if i did not throw wide that window and proclaim the fact to ears that would have been deaf to the truth of them what think you that i did i took a subtler vengeance i repaired to my own chamber procured me pen and ink and there with a heart that was brimming over with gall i penned an epic modelled upon the stately lines of virgil wherein i sang the prowess of the lord giovanni sforza describing that mornings mighty feat of arms and detailing each particular of the combat twixt giovanni and ramiro del orca  it was a brave thing when it was done a finer and worthier poetical achievement than any that i had yet encompassed and that night after they had supped as merrily as though duke valentino had never been heard of and whilst they were still sitting at their wine i got me a lute and stole down to the banqueting hall  i announced myself by leaping on a table and loudly twanging the strings of my instrument there was a hush succeeded by a burst of acclamation they were in a high goodhumour and the fool with a new song was the very thing they craved  when silence was restored i began and whilst my fingers moved sluggishly across the strings striking here and there a chord i recited the epic i had penned my voice swelled with a feverish enthusiasm whose colossal irony none there save one could guess he at first surprised grew angry presently as i could see by the cloud that had settled on his brow yet he restrained himself and the rest of the company were too enthralled by the breathless quality of my poem to bestow their glances on any countenance save mine  madonna paola sat upon the lord of pesaros right and her blue eyes were round and her lips parted with enthusiasm as i proceeded and when presently i came to that point in the fight betwixt giovanni and ramiro del orca when ramiro having broken down the lord giovannis visor was on the point of driving his sword into his adversarys face i saw her shrink in a repetition of the mornings alarm and her bosom heaved more swiftly as though the issue of that combat hung now upon my lines and she were made anxious again for the life of the man whom she had learnt to love  i finished on a slow and stately rhythm my voice rising and falling softly after the manner of a gregorian chant as i dwelt on the piety that had succeeded the lord of pesaros brave exploits and how upon his return from the stricken field he had repaired straight to his closet his battered and bloody harness on his back that he might kneel ere he disarmed and render thanks to god for the victory vouchsafed him  on that te deum i finished softly and as my voice ceased and the vibration of my last chord melted away a thunder of applause was my reward  men leapt from their chairs in their enthusiasm and crowded round the table on which i was perched whilst when presently i sprang down one noble woman kissed me on the lips before them all saying that my mouth was indeed a mouth of gold  madonna paola was leaning towards the lord giovanni her eyes shining with excitement and filmed with tears as they proudly met his glance and i knew that my song had but served to endear him the more to her by causing her to realise more keenly the brave qualities of the adventure that i sang the sight of it almost turned me faint and i would have eluded them and got away as i had come but that they lifted me up and bore me so to the table at which the lord giovanni sat he smiled but his face was very pale could it be that i had touched him could it be that i had driven the iron into his soul and that he could not bear to confront me knowing what a dastard i must deem him  the splendid filippo of santafior had risen to his feet and was waving a white bejewelled hand in an imperious demand for silence when at last it came he spoke his voice silvery and his accents mincing  lord of pesaro i demand a boon he who for years has suffered the ignominy of the motley is at last revealed to us as a poet of such magnitude of soul and richness of expression that he would not suffer by comparison with the great bojardo or tim greater virgil let him be stripped for ever of that hideous garb he wears and let him be treated hereafter with the dignity his high gifts deserve thus shall the day come when pesaro will take honour in calling him her son  loud and long was the applause that succeeded his words and when at last it had died down the lord giovanni proved equal to the occasion like the consummate actor that he was  i would said he that these high gifts of which tonight he has afforded proof could have been employed upon a worthier subject i fear me that since you have heard his epic you will be prone to overestimate the deed of which it tells the story i would too my friends he continued with a sigh that it were still mine to offer him such encouragement as he deserves but i am sorely afraid that my days in pesaro are numbered that my sands are all but runat least for a little while the conqueror is at our gates and it would be vain to set against the overwhelming force of his numbers the handful of valiant knights and brave soldiers that today opposed and scattered his forerunners it is my intention to withdraw now that my honour is safe by what has passed and that none will dare to say that it was through fear that i fled yet my absence i trust may be but brief i go to collect the necessary resources for i have powerful friends in this italy whose interests touching the duca valentino go hand in hand with mine and who will thus be the readier to lend me assistance once i have this i shall return and thenwoe to the vanquished  the tide of enthusiasm that had been rising as he spoke now overflowed swords leapt from their scabbardsmere toy weapons were they meant more for ornament than offence yet were they the earnest of the stouter arms those gentlemen were ready to wield when the time came he quieted their clamours with a dignified wave of the hand  when that day comes i shall see to it that boccadoro has his deserts meanwhile let the suggestion of my illustrious cousin be acted upon and let this gifted poet be arrayed in a manner that shall sort better with the nobility of his mind that tonight he has revealed to us  thus was it that i came at last to shed the motley and move among men garbed as themselves and with my outward trappings i cast off too the name of boccadoro and i insisted upon being known again as lazzaro biancomonte  but in so far as the court of pesaro was concerned this new life upon which i was embarked was of little moment for on the tuesday that followed that first sunday in october of such momentous memory the lord giovannis court passed out of being  it came about with his flight to bologna accompanied by the albanian captain and his men as well as by several of the knights who had joined in sundays fray ardently as i came afterwards to learn did he urge madonna paola and her brother to go with them and i believe that the lady would have done his will in this had not the lord filippo opposed the step he was no warrior himself he sworefor it was a thing he made open boast of affecting to despise all who followed the coarse trade of armsand as for his sister it was not fitting that she should go with a fugitive party made up of a handful of knights and some fifty rough mercenaries and be exposed to the hardships and perils that must be theirs not even when he was reminded that the advancing conqueror was cesare borgia did it affect him for despite his shallow mincing ways and his paraded scorn of war and warriors the lord filippo was stout enough at heart he did not fear the borgia he answered serenely and if he came he would offer him such hospitality as lay within his power  he came at last did the mighty cesare although between his coming and giovannis flight a full fortnight sped as for myself i spent the time at the sforza palace whither the lord filippo had carried me as his guest he being greatly taken with me and determined to become my patron we had news of giovanni first from bologna and later from ravenna whither he was fled at first he talked of returning to pesaro with three hundred men he hoped to have from the marquis of mantua but probably this was no more than another piece of that big talk of his meant to impress the sorrowing and repining madonna paola who suffered more for him maybe than he suffered himself  she would talk with me for hours together of the lord giovanni of his mental gifts and of his splendid courage and military address and for all that my gorge rose with jealousy and with the force of this injustice to myself i held my peace indeed indeed it was better so for all that i was no longer boccadoro the fool yet as lazzaro biancomonte the poet i was not so much better that i could indulge any mad aspirations of my own such as might have led me to betray the dastard who had arrayed his craven self in the peacock feathers of my achievements  in the course of the confidence with which the lord filippo honoured me i made bold on the eve of cesares arrival to suggest to him that he should remove his sister from the palace and send her to the convent of santa caterina whilst the borgia abode in the town lest the sight of her should remind cesare of the oldtime marriage plans which his family had centred round this lady and lead to their revival filippo heard me kindly and thanked me freely for the solicitude which my counsel argued for the rest however it was a counsel that he frankly admitted he saw no need to follow  in the three years that are sped since the holy father entertained such plans for the temporal advancement of his nephew ignacio the fortunes of the house of borgia have so swollen that what was then a desirable match for one of its members is now scarcely worthy of their attention i do not think he concluded that we have the least reason to fear a renewal of that suit  it may be that i am by nature suspicious and quick to see ignoble motives in mens actions but it occurred to me then that the lord filippo would not be so greatly put about if indeed the borgias were to reopen negotiations for the bestowing of madonna paolas hand upon the popes nephew ignacio that swelling of the borgia fortunes which in the three years had taken place and which he contended would render them more ambitious than to seek alliance with the house of santafior rendered them nevertheless in his eyes a more desirable family to be allied with than in the days when he had counselled his sisters flight from rome and so i thought despite what stood between her and the lord giovanni filippo would know no scruple now in urging her into an alliance with the house of borgia should they manifest a willingness to have that old affair reopened  on the 29th of that same month of october cesare arrived in pesaro his entry was a triumphant procession and the orderliness that prevailed among the two thousand menatarms that he brought with him was a thing that spoke eloquently for the wondrous discipline enforced by this great condottiero  the lord filippo was among those that met him and like the timeserver that he was he placed the sforza palace at his disposal  the duca valentino came with his retinue and the gentlemen of his household among whom was ever conspicuous by his great size and red ugliness the captain ramiro del orca who now seemed to act in many ways as cesares factotum this captain for reasons which it is unnecessary to detail i most sedulously avoided  on the evening of his arrival cesare supped in private with filippo and the members of filippos householdthat is to say with madonna paola and two of her ladies and three gentlemen attached to the person of the lord filippo cesares only attendants were two cavaliers of his retinue bartolomeo da capranica his fieldmarshal and dorio savelli a nobleman of rome  cesare borgia this man whose name had so terrible a sound in the ears of italys little princelings this man whose power and whose great gifts of mind had made him the subject of such bitter envy and fear until he was the besthated gentleman in italyand therefore the most calumniatedwas little changed from that cardinal of valencia in whose service i had been for a brief season the pallor of his face was accentuated by the illhealth in which he found himself just then and the air of feverish restlessness that had always pervaded him was grown more marked in the years that were sped as was after all but natural considering the nature of the work that had claimed him since he had deposed his priestly vestments he was splendidly arrayed and he bore himself with an imperial dignity a dignity nevertheless tempered with graciousness and charm and as i regarded him then it was borne in upon me that no fitter name could his godfathers have bestowed on him than that of cesare  the lord filippo exerted all his powers worthily to entertain his noble and illustrious guest and by his extreme almost servile affability it not only would seem that he had forgotten the favour and shelter he had received at the hands of the lord giovanni but it confirmed my suspicions of his willingness to advance his own fortunes by breaking with the fallen tyrant in so far as his sister was concerned  short of actually making the proposal itself it would seem that filippo did all in his power to urge his sister upon the attention of cesare but duke valentinos mind at that time was too full of the concerns of conquest and administration to find room for a matter to him so trifling as the enriching of his cousin ignacio by a wealthy alliance to this alone i thought was it due that madonna paola escaped the persecution that might then have been hers  on the morrow cesare moved on to rimini leaving his administrators behind him to set right the affairs of pesaro and ensure its proper governing in his name hereafter  and now that for the present my hopes of ever seeing my own wrongs redressed and my estates returned to me were too slender to justify my remaining longer in pesaro i craved of the lord filippo permission to withdraw telling him frankly that my tardily aroused duty called me to my widowed mother whom for some six years i had not seen he threw no difficulty in the way of my going and i was free to depart and now came the hidden pain of my leavetaking of madonna paola she seemed to grieve at my departure  lazzaro she cried when i had told her of my intention do you too desert me and i have ever held you my best of friends  i told her of the mother and of the duty that i owed her whereupon she remonstrated no more nor sought to do other than urge me to go to her and then i spoke of madonnas kindness to me and of the friendship with which she had honoured one so lowly and in the end i swore with my hand on my heart and my soul on my lips that if ever she had work for me she would not need to call me twice  this ring madonna said i was given me by the lord cesare borgia and was to have proved a talisman to open wide for me the door to fortune it did better service than that madonna it was the talisman that saved you from your pursuers that day at cagli three years ago  you remind me lazzaro she cried of how much you have sacrificed in my service yours must be a very noble nature that will do so much to serve a helpless lady without any hope of guerdon  nay nay i answered lightly you must not make so much of it it would never have sorted with my inclinations to have turned manatarms this ring madonna that once has served you i beg that you will keep for it may serve you again  i could not lazzaro i could not she exclaimed recoiling yet without any show of deeming presumptuous my words or of being offended by them  if you would make me the reward that you say i have earned you will do this for me it will make me happier madonna take iti thrust it into her unwilling handand if ever you should need me send it back to me that ring and the name of the place where you abide by the lips of the messenger you choose and with a glad heart as fast as horse can bear me shall i ride to serve you once again  in such a spirit yes said she i take it willingly to treasure it as a buckler against danger since by means of it i can bring you to my aid in time of peril  madonna do not overestimate my powers i besought her i would have you see in me no more than i am but it sometimes happens that the mouse may aid the lion  and when i need the lion to aid the mouse my good lazzaro i will send for you  there were tears in her voice and her eyes were very bright  addio lazzaro she murmured brokenly may god and his saints protect you i will pray for you and i shall hope to see you again some day my friend  addio madonna was all that i could trust myself to say ere i fled from her presence that she might not see my deep emotion nor hear the sobs that were threatening to betray the anguish that was ravaging my soul     part ii the ogre of cesena  chapter xi madonnas summons  however great the part that my mothersainted woman that she wasmay have played in my life she nowise enters into the affairs of this chronicle so that it would be an irrelevance and an impertinence to introduce her into these pages of the joy with which she welcomed me to the little home near biancomonte in which the earnings of boccadoro the fool had placed her it could interest you but little to read in detail nor could it interest you to know of the gentle patience with which she cheered and humoured me during the period that i sojourned there tilling the little plot she owned reaping and garnering like any born villano with a womans quick intuition she guessed perhaps the canker that was eating at my heart and with a mothers blessed charity she sought to soothe and mitigate my pain  it was during this period of my existence that the poetic gifts i had discovered myself possessed of whilst at pesaro burst into full bloom and not a little relief did i find in the penning of those lovesongsthe true expression of what was in my heartwhich have since been given to the world under the title of le rime di boccadoro and what time i tended my mothers land by day and wrote by night of the feverish despairing love that was consuming me i waited for the call that sooner or later i knew must come what prophetic instinct it was had rooted that certainty in my heart i do not pretend to say perhaps my hope was of such a strength that it assumed the form of certainty to solace the period of my hermitage but that some day madonna paolas messenger would arrive bringing me the borgia ring i was as confident as that some day i must die  two years went by and we were in the autumn of 1502 yet my faith knew no abating my confidence was strong as ever and at last that confidence was justified one night of early october as i sat at supper with my mother after the labours of the day a sound of hoofs disturbed the peace of the silent night it drew rapidly nearer and long before the knock fell upon our door i knew that it was the messenger from my lady  my mother looked at me across the board an expression of alarm overspreading her old face who her eyes seemed to ask me was this horseman that rode so late  my hound rose from the hearth with a growl and stood bristling his eyes upon the door whitehaired old silvio the last remaining retainer of the house of biancomonte came forth from the kitchen with inquiry and fear blending on his wrinkled weatherbeaten countenance  and i seeing all these signs of alarm yet knowing what awaited me on the threshold rose with a laugh and in a bound had crossed the intervening space i flung wide the door and from the gloom without a mans voice greeted me with a question  is this the house of messer lazzaro biancomonte  i am that lazzaro biancomonte answered i what may your pleasure be  the stranger advanced until he came within the light he was plainly dressed and wore a jerkin of leather and long boots from his air i judged him a servant or a courier he doffed his hat respectfully and held out his right hand in which something was gleaming yellow it was the borgia ring  pesaro was all he said  i took the ring and thanked him then bade him enter and refresh himself ere he returned and i called old silvio to bring wine  i am not returning the man informed me i am a courier riding to parma whom madonna charged with that message to you in passing  nevertheless he consented to rest him awhile and sip the wine we set before him and what time he did so i engaged him in talk and led him to tell me what he knew of the trend of things at pesaro and what news there was of the lord giovanni he had little enough to tell pesaro was flourishing and prospering under the borgia dominion of the lord giovanni there was little news saving that he was living under the protection of the gonzagas in mantua and that so long as he was content to abide there the borgias seemed disposed to give him peace  next i made him tell me what he knew of filippo di santafior and madonna paola on this subject he was better informed madonna paola was well and still lived with her brother at the palace of pesaro the lord filippo was high in favour with the borgias and cesare lately had been frequently his guest at pesaro whilst once for a few days the lord ignacio de borgia had accompanied his illustrious cousin  i flushed and paled at that piece of news and the reason of her summons no longer asked conjecture it was an easy thing for me knowing what i knew to fill in the details which the courier omitted in ignorance from the story  the lord filippo seeking his own advancement had so urged his sister upon the notice of the borgia familyperhaps even approached cesarein such a manner that it was again become a question of wedding her to ignacio who had meanwhile remained unmarried i could read that opportunists motives as easily as if he had written them down for my instruction giovanni sforza he accounted lost beyond redemption and i could imagine how he had plied his wits to aid his sister to forget him or else to remember him no longer with affection whether he had succeeded or not i could not say until i had seen her but meanwhile deeming ripe the soil of her heart for the new attachment that should redound so much to his own creditnow that the house of borgia had risen to such splendid heightshe was driving her into this alliance with ignacio  faithful to the very letter of the promise i had made her i set out that same night after embracing my poor tearful mother and promising to return as soon as might be all night i rode my soul now tortured with anxiety now exalted at the supreme joy of seeing madonna which was so soon to be mine i was at the gates of pesaro before matins and within the palazzo sforza ere its inmates had broken their fast  the lord filippo welcomed me with a certain effusion chiding me for my long absence and the ingratitude it had seemed to indicate and never dreaming by what summons i was brought back  you are wellreturned he told me in conclusion we shall need you soon to write an epithalamium  you are to be wed magnificent quoth i at last at which he laughed consumedly  nay we shall need the song for my sisters nuptials she is to wed the lord ignacio borgia before christmas  a lofty theme i answered with humility and one that may well demand resources nobler than those of my poor pen  then get you to work at once upon it i will have your chamber prepared  he sent for his seneschal a personlike most of the servants at the palacestrange to me and he gave orders that i should be sumptuously lodged he was grown more splendid than ever in the prosperity that seemed to surround him here at pesaro in this palace that had undergone such changes and been so enriched during the past two years as to go near defying recognition  when the seneschal had shown me to the quarters he had set apart for me i made bold to make inquiries concerning madonna paola  she is in the garden illustrious answered the seneschal deeming me no doubt a great lord from the respect which filippo had indicated should be shown me madonna has the wisdom to seek the little sunshine the year still holds winter will be soon upon us  i agreed with the old man and dismissed him so soon as he was gone i quitted my chamber and all dust staineded as i was i made my way down to the garden a turn in one of the boxwoodbordered alleys brought me suddenly face to face with madonna paola  a moment we stood looking at each other my heart swelling within me until i thought that it must burst then i advanced a step and sank on one knee before her  you sent for me madonna i am here there was a pause and when presently i looked up into her blessed face i saw a smile of infinite sorrow on her lips blending oddly with the gladness that shone from her sweet eyes  you faithful one she murmured at last dear lazzaro i did not look for you so soon  within an hour of your messengers arrival i was in the saddle nor did i pause until i had reached the gates of pesaro i am here to serve you to the utmost of my power madonna and the only doubt that assails me is that my power may be all too small for the service that you need  is its nature known to you she asked in wonder then ere i had answered she bade me rise and with her own hand assisted me  i have guessed it answered i guided by such scraps of information as from your messenger i gleaned it concerns unless i err the lord ignacio borgia  your wits have lost nothing of their quickness she said with a sad smile and i doubt me you know all  the only thing i did not know your brother has just told methat you are to be wed before christmas he has ordered me to write your epithalamium  she drew into step beside me and we slowly paced the alley side by side and as we went withered leaves overhead and withered leaves to make a carpet for our fret she told me in her own way more or less what i have set down even to her brothers selfseeking share in the transaction that she dubbed hideous and abhorrent  she was little changed this winsome lady in the time that was sped she was in her twentyfirst year but in reality she seemed to me no older than she had been on that day when first i saw her arguing with her grooms upon the road to cagli and from this i reassured myself that she had not been fretted overmuch by the absence of the lord giovanni  presently she spoke of him and of her plighted word which her brother and those supple gentlemen of the house of borgia were inducing her to dishonour  once before in a case almost identical when all seemed lost you cameas if heaven directedto my rescue this it is that gives me confidence in such aid as you might lend me now  alas madonna i sighed but the times are sorely changed and the situations with them what is there now that i can do  what you did then take me beyond their reach  ah but whither  whither but to the lord giovanni is it not to him that my troth is plighted  i shook my head in sorrow a thrust of jealousy cutting me the while  that may not be said i it were not seemly unless the lord giovanni were here himself to take you hence  then i will write to the lord giovanni she cried i will write and you shall bear my letter  what think you will the lord giovanni do i burst out with a scorn that must have puzzled her think you his safety does not give him care enough in the hidingplace to which he has crept that he should draw upon himself the vengeance of the borgias  she stared at me in ineffable surprise but the lord giovanni is brave and valiant she cried and down in my heart i laughed in bitter mockery  do you love the lord giovanni madonna i asked bluntly  my question seemed to awaken fresh astonishment it may well be that it awakened too reflection she was silent for a little space then  i honour and respect him for a noble chivalrous and gifted gentleman she answered me and her answer made me singularly content spreading a balm upon the wounds my soul had taken but to her fresh intercessions that i should carry a letter to him i shook my head again my mood was stubborn  believe me madonna it were not only unwise but futile  she protested  i swear it would be i insisted with a convincing force that left her staring at me and wondering whence i derived so much assurance we must wait from now till christmas we have more than two months in two months much may befall as a last resource we may consider communication with the lord giovanni but it is a forlorn hope madonna and so we will leave it until all else has failed us  she brightened at my promise that at least if other measures proved unavailing we should adopt that course and her brightening flattered me for it bore witness to the supreme confidence she had in me  lazzaro said she i know you will not fail me i trust you more than any living mam more i think than even the lord giovanni whom if god pleases i shall some day wed  thanks madonna mia i answered gratefully indeed it is a trust that i shall ever strive to justify meanwhile have faith and hope and wait  once before when to escape the schemes of her brother who would have wed her to the lord giovanni she had appealed to me the counsel i had given her had been much the same as that which i gave her now at the irony of it i could have laughed had any other been in question but madonna paolathis tender white flower of the quince that was like to be rudely wilted by the ruthless hands of scheming men     chapter xii the governor of cesena   that night i would have supped in my own quarters but that filippo sent for me and bade me join him and swell the little court he kept at times i believe he almost thought that he was the true lord of pesaroan opinion that may have been shared by not a few of the citizens themselves certainly he kept a greater state and was better housed than the duke of valentinois governor  it was a jovial company of perhaps a dozen nobles and ladies that met about his board and filippo bade his servants lay for me beside him as we ate he questioned me touching the occupation that i had found during my absence from pesaro i used the greatest frankness with him and answered that my life had been partly a peasants partly a poets  tell me what you wrote he bade me his eyes resting on my face with a new look of interest for his love of letters was one of the few things about him that was not affected  a few novelle dealing with courtlife but chiefly verses answered i  and with these verseswhat have you done  i have them by me illustrious i answered he smiled seemingly well pleased  you must read them to us he cried if they rival that epic of yours which i have never forgotten they should be worth hearing  and presently supper being done i went at his bidding to my chamber for my precious manuscripts and returning i entertained the company with the reading of a portion of what i had written they heard me with an attention that might have rendered me vain had my ambition really lain in being accounted a great writer and when i paused now and again there was a murmur of applause and many a pat on the shoulder from filippo whenever a line a phrase or a stanza took his fancy  i was perhaps too absorbed to pay any great attention to the impression my verses were producing but presently in one of my pauses the lord filippo startled me with words that awoke me to a sense of my imprudence  do you know lazzaro of what your lines remind me in an extraordinary measure  of what excellency i asked politely raising my eyes from my manuscript they chanced to meet the glance of madonna paola it was riveted upon me and its expression was one i could not understand  of the lovesongs of the lord giovanni sforza answered he they resemble those poems infinitely more than they resemble the epic you wrote two years ago  i stammered something about the similarity being merely one of subject but he shook his head at that and took good note of my confusion  no said he the resemblance goes deeper there is the same facile beauty of the rhymes the same freshness of the rhythmremotely resembling that of petrarca yet very different conceits similar to those that were the beauty spots of the lord giovannis verses are ubiquitous in yours and above all there is the same fervent earnestness the same burning tone of sincerity that rendered his strambotti so worthy of admiration  it may be i answered him my confusion growing under the steady gaze of madonna paola it may be that having heard the verses of the lord giovanni i may unconsciously have modelled my own lines upon those that made so deep an impression on me  he looked at me gravely for a moment  that might be an explanation he answered deliberately but frankly if i were asked i should give a very different one  and that would be came sharp and compelling the voice of madonna  he turned to her shrugged his shoulders and laughed why since you ask me he said i should hazard the opinion that lazzaro here was of considerable assistance to the lord giovanni in the penning of those verses with which he delighted us alland you madonna i believe particularly  madonna paola crimsoned and her eyes fell the others looked at us with inquiring glancesat her at filippo and at me with a fresh laugh filippo turned to me  confess now am i not right he asked goodhumouredly  magnificent i murmured in tones of protest ask yourself the question was it a likely thing that the lord giovanni would enlist the services of his jester in such a task  give me a straightforward answer he insisted am i right or wrong  i am giving you more than a straightforward answer my lord i still evaded him and more boldly now i am setting you on the highroad to solve the matter for yourself by an appeal to your own good sense and reason was it in the least likely i repeat that the lord giovanni would seek the services of his fool to aid him write the verses in honour of the lady of his heart  with a burst of mocking laughter filippo smote the table a blow of his clenched hand  your prevarications answer me he cried you will not say that i am wrong  but i do say that you are wrong i exclaimed suddenly inspired i did not assist the lord giovanni with his verses i swear it  his laughter faded and his eyes surveyed me with a sudden solemnity  then why did you evade my question he demanded shrewdly and then his countenance changed as swiftly again it was illumined by the light of sudden understanding i have it he cried the answer is plain you did not assist the lord giovanni to write them why because you wrote them yourself and you gave them to him that he might pass them off as his own  it was a merciful thing for me that the whole company fell into a burst of laughter and applauded filippos quick discernment which they never doubted all talked at once and a hundred proofs were advanced in support of filippos opinion the lord giovannis celebrated dullness of mind amounting almost to stupidity was cited and they reminded one another of the profound astonishment with which they had listened to the compositions that had suddenly burst from him  filippo turned to his sister on whose pale face i saw it written that she was as convinced as any there and my feelings were those of a dastard who has broken faith with the man who trusted him  do you appreciate now madonna he murmured the deceits and wiles by which that craven crept like a snake into your esteem  i guessed at once that by that thrust he sought to incline her more to the union he had in view for her  at least he was no craven answered she his burning desire to please me may have betrayed him into this foolish duplicity but he still must live in my memory as a brave and gallant gentleman or have you forgotten filippo that noble combat with the forces of ramiro del orca  to such a question filippo had no answer and presently his mood sobered a little for myself i was glad when the time came to withdraw from that company that twitted and pestered me and played upon my sense of shame at the imprudence i had committed  now that i look back i can scarce conceive why it should have so wrought upon me for in truth the little love i bore the lord giovanni might rather have led me to rejoice that his imposture should be laid bare to the eyes of all the world i think that really there was an element of fear in my feelingsfear that upon reflection madonna paola might ask herself how came that burning sincerity into the lovesongs written in her honour which it was now disclosed that i had penned the answer she might find to such a question was one that might arouse her pride and so outrage it as to lead her to cast me out of her friendship and never again suffer me to approach her  such a conclusion however she fortunately did not arrive at haply she accounted the fervour of those lines assumed for when on the morrow she met me she did no more than gently chide me for the deceit that i had had a hand in practising upon her she accepted my explanation that my share in that affair had been wrung from me with threats of torture and putting it from her mind she returned to the matter of the approaching alliance she sought to elude renewing her prayers that i should aid her  i have she told me then one other friend who might assist us and who has the power perhaps if he but has the will he is the governor of cesena and for all that he holds service under cesare borgia yet he seems much devoted to me and i do not doubt that to further my interests he would even consent to pit his wits against those of the family he serves  in which case madonna answered i spurred to it perhaps by an insensate pang of jealousy at the thought that there should be another beside myself to have her confidence he would be a traitor and it is ever an ill thing to trust a traitor who once betrays may betray again  that she manifested no resentment but on the contrary readily agreed with me showed me how idle had been that jealousy of mine and made me ashamed of it  why yes she mused it is the very thought that had occurred to me and caused me to spurn the aid he proffered when last he was here  ah i cried what aid was that  you must know lazzaro said she that he comes often to pesaro from cesena being a man in whom the duke places great trust and on whom he has bestowed considerable powers he never fails to lie at the palace when he comes and he seems toto have conceived a regard for me he is a man of twice my years she added hurriedly and haply looks upon me as he might upon a daughter  i sniffed the air i had heard of such men  a week ago when last he came i was cast down and grieved by the affair of this marriage which filippo had that day disclosed to me the governor of cesena observing my sadness sought my confidence with a kindliness of which you would scarce believe him capable for he is a fierce and blustering man of war in the fulness of my heart there was nothing that seemed so desirable as a friendly ear into which i might pour the tale of my affliction he heard me gravely and when i had done he placed himself at my disposal assuring me that if i would but trust myself to him he would defeat the ends of the house of borgia not until then did i seem to bethink me that he was the servant of that house and his readiness to betray the hand that paid him sowed mistrust and a certain loathing of him in my mind i let him see it perhaps which was unwise and may be even ungrateful he seemed deeply wounded and the subject was abandoned but i have since thought that perhaps i acted with a rashness that was  with a rashness that was eminently justifiable i interrupted her you could not have been better advised than to have mistrusted such a man  but touching this same governor of cesena there was a fine surprise in store for me at dusk some two days later there was a sudden commotion in the courtyard of the palace and when i inquired of a groom into its cause i was informed that his excellency the governor of cesena had arrived  curious to see this man whose willingness to betray the house he served where madonna was concerned was by no means difficult to probe i descended to the banquetinghall at supper time  they were not yet at table when i entered and a group was gathered in the centre of the room about a huge man at sight of whose red head and crimson brutal face i would have turned and sought again the refuge of my own quarters but that his wolfs eye had already fastened on me  body of god he swore and that was all but his eyes were on me in a marvellous stare as were nowimpelled by that oath of histhe eyes of all the company we looked at each other for a moment then a great laugh burst from him shaking his vast bulk and wrinkling his hideous face he thrust the intervening men aside as if they had been a growth of sedges he would penetrate and he advanced towards me the lord filippo and his sister looking on with all the rest in interested surprise  in front of me he halted and setting his hands on his hips he regarded me with a brutal mirth  what may your trade be now he asked at last contemptuously  i had taken rapid stock of him in the seconds that were sped and from the surpassing richness of his apparel his goldbroidered doublet and crimson furedged surcoat i knew that messer ramiro del orca was grown to the high estate of governor of cesena  a new trade even as yours i answered him  nay that is no answer he cried overlooking my offensiveness do you still follow the trade of arms  i think filippo interposed that our excellency is in some error this gentleman is lazzaro biancomonte a poet of whom italy will one day be proud despite the fact that for a time he acted as the lord giovanni sforzas fool  ramiro looked at his interlocutor as the mastiff may look at the lap dog he grunted and blew out his cheeks  there is yet another part he played said he as i have good cause to rememberfor he is the only man that can boast of having unhorsed ramiro del orca he was for a brief season the lord giovanni sforza himself  how asked the profoundly amazed filippo whilst all present pressed closer to miss nothing of the disclosure that seemed to impend myself i groaned there was naught that i could say to stem the tide of revelation that was coming  do you then keep this paladin here arrayed like a clerk quoth ramiro in his sardonic way and can it be that the secret of his feat of arms has been guarded so well that you are still in ignorance of it  filippos wits worked swiftly and swiftly they pieced together the hints that ramiro had let fall  you will tell us said he that the fight in the streets of pesaro in which your excellencys party suffered defeat was led by biancomonte in the armour of giovanni sforza  ramiro looked at him with that displeasure with which the jester visits the man who by anticipation robs his story of its points  it was known to you growled he  not so i have but learnt it from you but it nowise astonishes me  and he looked at his sister whose eyes devoured me as if they would read in my soul whether this thing were indeed true under her eyes i dropped my glance like a man ashamed at hearing a disgraceful act of his paraded  had it indeed been the lord giovanni he had been dead that day laughed ramiro grimly indeed it was nothing but my astonishment at sight of the face i was about to stab after having broken the fastenings of his visor that stayed my hand for long enough to give him the advantage but i bear you no grudge for that he ended turning on me with a ferocious smile nor yet for that other trick by whichas boccadoro the foolyou bested me i am not a sweet man when thwarted yet i can admire wit and respect courage but see to it he ended with a sudden and most unreasonable ferocity his visage empurpling if possible still more see to it that you pit neither that courage nor that wit against me again i have heard the story of how you came to be fool of the court of pesaro cesena is a dull place and we might enliven it by the presence of a jester of such nimble wits as yours  he turned without awaiting my reply and strode away to take his place at table whilst i walked slowly to my accustomed seat and took little part in the conversation that ensued which as you may imagine had me and that exploit of mine for scope  anon an elephantine trumpeting of laughter seemed to set the air aquivering ramiro was lying back in his chair a prey to such a passion of mirth that it swelled the veins of his throat and brow until i thought that they must burstand from my soul i hoped they would adown his rugged cheeks two tears were slowly trickling the lord filippo as presently transpired had been telling him of the epic i had written in praise of the lord giovannis prowess naught would now satisfy that ogre but he must have the epic read and filippo who had retained a copy of it went in quest of it and himself read it aloud for the delight of all assembled and the torture of myself who saw in madonna paolas eyes that she accounted the deception i had practised on her a thing beyond pardon  filippo had a taste for letters as i think i have made clear and he read those lines with the same fire and fervour that i myself had breathed into them two years ago but instead of the rapt and breathless attention with which my reading had been attended the present company listened with a smile whilst ever and anon a short laugh or a quiet chuckle would mark how well they understood tonight the subtle ironies which had originally escaped them  i crept away sick at heart while they were still making sport over my work cursing the lord giovanni who had forced me to these things and my own mad mood that had permitted me in an evil hour to be so forced yet my grief and bitterness were little things that night compared with what madonna was to make them on the morrow  she sent for me betimes and i went in fear and trembling of her wrath and scorn how shall i speak of that interview how shall i describe the immeasurable contempt with which she visited me and which i felt was perhaps no more than i deserved  messer biancomonte said she coldly i have ever accounted you my friend and disinterested the motives that inspired a heart seemingly noble to do service to a forlorn and helpless lady it seems that i was wrong that the indulging of a warped and malignant spirit was the inspiration you had to appear to befriend me  madonna you are overcruel i cried out wounded to the very soul of me  am i so she asked with a cold smile upon her ivory face is it not rather you who were cruel was it a fine thing to do to trick a lady into giving her affection to a man for gifts which he did not possess you know in what manner of regard i held the lord giovanni sforza so long as i saw him with the eyes of reason and in the light of truth and you who were my one professed friend the one man who spoke so loudly of dying in my service you falsified my vision you masked himeither at his own and at my brothers bidding or else out of the malignancy of your naturein a garb that should render him agreeable in my eyes do you realise what you have done does not your conscience tell you you have contrived that i have plighted my troth to a man such as i believed the lord giovanni to be mother of mercy she ended with a scorn ineffable when i dwell upon it now it almost seems that it was to you i gave my heart for yours were the deeds that earned my regardnot his  such was the very argument that i had hugged to my starving soul at the time the things she spoke of had befallen and it had consoled me as naught in life could have consoled me yet now that she employed it with such a scornful emphasis as to make me realise how far beneath her i really was how immeasurably beyond my reach was she it was as much consolation to me as confession without absolution may be to the perishing sinner i answered nothing i could not trust myself to speak besides what was there that i could say  i summoned you back to pesaro she continued pitilessly trusting in your fine words and deeming honest the offer of services you made me now that i know you you are free to depart from pesaro when you will  despite my shame i dared at last to raise my eyes but her face was averted and she saw nothing of the entreaty nothing of the grief that might have told her how false were her conclusions one thing alone there was might have explained my actions might have revealed them in a new light but that one thing i could not speak of  i turned in silence and in silence i quitted the room for that i thought was after all the wisest answer i could make     chapter xiii poison   despite madonna paolas dismissal i remained in pesaro indeed had i attempted to leave it is probable that the lord filippo would have deterred me for i was much grown in his esteem since the disclosures that had earned me the disfavour of madonna but i had no thought of going i hoped against hope that anon she might melt to a kinder mood or else that by yet aiding her despite herself to elude the borgia alliance i might earn her forgiveness for those matters in which she held that i had so gravely sinned against her  the epithalamium meanwhile was forgotten utterly and i spent my days in conceiving wild plans to save her from the lord ignacio only to abandon them when in more sober moments their impracticable quality was borne in upon me  in this fashion some six weeks went by and during the time she never once addressed me we saw much during those days of the governor of cesena indeed his time seemed mainly spent in coming and going twixt cesena and pesaro and it needed no keen penetration to discern the attraction that brought him he was ever all attention to madonna and there were times when i feared that perhaps she had been drawn into accepting the aid that once before he had proffered but these fears were shortlived for as time sped madonnas aversion to the man grew plain for all to see yet he persisted until the very eve almost of her betrothal to ignacio  one evening in early december i chanced through the purest accident to overhear her sharp repulsion of the suit that he had evidently been pressing  madonna i heard him answer with a snarl i may yet prove to you that you have been unwise so to use ramiro del orca  if you so much as venture to address me again upon the subject she returned in the very chilliest accents i will lay this matter of your odious suit before your master cesare borgia  they must have caught the sound of my footsteps in the gallery in which they stood and ramiro moved away his purple face pale for once and his eyes malevolent as satans  i reflected with pleasure that perhaps we had now seen the last of him and that before that threat of madonnas he would see fit to ride home to cesena and remain there but i was wrong with incredible effrontery and daring he lingered the morrow was a sunday and on the tuesday or wednesday following cesare borgia and his cousin ignacio were expected filippo was in the best of moods and paid more heed to the governor of cesenas presence at pesaro than he did to mine it may be that he imagined ramiro del orca to be acting under cesares instructions  that sunday night we supped together and we were all tolerably gay the topic of our talk being the coming of the bridegroom madonnas was the only downcast face at the board she was pale and worn and there were dark circles round her eyes that did much to mar the beauty of her angel face and inspired me with a deep and sorrowing pity  ramiro announced his intention of leaving pesaro on the morrow and ere he went he begged leave to pledge the beautiful lady of santafior who was so soon to become the bride of the valiant and mighty ignacio borgia it was a toast that was eagerly received so eager and uproariously that even that poor lady herself was forced to smile for all that i saw it in her eyes that her heart was on the point of breaking  i remember how when we had drunk she raised her gobleta beautiful chaste cup of solid goldand drank herself in acknowledgment and i remember too how chancing to move my head i caught a most singular illomened smile upon the coarse lips of messer ramiro  at the time i thought of it no more but in the morning when the horrible news that spread through the palace gained my ears that smile of ramiro del orca recurred to me at once  it was from the seneschal of the palace that i first heard that tragic news i had but risen and i was descending from my quarters when i came upon him his old face white as death a palsy in his limbs  have you heard the news ser lazzaro he cried in a quavering voice  the news of what i asked struck by the horror in his face  madonna paola is dead he told me with a sob  i stared at him in speechless consternation and for a moment i seemed forlorn of sense and understanding  dead i remember whispering what is it you say and i leaned forward towards him peering into his face what is it you say  well may you doubt your ears he groaned but vergine santissima it is the truth madonna paola that sweet angel of god lies cold and stiff they found her so this morning  god of heaven i cried out and leaving him abruptly i dashed down the steps  scarce knowing what i did acting upon an impulsive instinct that was as irresistible as it was unreasoning i made for the apartments of madonna paola in the antechamber i found a crowd assembled and on every face was pallid consternation written of my own countenance i had a glimpse in a mirror as i passed it was ashen and my hollow eyes were wild as a madmans  someone caught me by the arm i turned it was the lord filippo pale as the rest his affectations all fallen from him and the man himself revealed by the hand of an overwhelming sorrow with him was a grave whitebearded gentleman whose sober robe proclaimed the physician  this is a black and monstrous affair my friend he murmured  is it true is it really true my lord i cried in such a voice that all eyes were turned upon me  your grief is a welcome homage to my own he said alas dio santo it is most hideously true she lies there cold and white as marble i have just seen her come hither lazzaro he drew me aside away from the crowd and out of that antechamber into a closet that had been madonnas oratory with us came the physician  this worthy doctor tells me that he suspects she has been poisoned lazzaro  poisoned i echoed body of god but by whom we all loved her there was not in pesaro a man worthy of the name but would have laid down his life in her service who was there then to poison that dear saint  it was then that the memory of ramiro del orca and the look that in his eyes i had surprised whilst madonna drank flashed back into my mind  where is the governor of cesena i cried suddenly filippo looked at me with quick surprise  he departed betimes this morning for his castle why do you ask  i told him why i asked i told him what i knew of ramiros attentions to madonna of the rejection they had suffered and of the vengeance he had seemed to threaten filippo heard me patiently but when i had done he shook his head  why all being as you say should he work so wanton a destruction he asked stupidly as if jealousy were not cause enough to drive an evil man to destroy that which he may not possess nay nay your wits are disordered you remember that he looked at madonna whilst she drank and you construe that into a proof that he had poisoned the cup she drank from but then it is probable that we all looked at her in that same moment  but not with such eyes as his i insisted  could he have administered the poison with his own hands asked the doctor gravely  no said i that were a difficult matter but he might have bribed a servant to drop a powder in her wine  why then said he it should be an easy thing to find the servant do you chance to remember who served the wine  i remember answered filippo readily  let the man be questioned let him be racked if necessary thus shall you probably arrive at a true knowledge thus discover under whose directions he was working  it was the only thing to do and filippo sent me about it there and then telling me the servant in question was a venetian of the name of zabatello if confirmation had been needed that this fellow had been the tool of the poisonerthere was no reason to suppose that he would have done the thing to have served any ends of his ownthat confirmation i had upon discovering that zabatello was fled from pesaro leaving no trace behind him  men were sent out by the lord filippo in every direction to endeavour to find the rogue and bring him back whether they caught him or not seemed after all a little thing to me she was dead that was the one allabsorbing alleffacing fact that took possession of my mind blotting out all minor matters that might be concerned with it even the now assured fact that she had been poisoned was a thing that found little room in my consideration on that day of my burning grief  she was dead dead dead the hideous phrase boomed again and again through my distracted mind compared with that overwhelming catastrophe what signified to me the how or why or when she had died she was dead and the world was empty  for hours i sat on the rocks alone by the sea on that stormy day of december and i indulged my grief where no prying eyes could witness it amid the solitude of wild and angry nature and the moan and thud with which the great waves hurled themselves against the base of the black rock on which i was perched afforded but a feeble echo of the storm that raged and beat within my desolated soul  she was dead dead dead the waves seemed to shout it as they leapt up and spattered me with brine the wind now moaned it piteously now shrieked it fiercely as it scudded by wrapping its invisible coils about me and seeming intent on tearing me from my restingplace  towards evening at last i rose and skirting the castle i entered the town dishevelled and bedraggled yet caring nothing what spectacle i might afford and presently a grim procession overtook me and at sight of the black cowled and visored figures that advanced in the lurid light of their wax torches i fell on my knees there in the street and so remained my knees deep in the mud my head bowed until her sainted body had been borne past none heeded me they bore her to san domenico and thither i followed presently and in the shadow of one of the pillars of the aisle i crouched whilst the monks chanted their funereal psalms  the singing ended the friars departed and presently those of the court and the sightseers from the streets began to leave the church in an hour i was alonealone with the beloved dead and there on my knees i stayed and whether i prayed or blasphemed during that horrid hour my memory will not let me say  it may have been towards the third hour of night when at last i staggered upstiff and cramped from my long kneeling on the cold stone slowly in a halfdazed condition i move down the aisle and gained the door of the church i essayed to open it it resisted my efforts and then i realised that it was locked for the night  the appreciation of my position afforded me not the slightest dismay on the contrary i think my feelings were rather of relief i had not known whither i should repairso distraught was my moodand now chance had settled the matter for me by decreeing that i should remain  i turned and slowly i paced back until i stood beside the great black catafalque at each corner of which a tall wax taper was burning my footsteps rang with a hollow sound through the vast gloomy spaces of that cold empty church my very breathing seemed to find an echo in it but these were not things to occupy my mind in such a season no more than was the icy cold by which i was halfnumbedyet of which i seemed to remain unconscious in the absorbing anguish that possessed me  near the foot of the bier there was a bench and there i sat me down and resting my elbows on my knees i took my dishevelled head between my frozen hands my thoughts were all of her whose poor murdered clay was there encased above me i reviewed i think each scene of my life where it had touched on hers i evoked every word she had addressed to me since first i had met her on the road to cagli  and anon my mood changed and from cold and frozen that it had been by grief it grew ablaze with the fire of anger and the lust to wreak vengeance upon him that had brought her to this condition let filippo fear to move without proofs let him doubt such proofs as i had set before him and deem them overslender to warrant action such scruples should not serve to restrain me i was no lukewarm brother here in pesaro i would remain until her poor body was delivered to the earth and then i would set out upon a last emprise messer ramiro del orca should account to me for this vile deed  there in the house of peace i sat gnawing my hands and maturing my bloody plans whilst the night wore on later a still more frenzied mood obsessed mea burning desire to look again upon the sweet face of her i had loved the sainted visage of madonna paola what was there to deter me who was there to gainsay me  i stood up and uttered that challenge aloud in my madness my voice echoed mournfully up the aisles and the sound of the echo chilled me yet my purpose gathered strength  i advanced and after a moments pause with the silverbroidered hem of the pall in my hands i suddenly swept off that mantle of black cloth setting up such a gust of wind as all but quenched the tapers i caught up the bench on which i had been sitting and dragging it forward i mounted it and stood now with my breast on a level with the coffinlid i laid hands on it and found it unfastened without thought or care of how i went about the thing i raised it and let it crash over to the ground it fell on the stone flags with a noise like that of thunder which boomed and reverberated along the gloomy vault above  a figure all in purest white lay there under my eyes the face covered by a veil with deepest reverence and a prayer to her sainted soul to forgive the desecration of my loving hands i tremblingly drew that veil aside how beautiful she was in the calm peace of death she lay there like one gently sleeping the faintest smile upon her lips and as i looked it seemed hard to believe that she was truly dead why her lips had lost nothing of their colour they were as rosy redor nearly soas ever i had seen them in life how could this be the lips of the dead are wont to put on a livid hue i stared a moment my reverence and grief almost effaced by the intensity of my wonder this face so ivory pale wore not the ashen aspect of one that would never wake again there was a warmth about that pallor and then i caught my nether lip in my teeth until it bled and it is a miracle that i did not scream seeing how overwrought was my condition  for it had seemed to me that the draperies on her bosom had slightly moved a gentle almost imperceptible heave as if she breathed i looked and there it came again  god into what madness was i come that my eyes could so deceive me it was the draught that stirred the air about the church and blew great shrouds of wax adown the tapers yellow sides i manned myself to a more sober mood and looked again  and now my doubts were all dispelled i knew that i had mastered any errant fancy and that my eyes were grown wise and discriminating and i knew too that she lived her bosom slowly rose and fell the colour of her lips the hue of her cheeks confirmed the assurance that she breathed the poison had failed in its work  i paused a second yet to ponder that morning her appearance had been such that the physician had been deceived by it and had pronounced her cold yet now there were these signs of life what could it portend but that the effects of the poison were passing off and that she was recovering  in the wild madness of joy that sent the blood drumming and beating through my brain my first impulse was to run for help then i bethought me of the closed doors and i realised that no matter how i shouted none would hear me i must succour her myself as best i could and meanwhile she must be protected from the chill air of that december night in that church that was colder than the tomb i had my cloak a heavy serviceable garment and if more were needed there was the pall which i had removed and which lay in a heap about the legs of my bench  i leaned forward and passing my hand under her head i gently raised it then slipping it downwards i thrust my arm after it until i had her round the waist in a firm grip thus i raised her from the coffin and the warmth of her body on my arm the ready supple bending of her limbs were so many added proofs that she was not dead  gently and reverently i lifted her in my arms an intoxication of holy joy pervading me and the prayers falling faster from my lips than ever they had done since as a lad i had recited them at my mothers knee a moment i laid her on the bench whilst i divested myself of my cloak then suddenly i paused and stood listening holding my breath  steps were advancing towards the door  my first impulse was to rush forward and call to those who came shouting my news and imploring their help then a sudden an almost instinctive suspicion caught and chilled me who was it came at such an hour what could any man seek in the church of san domenico at dead of night was the church indeed their goal or were they but passersby  that last question went not long unanswered the steps came nearer whilst i stood appalled my skin roughening like a dogs they halted at the door something heavy hurtled against it  a voice the voice of ramiro del orcai knew it upon the instantreached my ears which concentration had rendered superacute  it is locked baldassare get out those tools of yours and force it  my wits were working now at feverpace it may be that i am swift of thought beyond the ordinary man or it may be that what then came to me was either a flash of inspiration or the conclusion to which i leapt by instinct but in that moment the whole plot of madonnas poisoning was revealed to me poisoned she had beenaye but by some drug that did but produce for a little while the outward appearance of death so truly simulated as to deceive the most experienced of doctors i had heard of such poisons and here in very truth was one of them at work his vengeance on her for her indifference to his suit was not so clumsy and primitive as that of simply slaying her he had by his infernal artifice intended secretly to bear her off tomorrow when men found a broken churchdoor and a violated bier they would set the sacrilege down to some wizard who had need of the body for his dark practices of magic  i cursed myself in that hour that i had not earlier been moved to peer into her coffin whilst yet there might have been time to have saved her now the sweat stood out in beads upon my brow at that door there were to judge by the sound of footsteps and of voices some three or four men besides messer ramiro for only weapon i had my dagger what could i do with that to defend her ramiros plan would suffer no frustration through my discovery when tomorrow the sacrilege was discovered the cold body of lazzaro biancomonte lying beside the desecrated bier would be but an item in the work of profanation they would findan item that nowise would modify the conclusion to which i anticipated they would come     chapter xiv requiescat   a strange and mysterious thing is the working of terror on the human mind some it renders incapable of thought or action paralysing their limbs and stagnating the blood in their veins such creatures die in anticipating death others under the stress of that grim passion have their wits preternaturally sharpened the instinct of selfpreservation assumes command of all their senses and urges them to swift and feverish action  i thank god with a full heart that to this latter class do i belong after one gelid moment spent with eyes and mouth agape my hands fallen limp beside me and my hair bristling with affright i became myself again and never calmer than in that dread moment i went to work with superhuman swiftness my cheeks may have been livid my very lips bloodless but my hands were steady and my wits under full control  concealmentconcealment for myself and herwas the thing that now imported and no sooner was the thought conceived than the means were devised slender means were they yet heaven knows i was in no case to be exacting and since they were the best the place afforded i must trust to them without demurring and pray god that messer ramiro might lack the wit to search and with that fresh hope it came to me that i must find a way so to dispose as to make him believe that to search would be a futile waste of energy  the odds against me lay in the little time at my disposal yet a little time there was the door was stout and messer ramiro might take no violent means of bursting it lest the noise should arouse the streetand i well could guess how little he would relish having lights to shine upon this deed of night of his  with what tools his sbirro was at work i could not say but surely they must be such as would leave me a few moments already the fellow had begun i could make out a soft crunching sound as of steel biting into wood to act then  with movements swift as a cats and as silent i went to work like a ghost i glided round the coffin to the other side where the lid was lying i took it up and when for a moment i had deposited madonna paola on the ground i mounted the bench and gently but quickly set back that lid as it had been next i gathered up the cumbrous pall and mounting the bench once more i spread it across the coffin this way and that i pulled it straightening it into the shape that it had worn when first i had entered and casting its folds into regular lines that would lend it the appearance of having remained undisturbed  and what time i toiled the half of my mind intent upon my task the other half was as intent upon the progress of the worker at the door  at last it was done i set the bench where first it had been at the foot of the catafalque and gathering up madonna in my arms as though her weight had been an infants i bore her swiftly out of the circle of light of those four tapers into the black impenetrable gloom beyond on i sped towards the highaltar flying now as men fly in evil dreams with the sensation of an enemy upon them and their progress a mere standingstill  thus i gained the chancel hurtling against the railing as i passed and pausing for an instant wondering whether those without could have heard the noise which in my clumsiness i had made but the grinding sound continued uninterrupted and i breathed more freely i mounted the altarsteps the distant light behind me still feebly guiding me i ran round to the right and heaved a great sigh of relief to find my hopes verified and that the altar of san domenico was as the altar of other churches i had known it stood a pace or so from the wall and behind it there was just such narrow hidingroom as i had looked to find  i paused at the mouth of that black opening and even as i paused something hard that gave out a metallic sound fell at the far end of the church instinct told me it was the lock which those miscreants had cut from the door i waited for no more but like a beast scudding to cover i plunged into that black space  madonna wrapped in my cloak as she was i set down upon the ground and then i crept forward on hands and knees and thrust out my head trusting to the darkness to envelop me  i waited thus for some seconds my heart beating now against my ribs as if it would hurl itself out of my bosom my head and face on fire with the fever of reaction that succeeded my late cold pallor  from where i watched it was impossible to see the door hidden in the black gloom away in the centre of the church an island of light in that vast sea of blackness stood the catafalque with its four wax torches something creaked and almost immediately i saw the flames of those tapers bend towards me beaten over by the gust that smote them from the door thus i surmised that ramiro and his men had entered the soft fall of their feet for they were treading lightly now succeeded and at last they came into view shadowy at first then sharply outlined as they approached the light  a moment they stood in halfwhispered conversation their voices a mere boom of sound in which no word was to be distinguished then i saw ramiro suddenly step forwardi knew him by his great heightand drag away even as i had done the pall that hid the coffin next he seized the bench and gave a brisk order to his men in a less cautious voice so that i caught his words  spread a cloak said he and in obedience the four that were with him took a cloak among them each holding one of its corners it was thus that he meant to bear her with him  he mounted now the bench and i could imagine with what elation of mind he put out his hands to remove the coffinlid as well as if his soul had been transformed into a book conceived for my amusement did i surmise the exultant mood that then possessed him he had tricked filippo he had outwitted us allmadonna herself includedand he was leaving no trace behind him that should warrant any so much as to dare to think that this vile deed was the work of messer ramiro del orca governor of cessna  but fate that archhumourist that jester of the gods delights in mighty contrasts and has a trick of exalting us by false hopes and hollow lures on the very eve of working our discomfiture from the soul that but a moment back had been aglow with evil satisfaction there burst a sudden blasphemous cry of rage that disregarded utterly the sanctity of that consecrated place  by the death of christ the coffin is empty  it was the roar of a beast enraged and it was succeeded by a heavy crash as he let fall the coffinlid a second later a still louder sound awoke the nightechoes of that silent place in a burst of maniacal frenzy he had caught the coffin itself a buffet of his mighty fist and hurled it from its trestles  then he leapt down from the bench and flung all caution to the winds in the excitement that possessed him  it is a trick of that smoothfaced knave filippo he cried they have laid a trap for us animals and you never informed yourselves  i could imagine the foam about the corners of his mouth the swelling veins in his brow and the mad bulging of his hideous eyes for terror spoke in his words and the governor of cesena overbearing bully though he was could on occasion too become a coward  out of this he growled at them see that your swords hang ready away  one of them murmured something that i could not catch mother in heaven if it should be a suggestion of what actually had taken place a suggestion that the church should be searched ere they abandoned it but ramiros answer speedily relieved my fears  ill take no risks he barked come let us go separately i first and do you follow me and get clear of pesaro as best you can his voice grew lower and from what else he said i but caught the words cesena and tomorrow night from which i gathered that he was appointing that as their next meetingplace  ramiro went and scarce had the echoes of his footsteps died away ere the others followed in a rush fearful of being caught in some trap that was here laid for them and but restrained from flying on the instant by their still greater fear of that harsh master ramiro  thanking heaven for this miraculous deliverance and for the wit it had lent me so to prepare a scene that should thoroughly mislead those ravishers i turned me now to madonna paola her breathing was grown more heavy and more regular so that in all respects she was as one sleeping healthily soon i hoped that she might awaken for to seek to bear her thence and to the palace in my arms would have been a madness and now it occurred to me that i should have restoratives at hand against the time of her regaining consciousness inspiration suggested to me the wine that should be stored in the sacristy for altar purposes it was unconsecrated and there could be no sacrilege in using it  i crept round to the front of the altar at the angle a candlebranch protruded standing no higher than my head it held some three or four tapers and was so placed to enable the priest to read his missal at early mass on dark winter mornings i plucked one of the candles from its socket and hastening down the church i lighted it from one of the burning tapers of the bier screening it with my hand i retraced my steps and regained the chancel then turning to the left i made for a door that i knew should give access to the sacristy it yielded to my touch and i passed down a short stoneflagged passage and entered the spacious chamber beyond an oak settle was placed against one wall and above it hung an enormous rudelycarved crucifix facing it against the other wall loomed a huge piece of furniture halfcupboard halfbuffet on a bench in a corner stood a basin and ewer of metal whilst a few vestments hanging beside these completed the furniture of this austere and whitewashed chamber setting my candle on the buffet i opened one of the drawers it was full of garments of different kinds among which i noticed several monks habits i rummaged to the bottom only to find some odd pairs of sandals  disappointed i closed the drawer and tried another with no better fortune here were undervestments of fine linen newly washed and fragrant with rosemary i abandoned the drawer and gave my attention to the cupboard above it was locked but the key was there it opened and my candle reflected a blaze on gold and silver vessels consecrated chalices a dazzling monstra and several richlycarved ciboria of solid gold set with precious stones but in a corner i espied a darkbrown gourdshaped object it was a skin of wine and with a halfsuppressed cry of joy i seized it in that instant a piercing scream rang through the stillness of the church and startled me so that i stood there for some seconds frozen in horror a hundred wild conjectures leaping to my mind  had ramiro remained hidden and was he returned did the scream mean that madonna paola had been awakened by his rough hands  a second time it came and now it seemed to break the hideous spell that its first utterance had cast over me dropping the leather bottle i sped back down the stone passage to the door that abutted on the chancel  there by the highaltar i saw a form that seemed at first luminous and ghostly but in which presently i recognised madonna paola the dim rays of the distant tapers finding out the white robe with which her limbs were hung she was alone and i knew then that it was but the very natural fear consequent upon awakening in such a place that had provoked the cry i had heard  madonna i called advancing swiftly towards her madonna paola there was a gasp a moments stillness then  lazzaro she cried questioningly what has happened why am i here  i was beside her now and found her trembling like an aspen  something horrible has happened madonna i answered but it is over now and the evil is averted  but how came i here  that you shall learn i stooped to gather up the cloak which had slipped from her shoulders as she advanced do you wrap this about you i urged her and with my own hands i assisted to enfold her in that mantle are you faint madonna i asked  i scarce know she answered in a frightened voice there is a black horror upon me tell me she implored again what does it mean  i drew her away now promising to satisfy her in the fullest manner once she were out of these forbidding surroundings i led her to the sacristy and seating her upon the settle i produced that wineskin once again  at first she babbled like a child of not being thirsty but i was insistent  it is no matter of quenching thirst madonna i told her the wine will warm and revive you come madonna mia drink  she obeyed me now and having got the first gulp down her throat she drank a lusty draught that was not long in bringing a healthier colour to replace the ashen pallor of her cheeks  i am so cold lazzaro she complained  i turned to the drawer in which i had espied the rough monks habits and pulling one out i held it for her to don she sat there now in that garment of coarse black cloth the cowl flung back upon her shoulder the fairest postulate that ever entered upon a novitiate  you are good to me lazzaro she murmured plaintively and i have used you very ill she paused a second passing her hand across her brow thenwhat is the hour she asked  it was a question that i left unheeded i bade her brace herself and have courage for the tale i was to tell i assured her that the horror of it was all passed and that she had naught to fear so soon as her natural curiosity should be satisfied it should be hers to return to her brother at the palace  but how came i thence she cried i must have lain in a swoon for i remember nothing and then her swift mind leaping to a reasonable conclusion and assisted perhaps by the memory of the shattered catafalque which she had seendid they account me dead lazzaro she asked of a sudden her eyes dilating with a curious affright as they were turned upon my own  yes madonna answered i you were accounted dead and with that i told her the entire story of what had befallen saving only that i left my own part unmentioned nor sought to explain my opportune presence in the church when i spoke of the coming of ramiro and his knaves she shuddered and closed her eyes in very awe at length when i had done she opened them again and again she turned them full upon me their brightness seemed to increase a moment and then i saw that she was quietly weeping  and you were there to save me lazzaro she murmured brokenly lazzaro mio it seems that you are ever at hand when i have need of you you are indeed my one true friendthe one true friend that never fails me  are you feeling stronger madonna i asked abruptly roughly almost  yes i am stronger she stood up as if to test her strength indeed little ails me saving the horror of this thing the thought of it seems to turn me sick and dizzy  sit then and rest said i presently when you are more recovered we will set out  whither shall we go she asked  why to the palace to your brother  why yes she answered as though it were the last suggestion that she had been expecting and tomorrowit will be tomorrow will it notcomes the lord ignacio to claim his bride he will owe you no mean thanks lazzaro  there was a pause i paced the chamber a hundred thoughts crowding my mind but overriding them all the conjecture of how far it might be from matins and how soon we might be discovered by the monks presently she spoke again  lazzaro she inquired very gently what was it brought you to the church  i came with the others madonna to the burial service answered i and fearing such questions as might followquestions that i had been dreading ever since i had brought her to the sacristyif you are recovered we had best be going i told her gruffly  nay i am not yet enough recovered answered she and before we go there are some points in this strange adventure that i would have you make clear to me meanwhile we are very well here if the good fathers come upon us what shall it signify  i groaned inwardly and i grew i think more afraid than when ramiro and his men had broken into the church an hour ago  what kept you here after all were gone  i remained to pray madonna i answered brusquely is aught else to be done in a church  to pray for me lazzaro she asked  assuredly madonna  faithful heart she murmured and i had used you so cruelly for the deception you practised but you merited my cruelty did you not lazzaro say that you did else must i perish of remorse  perhaps i deserved it madonna but perhaps not so much as you bestowed had you but understood my motives i said unguardedly  if i had understood your motives she mused aye there is much i do not understand even in this nights transactions there are not wanting things that remain mysterious despite the explanations you have supplied me tell me lazzaro what was it led you to suppose that i still lived  i did not suppose it i blundered like a fool never seeing whither her question led  you did not she cried in deep surprise and now when it was too late i understood what was it then induced you to lift the coffinlid  you ask me more than i can tell you i answered almost roughly do you thank god madonna that it was so and never plague your mind to learn the why of it  she looked at me with eyes that were singularly luminous  but i must know she insisted have i not the right tell me now was it that you wished to see my face again before they gave me over to the grave  perhaps it was that madonna i answered in confusion avoiding her glance thenshall we be going i suggested fiercely but she never heeded that suggestion  she spoke as if she had not heard and the words she uttered seemed to turn me into stone  did you love me then so much dear lazzaro  i swung round to face her now and i know that my face was whitewhiter than hers had been when i had beheld her in her coffin my eyes seemed to burn in their sockets as they met hers a madness overtook me and whelmed my better judgment i had undergone so much that day through grief and that night through a hundred emotions that i was no longer fully master of myself her words robbed me i think of my last lingering shred of reason  love you madonna i echoed in a voice that was as unlike my own as was the mood that then possessed me you are the air i breathe the sun that lights my miserable world you are dearer to me than honour sweeter than life you are the guardian angel of my existence the saint to whom i have turned morning and evening in my prayers for grace do i love you madonna  and there i paused the thought of what i did and what the consequences must be rushed suddenly upon me i shivered as a man shivers in awaking i dropped on my knees before her bowing my head and flinging wide my arms  forgive madonna i cried entreatingly forgive and forget never again will i offend  neither forgive nor forget will i came her voice charged with an ineffable sweetness and her hands descended on my bowed bead as if she would bless and soothe me i am conscious of no offence that craves forgiveness and what you have said i would not forget if i could whence springs this fear of yours dear lazzaro am i more than woman or you less than man that you should tremble for the confession that in a wild moment i have dragged from you for that wild moment i shall be thankful to my lifes end for your words have been the sweetest ever my poor ears listened to once i thought that i loved the lord giovanni sforza but it was you i loved for the deeds that earned him my affection were deeds of yours and not of his once i told you so in scorn yet since then i have come soberly to ponder it i account you lazzaro the noblest friend the bravest gentleman and the truest lover that the world has known need it surprise you then that i love you and that mine would be a happy life if i might spend it in growing worthy of this noble love of yours  there was a knot in my throat and tears in my eyesa matter at which i take no shame air seemed to fail me for a moment and i almost thought that i should swoon so overcome was i transport the blackest soul from among the damned of hell wash it white of its sins and seat it on one of the glorious thrones of heaven then ponder its emotions and you may learn something of what i felt at last when i had mastered the exquisite torture of my joy  madonna mia i cried bethink you of what you say you are the noble lady of santafior and i  no more of this she interrupted me you are lazzaro biancomonte of patrician birth no matter to what odd shifts a cruel fortune may have driven you will you take me  she had my face between her palms and she forced my glance to meet her own saintly eyes  will you take me lazaro she repeated  holy flower of the quince was all that i could murmur whereat she gently smiled santo fior di cotogno  and then a great sadness overwhelmed me a tide that neaped the frail bark of happiness high and dry upon the shores of black despair  tomorrow madonna comes the lord ignacio borgia i groaned  i know i know said she but i have thought of that paula sforza di santafior is dead requiescat we must dispose that they will let her rest in peace     chapter xv an ill encounter   speechless i stared at her a moment so taken was i with the immensity of the thing that she suggested fear amazement and joy jostled one another for the possession of my mind  why do you look so lazzaro she exclaimed at last what is it daunts you  how is the thing possible quoth i  what difficulty does it present she questioned back the governor of cesena has rendered very possible what i propose we may look on him tomorrow as our best friend  but ramiro knows i reminded her  true but do you think that he will dare to tell the world what he knows he might be asked to say how he comes by his knowledge and that should prove a difficult question to answer tell me lazzaro she continued if he had succeeded in carrying me away what think you would have been said in pesaro tomorrow when the coffin was found empty  they would assume that your body had been stolen by some wizard or some daring student of anatomy  ah and if we were quietly to quit the church and be clear of pesaro before morning would not the same be said  probably answered i  then why hesitate is it that you do not love me enough lazzaro  i smiled and my eyes must have told her more than any protestation could then i sighed i hesitate madonna because i would not have you do now what you might come hereafter bitterly to repent i would not let you be misled by the impulse of a moment into an act whose consequences must endure as long as life itself  is that the reasoning of a lover she asked me very quietly is this cold argument this weighing of issues consistent with the stormy passion you professed so lately  it is i answered stoutly it is because i love you more than i love myself that i would have you reflect ere you adventure your life upon such a broken raft as mine you are paola sforza di santafior and i  enough of that she interrupted me rising she swept towards me and before i knew it her hands were on my shoulders her face upturned and her blue eyes on mine depriving me of all will and all resistance  lazzaro said she and there was an intensity almost fierce in her low tones moments are flying and you stand here reasoning with me and bidding me weigh what is already weighed for all time will you wait until escape is rendered impossible until we are discovered before you will decide to save me and to grasp with both hands this happiness of ours that is not twice offered in a lifetime  she was so close to me that i could almost feel the beating of her heart some subtle perfume reaching me and combining with the dominion that her eyes seemed to have established over me completed my subjugation i was as warm wax in her hands forgotten were all considerations of rank and station we were just a man and a woman whose fates were linked irrevocably by love i stooped suddenly under the sway of an impulse i could not resist and kissed her upturned face turning almost dizzy in the act then i broke from her clasp and bracing myself for the task to which we stood committed by that kiss  paola said i we must devise the means to get away i will bear you to my mothers home near biancomonte that you may dwell there at least until we are wed but the thing that exercises my mind is how to make our unobserved escape from pesaro  i have thought of it already she informed me quietly  you have thought of it i cried and of what have you thought  for answer she stepped back a pace and drew the cowl of the monks habit over her head until her features were lost in the shadows of it she stood before me now a diminutive dominican brother her meaning was clear to me at once with a cry of gladness i turned to the drawer whence i had taken the habit in which she was arrayed and selecting another one i hastily donned it above the garments that i wore  no sooner was it done than i caught her by the arm  come madonna i bade her in an urgent voice at the first step she stumbled the habit was so long that it cumbered her feet but that was a difficulty soon conquered with my dagger i cut a piece from the skirt of it enough to leave her freedom of movement and that accomplished we set out  we crossed the church swiftly and silently and a moment i left her in the porch whilst i surveyed the street all was quiet pesaro still slept and it must have wanted some two hours or more to the dawn  a fine rain was falling as we sallied out and there was a sting in the december wind which made us draw our cowls the tighter about our face abandoning the main street i led her down some narrow alleys deserted like all the rest of the city and not so much as a stray cat abroad in that foul weather it was very dark and a hundred times we stumbled whilst in some places i almost carried her bodily to avoid the filth of the quarter we were traversing at length we gained the space in front of the gates that open on to the northern road known as porta venezia and i would have blundered on and roused the guard to let us out using the borgia ring once morethat talisman whose power had grown during these years so that it would now open me almost any door in italy but paola stayed me wisely she counselled that we should do nothing that might draw too much attention upon ourselves and she urged me to wait until the dawn when the guard would be astir and the gates opened  so we fled to the shelter of a porch and there we waited huddling ourselves out of the reach of the icy rain we talked little during the time we spent there for my own part i had overmuch food for thought and a very natural anxiety racked me soon the monks would be descending to the church and they would discover the havoc there and spread the alarm  who could say but that they might even discover the abstraction of the two habits from the sacristy and the hue and cry for two men in the sackcloth of dominicans would be afootfor they would infer that two men so disguised had made off with the body of madonna paola the thought stirred me like a goad i stood up the night was growing thinner and suddenly even as i rose a light gleamed from one of the windows of the guardhouse  god be thanked for that fellows early rising i cried out come madonna let us be moving  and i added my newlyconceived reasons for quitting the place without further delay  cursing us for being so early abroada curse to which i responded with a sonorous pax domini sit tecum the still somnolent sentinel opened the post and let us pass i was glad in the end that we had waited and thus avoided the necessity of showing my ring for should inquiries be made concerning two monks that ring of mine might have betrayed the identity of one of them i gave thanks to heaven that i knew the country well a quarter of a league or so from pesaro we quitted the highroad and took to the bypaths with which i was well acquainted  day came grey and forbidding at first but presently the rain ceased and the sun flashed out a thousand diamonds from the drenched hedgerows  we plodded on and at length towards noon when we had gained the neighbourhood of the village of cattolica we halted at the hut of a peasant on a small campagna i had divested myself of my monks habit and cut away the cowl from madonnas she had thereafter fashioned it by means that were mysterious to my dull mans mind into a more femininelooking garb  thus we now presented ourselves to the old man who was the sole tenant of that lonely and squalid house a ducat opened his door as wide as it would go and gave us free access to every cranny of his dwelling food he procured usrough black bread some pieces of roasted goat and some goats milkand on this we regaled ourselves as though it had been a ducal banquet for hunger had set us in the mood to account anything delicious and when we had eaten we fell to talking the old man having left us to go about such peasant duties as claimed his attention and our talk concerned ourselves our future first and later on our past i remember that madonna returned to the matter of the deception that i had practised seeking to learn what reasons had impelled me and i answered her in all truth  madonna mia i think it must have been to win your love when giovanni sforza bade me with many a threat to write those verses i undertook the task with ready gladness for in its performance i was to pour out the tale of the passion that was consuming my poor heart it occurred to me that if those verses were worthy you might come to love their author for their beauty and so i strove to render them beautiful it was the same spirit urged me to don the lord giovannis armour and fight in that splendid if futile skirmish even as you had come to love the author for his verses so might you come to love the warrior for his valour that you should account the one and the other the work of giovanni sforza was to me a little thing since i was well content to think that you but loved him because you accounted his the things that i had performed therefore was i the one you truly loved although you did not know it could you but conceive what consolation that reflection was to me you would deal lightly with me for my deceit  i can conceive it she answered very gently her eyes downcast and now that i know the motives that impelled you i almost love you for that deceit itself for it seems to me that it holds some quality well worthy of devotion  such was our talk all of a nature to help us to a better understanding of each other and all seeming to endear us more and more by showing us how close the past had already drawn us  later i rose and announced my intention of adventuring into cattolica there to procure her garments more seemly than those she wore in which she might journey on and come into the presence of my mother also there was in cattolica a man i knew of whom i hoped for the loan of enough money to enable me to purchase mules to the end that we might journey in more dignity and comfort it was then about the twentieth hour and i hoped to return by nightfall i took my leave of madonna enjoining her to rest and to seek sleep whilst i was absent and with that i set out  cattolica was no more than a halfleague distant and i looked to reach it in a halfhour or so i fell into thought as i trudged along and i was building plans for the sunlit future that was to be ours i was a man transformed that day and i could have sung in spite of the chill december wind that buffeted me so full of joy and gladness was my heart  at biancomonte i was likely to spend my days as little better than a peasant but surely a peasants estate with such a companion as was to be mine was preferable to an emperors throne without her  the bleak landscape seemed to me invested with a beauty that at no other time i should have noticed god was good i swore a thousand times the world was a good worldso good that heaven could scarce be better  i had come perhaps the better half of the distance i had to travel and i was giving full rein to my joyous fancy when suddenly i espied ahead a company of horsemen they were approaching me at a brisk pace but i took no thought of them accounting myself secure from any molestation if it so happened that it was a search party from pesaro seeking two men disguised as monks who had ravished the coffin of madonna paola di santafior what should they want of lazzaro biancomonte and so in my confidence i advanced even as they trotted quickly towards me  not until they were within a matter of a hundred paces did i raise my eyes to take their measure and then i halted on my step smitten of a sudden by an unreasoning and unreasonable fear to see at their head the bulky form of the governor of cesena he saw me too and what was worse he recognised me on the instant for he clapped spurs to his horse and came at me as if he would ride me down within three paces of me he drew up his steed whether the memory of the other two occasions on which i had thwarted him arose now in his mind and made him wonder had not some fatality brought me across his path again to send awry his pretty schemes concerning madonna paula i cannot say for certain yet some suspicion of it occurred to me and filled me with apprehension  body of bacchus he roared is it truly you boccadoro  they call me biancomonte now magnificent i answered him but my tone was respectful for it could profit me nothing to incense him  a fig for what they call you he snapped contemptuously whence are you  from pesaro i answered truthfully  from pesaro but you are travelling towards it  true i was making for cattolica but i missed my way in seeking to shorten it i am now returning by the highroad  the explanation satisfied him on that point and being satisfied he asked me when i had left pesaro a moment i hesitated  late last night said i at last he looked at me my foolish hesitation having perhaps unslipped a suspicion that was straining at its leash  in that case said he you can scarcely have heard the strange story that is being told there  i looked at him as if puzzled for a second if you mean the story of madonna paoias end i heard it yesterday  why what story was that quoth he in some surprise his beetling brows coming together in one broad line of fur  i shrugged my shoulders men said that she had been poisoned  oh that he cried indifferently but men say today that her body was stolen from the church of san domenico where it lay an odd happening is it not and his eyes covered me in a fierce scrutiny that again suggested to me those suspicions of his that i might be the man who had anticipated him i was soon to learn that he had more grounds than at first i thought for those same suspicions  odd indeed i answered calmly for all that i felt my pulses quickening with apprehension but is it true i added  he shrugged his shoulders rumours habit is to lie he answered yet for such a lie as that so monstrous an imagination would be needed that rather am i inclined to account it truth there are no more poets in pesaro since you left but at what hour was it that you quitted the city  to hesitate again were to betray myself it were to suggest that i was seeking an answer that should sort well with the rest of my story besides what could the hour signify  it would be about the first hour of night i said he looked at me with increasing strangeness  you must indeed have wandered from your road to have got no farther than this in all that time perhaps you were hampered by some heavy burden he leered evilly and i turned cold  i was burdened with nothing heavier than this body of mine and a rather uneasy conscience  where then have you tarried  at this i thought it time to rebel were i too meekly to submit to this examination my very meekness might afford him fresh grounds for doubts  once have i told you i answered wearily that i lost my way and however much it may flatter me to have your excellency evincing such an interest in my concerns i am at a loss to find a reason for it  he leered prodigiously once more and his eyebrows shot up to the level of his cap  i will tell you brute beast he answered me i question you because i suspect that you are hiding something from me  what should i hide from your excellency  he dared not enlighten me on that point for should his suspicions prove unfounded he would have uselessly betrayed himself  if you are honest why do you lie  i i ejaculated in what have i lied  in that you have told me that you left pesaro at the first hour of night at the third hour you were still in the church of san domenico whither you followed madonna paolas bier  it was my turn to knit my brows was i indeed quoth i why yes it may well be but what of that is the hour in which i quitted pesaro a matter of such moment as to be worth lying over if i said that i left about the first hour it is because i was under the impression that it was so but i was so distraught by grief at madonnas death that i may have been careless in my account of time  more lies he blazed with sudden passion it may have been the third hour you say fool the gates of pesaro close at the second hour of night where are your wits  outwardly calm but inwardly in a panicmore for madonnas sake than for my owni promptly held out the hand on which i wore the borgia ring in a flash of inspiration did that counter suggest itself to me  there is a key that will open any gate in romagna at any hour  he looked at the ring and of what passed in his mind i can but offer a surmise he may have remembered that once before i had fooled him with the help of that gold circlet or he may have thought that i was secretly in the service of the borgias and that acting in their interests i had carried off madonna paola be that as it may the sight of the ring threw him into a fury he turned on his horse  lucagnolo he called and a man of officers rank detached himself from the score of menatarms and rode forward let six men escort me home to cesena take you the remainder and beat up the country for three leagues about this spot do not leave a house outside cattolica unsearched you know what we are seeking  the man inclined his head  if it is within the circle you have appointed we will find it he answered confidently  set about it was the surly command and ramiro turned again to me you have gone a little pale good messer boccadoro he sneered we shall soon learn whether you have sought to fool me woe betide you should it be so we bear a name for swift justice at cesena  so be it then i answered as calmly as i might meanwhile perhaps you will now suffer me to go my ways  the readier since your way must lie with ours  not so magnificent i am for cattolica  not so animal he mimicked me with elephantine grace you are for cesena and you had best go with a good will our manner of constraining men is reputed rude he turned again ercole take you this man behind you assist him stefano  and so it was done and a few minutes later i was riding strapped to the steelclad ercole away from paola at every stride thus at every stride the anguish that possessed me increased as the fear that they must find her rose ever higher     chapter xvi in the citadel of cesena   i will not harass you at any further length with the feelings that were mine as we sped northward towards cesena if you are a person of some imagination and not destitute of human sympathy you will be able to surmise them if you are notwhy then my tale is not for you and it is more than probable that you will have wearied of it and flung it aside long before you reach this page  we rode so hard that by sunset cesena was in sight and ere night had fallen we were within the walls of the citadel it was when we had dismounted and i stood in the courtyard between ercole and another of the soldiers that ramiro again addressed me  animal said he they tell me that i bear a name for harsh measures and rough ways you shall be a witness hereafter of how deeply i am maligned for instead of putting you to the question and loosening your lying tongue with the rack i am content to keep you a prisoner until my men return with that which i suspect you to be hiding from me but if i then discover that you have sought to fool me you shall flutter from ramiro del orcas flagstaff  he pointed up to the tower of the castle from which a beam protruded laden at that moment with a ghastly burden just discernible in the thickening gloom he named it well when he called it his flagstaff and the miserable banner of carrion that hung from it was a fitting pennon for the ruthless governor of cesena worthy was he to have worn the silver hauberk of werner von urslingen with its motto the enemy of god of pity and of mercy  forbidding blackbrowed men caught me with rough hands and dragged me off to a dank unlighted prison as empty of furniture as it was full of noisome smells and there they left me to my ugly thoughts and my deeply despondent mood what time the governor of cesena supped with his officers in the hall of the castle  ramiro drank deep that night as was his habit and being overladen with wine it entered his mind that in one of his dungeons lay lazzaro biancomonte who at one time had been known as boccadoro the merriest fool in italy in his drunkenness he grew merry and when ramiro del orca grew merry men crossed themselves and betook them to their prayers he would fain be amused and to serve that end he summoned one of his sbirri and bade the fellow drag boccadoro from his dungeon and fetch him into his presence  when they came for me i turned cold with fear that madonna was already taken and by contrast with such a fear as that the reflection that he might carry out his threat to hang me from that black beam of his faded into insignificant proportions  they ushered me into a great hall not illfurnished the floor strewed plentifully with rushes and warmed by an enormous fire of blazing oak by the door stood two pikemen in armour like a pair of statues in the centre of the floor was a heavy oaken board laden now with flagons and beakers at which sat ramiro with a pair of gossips so villainous to look at that the sight of them reminded me of the adage god makes a man and then accompanies him  the governor made a hideous noise at sight of me which i was constrained to accept as an expression of horrid glee  boccadoro said he do you recall that when last i had the honour of being entertained by your pert tongue i promised you that did you ever cross my path again i would raise you to the dignity of fool of my court of cesena  into what magniloquence does vanity betray us his court of cesena as well might you describe a pigsty as a bower of roses  but his words despite the unsavoury thing of which they seemed to hold a promise fell sweetly on my ear inasmuch as for the time they relieved my fears touching madonna it was not to advise me of her capture that he had had me haled into his odious presence i gathered courage  have you not fools enough already at cesena i asked him  a moment he looked as if he were inclining to anger then he burst into a coarse laugh and turned to one of his gossips  did i not tell you lampugnani that his wit was quick and penetrating hear him rogue already has he discerned your quality he laughed consumedly at his own jest and turning to me he pointed to a crimson bundle on a chair beside me take those garments he roughly bade me go dress yourself in them then come you back and entertain us  without answering him and already anticipating the nature of the clothes he bade me don i lifted one of the garments from the heap it was a foliated jesters cap with a bell hanging from every point which gave out a tinkling sound as i picked it up i let it fall again as though it had scorched me the memory of what stood between madonna paola and me rising like a warning spectre in my mind i would not again defile myself by the garb of folly not again would i incur the shame of playing the fool for the amusement of others  may it please your excellency to excuse me i answered in a firm tone i have made a vow never again to put on motley  he eyed me sardonically for a moment as if enjoying in anticipation the pleasure of compelling me against my will he sat back in his chair and threw one heavilybooted leg across the other  in the citadel of cesena said he we fear neither god nor devil and vows are as water to usthings we cannot stomach it does not please me to excuse you  i may have paled a little before the sinister smile with which he accompanied his words but i stood my ground boldly  it is not said i a question of what a vow may be to you and yours but of what a vow is to me it is a thing i cannot break  sangue di cristo he snarled we will break it for you thenthat or your bones resolve yourself beast the motley or the rackor yet if you prefer it there is the cord yonder and he pointed to the far end of the chamber where some ropes were hanging from a pulley the implements of the ghastly torture of the cord of such a nature was this monster that he made a torturechamber of his dininghall  let the rogue make acquaintance with it laughed lampugnani showing a mouthful of yellow teeth behind the black beard that bushed his lips ill swear his dancing would afford us more amusement than his quips swing him up illustrious  but the illustrious seemed to ponder the matter  you shall have five minutes in which to decide he informed me presently they say that i am cruel behold how patient is my clemency five minutes shall you have where many another would hang you out of hand for bearding him as you have done me  you may begin at once said i neither five minutes nor five years will alter my determination  his brow grew black with anger we shall see was all he said  there was a silence now in which we waited a storm of thoughts battling in my mind presently ramiro caught up one of the flagons and applied it to his cup it proved empty and in a gust of passion he hurled it against the wall where it burst into a thousand pieces clearly he was very angry and it taxed my wits to account for the little measure of patience he was showing me  beppo he called a page lounging by the buffet sprang to attention he was a slender rather delicate lad fair of hair and blue of eyes not more than twelve years of age an elderly man who stood beside himone mariani the seneschal of cesenastepped forward also solicitude in his glance  bring me wine bawled the ogre must i tell you what i need if you do not put those eyes of yours to better service ill have them plucked from your empty head bestir animal  the old man caught up a beaker from the buffet and handed it to the boy  here my son said he hasten to his excellency  the lad took the beaker from his fathers hands and trembling in his fear of ramiros anger he sprang forward to serve him in his haste the poor youth slipped in some grease that had clung to the rushes in seeking to recover himself he tripped over the feet of one of the halberdiers that guarded me and measured his length upon the floor at ramiros feet flooding the governors legs with the wine he carried  how shall i tell you of the horror that was the sequel  for just one instant ramiro looked down at the sprawling lad his eyes glowing like a madmans then suddenly he rose stooped and set one hand to the boys belt the other to the collar of his jerkin feeling himself lifted and knowing whose were the dread hands that held him poor beppo uttered a single scream of terror then ramiro swung him round with an ease that displayed the mans prodigious strength for just a second he seemed to hesitate how to dispose of the human bundle that he held then as if suddenly taking his resolve that devil hurled the lad across the little intervening space straight into the heart of the blazing fire  beppo hurtled against the logs with a sickening crash and a thousand sparks leapt up and vanished in the cavern of the chimney ramiro wheeled sharply about and snatching the pike from the hands of one of my guards he pinned down the poor body of the boy to make sure of his victims entire destruction  away by the buffet old mariani looked on with a face as grey as ashes his eyes protruding in horror at the thing they witnessed one glimpse i had of him and i scarce know which was the sight that sickened me more the fathers anguish or the twitching limbs of the burning child two legs and two arms protruded from the blaze and writhed and wriggled horribly what time the flames peeled the garments from them and licked the flesh from the bones at length they fell still and sank down into the white heat of the logs a hideous pungent odour spreading through the chamber from the old man by the buffet who had stood spellbound during this ghastly scene there broke at last an anguished cry  mercy my lord mercy  the governor of cesena straightened himself from his task pulled the pike from the flames and restored it to the manatarms then turning to mariani  fetch me wine he bade him curtly as he seated himself once more upon the chair from which he had risen to perform that deed of ghastly ruthlessness  a torch spluttered suddenly in its sconce and the fierce hissing of the firelike some monster licking its chops over a bloody mealwere the only sounds that disturbed the stillness that ensued  every man there including ramiros table companions was white to the lips for accustomed though they might be to horrors in that brigands nest this was a horror that surpassed anything they had ever witnessed the silence irked messer ramiro he looked round from under his shaggy brows and he spluttered out an oath  will you bring me this wine pig he growled at the almost senseless mariani and in his air and voice there was a promise of such terrific things that the old man put aside his horror to make room for his fears and mechanically seizing another flagon he hurried forward to minister to the wants of his fearful lord  ramiro eyed him with cynical amusement  your hand shakes mariani he derided him are you cold go warm yourself he added with a brutal laugh and a jerk of his thumb towards the fire  my eyes have looked upon some gruesome sights and i have heard such tales of ruthless cruelty as you would deem almost passing possibility i have read of the awful doings of the lord bernabo visconti at milan in the olden time but i believe that compared with this monster of cesena that same bernabo was no worse than a sucking dove how it befell that men permitted him to live how it was that none bethought him to put poison in his wine or a knife in his back is something that i shall never wholly understand could it be that these robbers of whom he made a hedge for his protection were no better than himself or was it that the mans terrific brutality was on such a scale that it filled them with an almost supernatural awe of him to men better versed than am i in the mysterious ways of human nature do i leave the answering of these questions  the ogre turned his bloodshot eyes upon me as with his hand he caressed his tawny beard he seemed to have cooled a little now and to have regained some mastery of his drunken self old mariani tottered back to his buffet and stood leaning against it his eyes wandering with the look of a man demented to the fire that had devoured his child there indeed if he escaped the madness with which the poignancy of his grief was threatening him was a tool that might turn its edge against this inhuman monster this devil this bloody carnifex of a governor  chance said ramiro has designed that you should see something of how we deal with clumsy knaves at cesena boccadoro to disobedient ones i can assure you that we are not half so merciful there is no such short shrift for them you have had more than the time i promised you for reflection the garments await you yonder let us know  the door opened suddenly and a servant entered  a courier from the lord vitellozzo vitelli tyrant of città di castello he announced unwittingly breaking in upon ramiros words with urgent messages for the high and mighty governor of cesena  on the instant ramiro rose the expression of his face changing from cynical amusement to sober concern the task upon which he was engaged forgotten  admit him instantly he commanded and whilst he waited he paced the chamber in long strides his chin thrust slightly forward suggestive of deep thought and during that pause i too was thinking not indeed of him nor vainly speculating upon such matters as might be involved in the message the announcement of which seemed so deeply to engage his mind but chiefly of my own and madonna paolas concerns  it was not fear of what i had seen that now sent my thoughts into a new channel and inspired me with the wisdom of obeying ramiro del orcas behest that i should don the hateful motley and play the fool for his diversion it was not that i feared death it was that i feared what the consequences of my death might be to paola di santafior  however desperate a position may seem unlookedfor loopholes often present themselves and so long as we live and have sound limbs to aid us to seize such opportunities as may offer it is a weak thing utterly to abandon hope  was it then not better to submit to the shame of the motley once again for a little time when by so doing i might perhaps live to work my own salvation and madonnas should she suffer capture rather than stubbornly to invite him to put me to death out of a feeling of false pride  the very resolve seemed to lend me strength and to revive the hope that lay moribund in my breast and then scarce was it taken when the door again opened and a man who was splashed from head to foot with mud in earnest of how hard he had ridden was ushered in  he advanced to meser ramiro bowed and presented a package ramiro broke the seal and standing with his back to the fire immediately in the light shed by one of the wax torches he read the letter then his eyes wandered to the man who had brought it and to me it seemed that they dwelt particularly upon the hat the courier was holding in his hand  take this good fellow to the kitchen he bade the servant that had introduced him let him be fed and rested then turning to the man himself i shall require you to set out at daybreak with my answer he said and so with a wave of the hand he dismissed him as the messenger departed ramiro returned to the table filled himself a cup of wine and drank  what says the lord vitelli lampugnani ventured to ask him  if he knew you answered ramiro with a scowl he would counsel me to strangle some of the overinquisitive rascals that surround me  overinquisitive echoed lampugnani boldly body of god it were enough to wake the curiosity of an ecstatic hermit to have a mudsplashed courier from citta di castello at cesena three times within one little week  ramiro looked at him and by his glance it was plain to see that the words had jarred his temper whatever it was that vitelli wrote to ramiro this gentleman was not minded to divulge it  if you have supped lampugnani said the governor slowly his eyes upon his offending officer perhaps you will find some duty to perform ere you seek your bed  lampugnani turned crimson and for a moment seemed to hesitate then he rose he was a man of choleric aspect and that he served under ramiro del orca was as much a danger to the governor as to himself he had not the air of one whom it was wise to threaten in however veiled a manner  shall i fetch you this fellows hat ere i sleep he inquired with contemptuous insolence  not a word did ramiro answer him but his glance fastened upon lampugnani with an expression before which that impudent ruffian lowered his own bold eyes thus for a moment then with an awkward laugh to cover the intimidation that he felt lampugnani walked heavily from the room and banged the door after him  there was about it all a strangeness that set my wits to work in a mighty busy fashion that work suffered interruption by the harsh voice of ramiro  are you resolved boccadoro he growled at me have you decided for the motley or the cord  instantly i fell into the part i was to play  did i choose the latter said i with an assumption of sudden airiness and such a grimace as was part and parcel of my oldtime trade then were i truly worthy of the former for i should have proved myself indeed a fool yet if i choose the former i pray that youll not follow the same course of reasoning and hold me worthy of the latter  when he had understood its subtleties for his wits were of a quality that would have disgraced a calf he roared at the conceit and seemingly thrown into a better humour by the promise of more such entertainment he bade my guards release me and urged me to assume the motley without more delay  what time i was obeying him my mind was returning to that matter of lampugnanis words and it is not difficult to understand how i should arrive at the only possible conclusion they suggested the hats of the other messengers from vitelli that the officer had mentioned had been brought to ramiro the reason for this that at once arose in my mind was that within the messengers hat there was a second and more secret communication for the governor  this secrecy and ramiros display of anger at seeing a hint of it betrayed by lampugnani struck me not unnaturally as suspicious what were these hidden communications that passed between vitellozzo vitelli and the governor of cesena it was a matter of which i could not pretend to offer a solution but nevertheless it was one i thought that promised to repay investigation  ramiro grew impatient and my reflections suffered interruption by his rough command that i should hasten one of the menatarms helped me to truss my points and when that was done i stepped forwardboccadoro the fool once more     chapter xvii the seneschal  for an hour or so that night i played the fool for messer ramiros entertainment in a manner which did high justice to the fame that at pesaro i had earned for the name of boccadoro  beginning with quip and jest and paradox aimed now at him now at the officer who had remained to keep him company in his cups now at the servants who ministered to him now at the guards standing at attention i passed on later to play the part of narrator and i delighted his foul and prurient mind with the story of andreuccio da perugia and another of the more licentious tales of messer giovanni boccacci i crimson now with shame at the manner in which i set myself to pander to his mood that with my wit i might defend my life and limbs and preserve them for the service of my holy flower of the quince in the hour of her need  one man alone of all those present did i spare my banter this was the old seneschal miriani he stood at his post by the buffet and ever and anon he would come forward to replenish messer ramiros cup in obedience to the monsters imperious orders  what fortitude was it i wondered that kept the old man outwardly so calm his face was as the face of one who is dead its features set and rigid its colour ashen but his step was tolerably firm and his hand seemed to have lost the trembling that had assailed it under the first shock of the horror he had witnessed  as i watched him furtively i thought that were i ramiro i should beware of him that frozen calm argued to me some terrible labour of the mind beneath that livid mask but the governor of cesena appeared insensible or else he was contemptuous of danger from that quarter it may even have delighted his outrageous nature to behold a man whose son he had done to death with such brutality continue obedient and submissive to his will for it may have flattered his vanity by the concession that bearing seemed to make to his grim power  an hour went by my second tale was done and i was now entrancing messer ramiro with some impromptu verses upon the divorce of giovanni sforza a theme set me by himself when i was interrupted by the arrival of a soldier who entered unannounced  i paled and turned cold at the cry with which ramiro rose to greet him and the words he dropped which told me that here was one of the riders of the party that under lucagnolo had been ordered to search the country about cattolica had they found madonna  messer lucagnolo the fellow announced has sent me to report to you the failure of his search to the west and north of cattolica he has beaten the country thoroughly for three leagues of the town on those two sides as you desired him but unfortunately without result he is now spreading his search to the south and not a house is being left unvisited by morning he hopes to report again to your excellency  a wild wave of joy swept through my soul they had ransacked the country west and north of cattolica without result why then assuredly they had missed the peasants hut that sheltered her and where she waited yet for my return their search to the south i knew would prove equally futile i could have fallen on my knees in a prayer of thanksgiving had my surroundings been other than they were  ramiros eye wandered round to me and settled on me in a lowering glance by his face it was plain that the message disappointed him  i wonder said he whether we could make you talk and from me his eyes roamed on to the instrument of torture at the end of that long chamber i grew sick with fear for if he were to do this thing and maim me by it how should i avail myself or her hereafter  excellency i cried since you met me you have hinted at something that i am hiding from you at something touching which i could give you information did i choose what it may be passes all thought of mine but this i do assure you no torture could make me tell you what i do not know nor is any torture needed to extract from me such information as i may be possessed of i do but beg that you wilt frankly question me upon this matter whatever it may be and your excellency shall be answered to the best of my knowledge  he looked at me as if taken aback a little by my assurance and the seemingly transparent candour of my speech and in his face i saw that he believed me a moment he hesitated yet then  i am seeking knowledge concerning madonna paolo di santafior he said presently resuming as he spoke his seat at table as i told you the body which was believed to be dead was stolen in the night from san domenico know you aught of this  it may be an ignoble thing to lie but with what other weapon was i to fight this brigand surely if an exception can be made to the rule and a lie become a meritorious thing such an occasion as this would surely justify such an exception  i know nothing i answered boldly unhesitatingly and even with a ring of truth and sincerity that was calculated to convince nor can i even believe this rumour it is a wild story that the body has been stolen may be true enough such things occur though he was a bold man who laid hands upon the body of a person of such importance but that she livesgesu that is an old wifes tale i had myself the word of the lord filippos physician that she was dead  nevertheless this old wifes tale as you dub it is one of which i have had confirmation lend me your wits boccadoro and you shall not regret it exercise them now and conjecture me who could have abstracted the body from the church in seeking this information i am acting in the interests of the noble house of borgia which i serve and to which she was to have been allied as you well know  i could have laughed to see how the apparent sincerity of my denial had convinced him to such an extent that he even sought my help to discover the true thief and to account for his interest in the matter he lied to me of his service to the house of borgia  i will gladly lend you these wits said i to disprove to you the rumour of which you say that you have confirmation let us accept the statement that the body has been stolen that much no doubt is true for even rumours require some slight foundation but who in all this world could say that when the body was taken it was not dead clearly but one manhe that administered the poison and i ask your excellency would he be likely to tell the world what he had done  he might have answered me i am that man but he did not instead he hung his head as if pondering the words of wisdom i had utteredwords meant to convince him of my own innocence in the matter and this they achieved at least in part he flashed me a look of sudden suspicion it is true but it faded almost as soon as it shone from his brooding eye  maybe i am a fool that i do not string you up and test the truth of what you say he grumbled but i incline to believe you and you are a merry rogue you shall remain and have peace and comfort so long as you amuse me but tremble if i discover that you have sought to deceive me you shall have the cord first and other things after and your death shall be the thing youll pray for long before it takes you from my vengeance if you know aught speak now and you shall find me merciful your life and liberty shall be the recompense of your honesty towards me  i repeat excellency i answered without changing colour that all that i know have i already told you  he was convinced i think for the time being  get you gone then he bade me i have other business to deal with ere i sleep mariani see that boccadoro is well lodged  the old man bowed and lifting a torch from its socket he silently motioned me to go with him i made messer ramiro a profound obeisance and withdrew in the wake of the seneschal  he led me up a flight of stairs that rose from the hall and along a gallery that ran half round it then plunging down a corridor he halted presently and opening a door ushered me into a tolerably furnished room  a servant followed hanging the clothes that i had worn when i arrived  the old man lingered a moment after the servant had withdrawn and his hollow eyes rested on me for a second i thought that he was on the point of saying something and i waited returning his glance with one that quailed before the anguish of his own i feared to speak to offer an expression of the sympathy that filled my heart for in that strange place i could not tell how far a man was to be trustedeven a man so wronged as this one on his own part it may be that a like doubt beset him concerning me for in the end he departed as he had come no word having passed his ashen lips  left alone i surveyed my surroundings by the light of the taper he had left in the iron sconce on the wall the single window overlooked the courtyard so that even had i been disposed and able to cut through the iron that barred it i should but succeed in falling into the hands of the guards who abounded in that nest of infamy  so that for the night at least the notion of flight must be abandoned what the morrow would bring forth we must wait and see perhaps some way of escape would offer itself then my thoughts returned to paola and i was tortured by surmises as to her fate and chiefly as to how she could have eluded the search that must have been made for her in the hut where i had left her had the peasant befriended her i wondered and what did she think of my protracted absence i sat on the edge of the bed and gave rein to my conjectures the noises in the castle had all ceased and still i sat on unconscious of time my taper burning low  it may have been midnight when i was startled by the sound of a stealthy step in the corridor near my door a heavy footfall i should have left unheeded but this soft tread aroused me on the instant and i sat listening  it halted at my door and was succeeded by a soft scratching sound noiselessly i rose and with ready hands i waited prepared in the instinct of selfpreservation to fall upon the intruder however futile the act might be but the door did not open as i expected instead the scratching sound continued growing slightly louder then it occurred to me at last that whoever came might be a friend craving admittance and proceeding stealthily that others in the castle might not overhear him  swiftly i crossed to the door and opened on the threshold a dark figure straightened itself from a stooping posture and the light of the taper behind me fell on a face of a pallor that seemed to glisten in its intensity it was the face of mariani the seneschal of the castle of cessna  one glance we exchanged and intuitively i seemed to apprehend the motive of this midnight visit he came either to bring me aid or to seek mine with vengeance for his guerdon i stood aside and silently he entered my room and closed the door  quench your taper he bade me in a husky whisper  without hesitation i obeyed him a strange excitement thrilling me for a second we stood in the dark then another light gleamed as he plucked away the cloak that masked a lanthorn which he had brought with him he set the lanthorn on the floor and held the cloak in his hand ready at a moments notice to conceal the light in its folds then pulling me down beside him on the bed where he had perched himself  my friend said he it may be that i bring you assistance  speak then i bade him you shall not find me slow to act if there is the need or the way  so i had surmised he said are you not that same boccadoro fool of the court of pesaro who donned the lord giovannis armour and rode out to do battle in his stead  i answered him that i was that man  i have heard the tale said he indeed all italy has heard it and knows you for a man of steel as strong and audacious as you are cunning and resourceful i know against what desperate odds you fought that day and how you overcame this terrible ramiro this it is that leads me to hope that in the service of your own ends you may become the instrument of my vengeance  unfold your project man i muttered fiercely almost in my burning eagerness let me hear what you would have me do  he did not answer me until a sob had shaken his old frame  that boy he muttered brokenly that goldenhaired angel sent me for the consolation of my decaying years that lad whom ramiro destroyed so foully and wantonly was my son futile though the attempt had proved i had certainly set my hands at the tyrants neck but that i founded hopes on you of a surer and more terrible revenge that thought has manned me and upheld me when anguish was near to slaying me outright to see the boy burn so under my very eyes god of mercy and pity that i should have lived so long  your child burned but a moment suffered but an instant for the deed ramiro will burn in hell through countless generations through interminable ages  it was a paltry consolation perhaps but it was the best that then occurred to me  meanwhile i begged him do you tell me what you would have me do  i urged him to it that he might thereby suffer his mind to rest a moment from pondering that ghastly thing that he had witnessed that scene that would live before his eyes until they closed in their last sleep  you heard lampugnani quip ramiro with the fact that three messengers have ridden desperately within the week from citta di castello to cesena and you heard perhaps his obscure reference to the hat  i heard both and both i weighed said i the old man looked at me as if surprised  and what he asked was the conclusion you arrived at  why simply this that whilst the messenger bore some letter from vitelli to ramiro that should serve to lull the suspicions of any who wondering at so much traffic between these two should be moved to take a peep into those missives the true letter with which the courier rides is concealed within the lining of his hatprobably unknown even to himself  he stared at me as though i had been a wizard  messer boccadoro he began  my name i corrected him is biancomontelazzaro biancomonte  whatever be your name he returned of the quality of your wits there can be no question you have guessed for yourself the half of what i was come to tell you has your shrewdness borne you any further have you concluded aught concerning the nature of those letters  i have concluded that it might repay some trouble to discover what is contained in letters that are sent with so much secrecy i can conceive nothing that might lie between the lord of citta di castello and this ruffian of cesena and yettreason lurks often where least it is expected and treason makes stranger bedfellows than misfortune  lampugnani was no fool and yet a great fool the old man murmured he surmised what you have surmised with each of the messengers ramiro has dealt in the same manner he has sent each to be fed and refreshed whilst waiting to return with the answer he was penning for their refreshment he has ordered a very full stout winenot drugged for that they might discover upon awaking but a wine that of itself would do the work of setting them to sleep very soundly then when all slept and only he remained at table like the drunkard that he is it has been his habit to descend himself to the kitchen and possess himself of the messengers hat with this he has returned to the hall opened the lining and withdrawn a letter  then as i suppose he has penned his answer thrust it into the lining where the other one had been and secured it as it was before with his own hands he has returned the hat to the place from whence he took it and when the courier awakens in the morning there is another letter put into his hand and he is bidden to bear it to vitelli  he paused a moment then continued lampugnani must have suspected something and watched ramiro to make sure that his suspicions were well founded in that he was wise but he was a fool to allow ramiro to see what lie he had discovered already he has paid the penalty he is lying with a dagger in his throat for an hour ago ramiro stabbed him while he slept  i shuddered what a place of blood was this could it be that cesare borgia had no knowledge of what things were being performed by his governor of cesena  poor lampugnani i sighed god rest his soul  i doubt but he is in hell answered mariani without emotion he was as great a villain as his master and he has gone to answer for his villainy even as this ugly monster of a ramiro shall but let lampugnani be i am not come to talk of him  returning from his bloody act ramiro ordered me to bed i went and as i passed lampugnanis room i saw the door standing wide it was thus that i learnt what had befallen i remembered his words concerning the hat and i remembered old suspicions of my own aroused by the thought of the potent wine which ramiro had ordered me to see given to the couriers i sped back to the gallery that overlooks the hall ramiro was absent and i surmised at once that he was gone to the kitchen then was it that i thought of you and of what service you might render if things were indeed as i now more than suspected like an inspiration it came to me how i might prepare your way i ran down to the hall sweating in my terror that he should return ere i had performed the task i went on from the buffet i drew a flagon of that same stout wine that ramiro used upon his messengers i ripped away the seal and crimson cord by which it is distinguished and placing it on the table i removed the flagon i had set for him before i had first departed  then i fled back to the gallery and from the shadows i watched for his return soon he came bearing a hat in his hand and from that hat he took a letter all as you have surmised he read it and i saw his face lighten with a fierce excitement then he helped himself freely to wine and drank thirstily for all that he was overladen with it one of the qualities of this wine is that in quenching thirst it produces yet a greater ramiro drank again then sat with the letter before him in the light of the single taper i had left burning presently he grew sleepy he shook himself and drank again then again he sat conning his epistle and thus i left him and came hither in quest of you  there followed a pause  well i asked at length what is it you would have me do stab him as he sleeps  he shook his head that were too sweet and sudden a death for him if it had been no more than a matter of that my old arms would have lent me strength enough but think you it would repay me for having seen my boy pinned by that monsters pike to the burning logs  what is it then you ask of me  if that letter were indeed the treasonable document we account it if its treason should be aimed at cesare borgiait could scarce be aimed at anotherwould it not be a sweet thing to obtain possession of it  aye but when he wakes tomorrow and finds it gonewhat then you know this governor of cesena well enough to be assured that he would ransack the castle torture rack burn and flay us all until the missive were forthcoming  that he groaned is what deterred me if i had the means of getting the letter sent to cesare borgia or of escaping with it myself from cesena i should not have hesitated cesare borgia is lying at faenza and i could ride there in a day but it would be impossible for me to leave the place before morning i have duties to perform in the town and i might get away whilst i am about them but before then the letter will have been missed and no one will be allowed to leave the citadel  why then said i the only hope lies in abstracting that letter in such a manner that he shall not suspect the loss and that seems a very desperate hope  we sat in silence for some moments during which i thought intently to little purpose  does he sleep yet think you i asked presently  assuredly he must  and if i were to go to the gallery is there any fear that i should be discovered by others  none all at cesena are asleep by now  then said i rising let us take a look at him who knows what may suggest itself come i moved towards the door and he took up his lanthorn and followed me enjoining me to tread lightly     chapter xviii the letter   on tiptoe i crept down that corridor to the gallery above the banquetinghall secure from sight in the enveloping darkness and intent upon allowing no sound to betray my presence lest ramiro should have awakened behind me treading as lightly came messer mariani  thus we gained the gallery i leaned against the stout oaken balustrade and looked down into the black pit of the hall broken in the centre by the circle of light from the two tapers that burnt upon the table the other torches had all been quenched  at the table sat messer ramiro his head fallen forward and sideways upon his right arm which was outstretched and limp along the board before him lay a paper which i inferred to be the letter whose possession might mean so much  i could hear the old man breathing heavily beside me as i leaned there in the dark and sought to devise a means by which that paper might be obtained no doubt it would be the easiest thing in the world to snatch it away without disturbing him but there was always to be considered that when he waked and missed the letter we should have to reckon with his measures to regain possession of it  it became necessary therefore to go about it in a manner that should leave him unsuspicious of the theft a little while i pondered this deeming the thing desperate at first then an idea came to me on a sudden and turning to mariani i asked him could he find me a sheet of paper of about the size of that letter held by ramiro he answered me that he could and bade me wait there until he should return  i waited watching the sleeper below my excitement waxing with every second of the delay ramiro was snoring nowa loud sonorous snore that rang like a trumpetblast through that vast empty hall  at last mariani returned bringing the sheet of paper i had asked for and he was full of questions of what i intended but neither the place nor the time was one in which to stand unfolding plans every moment wasted increased the uncertainty of the success of my design someone might come or ramiro might awaken despite the potency of the wine he had been givenfor on so wellseasoned a toper the most potent of wines could have but a transient effect  so i left mariani and moved swiftly and silently to the head of the staircase  i had gone down two steps when in the dark i missed the third the bells in my cap jangling at the shock i brought my teeth together and stood breathless in apprehension fearing that the noise might awaken him and cursing myself for a careless fool to have forgotten those infernal bells above me i heard a warning hiss from old mariani which if anything increased my dread but ramiro snored on and i was reassured  a moment i stood debating whether i should go on or first return to divest myself of that cap of mine in the end i decided to pursue the latter course the need for swift and sudden movement might come ere i was done with this adventure and those bells might easily be the undoing of me so back i went to the surprise and infinite dismay of mariani until i had whispered in his ear the reason we retreated together to the corridor and there with his help i removed my jangling headgear which i left him to restore to my chamber  whilst he went upon that errand i returned once more on mine and this time i gained the foot of the stairs without mishap and stood in the hall ramiros back was towards me on my right stood the tall buffet from which the boy had fetched him wine that evening this i marked out as the cover to which i must fly in case of need  a second i stood hesitating still considering my course then i went softly forward my feet making no sound in the rushes of the floor i had covered half the distance and growing bolder i was advancing more swiftly and with less caution when suddenly my knee came in contact with a threelegged stool that had been carelessly left where none would have suspected it the blow may have hurt afterwards indeed i was conscious of a soreness at the knee but at the moment i had no thought or care for physical pain the bench went over with a crash and for all that the rushes may have deadened in part the sound of its fall to my nervous ear it boomed like the report of a cannon through the stillness of the place  i turned cold as ice and the sweat of fear sprang out to moisten me from head to foot instantly i dropped on all fours lest ramiro awaking suddenly should turn and i waited for the least sign that should render advisable my seeking the cover of the buffet in the gallery above i could picture old mariani clenching his teeth at the noise his knees knocking together and his face white with horror for ramiros snoring had abruptly ceased it came to an end with a choking catch of the breath and i looked to see him raise his head and start up to ascertain what it was that had aroused him but he never stirred and for all that he no longer snored his breathing continued heavy and regular so that i was cheered by the assurance that i had but disturbed his slumber not dispelled it  yet since i had disturbed and lightened it a greater precaution was now necessary and i waited there for some ten minutes maybe a period that must have proved a very eternity to the old man upstairs at last i had the reward of hearing the snoring recommence lightly at first but soon with all its former fullness  i rose and proceeded now with a caution that must guard me from any more unlookedfor obstacles moreover as i approached the darkness was dispelled more and more at every stride in the direction of the light at last i reached the table and stood silent as a spectre at ramiros side looking down upon the features of the sleeping man  his face was flushed and his tawny hair tumbled about his damp brow his lips quivered as he breathed for a moment as i stood gazing on him there was murder in my mind his dagger hung temptingly in his girdle to have drawn it and rid the world of this monster might have been a worthy deed acceptable in the eyes of heaven but how should it profit me rather must it prove my destruction at the hands of his followers and to be destroyed just then with paola depending upon me and life full of promise once i regained my liberty was something i had no mind to risk  my eyes wandered to the letter lying on the table if this were of the nature we suspected it should prove a safer tool for his destruction  to read it as it lay was an easy matter and it came to me then that ere i decided upon my course it might be well that i should do so if by chance it were innocent of treason why then i might resort to the risk of that other and more desperate weaponhis own dagger  at the foot of the short flight of steps that led from the hall to the courtyard i could hear the slow pacing of the sentry placed there by ramiro but unless he were summoned it was extremely unlikely that the fellow would leave his post so that i concluded i had little to fear from that quarter i drew back and taking up a position behind ramiros chaira position more favourable to escape in the untoward event of his awakingi craned forward to read the letter over his shoulder i thanked god in that hour for two things that my sight was keen and that vitellozzo vitelli wrote a large bold hand  scarcely breathing and distracted the while by the mad racing of my pulses i read and this as nearly as i can remember is what the letter contained  illustrious ramiroyour answer to my last letter reached me safely and it rejoiced me to learn that you had found a man for our undertaking see that you have him in readiness for the hour of action is at hand cesare goes south on the second or third day of the new year and he has announced to me his intention of passing through cesena on his way there to investigate certain charges of maladministration which have been preferred against you these concern in particular certain misappropriation of grain and stores and an excessive severity of rule of which complaints have reached him from this you will gather that out of a spirit of selfdefence if not to earn the reward which we have bound ourselves to pay you it is expedient that you should not fail us the occasion of the dukes visit to cesena will be of all the most propitious for our purpose have your arbalister posed and may god strengthen his arm and render true his aim to the end that italy may be rid of a tyrant i commend myself to your excellency and i shall anxiously await your news  vitellozzo vitelli  here indeed were my hopes realised a plot there was and it aimed at nothing less than the duca valentinos life let that letter be borne to cesare borgia at faenza and i would warrant that within a dozen hours of his receipt of it he would so dispose that all who had suffered by the cruel tyranny of ramiro del orca would be avenged and those who were still suffering would be relieved in this letter lay my own freedom and the salvation of madonna paula and this letter it behoved me at once to become possessed it was a safer far alternative than that dagger of his  a moment i stood pondering the matter for the last time then stepping sideways and forward so that i was again beside him i put out my hand and swiftly whipped the letter from the table then standing very still to prevent the slightest rustle i remained a second or two observing him he snored on undisturbed by my lightfingered action  i drew away a pace or two as lightly as i might and folding the letter i thrust it into my girdle then from my open doublet i drew the sheet that mariani had supplied me and advancing again i placed it on the table in a position almost identical with that which the original had occupied saving that it was removed a halffingers breadth from his hand for i feared to allow it actually to touch him lest it should arouse him  holding my breath for now was i come to the most desperate part of my undertaking i caught up one of the tapers and set fire to a corner of the sheet that done i left the candle lying on its side against the paper so as to convey the impression to him when presently he awakened that it had fallen from it sconce then without waiting for more i backed swiftly away watching the progress of the flames as they devoured the paper and presently reached his hand and scorched it  at that i dropped again on all fours and having gained the corner of the buffet i crouched there even as with a sudden scream of pain he woke and sprang upright shaking his blistered hand as a matter of instinct he looked about to see what it was had hurt him then his eyes fell upon the charred paper on the table and the fallen candle which was still burning across one end of it and even to the dull wits of ramiro del orca the only possible conclusion was suggested he stared at it a moment then swept that flimsy sheet of ashes from the table with an oath and sank back once more into his great leathern chair  body of god he swore aloud it is well that i had read it a dozen times better that it should have been burnt than that someone should have read it whilst i slept  the idea of such a possibility seemed to rouse him to fresh action for seizing the fallen candle and replacing it in its socket he rose once more and holding it high above his head he looked about the hall  the light it shed may have been feeble and the shadows about my buffet thick but as i have said my doublet was open and some ray of that weak candlelight must have found out the white shirt that was showing at my breast for with a sudden cry he pushed back his chair and took a step towards me no doubt intent upon investigating that white something that he saw gleaming there  i waited for no more i had no fancy to be caught in that corner utterly at his mercy i stood up suddenly  magnificent it is i i announced with a calm and boundless effrontery  the boldness of it may have staggered him a little for he paused although his eyes were glowing horribly with the frenzy that possessed him the half of which was drunkenness the other fear and wrath lest i should have seen his treacherous communication from vitelli  what make you here he questioned threateningly  i thirsted excellency i answered glibly i thirsted and i bethought me of this buffet where you keep your wine  he continued to eye me some six paces off his halfdrunken wits no doubt weighing the plausibility of my answer at last  if that be all what cause had you to hide he asked me shrewdly  one of your candles fell over and awakened you said i i feared you might resent my presence and so i hid  you came not near the table he inquired you saw nothing of the paper that i held nay by the host ill take no risks you were born neath an unlucky star fool for be your reason for your presence here no more than you assert you have come in a season that must be fatal to you  he set the candle on the table then carrying his hand to his girdle he withdrew it sharply and i caught the gleam of a dagger  in that instant i thought of mariani waiting above and like a flash it came to me that if i could outpace this drunken brigand and gaining the gallery well ahead of him transfer that letter to the old mans hands i should not die in vain cesare borgia would avenge me and madonna paola at least would be safe from this villain if mariani could reach valentino at faenza i would answer for it that within fourandtwenty hours messer ramiro del orca would be the banner on that ghastly beam that he facetiously dubbed his flagstaff and he would be the blackest dirtiest banner that ever yet had fluttered there  the thought conceived in the twinkling of an eye i acted upon without a seconds hesitation ere ramiro had taken his first step towards me i had sprung to the stairs and i was leaping up them with the frantic speed of one upon whose heels death is treading closely  a singular fierce joy was blent with my measure of fear a joy at the thought that even now in this extremity i was outwitting him for never a doubt had he that the burnt paper he had found on the table was all that was left of vitellis letter his fears were that i might have read it but never a suspicion crossed his mind of such a trick as i had played upon him  so i sped on the gigantic ramiro blundering after me panting and blaspheming for although powerful his bulk and the wine he had taken left him no nimbleness the distance between us widened and if only mariani would have the presence of mind to wait for me at the mouth of the passage all would be as i could wish it before his dagger found my heart  i was assuring myself of this when in the dark i stumbled and striking my legs against a stair i hurtled forward i recovered almost immediately but in my frenzy of haste to make up for the instant lost i stumbled a second time ere i was well upon my feet  with a roar ramiro must have hurled himself forward for i felt my ankle caught in a grip from which there was no escaping and i was roughly and brutally dragged back and down those stairs now my head now my breast beating against the steps as i descended them one by one  but even in that hour the letter was my first thought and i found a way to thrust it farther under my girdle so that it should not be seen  at last i reached the hall halfstunned and with all the misery of defeat and the certainty of the futility of my death to further torture my last moments over me stood ramiro his dagger upheld ready to strike  dog he taunted me your sands are run  mercy magnificent i gasped i have done nothing to deserve your poniard  he laughed brutally delaying his stroke that he might prolong my agony for his drunken entertainment  address your prayers to heaven he mocked me and let them concern your soul  and then like a flash of inspiration came the words that should delay his hand  spare me i cried for i am in mortal sin  impious abandoned villain though he was he said too much when he boasted that he feared neither god nor devil he was prone to forget his god and the lessons that as a babe he had learnt at his mothers kneefor i take it that even ramiro del orca had once been a babebut deep down in his soul there had remained the fear of hell and an almost instinctive obedience to the laws of mother church he could perform such ruthless cruelties as that of hurling a page into the fire to punish his clumsiness he could rack and stab and hang men with the least shadow of compunction or twinge of conscience but to slay a man who professed himself to be in mortal sin was a deed too appalling even for this ruthless butcher  he hesitated a second then he lowered his hand his face telling me clearly how deeply he grudged me the respite which yet he dared not do other than accord me  where shall i find me a priest he grumbled think you the citadel of cesena is a monastery i will wait while you make an act of contrition for your sins it is all the shrift i can afford you and get it done for it is time i was abed you shall have five minutes in which to clear your soul  by this it seemed to meas it may well seem to youthat matters were but little mended and instead of employing the respite he accorded me in the pious collecting of thoughts which he enjoined i sat upvery sore from my descent of the stairsand employed those precious moments in putting forward arguments to turn him from his murderous purpose  i have lived too ungodly a life i protested to be able to squeeze into paradise through so narrow a tate as you would hope for your own ultimate salvation excellency i do beseech you not to imperil mine  this disposed him at least to listen to me and proceeded to assure him of the harmless nature of my visit to the hall in quest of wine to quench my thirst i was running the grave risk of dying with lies on my lips but i was too desperate to give the matter thought just then his mood seemed to relent the delay perhaps had calmed his first access of passion and he was grown more reasonable but when ramiro cooled he was perhaps more malignant than ever for it meant a return to natural condition and ramiros natural condition was one of cruelty unsurpassed  it may be as you say he answered me at last sheathing his dagger and at least you have my word that i will not slay you without first assuring myself that you have lied for tonight you shall remain in durance tomorrow we will apply the question to you  the hope that had been reviving in my breast fell dead once more and i turned cold at that threat and yet between now and tomorrow much might betide and i had cause for thankfulness perhaps for this respite thus i sought to cheer myself but i fear i failed tomorrow he would torture me not so much to ascertain whether i had spoken truly but because to his diseased mind it afforded diversion to witness a mans anguish no doubt it was that had urged him now to spare my life and accord me this merciless piece of mercy  in a loud voice he called the sentry who was pacing below and in a moment the man appeared in answer to that summons  you will take this knave to the chamber set apart for him up there and you will leave him secure under lock and bar bringing me the key of his door  the fellow informed himself which was the chamber then turning to me he curtly bade me go with him thus was i haled back to my room with the promise of horrors on the morrow but with the night before me in which to scheme and pray for some miracle that might yet save me but the days of miracles were long past i lay on my bed and deplored with many a sigh that bitter fact and if aught had been wanting to increase the weight of fear and anguish on my already overburdened mind and to aid in what almost seemed an infernal plot to utterly distract me i had it in fresh wild conjectures touching madonna paola where indeed could she be that ramiros men had failed to find her for all that they had scoured that part of the country in which i had left her to wait for my return what if by now worse had befallen her than the capture with which ramiros lieutenant was charged  with such doubts as these to haunt me fretted as i was by my utter inability to take a step in her service i lay there for an hour or so in such agony of mind as is begotten only of suspense in my girdle still reposed the treasonable letter from vitelli to ramiro a mighty weapon with which to accomplish the butchers overthrow but how was i to wield it imprisoned here  i wondered why mariani had not returned only to remember that the soldier who had locked me in had carried the key of my prisonchamber to ramiro  suddenly the stillness was disturbed by a faint tap at my door my instincts and my reason told me it must be mariani at last in an instant i had leapt from the bed and whispered through the keyhole  who is there  it is imarianithe seneschal came the old mans voice very softly but nevertheless distinctly they have taken the key  i groaned then in a gust of passion i fell to cursing ramiro for that precaution  you have the letter came marianis voice again  aye i have it still i answered  have you seen what it contains  a plot to assassinate the dukeno less enough to get this bloody ramiro broken on the wheel  i was answered by a sound that was as a gasp of malicious joy then the old mans voice added  can you pass it under the door there is a sufficient gap  i felt and found that he was right i could pass the half of my hand underneath i took the letter and thrust it through his hands fastened on it instantly almost snatching it from my fingers before they were ready to release it  have courage he bade me listen i shall endeavour to leave cesena in the morning and i shall ride straight for faenza if i find the duke there when i arrive he should be here within some twelve or fourteen hours of my departure fence with ramiro temporise if you can till then and all will be well with you  i will do what i can i answered him but if he slays me in the meantime at least i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that he will not be long in following me  may god shield you he said fervently  may god speed you i answered him with a still greater fervour  that night as you may well conceive i slept but little and that little ill the morning instead of relieving the fears that in the darkness had been with me seemed to increase them for now was the time for mariani to act and i was fearful as to how he might succeed i was full of doubts lest some obstacle should have arisen to prevent his departure from cesena and i spent my morning in wearisome speculation  i took an almost childish satisfaction in the thought that since being a prisoner i could no longer count myself the fool of the court of cesena i was free to strip the motley and assume the more sober garments in which i had been taken and whichas you may recallhad been placed in my chamber on the previous evening it was the very plainest raiment for doublet i wore a buff brigandine quilted and daggerproof and caught at the waist by a girdle of hammered steel my winecoloured hose was stout and serviceable as were my long boots of untanned leather yet prouder was i of this sober apparel than ever king of his ermine  it may have been an hour or so past noon when at last my solitude was invaded by a soldier who came to order me into the presence of the governor i had been sitting at the window leaning against the bars and looking out at the desolate white landscape for there had been a heavy fall of snow in the night which reminded meas snow ever didof my first meeting with madonna paola  i rose upon the instant and my fears rose with me but i kept a bold front as i went down into the hall where ramiro and the blackguards of his court were sitting with three or four menatarms at attention by the door close to the pulleys appertaining to the torture of the cord stood two leatherclad ruffiansramiros executioners  at the head of the board which was still strewn with fragments of foodfor they had but dinedsat ramiro del orca with him were half a dozen of his officers whose villainous appearance pronounced them worthy of their brutal leader the air was heavy with the pungent odour of viands i looked round for mariani and i took some comfort from the fact that he was absent might heaven please that he was even then on his way to faenza  ramiro watched my advance with a smile in which mockery was blent with satisfaction for all that of the resumption of my proper raiment he seemed to take no heed no doubt he had dined well and he was now disposing himself to be amused  messer bocadaro said he when i had come to a standstill there was last night a matter that was not cleared up between us and concerning which i expressed an intention of questioning you today i should proceed to do so at once were it not that there is yet another matter on which i am if possible still more desirous you should tell us all you know once already have you evaded my questions with answers which at the time i half believed even now i do not say that i utterly disbelieve them but i wish to assure myself that you told the truth for if you lied why then we may still be assisted by such information the cord shall squeeze from you i am referring to the mysterious disappearance of madonna paola di santafiora disappearance of which you have assured me that you knew nothing being even in ignorance of the fact that the lady was not really dead i had confidently expected that the party searching for madonna paola would have succeeded ere this in finding her but this morning my hopes suffered disappointment my men have returned emptyhanded once more  for which mercy may heaven be praised i burst out  he scowled at me then he laughed evilly  my men have returnedall save three captain lucagnolo with two of his followers has undertaken to go beyond the area i appointed for the search and to proceed to the village of cattolica while he is pursuing his inquiries there i have resolved to pursue my own here i now call upon you boccadoro to tell us what you know of madonna paolas whereabouts  i know nothing i answered stoutly i am prepared to take oath that i know nothing of her whereabouts  tell me then at least said he where you bestowed her  i shook my head pressing my lips tight  do you think that i would tell you if i had the knowledge was the scornful question with which i answered him you may pursue your inquiries as you will and where you will but i pray god they may all prove as futile as must those that you would pursue here and upon my own person  this was how i fenced with him this was the manner in which i followed marianis sound advice that i should temporise oh i know that my words were the words of a fool yet no fear that ramiro would inspire me could have restrained them  there was a murmur at the table and his fellows turned their eyes on ramiro to see how he would receive this bearding he smiled quietly and raising his hand he made a sign to the executioners  rude hands seized me from behind and the doublet was torn from my back by fingers that never paused to untruss my points  they turned me about and hurried me along until i stood under the pulleys of the torture and one of the men held me securely whilst the other passed the cords about my wrists then both the executioners stepped back to be ready to hoist me at the governors signal  he delayed it much as an epicure delays the consumption of a delectable morsel heightening by suspense the keen desire of his palate he watched me closely and had my lips quivered or my eyelids fluttered he would have hailed with joy such signs of weakness but i take pride in truthfully writing that i stood bold and impassively before him and if i was pale i thank heaven that pallor was the habit of my countenance so that from that he could gather no satisfaction and standing there i gave him back look for look and waited  for the last time boccadoro he said slowly attempting by words to shake a demeanour that was proof against the impending facts of the cord i ask you to remember what must be the consequences of this stubbornness if not at the first hoist why then at the second or the third the torture will compel you to disclose what you may know would you not be better advised to speak at once while your limbs are soundly planted in their sockets rather than let yourself be maimed perhaps for life ere you will do so  there was a stir of hoofs without they thundered on the planks of the drawbridge and clattered on the stones of the courtyard the thought of cesare borgia rose to my mind but never did drowning man clutch at a more illusory straw cold reason quenched my hope at once if the greatest imaginable success attended marianis journey the duke could not reach cesena before midnight and to that it wanted some ten hours at least moreover the company that came was small to judge by the sounda halfdozen horses at the most  but ramiros attention had been diverted from me by the noise halfturning in his chair he called to one of the menatarms to ascertain who came before the fellow could do his bidding the door was thrust open and lucagnolo appeared on the threshold jaded and worn with hard riding  a certain excitement arose in me at sight of him despite my confidence that he must be returning emptyhanded  ramiro rose pushed back his chair and advanced towards the newcomer  well he demanded what news  excellency the girl is here  that answer seemed to turn me into stone so great was the shock of this sudden shattering of the confidence that had sustained me  my search in the country failing pursued the captain as he came forward i made bold to exceed your orders by pushing my inquiries as far as the village of cattolica there i found her after some little labour  surely i dreamt surely i told myself this was not possible there was some mistake lucagnolo had drought some wench whom he believed to be madonna paola  but even as i was assuring myself of this the door opened again and between two menatarms white as death her garments stained with mud and all but reduced to rags and her eyes wild with a great fear came my beloved paola  with a sound that was as a grunt of satisfaction ramiro strode forward to meet her but her eyes travelled past him and rested upon me standing there between the leatherclad executioners with the cords of the torture pinioning my wrists and i saw the anguish deepen in their blue depths     chapter xix doomed  across the length of that hall our eyes methers and mineand held each others glances to me the room and all within it formed an indistinct and misty picture from out of which there clearly gleamed my paolas sweet white face  all at the table had risen with ramiro and now copying their leader they bared their heads in outward token of such respect as certainly would have been felt by any men less abandoned than were they before so much saintly beauty and distress  lucagnolo had stepped aside and ramiro was now bowing low and ceremoniously before madonna his face i could not see since his back was towards me but his tones as they floated across the hall to where i stood came laden with subservience  madonna i give praise and thanks to heaven for this said he i was afflicted by the gravest misgivings for your safety and i am more than thankful to behold you safe and sound  there was a hypocritical flavour of courtliness about his words and a mincing of his tones that suggested the efforts of a bullcalf to imitate the warbling of a throstle  madonna paid him no heed indeed she appeared not to have heard him for her eyes continued to look past him and at me at last her lips parted and although she scarcely seemed to raise her voice above a whisper the word uttered reached my ears across the stillness of the great room and the word was lazzaro  at mention of my name and at the tone in which it was uttereda tone that betrayed same measure of what was in her heartramiro wheeled sharply in my direction his brows wrinkling a certain craftiness he had for all that i ever accounted him the dullestwitted clod that ever rose to his degree of honour he must have realised how expedient it was that in all he did he should present himself to madonna in a favourite light  release him he bade the executioners that held me and in an instant i was set free the order given he turned again to madonna  you have been torturing him she cried and her words were hard and fierce her eyes blazing you shall repent it ser ramiro the lord cesare borgia shall hear of it  her anger betrayed her more and more and however hidden it may have been to her to me it was exceeding clear that she was encompassing my destruction ramiro laughed easily  madonna you are at fault we have not been torturing him though i confess that we were on the point of putting him to the question but your timely arrival has saved his limbs for the question we were asking him concerned your whereabouts  i would have shouted to her to be wary how she answered him for some premonition how he was about to trick her entered my mind but realising the futility of such a course i held my peace and waited agonisedly  you had tortured him in vain then she answered scornfully for lazzaro biancomonte would never have betrayed me nor could he have betrayed me if he would for after your men had searched the hut in which i was hidden i walked to cattolica thinking foolishly that i should be safer there  lackaday she had told him the very thing he had sought to know yet to make doubly sure he pursued the scent a little farther  indeed it seems to me that had i tortured him i had given him no more than he deserved for having abandoned you in that hut madonna i tremble to think of the harm that might have come to you through that knaves desertion and he scowled across at me much as the pharisee might have scowled upon the publican  he is no knave she answered and i could have groaned to hear her working my undoing though not by so much as a sign might i inspire her with caution for that sign must have been seen by others nor did he abandon me he left me only to go in quest of the necessaries for our journey if harm has come to me the blame of it must not rest on him  of what harm do you speak madonna he cried in a voice laden with concern  of what harm she echoed eyeing him with a scorn that would have slain him had he any manhood left of what harm mother of mercy defend me do you ask the question what greater harm could have come to me than to have fallen into the hands of ramiro del orca and his brigands  he stood looking at her and i doubt not that his face was a very picture of simulated consternation  surely madonna you do not understand that we are your friends that you can so abuse us but you will be faint madonna he cried with a fresh and deep solicitude a cup of wine and he waved his hand towards the table  it would poison me i think she answered coldly  you are cruel andalasmistrustful said he can you guess nothing of the anxiety that has been mine these two days of the fears that have haunted me as i thought of you and your wanderings  her lip curled and her face took on some slight vestige of colour her spirit was a thing for which i might then have come to love her had it not been that already i loved her to distraction  yes said she i can guess something of your dismay when you found your schemes frustrated when you found that you had come too late to san domenico  will you not forgive me that shift to which my adoration drove me he implored in a honeyed voiceand a more fearful thing than ramiro the butcher was ramiro the lover  at that scarcely covert avowal of his passion she recoiled a step as she might before a thing unclean the little colour faded from her cheek the scorn departed from her lip and a sickly deadly fear overspread her lovely face god that i should stand there and witness this insult to the woman i adored and worshipped with a fervour that the church seeks to instil into us for those about the throne of heaven it might not be a blind access of fury took me of the consequences i thought nothing reason left me utterly and the slight hope that might lie in temporising was disregarded  before those about me could guess my purpose or those others too engrossed in the scene at the far end of the hall could intervene i had sprung from between the executioners and dashed across the space that separated me from the governor of cesena one wellaimed blow and there should be an end to messer ramiro that was the only thought that found room in my disordered mind  one or two there were who cried out as i sped past them swift as the hound when it speeds after the fleeing hare but i was upon ramiro ere any could have sufficiently mastered his surprise to interfere  by the nape of his great neck i caught him from behind and setting my knee at his spine i wrenched him backward and so flung him over on the floor down i went with him my hand reaching for the dagger at his jewelled girdle and i had found and drawn it in that swift action of mine ere he had bethought him of his hands up it flashed and down i sank it through the crimson velvet of his rich doublets straight at the spot where his heart should beif he were so human as to have a heart the next instant i turned cold and sick my desperate effort had been all for nothing in my hand i was left with the bronze hilt of his great poniard the blade had broken off against the mesh of steel the coward wore beneath his finery  there was a rush of feet about us a piercing scream from madonna paola and it was to her that i owed my life in that grim moment a dozen blades were naked and would have transfixed me as i lay but that she covered my body with her own and bade them strike at me through her  a moment later and the powerful hands of the governor of cesena were at my throat i was lifted and tossed aside as though i had been a hound and he the bull i had beset and as he swung me over and crushed me to the ground he knelt above me and grinned horribly into my purpling face  a second we stayed so and i thought indeed that my hour was come when suddenly i felt the blood in my head released once more he had taken his hands from my throat he seized me now by the collar and dragged me rudely to my feet  take this knave and lock him in his chamber he bade a couple of his bravi i may have need of him ere he dies  messer ramiro came the interceding voice of madonna paola what he did he did for me you will not let him die for it  there was a pause during which he looked at her whilst the men were roughly dragging me across the hall  who knows madonna he said with a bow and an infernal smile if you were to beg his life it might even come to pass that i might spare it  he did not wait for her answer but stepping after me he called to the men that led me in obedience they halted and he came forward we were now at the foot of the staircase  boccadoro said he planting himself before me and eyeing me with eyes that were very full of malice you will recall the punishment i promised you if i came to discover it was you had thwarted me in pesaro it is the second time you have fooled ramiro del orca there does not live the man who can boast that he did it thrice nor will i risk it that you be that man make your peace with heaven for at sunsetin an hours timeyou hang there is one little thing that might save you even yet and if you find life sweet you would do well to pray that that little thing may come to pass  i answered him nothing but i bowed my head in token that i had heard and he signed to the men to proceed with me whilst turning on his heel he stepped down the hall again to where madonna paola overcome with weakness had sunk upon a stool  as i was leaving the gallery i had a last glimpse of her sitting there with drawn face and haggard eyes that followed me as i passed from her sight whilst ramiro del orca stood beside her murmuring words that did not reach me his socalled courtiers and his menatarms were trooping out of the room no doubt in obedience to his dismissal     chapter xx the sunset   i have heard tell of the calm that comes upon brave men when hope is dead and their doom has been pronounced uncertainty may have tortured and made cowards of them but once that uncertainty is dissolved and suspense is at an end resignation enters their soul and possessing it gives to their bearing a noble and dignified peace by the mercy of heaven they are made maybe to see how poor and evanescent a thing is life and they come to realise that since to die is a necessity there is no avoiding as well might it betide today as ten years hence  such a mood however came not to soothe that last hour of mine and yet i account myself no coward it was an hour of such torture and anguish as never before i had experiencedmuch though i had undergoneand the source of all my suffering lay in the fact that madonna paola was in the hands of the ogre of cesena had it not been for that most untoward circumstance i almost believe that while i waited for the sun to set on that december afternoon my mood had not only been calm but even in some measure joyous for it must have comforted my last moments to reflect that for all that messer ramiro was about to hang me yet had i sown the seeds of his own destruction ere he had brought me to this pass  i did indeed reflect upon it and it may even be that in spite of all i culled some grain of comfort from the reflection but let that be my narrative would drag wearily were i to digress that i might tell you at length the ugly course of my thoughts whilst the sands of my last hour were running swiftly out for after all my concern and yours is with the story of lazzaro biancomonte sometime known as boccadoro the fool and not with his philosophiesphilosophies so unprofitable that it can benefit no man that i should set them down  my windows faced west and so i was able to watch the fall of the sun and measure by its shortening distance from the horizon the ebbing of my poor life at last the nether rim of that round fiery orb was on the point of touching the line of distant hills and it was casting a crimson glow along the white snowsheeted landscape that was singularly suggestive of a tide of blooda very fitting tide to flow and ebb about the walls of the castle of cesena  one little thing there was might save me ramiro had said but i had shut the thought out of my mind to keep me from utter distraction the only little thing in which i held that my salvation could lie would be in the miraculous arrival of cesare borgia and of that not the faintest hope existed if the greatest luck attended marianis errand and the greatest speed were made by the duke once he received the letter he could not reach cesena in less than another eight hours and another eight minutes to reckon by the swift sinking of the sun would see the time appointed for my hanging i thought of joshua in that grim hour and in a mood that approached the whimsical i envied him his gift if i could have stayed the setting of the sun and held it where it was till midnight all might yet be well if mariani had been diligent and cesare swift  the key grating in the lock put an end to my vague musings and reminded me of the fact that i had neglected to employ that last hour as would have become a good son of mother church for an instant i believe that my heart turned me to thoughts of god and sent up a prayer for mercy for my poor sinful soul then the door swung wide two halberdiers and a carnifex in his odious leathern apron stood before me clearly ramiro sought to be exact and to have me hanging the instant the sun should vanish  it is time said one of the soldiers whilst the executioner stepping into my chamber pinioned my wrists behind me and retaining hold of the cord bade me march he followed holding that slender cord and so like a beast to the shambles went i  once more they led me into the hall where the shadows were lengthening in dark contrast to the splashes of sunlight that lingered on the floor and whose bloodred hue was deepened by the gules of the windows through which it was filtered  ramiro was waiting for me and six of his officers were in attendance but for once there were no menatarms at hand on a chair the one usually occupied by ramiro himself sat madonna paola still in her torn and bedraggled raiment her face white her eyes wild as they had been when first she had been haled into ramiros presence some two hours ago and her features so rigidly composed that it told the tale of the awful selfcontrol she must be exertinga selfcontrol that might end with a sudden snap that would plunge her into madness  a wild rage possessed me at sight of her let ramiro be ruthless and cruel where men were concerned that was a thing for which forgiveness might be found him but that he should submit a lady delicately nurtured as was madonna to such horrors as she had undergone since she had awakened from his sleepingpotion in the church of san domenico was something for which no hell could punish him condignly  ramiro met me with a countenance through the assumed gravity of which i could espy his wicked infernal mockery peeping forth  i deplore your end lazzaro biancomonte said he slowly for you are a brave man and brave men are rare you were worthy of better things but you chose to cross swords with ramiro del orca and you have got your deathblow may god have mercy on your soul  i am praying said i for just so much mercy as you shall have justice if my prayer is heard i should be wellcontent  he changed countenance a little so too i thought did madonna paola my firmness may have yielded her some grain of comfort ramiro set his hands on his hips and eyed me squarely  you are a dauntless rogue he confessed  i laughed for answer and in that moment it entered my mind that i might yet enjoy some measure of revenge in this life more than that i might benefit madonna for were the seed i was about to sow to take root in the craven heart of ramiro del orca it would so fully occupy his mind that he would have little time to bestow on paola in the few hours that were left him but before i could bethink me of words he was speaking again  i held out to you a slender hope said he i told you that there was one little thing might save you that hope has borne no fruit the little thing i spoke of has not come to pass it rested with madonna paola here she had it in her hands to effect your salvation but she has refused your blood rests on her head  she shuddered at the words and a low moan escaped her she covered her face with her hands a moment i stood looking at her then i shifted my glance to ramiro  will it please you illustrious to allow me a few moments conversation with madonna paola di santafior  i invested my tones with a weight of meaning that did not escape him his face suddenly lightened whilst one of his officersa fellow very fitly named luponelaughed outright  your hero seems none so heroic after all he said derisively to the governor the imminence of death makes him amenable  ramiro scowled on him for answer then turning to medo you think you could bend her stubbornness quoth he  i might attempt it answered i  his eyes flashed with evil hope his lips parted in a smile he shot a glance at madonna who had withdrawn her hands from her face and was regarding me now with a strange expression of horror and incredulitymarvelling no doubt to find me such a craven as i must have seemed  ramiro looked at the diminishing sunlight on the floor  in some five minutes the sun will have completely set said he those five minutes you shall have to seek to enlist madonnas aid on your behalf if you succeedand she may tell you on what terms you are to have your lifeyou shall depart from cesena tonight a free man  he paused a moment and his eyes lighted by an odious smile rested once more on madonna paula then he bade all withdraw and went with them into an adjoining chamber fondly nurturing the hopes that were begotten of his belief that lazzaro biancomonte was a villain  when we were alone she and i i stood a moment where they had left me my hands pinioned behind me and the cord which the executioner had held trailing the ground like a lambent tail then i went slowly forward until i stood close before her her eyes were on my face still with that same look of unbelief  madonna mia said i do not for an instant think that it is my purpose to ask of you any sacrifice that might save my worthless life rather was my purpose in seeking these few moments with you to strengthen and encourage you by such news as it is mine to bring  she looked now as if she scarcely understood  if i will wed him tonight he has promised that you shall go free she said in a whisper he says that he can bring a priest from the neighbourhood at a moments notice  do not heed him i cried sternly  i do not heed him said she more composedly if he seeks to force me i shall find a way of setting myself free dear mother of heaven death were a sweet and restful thing after all that i have suffered in these days  then she fell suddenly to weeping  think me not an utter coward lazzaro willingly would i do this thing to save so noble a life as yours did i not think that you must hate me for it i was stout and firm in my refusal confident that you would have had me so was i not right my poor poor lazzaro  madonna you were right i answered firmly and calmly  and you are to die amor mio she murmured passionately you are to die when the promise of happiness seemed held out to us and yet were you to live at the price at which life is offered you would your life be endurable tell me the truth lazzaro swear it to me for if life is the dearer thing to you why then you shall have your life  need you ask me paola questioned i does not your heart tell you how much easier is death than would be such life as i must lead hereafter even if we could trust ramiro which we cannot be brave madonna and help me to be brave and to bear thyself with a becoming fortitude now listen to what i have to tell you ramiro del orca is a traitor who is plotting the death of his overlord proofs of it are by now in the hands of cesare borgia and in some seven or eight hours the duke himself should be here to put this monster to the question touching these matters i will say a word in his ear ere i depart that will fill his mind with a very wholesome fear and you will find that during the few hours left him he will have little leisure to think of you and afflict you with his odious wooing be strong then for a little while for cesare is coming to set you free  she looked at me now with eyes that were wide open suddenly  could we not gain time she cried and in her eagerness she rose and set her hands upon my shoulders could i not pretend to acquiesce to his wishes and so delay your end  i have thought of it i answered gloomily but the thought has brought me no hope ramiro is not to be trusted he might tell you that he sets me free but he dare not do so he fears that i may have knowledge of his dealings with vitelli and assuredly he would break faith with us again the coming of the duke might be delayed alas i ended in despair there is nothing to be done but to let things run their course  there was even more in my mind than i expressed my mistrust of ramiro went further than i had explained and concerning madonna more closely than it did me  nay lazzaro mine she still protested i will attempt it it is at least well worth the risk  you forget said i that even when cesare comes we cannot say how he will bear himself towards you you were to have been betrothed to his cousin ignacio it is a matter upon which he may insist  she looked at me for a moment with anguish in her eyes that turned my misery into torture  lazzaro she moaned was ever woman so beset i think that heaven must have laid some curse upon me  her face was close to mine i stooped forward and kissed her on her brow  may god have you in his keeping madonna mia i murmured the sun is gone  lazzaro it was the cry of a breaking heart her arms went round my neck and in a passion of grief her kisses burned on my lips  then the door of the anteroom openedand i thanked god for the mercy of that interruption i whispered a word to her and in obedience she sprang back and sank limp and broken on the chair once again  ramiro entered his men behind him his face alit with eagerness there and then i swamped his hopes  the sun is gone magnificent said i you had best get me hanged  his brow darkened for there was a note of mockery and triumph in my voice  you have fooled me animal he cried his jaw set and his eyes continued to regard me with an evil glow then he laughed terribly shrugged his shoulders and spoke again after all it shall avail you little he turned to the carnifex federigo do your work said he whereupon the fellow stepped behind me and the halberdiers ranged themselves one on either side of me again  a word ere i go messer del orca i demanded insolently  he looked at me sharply wondering maybe at the fresh tone i took  say it and begone he sullenly permitted me  i paused a moment to choose fitting words for that portentous deathsong of mine at length  you boasted to me a little while ago said i smiling grimly that the man did not live who had thrice fooled you that man does live for that man am i  bah he returned contemptuously thinking no doubt that i referred to my interview with madonna paola you may take what pride you will from such a thought you are upon the threshold of death  true but the thought is one that affords me more comfort and joy than pride as much comfort and joy as you shall take horror when i tell you in what manner i have fooled you i paused to heighten the sensation of my words  to such good purpose have i used my wits that ere another sun shall rise and set you will have followed me along the black road that i am now treadingthe road whose bourne is the gallows bethink you of the charred paper that last night you brushed from this table when you awoke to find a candle fallen on the treacherous letter vitellozzo vitelli sent you in the lining of a hat  his jaw fell his face flamed redder than ever for a second then it went grey as ashes  of what do you prate fool he questioned huskily seeking to bluster it before the startled glances of his officers  i speak said i of that charred paper it was i who laid the candle across it but it was a virgin sheet i burned vitellis letter i had first abstracted  you lie he almost screamed  to prove that i do not i will tell you what it contained it held proof that bribed by the tyrant of citta di castello you had undertaken to pose an arbalister to slay the duke on the occasion of his coming visit to cesena  he glared at me a moment in furious amazement then he turned to his officers  do not heed him he bade them the dog lies to sow doubts in your minds ere he goes out to hang it is a puerile revenge  i laughed with amused confidence there was one among them had heard lampugnanis words touching the messengers hatwords that had cost the fellow his life but my concern was little with the effect my words might produce upon his followers  by tomorrow you will know whether i have lied or not nay before then shall you know it for by midnight cesare borgia should be at cesena vitellozzo vitellis letter is in his hands by now  at that ramiro burst into a laugh so convinced was he of the impossibility of my having got the letter to the duke even if what i had said of its abstraction were true that he gathered assurance from what seemed to him so monstrous an exaggeration  by your own words are you confounded said he out of your own mouth have you proven your lies assuming that all you say were true how could you who since last night have been a prisoner have got a messenger to bear anything from you to cesare borgia  i looked at him with a contemptuous amusement that daunted him  where is mariani i asked quietly where is the father of the lad you so brutally and wantonly slew yesternight seek him throughout cesena and when you find him not perhaps you will realise that one who had seen his own son suffer such an outrageous and cruel death at your brigands hands would be a willing and ready instrument in an act that should avenge him  vergine santa what a consternation was his he must have missed mariani early in the day for he took no measure asked no questions that might confirm or refute the thing i announced his face grew livid and his knees loosened he sank on to a chair and mopped the cold sweat from his brow with his great brown hand no thought had he now for the eyes of his officers or their opinions fear icy and horrid such fear as in his time he had inspired in a thousand hearts was now possessed of his sweet indeed was the flavour of my vengeance  his officers instinctively drew away from him before the guilt so clearly written on his face and their eyes were full of doubt as to how they should proceed and of some fearfor it must have been passing through their minds that they stood themselves in danger of being involved with him in the dukes punishment of his disloyalty  this was more than had ever entered into my calculations or found room in my hopes by a brisk appeal to them it almost seemed that i might work my salvation in this eleventh hour  madonna watched the scene with eyes that suggested to me that the same hope had arisen in her own mind my halberdiers and the carnifex alone stood stolidly indifferent ramiro was to them the man that hired them with his intriguing they had no concern  for a moment or two there was a silence and ramiro sat staring before him his white face glistening with the sweat of fear a very coward at heart was this overbearing ogre of cesena who for years had been the terror and scourge of the countryside at last he mastered his emotion and sprang to his feet  you have had the laugh of me he snarled fury now ringing in his voice but ere you die you may regret it that you mocked me  he turned to the executioner  strip him he commanded fiercely he shall not hang as i intendedat least not before we have torn every bone of his body from its socket to the cord with him and he pointed to the torture at the end of the hall  the executioner made shift to obey him when suddenly madonna paola leapt to her feet her cheeks flushed and her eyes bright with a new excitement  is there none here he cried appealing to ramiros officers that will draw his sword in the service of his overlord the duca valentino there stands a traitor and there one who has proven his loyalty to cesare borgia the duke is likely to demand a heavy price for the life of that faithful one to whose warning he owes his escape of assassination will none of you side now with the right that anon you may stand well with cesare borgia when he comes or by idly allowing this traitor to have his way will you participate in the punishment that must be his  it was the very spur they needed and scarce was that final question of hers flung at those knaves when the answer came from one of them it was that same sturdy lupone  i for one am for the duke said he and his sword leapt from its scabbard i draw my iron for valentino let every loyal man do likewise and seize this traitor and with his sword he pointed at ramiro  in an instant three others bared their weapons and ranged themselves beside him the remaining twoof whom was lucagnolofolded their hands manifesting by that impassivity that they were minded to take neither one side nor the other  the carnifex paused in his labours of undressing me and the affair promised to grow interesting but ramiro did not stand his ground fury swelling his veins and crimsoning his huge face he sprang to the door and bellowed to his guards six men trooped in almost at once and reinforced by the halberdiers that had been guarding me they made short work of the resistance of those four officers in as little time as it takes me to record it they were disarmed and ranged against the wall behind those guards and others that had come to their supportto be dealt with by ramiro after he had dealt with me  his fear of cesares coming was put by for the moment in his fierce lust to be avenged upon me who had betrayed him and the officers who had turned against him madonna sank back once more in her despair the little spark that she had so bravely fanned to life had been quenched almost as soon as it had shown itself  now federigo said ramiro grimly i am waiting  the executioner resumed his work and in an instant i stood stripped of my brigandine as the fellow led me unresisting to the torturefor what resistance could have availed me nowi tried to pray for strength to endure what was to come i was done with life for some portion of an hour i must go through the cruellest of agonies and then when it pleased god in his mercy that i should swoon it would be to wake no more in this world for they would bear out my unconscious body and hang it by the neck from that black beam they called ramiro del orcas flagstaff  i cast a last glance at madonna she had fallen on her knees and with folded hands was praying intently none heeding her  federigo halted me beneath the pulleys and his horrid hands grew busy adjusting the ropes to my wrists  and then when the last ray of hope had faded but before the executioner had completed his hideous task a trumpetblast winding a challenge to the gates of the castle of cesena suddenly rang out upon the evening air and startled us all by its sudden and imperious note     chapter xxi ave caesar   for just an instant i allowed myself to be tortured by the hope that a miracle had happened and here was cesare borgia come a good eight hours before it was possible for mariani to have fetched him from faenza the same doubt may have crossed ramiros mind for he changed colour and sprang to the door to bawl an order forbidding his men to lower the bridge  but he was too late before he was answered by his followers we heard the creaking of the hinges and the rattle of the running chains ending in a thud that told us the drawbridge had dropped across the moat then came the loud continuous thunder of many hoofs upon its timbers paralysed by fear ramiro stood where he had halted turning his eyes wildly in this direction and in that but never moving one way or the other  it must be cesare i swore to myself who else could ride to cessna with such numbers but then if it was cesare it could not be that he had seen mariani for he could not have ridden from faenza madonna had risen too and with a white face and straining eyes she was looking towards the door  and then our doubts were at last ended there was a jangle of spurs and the fall of feet and through the open door stepped a straight martial figure in a doublet of deep crimson velvet trimmed with costly lynx furs and slashed with satin in the sleeves and shoulderpuffs jewels gleamed in the massive chain across his breast and at the marroquin girdle that carried his bronzehilted sword his hose was of red silk and his great black boots were armed with golden spurs but to crown all this very regal splendour was the beautiful pale cold face of cesare borgia from out of which two black eyes flashed and played like swordpoints on the company  behind him surged a press of mercenaries in steel their weapons naked in their hands so that no doubt was left of the character of this visit  collecting himself and bethinking him that after all he had best dissemble a good countenance ramiro advanced respectfully to meet his overlord but ere he had taken three steps the duke stayed him  stand where you are traitor was the imperious command ill trust you no nearer to my person and to emphasise his words he raised his gloved left hand which had been resting on his swordhilt and in which i now observed that he held a paper  whether ramiro recognised it or whether it was that the mere sight of a paper reminded him of the letter which on my testimony should be in cesares keeping or whether again the word traitor with which cesare branded him drove the iron deeper into his soul i cannot say but to this i can testify that he turned a livid green and stood there before his formidable master in an attitude so stricken as to have aroused pity for any man less a villain than was he  and now cesares eye travelling round alighted on madonna paola standing back in the shadows to which she had instinctively withdrawn at his coming at sight of her he recoiled a pace deeming no doubt that it was an apparition stood before him then he looked again and being a man whose mind was above puerile superstitions he assured himself that by what miracle the thing was wrought the figure before him was the living body of madonna paola sforza di santafior he swept the velvet cap with its jewelled plume from off his auburn locks and bowed low before her  in gods name madonna how are you come to life again and how do i find you here of all places  she made no ado about enlightening him  that villain said she and her finger pointed straight and firmly at ramiro put a sleepingpotion in my wine on the last night he dined with us at pesaro and when all thought me dead he came to the church of san domenico with his men to carry off my sleeping body he would have succeeded in his fell design but that lazzaro biancomonte there whom you have stayed him in the act of torturing to death was beforehand and saved me from his clutches for a time this morning at cattolica his searching sbirri discovered me and brought me hither where i have been for the past three hours and where but for your excellencys timely arrival i shudder to think of the indignities i might have suffered  i thank you madonna for this clear succinctness answered cesare coldly as was his habit they say he was a passionate man and such indeed i do believe him to have been but even in the hottest frenzy of rage outwardly he was ever the sameicily cold and tranquil and this no doubt was the thing that made him terrible  presently madonna he pursued i shall ask you to tell me how it chanced that having saved you messer biancomonte did not bear you to your brothers house but first i have business with my governor of cesenaa score which is rendered if possible heavier than it already stood by this thing that you have told me  my lord cried out ramiro finding his tongue at last madonna has misinformed you i know nothing of who administered the sleepingpotion certainly it was not i i heard a rumour that her body had been stolen and  silence cesare commanded sternly did i question you dog  his beautiful terrible eyes fastened upon ramiro in a glance that defied the man to answer him cowed like a hound at sight of the whip ramiro whimpered into silence  cesare waved his hand in his direction halfturning to the menatarms behind him  take and disarm him was his passionless command and while they were doing his bidding he turned to me and ordered the executioner beside me to unbind my hands and set me at liberty  i owe you a heavy debt messer biancomonte he said without any warmth even now that his voice was laden with a message of gratitude it shall be discharged it is thanks to your daring and resource that the seneschal mariani was able to bring me this letter this piece of culminating proof against ramiro del orca it is fortunate for you that mariani was not put to it to ride to faenza to find me or else i am afraid we had not reached cesena in time to save your life i met him some leagues this side of faenza as i was on my way to sinigaglia  he turned abruptly to ramiro  in this letter which vitelli wrote you said he it is suggested that there are others in the conspiracy tell me now who are those others see that you answer me with truth for i shall compel proofs from you of such accusations as you may make  ramiro looked at him with eyes rendered dull by agony he moistened his lips with his tongue and turning his head towards his men  wine he gasped from very force of habit a cup of wine  let it be supplied him said cesare coldly and we all stood waiting while a servant filled him a cup ramiro gulped the wine avidly never pausing until the goblet was empty  now said cesare who had been watching him will it please you to answer my question  my lord said ramiro revived and strengthened in spirit by the draught i must ask your excellency to be a little plainer with me to what conspiracy is it that you refer i know of none what is this letter which you say vitelli wrote me i take it you refer to the lord of citta di castello but i can recall no letters passing between us my acquaintance with him is of the slightest  cesare looked at him a second  approach he curtly bade him and ramiro came forward one of the borgia halberdiers on either side of him each holding him by an arm the duke thrust the letter under his eyes have you never seen that before  ramiro looked at it a moment and his attempt at dissembling bewilderment was a ludicrous thing to witness  never he said brazenly at last  cesare folded the letter and slipped it into the breast of his doublet from his girdle he took a second paper he turned from ramiro  don miguel he called  from behind his menatarms a tall man all dressed in black stood forward it was cesares spanish captain one whose name was as well known and as welldreaded in italy as cesares own the duke held out to him the paper that he had produced  you heard the question that i asked messer del orca he inquired  i heard illustrious answered miguel with a bow  see that you obtain me an answer to it as well as an account of the other matters that i have noted on this listconcerning the misappropriation of stores the retention of taxes illicitly levied and the wanton cruelty towards my good citizens of cesena put him to the question without delay and record me his replies the implements are yonder  and with the same calm indifference which characterised his every word and action cesare pointed to the torture and turned to madonna paola as though he gave the matter of ramiro del orca and his misdeeds not another thought  mercy my lord rang now the voice of ramiro laden with horrid fear i will speak  then do soto don miguel he will question you in my name again he turned to madonna madonna paola may i conduct you hence things may perhaps occur which it is not seemly your gentle eyes should witness messer biancomonte attend us  now in spite of all that ramiro had made me suffer i should have been loath to have remained and witnessed his examination that they would torture him was now inevitable his chance of answering freely was gone even if he returned meek replies to don miguels questions that gentleman would no doubt still submit him to the cord by way of assuring himself that such replies were true ones  gladly then did i turn to follow the duke and madonna paola into the adjoining chamber to which cesare led the way even as don miguels voice was raised to command his men to clear the hall to the end that he might conduct his examination in private  the three of us stood in the anteroom a servant had lighted the tapers and closed the doors and the duke turned to me  first messer biancomonte to discharge my debt you are if i am not misinformed the lord by right of birth of certain lands that bear your name which suffered sequestration during the reign of the late costanzo tyrant of pesaro whose son giovanni upheld that confiscation am i right  your excellency is very well informed the lord of pesaro did make me tardy restitutionso tardy indeed that the lands which he restored to me had already virtually passed from his possession  cesare smiled  in recompense for the service you have rendered me this day said he and my heart thrilled at the words and at the thought of the joy which i was about to bear to my old mother i reinvest you in your lands of biancomonte for so long as you are content to recognise in me your overlord and to be loyal true and faithful to my rule  i bowed murmuring something of the joy i felt and the devotion i should entertain  then that is done with you shall have the deed from my hand by morning and now madonna will you grant me some explanation of your conduct in leaving pesaro in this mans company instead of repairing to your brothers house when you awakened from the effects of the potion ramiro gave you or must i seek the explanation from messer biancomonte  her eyes fell before the scrutiny of his and when they were raised again it was to meet my glance and if cesare could not for himself read the message of those eyes why then his penetration was by no means what the world accounted it  my lord i cried let me explain i love madonna paola it was love of her that led me to the church and kept me there that night it was love of her and the overmastering passion of my grief at her so sudden death that led me in a madness to desire once more to look upon her face ere they delivered it to earths keeping thus was it that i came to discover that she lived thus was it that i anticipated ramiro del orca he came upon us almost before i had raised her from the coffin yet love lent me strength and craft to delude him we hid awhile in the sacristy and it was there after madonna had revived that the pentup passion of years burst the bond with which reason had bidden me restrain it  by the host cried cesare his brows drawn down in a frown you are a bold man to tell me this and you madonna he cried turning suddenly to her what have you to say  only my lord that i have suffered more i think in these past few days than has ever fallen to the lifetimes share of another woman i think my lord that i have suffered enough to have earned me a little peace and a little happiness for the remainder of my days all my life have men plagued me with marriages that were hateful to me and this has culminated in the brutal act of ramiro del orca do you not think that i have endured enough  he stared at her for a moment  then you love this fellow he gasped you madonna paola sforza di santafior one of the noblest ladies in all italy confess to love this lordling of a few barren acres  i loved him illustrious when he was less much less than that i loved him when he was little better than the fool of the court of pesaro and not even the shame of the motley that disgraced him could stay the impulse of my affections  he laughed curiously  by my faith said he i have gone through life complaining of the want of frankness in the men and women i have met but you two seem to deal in it liberally enough to satisfy the most ardent seeker after truth i would that pontius pilate could have known you then he grew sterner but what account of this evenings adventure am i to bear to my cousin ignacio  she hung her head in silence whilst my own spirit trembled then suddenly i spoke  my lord said i if you take her back to pesaro you may keep the deed of biancomonte for unless madonna paola goes thither with me your gift is a barren one your reward of no account or value to me  i would not have it so said he his head on one side and his fingers toying with his auburn beard you saved my life and you must be rewarded fittingly  then illustrious in payment for my preservation of your life do you render happy mine and we shall thus be quits  my lord cried paola putting forth her hands in supplication if you have ever loved befriend us now  a shadow darkened his face for an instant then it was gone and his expression was as inscrutable as ever yet he took her hands in his and looked down into her eyes  they say that i am hard bloodthirsty and unfeeling he said in tones that were almost of complaint but i am not proof against so much appeal ignacio must find him a bride in spain and if he is wise and would taste the sweets of life he will see to it that he finds him a willing one  as for you two cesare borgia shalt stand your friend he owes you no less i will be godfather to your nuptials thus shall the blame and consequences rest on me paola sforza di santafior is dead men think we will leave them thinking it filippo must know the truth but you can trust me to make your brother take a reasonable view of what has come to pass after all there may be a disparity in your ranks but it is purely adventitious for noble though you may be madonna paola you are wedding one who seems no less noble at heart whatever the parts he may have played in life he smiled inscrutably as he added i have in mind that you once sought service with me messer biancomonte and if a martial life allures you still ill make you lord of something better far than biancomonte  i thanked him and madonna joined me in that expression of gratitudean expression that fell very short of all that was in our hearts but touching that offer of his that i should follow his fortunes i begged him not to insist  the possession of biancomonte has from my cradle been the goal of all my hopes it is patrimony enough for me and there with madonna paola ill take a long farewell of ambition which is but the seed of discontent  why as you will he sighed and then before more could be said there came from the adjoining room a piercing scream  cesare raised his head and his lips parted in the faintest vestige of a smile  they are exacting the truth from the governor of cesena said he i think madonna that we had better move a little farther off ramiros voice makes indifferent music for a ladys ear  she was white as death at the horrid noise and all the things of which it may have reminded her and so we passed from the antechamber and sought the more distant places of the castle  here let me pause we were married on the morrow which was christmas eve and in the grey dawn of the christmas morning we set out for biancomonte with the escort which cesare borgia placed at our disposal  as we rode out from the citadel of cesena we saw the last of ramiro del orca beyond the gates in the centre of the public square a block stood planted in the snow on the side nearer the castle there was a dark mass over which a rich mantle had been thrown it was of purple colour and in the uncertain light it was not easy to tell where the cloak ended and the stain that embrued the snow began on the other side of the block a decapitated head stood mounted on an upright pike and the sightless eyes of ramiro del orca looked from his grinning face upon the town of cesena which he had so wantonly misruled  madonna shuddered and turned her head aside as we rode past that dread emblem of the borgia justice  to efface from her mind the memory of such a thing on such a day i talked to her as we cantered out into the country of the life to come of the mother that waited to welcome us and of the glad tidings with which we were to rejoice her on that christmas day  there is no moral to my story i may not end with one of those graceful admonitions beloved of messer boccacci to whom in my jesters days i owed so much not mine is it to say with him wherefore gentle ladiesor noble sirsbeware of this avoid that other thing  mine is a plain tale written in the belief that some account of those old happenings that befell me may offer you some measure of entertainment and written too in the support of certain truths which my contemporaries have been shamefully inclined and simoniacally induced to suppress many chroniclers set forth how the lord vitellozzo vitelli and his associates were barbarously strangled by cesares orders at sinigaglia and wilfullyfor i cannot believe that it results from ignoranceare they silent touching the reason leaving you to imagine that it was done in obedience to a ruthlessness of character beyond parallel so that you may come to consider cesare borgia as black as they were paid to paint him  to confute them do i set down these facts of which my knowledge cannot be called in question and also that you may know the true story of paola di santafiorand more particularly that part of it which lies beyond the death she did not die  the sun of that christmas day was setting as we drew near to biancomonte and the humble dwelling of my old mother we fell into talk of her once more suddenly paola turned in her saddle to confront me  tell me lord of biancomonte will she love me a little think you she asked to plague me  who would not love you lady of biancomonte counterquestioned i
