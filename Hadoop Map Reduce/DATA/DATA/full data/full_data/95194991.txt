95194991	the mistletoe bough   by anthony trollope     let the boys have it if they like it said mrs garrow pleading to her only daughter on behalf of her two sons  pray dont mamma said elizabeth garrow  it only means romping to me all that is detestable and i am sure it is not the sort of thing that miss holmes would like  we always had it at christmas when we were young  but mamma the world is so changed  the point in dispute was one very delicate in its nature hardly to be discussed in all its bearings even in fiction and the very mention of which between mother and daughter showed a great amount of close confidence between them  it was no less than this  should that branch of mistletoe which frank garrow had brought home with him out of the lowther woods be hung up on christmas eve in the diningroom at thwaite hall according to his wishes or should permission for such hanging be positively refused  it was clearly a thing not to be done after such a discussion and therefore the decision given by mrs garrow was against it  i am inclined to think that miss garrow was right in saying that the world is changed as touching mistletoe boughs  kissing i fear is less innocent now than it used to be when our grandmothers were alive and we have become more fastidious in our amusements nevertheless i think that she made herself fairly open to the raillery with which her brothers attacked her  honi soit qui mal y pense said frank who was eighteen  nobody will want to kiss you my lady fineairs said harry who was just a year younger  because you choose to be a puritan there are to be no more cakes and ale in the house said frank  still waters run deep we all know that said harry  the boys had not been present when the matter was decided between mrs garrow and her daughter nor had the mother been present when these little amenities had passed between the brothers and sister  only that mamma has said it and i wouldnt seem to go against her said frank id ask my father  he wouldnt give way to such nonsense i know  elizabeth turned away without answering and left the room  her eyes were full of tears but she would not let them see that they had vexed her  they were only two days home from school and for the last week before their coming all her thoughts had been to prepare for their christmas pleasures  she had arranged their rooms making everything warm and pretty  out of her own pocket she had bought a shotbelt for one and skates for the other  she had told the old groom that her pony was to belong exclusively to master harry for the holidays and now harry told her that still waters ran deep  she had been driven to the use of all her eloquence in inducing her father to purchase that gun for frank and now frank called her a puritan  and why  she did not choose that a mistletoe bough should be hung in her fathers hall when godfrey holmes was coming to visit him  she could not explain this to frank but frank might have had the wit to understand it  but frank was thinking only of patty coverdale a blueeyed little romp of sixteen who with her sister kate was coming from penrith to spend the christmas at thwaite hall  elizabeth left the room with her slow graceful step hiding her tearshiding all emotion as latterly she had taught herself that it was feminine to do  there goes my lady fineairs said harry sending his shrill voice after her  thwaite hall was not a place of much pretension  it was a moderate sized house surrounded by pretty gardens and shrubberies close down upon the river eamont on the westmoreland side of the river looking over to a lovely wooded bank in cumberland  all the world knows that the eamont runs out of ulleswater dividing the two counties passing under penrith bridge and by the old ruins of brougham castle below which it joins the eden  thwaite hall nestled down close upon the clear rocky stream about half way between ulleswater and penrith and had been built just at a bend of the river  the windows of the diningparlour and of the drawing room stood at right angles to each other and yet each commanded a reach of the stream  immediately from a side of the house steps were cut down through the red rock to the waters edge and here a small boat was always moored to a chain  the chain was stretched across the river fixed to the staples driven into the rock on either side and the boat was pulled backwards and forwards over the stream without aid from oars or paddles  from the opposite side a path led through the woods and across the fields to penrith and this was the route commonly used between thwaite hall and the town  major garrow was a retired officer of engineers who had seen service in all parts of the world and who was now spending the evening of his days on a small property which had come to him from his father  he held in his own hands about twenty acres of land and he was the owner of one small farm close by which was let to a tenant  that together with his halfpay and the interest of his wifes thousand pounds sufficed to educate his children and keep the wolf at a comfortable distance from his door  he himself was a spare thin man with quiet lazy literary habits  he had done the work of life but had so done it as to permit of his enjoying that which was left to him  his sole remaining care was the establishment of his children and as far as he could see he had no ground for anticipating disappointment  they were clever good looking welldisposed young people and upon the whole it may be said that the sun shone brightly on thwaite hall  of mrs garrow it may suffice to say that she always deserved such sunshine  for years past it had been the practice of the family to have some sort of gathering at thwaite hall during christmas  godfrey holmes had been left under the guardianship of major garrow and as he had always spent his christmas holidays with his guardian this perhaps had given rise to the practice  then the coverdales were cousins of the garrows and they had usually been there as children at the christmas last past the custom had been broken for young holmes had been abroad  previous to that they had all been children excepting him  but now that they were to meet again they were no longer children  elizabeth at any rate was not so for she had already counted nineteen winters  and isabella holmes was coming  now isabella was two years older than elizabeth and had been educated in brussels moreover she was comparatively a stranger at thwaite hall never having been at those early christmas meetings  and now i must take permission to begin my story by telling a ladys secret  elizabeth garrow had already been in love with godfrey holmes or perhaps it might be more becoming to say that godfrey holmes had already been in love with her  they had already been engaged and alas they had already agreed that that engagement should be broken off  young holmes was now twentyseven years of age and was employed in a bank at liverpool not as a clerk but as assistantmanager with a large salary  he was a man well to do in the world who had money also of his own and who might well afford to marry  some two years since on the eve of leaving thwaite hall he had with low doubting whisper told elizabeth that he loved her and she had flown trembling to her mother  godfrey my boy the father said to him as he parted with him the next morning bessy is only a child and too young to think of this yet  at the next christmas godfrey was in italy and the thing was gone byso at least the father and mother said to each other  but the young people had met in the summer and one joyful letter had come from the girl home to her mother  i have accepted him  dearest dearest mamma i do love him  but dont tell papa yet for i have not quite accepted him  i think i am sure but i am not quite sure  i am not quite sure about him  and then two days after that there had come a letter that was not at all joyful  dearest mammait is not to be  it is not written in the book  we have both agreed that it will not do  i am so glad that you have not told dear papa for i could never make him understand  you will understand for i shall tell you everything down to his very words  but we have agreed that there shall be no quarrel  it shall be exactly as it was and he will come at christmas all the same  it would never do that he and papa should be separated nor could we now put off isabella  it is better so in every way for there is and need be no quarrel  we still like each other  i am sure i like him but i know that i should not make him happy as his wife  he says it is my fault  i at any rate have never told him that i thought it his  from all which it will be seen that the confidence between the mother and daughter was very close  elizabeth garrow was a very good girl but it might almost be a question whether she was not too good  she had learned or thought that she had learned that most girls are vapid silly and uselessgiven chiefly to pleasureseeking and a hankering after lovers and she had resolved that she would not be such a one  industry selfdenial and a religious purpose in life were the tasks which she set herself and she went about the performance of them with much courage  but such tasks though they are excellently well adapted to fit a young lady for the work of living may also be carried too far and thus have the effect of unfitting her for that work  when elizabeth garrow made up her mind that the finding of a husband was not the only purpose of life she did very well  it is very well that a young lady should feel herself capable of going through the world happily without one  but in teaching herself this she also taught herself to think that there was a certain merit in refusing herself the natural delight of a lover even though the possession of the lover were compatible with all her duties to herself her father and mother and the world at large  it was not that she had determined to have no lover  she made no such resolve and when the proper lover came he was admitted to her heart  but she declared to herself unconsciously that she must put a guard upon herself lest she should be betrayed into weakness by her own happiness  she had resolved that in loving her lord she would not worship him and that in giving her heart she would only so give it as it should be given to a human creature like herself  she had acted on these high resolves and hence it had come to passnot unnaturallythat mr godfrey holmes had told her that it was her fault  she was a pretty fair girl with soft darkbrown hair and soft long dark eyelashes  her grey eyes though quiet in their tone were tender and lustrous  her face was oval and the lines of her cheek and chin perfect in their symmetry  she was generally quiet in her demeanour but when moved she could rouse herself to great energy and speak with feeling and almost with fire  her fault was a reverence for martyrdom in general and a feeling of which she was unconscious that it became a young woman to be unhappy in secretthat it became a young woman i might rather say to have a source of unhappiness hidden from the world in general and endured without any detriment to her outward cheerfulness  we know the story of the spartan boy who held the fox under his tunic  the fox was biting into himinto the very entrails but the young hero spake never a word  now bessy garrow was inclined to think that it was a good thing to have a fox always biting so that the torment caused no ruffling to her outward smiles  now at this moment the fox within her bosom was biting her sore enough but she bore it without flinching  if you would rather that he should not come i will have it arranged her mother had said to her  not for worlds she had answered  i should never think well of myself again  her mother had changed her own mind more than once as to the conduct in this matter which might be best for her to follow thinking solely of her daughters welfare  if he comes they will be reconciled and she will be happy had been her first idea  but then there was a stern fixedness of purpose in bessys words when she spoke of mr holmes which had expelled this hope and mrs garrow had for a while thought it better that the young man should not come  but bessy would not permit this  it would vex her father put out of course the arrangements of other people and display weakness on her own part  he should come and she would endure without flinching while the fox gnawed at her  that battle of the mistletoe had been fought on the morning before christmasday and the holmeses came on christmaseve  isabella was comparatively a stranger and therefore received at first the greater share of attention  she and elizabeth had once seen each other and for the last year or two had corresponded but personally they had never been intimate  unfortunately for the latter that story of godfreys offer and acceptance had been communicated to isabella as had of course the immediately subsequent story of their separation  but now it would be almost impossible to avoid the subject in conversation  dearest isabella let it be as though it had never been she had said in one of her letters  but sometimes it is very difficult to let things be as though they had never been  the first evening passed over very well  the two coverdale girls were there and there had been much talking and merry laughter rather juvenile in its nature but on the whole none the worse for that  isabella holmes was a fine tall handsome girl good humoured and well disposed to be pleased rather frenchified in her manners and quite able to take care of herself  but she was not above round games and did not turn up her nose at the boys godfrey behaved himself excellently talking much to the major but by no means avoiding miss garrow  mrs garrow though she had known him since he was a boy had taken an aversion to him since he had quarrelled with her daughter but there was no room on this first night for showing such aversion and everything went off well  godfrey is very much improved the major said to his wife that night  do you think so  indeed i do  he has filled out and become a fine man  in personal appearance you mean  yes he is welllooking enough  and in his manner too  he is doing uncommonly well in liverpool i can tell you and if he should think of bessy  there is nothing of that sort said mrs garrow  he did speak to me you knowtwo years ago  bessy was too young then and so indeed was he  but if she likes him  i dont think she does  then theres an end of it  and so they went to bed  frank said the sister to her elder brother knocking at his door when they had all gone up stairs may i come inif you are not in bed  in bed said he looking up with some little pride from his greek book ive one hundred and fifty lines to do before i can get to bed  itll be two i suppose  ive got to mug uncommon hard these holidays  i have only one more half you know and then  dont overdo it frank  no i wont overdo it  i mean to take one day a week and work eight hours a day on the other five  that will be forty hours a week and will give me just two hundred hours for the holidays  i have got it all down here on a table  that will be a hundred and five for greek play forty for algebra and so he explained to her the exact destiny of all his long hours of proposed labour  he had as yet been home a day and a half and had succeeded in drawing out with red lines and blue figures the table which he showed her  if i can do that it will be pretty well wont it  but frank you have come home for your holidaysto enjoy yourself  but a fellow must work nowadays  dont overdo it dear thats all  but frank i could not rest if i went to bed without speaking to you  you made me unhappy today  did i bessy  you called me a puritan and then you quoted that illnatured french proverb at me  do you really believe your sister thinks evil frank and as she spoke she put her arm caressingly round his neck  of course i dont  then why say so  harry is so much younger and so thoughtless that i can bear what he says without so much suffering  but if you and i are not friends i shall be very wretched  if you knew how i have looked forward to your coming home  i did not mean to vex you and i wont say such things again  thats my own frank  what i said to mamma i said because i thought it right but you must not say that i am a puritan  i would do anything in my power to make your holidays bright and pleasant i know that boys require so much more to amuse them than girls do good night dearest pray dont overdo yourself with work and do take care of your eyes  so saying she kissed him and went her way  in twenty minutes after that he had gone to sleep over his book and when he woke up to find the candle guttering down he resolved that he would not begin his measured hours till christmasday was fairly over  the morning of christmasday passed very quietly  they all went to church and then sat round the fire chatting until the four oclock dinner was ready  the coverdale girls thought it was rather more dull than former thwaite hall festivities and frank was seen to yawn  but then everybody knows that the real fun of christmas never begins till the day itself be passed  the beef and pudding are ponderous and unless there be absolute children in the party there is a difficulty in grafting any special afternoon amusements on the sunday pursuits of the morning  in the evening they were to have a dance that had been distinctly promised to patty coverdale but the dance would not commence till eight  the beef and pudding were ponderous but with due efforts they were overcome and disappeared the glass of port was sipped the almonds and raisins were nibbled and then the ladies left the room  ten minutes after that elizabeth found herself seated with isabella holmes over the fire in her fathers little bookroom  it was not by her that this meeting was arranged for she dreaded such a constrained confidence but of course it could not be avoided and perhaps it might be as well now as hereafter  bessy said the elder girl i am dying to be alone with you for a moment  well you shall not die that is if being alone with me will save you  i have so much to say to you  and if you have any true friendship in you you also will have so much to say to me  miss garrow perhaps had no true friendship in her at that moment for she would gladly have avoided saying anything had that been possible  but in order to prove that she was not deficient in friendship she gave her friend her hand  and now tell me everything about godfrey said isabella  dear bella i have nothing to tellliterally nothing  that is nonsense  stop a moment dear and understand that i do not mean to offend you  it cannot be that you have nothing to tell if you choose to tell it  you are not the girl to have accepted godfrey without loving him nor is he the man to have asked you without loving you  when you write me word that you have changed your mind as you might about a dress of course i know you have not told me all  now i insist upon knowing itthat is if we are to be friends  i would not speak a word to godfrey till i had seen you in order that i might hear your story first  indeed bella there is no story to tell  then i must ask him  if you wish to play the part of a true friend to me you will let the matter pass by and say nothing  you must understand that circumstanced as we are your brothers visit herewhat i mean is that it is very difficult for me to act and speak exactly as i should do and a few unfortunate words spoken may make my position unendurable  will you answer me one question  i cannot tell  i think i will  do you love him  for a moment or two bessy remained silent striving to arrange her words so that they should contain no falsehood and yet betray no truth  ah i see you do continued miss holmes  but of course you do  why else did you accept him  i fancied that i did as young ladies do sometimes fancy  and will you say that you do not now  again bessy was silent and then her friend rose from her seat  i see it all she said what a pity it was that you both had not some friend like me by you at the time  but perhaps it may not be too late  i need not repeat at length all the protestations which upon this were poured forth with hot energy by poor bessy  she endeavoured to explain how great had been the difficulty of her position  this christmas visit had been arranged before that unhappy affair at liverpool had occurred  isabellas visit had been partly one of business it being necessary that certain money affairs should be arranged between her her brother and the major  i determined said bessy not to let my feelings stand in the way and hoped that things might settle down to their former friendly footing  i already fear that i have been wrong but it will be ungenerous in you to punish me  then she went on to say that if anybody attempted to interfere with her she should at once go away to her mothers sister who lived at hexham in northumberland  then came the dance and the hearts of kate and patty coverdale were at last happy  but here again poor bessy was made to understand how terribly difficult was this experiment of entertaining on a footing of friendship a lover with whom she had quarrelled only a month or two before  that she must as a necessity become the partner of godfrey holmes she had already calculated and so much she was prepared to endure  her brothers would of course dance with the coverdale girls and her father would of course stand up with isabella  there was no other possible arrangement at any rate as a beginning  she had schooled herself too as to the way in which she would speak to him on the occasion and how she would remain mistress of herself and of her thoughts  but when the time came the difficulty was almost too much for her  you do not care much for dancing if i remember said he  oh yes i do  not as patty coverdale does  its a passion with her  but then i am older than patty coverdale  after that he was silent for a minute or two  it seems so odd to me to be here again he said  it was oddshe felt that it was odd  but he ought not to have said so  two years make a great difference  the boys have grown so much  yes and there are other things said he  bella was never here before at least not with you  no  but i did not exactly mean that  all that would not make the place so strange  but your mother seems altered to me  she used to be almost like my own mother  i suppose she finds that you are a more formidable person as you grow older  it was all very well scolding you when you were a clerk in the bank but it does not do to scold the manager  these are the penalties men pay for becoming great  it is not my greatness that stands in my way but  then im sure i cannot say what it is  but patty will scold you if you do not mind the figure though you were the whole board of directors packed into one  she wont respect you if you neglect your present work  when bessy went to bed that night she began to feel that she had attempted too much  mamma she said could i not make some excuse and go away to aunt mary  what now  yes mamma now tomorrow  i need not say that it will make me very unhappy to be away at such a time but i begin to think that it will be better  what will papa say  you must tell him all  and aunt mary must be told also  you would not like that  has he said anything  no nothingvery little that is  but bella has spoken to me oh mamma i think we have been very wrong in this  that is i have been wrong  i feel as though i should disgrace myself and turn the whole party here into a misfortune  it would be dreadful that telling of the story to her father and to her aunt and such a necessity must if possible be avoided should such a necessity actually come the former task would no doubt be done by her mother but that would not lighten the load materially  after a fortnight she would again meet her father and would be forced to discuss it  i will remain if it be possible she said but mamma if i wish to go you will not stop me  her mother promised that she would not stop her but strongly advised her to stand her ground  on the following morning when she came down stairs before breakfast she found frank standing in the hall with his gun of which he was trying the lock  it is not loaded is it frank said she  oh dear no no one thinks of loading nowadays till he has got out of the house  directly after breakfast i am going across with godfrey to the back of greystock to see after some moorfowl  he asked me to go and i couldnt well refuse  of course not  why should you  it will be deuced hard work to make up the time  i was to have been up at four this morning but that alarum went off and never woke me  however i shall be able to do something tonight  dont make a slavery of your holidays frank  whats the good of having a new gun if youre not to use it  its not the new gun  im not such a child as that comes to  but you see godfrey is here and one ought to be civil to him  ill tell you what i want you girls to do bessy  you must come and meet us on our way home  come over in the boat and along the path to the patterdale road  well be there under the hill about five  and if you are not we are to wait in the snow  dont make difficulties bessy  i tell you we will be there  we are to go in the cart and so shall have plenty of time  and how do you know the other girls will go  why to tell you the truth patty coverdale has promised  as for miss holmes if she wont why you must leave her at home with mamma  but kate and patty cant come without you  your discretion has found that out has it  they say so  but you will come wont you bessy  as for waiting its all nonsense  of course you can walk on  but well be at the stile by five  ive got my watch you know  and then bessy promised him  what would she not have done for him that was in her power to do  go  of course ill go said miss holmes  im up to anything id have gone with them this morning and have taken a gun if theyd asked me  but bythebye id better not  why not said patty who was hardly yet without fear lest something should mar the expedition  what will three gentlemen do with four ladies  oh i forgot said patty innocently  im sure i dont care said kate you may have harry if you like  thank you for nothing said miss holmes  i want one for myself its all very well for you to make the offer but what should i do if harry wouldnt have me  there are two sides you know to every bargain  im sure he isnt anything to me said kate  why hes not quite seventeen years old yet  poor boy  what a shame to dispose of him so soon  well let him off for a year or two wont we miss coverdale  but as there seems by acknowledgment to be one beau with unappropriated services  im sure i have appropriated nobody said patty and didnt intend  godfrey then is the only knight whose services are claimed said miss holmes looking at bessy  bessy made no immediate answer with either her eyes or tongue but when the coverdales were gone she took her new friend to task  how can you fill those young girls heads with such nonsense  nature has done that my dear  but nature should be trained should it not  you will make them think that those foolish boys are in love with them  the foolish boys as you call them will look after that themselves  it seems to me that the foolish boys know what they are about better than some of their elders  and then after a moments pause she added as for my brother i have no patience with him  pray do not discuss your brother said bessy  and bella unless you wish to drive me away pray do not speak of him and me together as you did just now  are you so bad as thatthat the slightest commonplace joke upsets you  would not his services be due to you as a matter of course if you are so sore about it you will betray your own secret  i have no secretnone at least from you or from mamma and indeed none from him  we were both very foolish thinking that we knew each other and our own hearts when we knew neither  i hate to hear people talk of knowing their hearts  my idea is that if you like a young man and he asks you to marry him you ought to have him  that is if there is enough to live on  i dont know what more is wanted  but girls are getting to talk and think as though they were to send their hearts through some fiery furnace of trial before they may give them up to a husbands keeping  i am not at all sure that the french fashion is not the best and that these things shouldnt be managed by the fathers and mothers or perhaps by the family lawyers  girls who are so intent upon knowing their own hearts generally end by knowing nobodys heart but their own and then they die old maids  better that than give themselves to the keeping of those they dont know and cannot esteem  thats a matter of taste  i mean to take the first that comes so long as he looks like a gentleman and has not less than eight hundred a year  now godfrey does look like a gentleman and has double that  if i had such a chance i shouldnt think twice about it  but i have no such chance  thats the way the wind blows is it  no no  oh bella pray pray leave me alone  pray do not interfere  there is no wind blowing in any way  all that i want is your silence and your sympathy  very well  i will be silent and sympathetic as the grave  only dont imagine that i am cold as the grave also  i dont exactly appreciate your ideas but if i can do no good i will at any rate endeavour to do no harm  after lunch at about three they started on their walk and managed to ferry themselves over the river  oh do let me bessy said kate coverdale  i understand all about it  look here miss holmes  you pull the chain through your hands  and inevitably tear your gloves to pieces said miss holmes  kate certainly had done so and did not seem to be particularly well pleased with the accident  theres a nasty nail in the chain she said  i wonder those stupid boys did not tell us  of course they reached the trystingplace much too soon and were very tired of walking up and down to keep their feet warm before the sportsmen came up  but this was their own fault seeing that they had reached the stile half an hour before the time fixed  i never will go anywhere to meet gentlemen again said miss holmes  it is most preposterous that ladies should be left in the snow for an hour  well young men what sport have you had  i shot the big black cock said harry  did you indeed said kate coverdale  and here are the feathers out of his tail for you  he dropped them in the water and i had to go in after them up to my middle  but i told you that i would so i was determined to get them  oh you silly silly boy said kate  but ill keep them for ever  i will indeed  this was said a little apart for harry had managed to draw the young lady aside before he presented the feathers  frank had also his trophies for patty and the tale to tell of his own prowess  in that he was a year older than his brother he was by a years growth less ready to tender his present to his lady love openly in the presence of them all  but he found his opportunity and then he and patty went on a little in advance kate also was deep in her consolations to harry for his ducking and therefore the four disposed of themselves in the manner previously suggested by miss holmes  miss holmes therefore and her brother and bessy garrow were left together in the path and discussed the performances of the day in a manner that elicited no very ecstatic interest  so they walked for a mile and by degrees the conversation between them dwindled down almost to nothing  there is nothing i dislike so much as coming out with people younger than myself said miss holmes  one always feels so old and dull  listen to those children there they make me feel as though i were an old maiden aunt brought out with them to do propriety  patty wont at all approve if she hears you call her a child  nor shall i approve if she treats me like an old woman and then she stepped on and joined the children  i wouldnt spoil even their sport if i could help it she said to herself  but with them i shall only be a temporary nuisance if i remain behind i shall become a permanent evil  and thus bessy and her old lover were left by themselves  i hope you will get on well with bella said godfrey when they had remained silent for a minute or two  oh yes  she is so goodnatured and lightspirited that everybody must like her  she has been used to so much amusement and active life that i know she must find it very dull here  she is never dull anywhereeven at liverpool which for a young lady i sometimes think the dullest place on earth  i know it is for a man  a man who has work to do can never be dull can he  indeed he can as dull as death  i am so often enough  i have never been very bright there bessy since you left us  there was nothing in his calling her bessy for it had become a habit with him since they were children and they had formerly agreed that everything between them should be as it had been before that foolish whisper of love had been spoken and received  indeed provision had been made by them specially on this point so that there need be no awkwardness in this mode of addressing each other such provision had seemed to be very prudent but it hardly had the desired effect on the present occasion  i hardly know what you mean by brightness she said after a pause  perhaps it is not intended that peoples lives should be what you call bright  life ought to be as bright as we can make it  it all depends on the meaning of the word  i suppose we are not very bright here at thwaite hall but yet we think ourselves very happy  i am sure you are said godfrey  i very often think of you here  we always think of places where we have been when we were young said bessy and then again they walked on for some way in silence and bessy began to increase her pace with the view of catching the children  the present walk to her was anything but bright and she bethought herself with dismay that there were still two miles before she reached the ferry  bessy godfrey said at last  and then he stopped as though he were doubtful how to proceed  she however did not say a word but walked on quickly as though her only hope was in catching the party before her  but they also were walking quickly for bella was determined that she would not be caught  bessy i must speak to you once of what passed between us at liverpool  must you said she  unless you positively forbid it  stop godfrey she said  and they did stop in the path for now she no longer thought of putting an end to her embarrassment by overtaking her companions  if any such words are necessary for your comfort it would hardly become me to forbid them  were i to speak so harshly you would accuse me afterwards in your own heart it must be for you to judge whether it is well to reopen a wound that is nearly healed  but with me it is not nearly healed  the wound is open always  there are some hurts she said which do not admit of an absolute and perfect cure unless after long years  as she said so she could not but think how much better was his chance of such perfect cure than her own  with herso she said to herselfsuch curing was all but impossible whereas with him it was as impossible that the injury should last  bessy he said and he again stopped her on the narrow path standing immediately before her on the way you remember all the circumstances that made us part  yes i think i remember them  and you still think that we were right to part  she paused for a moment before she answered him but it was only for a moment and then she spoke quite firmly  yes godfrey i do i have thought about it much since then  i have thought i fear to no good purpose about aught else  but i have never thought that we had been unwise in that  and yet i think you loved me  i am bound to confess i did so as otherwise i must confess myself a liar  i told you at the time that i loved you and i told you so truly  but it is better ten times better that those who love should part even though they still should love than that two should be joined together who are incapable of making each other happy  remember what you told me  i do remember  you found yourself unhappy in your engagement and you said it was my fault  bessy there is my hand  if you have ceased to love me there is an end of it  but if you love me still let all that be forgotten  forgotten godfrey  how can it be forgotten  you were unhappy and it was my fault  my fault as it would be if i tried to solace a sick child with arithmetic or feed a dog with grass  i had no right to love you knowing you as i did and knowing also that my ways would not be your ways  my punishment i understand and it is not more than i can bear but i had hoped that your punishment would have been soon over  you are too proud bessy  that is very likely  frank says that i am a puritan and pride was the worst of their sins  too proud and unbending  in marriage should not the man and woman adapt themselves to each other  when they are married yes  and every girl who thinks of marrying should know that in very much she must adapt herself to her husband but i do not think that a woman should be the ivy to take the direction of every branch of the tree to which she clings  if she does so what can be her own character  but we must go on or we shall be too late  and you will give me no other answer  none other godfrey  have you not just now at this very moment told me that i was too proud  can it be possible that you should wish to tie yourself for life to female pride  and if you tell me that now at such a moment as this what would you tell me in the close intimacy of married life when the trifles of every day would have worn away the courtesies of guest and lover  there was a sharpness of rebuke in this which godfrey holmes could not at the moment overcome  nevertheless he knew the girl and understood the workings of her heart and mind  now in her present state she could be unbending proud and almost rough  in that she had much to lose in declining the renewed offer which he made her she would as it were continually prompt herself to be harsh and inflexible  had he been poor had she not loved him had not all good things seemed to have attended the promise of such a marriage she would have been less suspicious of herself in receiving the offer and more gracious in replying to it  had he lost all his money before he came back to her she would have taken him at once or had he been deprived of an eye or become crippled in his legs she would have done so  but circumstanced as he was she had no motive to tenderness  there was an organic defect in her character which no doubt was plainly marked by its own bump in her cranium the bump of philomartyrdom it might properly be called  she had shipwrecked her own happiness in rejecting godfrey holmes but it seemed to her to be the proper thing that a wellbehaved young lady should shipwreck her own happiness  for the last month or two she had been tossed about by the waters and was nearly drowned  now there was beautiful land again close to her and a strong pleasant hand stretched out to save her  but though she had suffered terribly among the waves she still thought it wrong to be saved it would be so pleasant to take that hand so sweet so joyous that it surely must be wrong  that was her doctrine and godfrey holmes though he hardly analysed the matter partly understood that it was so  and yet if once she were landed on that green island she would be so happy  she spoke with scorn of a woman clinging to a tree like ivy and yet were she once married no woman would cling to her husband with sweeter feminine tenacity than bessy garrow  he spoke no further word to her as he walked home but in handing her down to the ferryboat he pressed her hand  for a second it seemed as though she had returned this pressure  if so the action was involuntary and her hand instantly resumed its stiffness to his touch  it was late that night when major garrow went to his bedroom but his wife was still up waiting for him  well said she what has he said to you  he has been with you above an hour  such stories are not very quickly told and in this case it was necessary to understand him very accurately  at length i think i do understand him  it is not necessary to repeat at length all that was said on that night between major and mrs garrow as to the offer which had now for a third time been made to their daughter  on that evening after the ladies had gone and when the two boys had taken themselves off godfrey holmes told his tale to his host and had honestly explained to him what he believed to be the state of his daughters feelings  now you know all said he  i do believe that she loves me and if she does perhaps she may still listen to you  major garrow did not feel sure that he knew it all  but when he had fully discussed the matter that night with his wife then he thought that perhaps he had arrived at that knowledge  on the following morning bessy learned from the maid at an early hour that godfrey holmes had left thwaite hall and gone back to liverpool  to the girl she said nothing on the subject but she felt obliged to say a word or two to bella  it is his coming that i regret she saidthat he should have had the trouble and annoyance for nothing  i acknowledge that it was my fault and i am very sorry  it cannot be helped said miss holmes somewhat gravely  as to his misfortunes i presume that his journeys between here and liverpool are not the worst of them  after breakfast on that day bessy was summoned into her fathers bookroom and found him there and her mother also  bessy said he sit down my dear  you know why godfrey has left us this morning  bessy walked round the room so that in sitting she might be close to her mother and take her mothers hand in her own  i suppose i do papa she said  he was with me late last night bessy and when he told me what had passed between you i agreed with him that he had better go  it was better that he should go papa  but he has left a message for you  a message papa  yes bessy  and your mother agrees with me that it had better be given to you  it is thisthat if you will send him word to come again he will be here by twelfthnight  he came before on my invitation but if he returns it must be on yours  oh papa i cannot  i do not say that you can but think of it calmly before you altogether refuse  you shall give me your answer on new years morning  mamma knows that it would be impossible said bessy  not impossible dearest  in such a matter you should do what you believe to be right said her father  if i were to ask him here again it would be telling him that i would  exactly bessy  it would be telling him that you would be his wife  he would understand it so and so would your mother and i it must be so understood altogether  but papa when we were at liverpool  i have told him everything dearest said mrs garrow  i think i understand the whole said the major and in such a matter as this i will not give you counsel on either side  but you must remember that in making up your mind you must think of him as well as of yourself  if you do not love himif you feel that as his wife you should not love him there is not another word to be said  i need not explain to my daughter that under such circumstances she would be wrong to encourage the visits of a suitor  but your mother says you do love him  i will not ask you  but if you doif you have so told him and allowed him to build up an idea of his lifehappiness on such telling you will i think sin greatly against him by allowing a false feminine pride to mar his happiness  when once a girl has confessed to a man that she loves him the confession and the love together put upon her the burden of a duty towards him which she cannot with impunity throw aside  then he kissed her and bidding her give him a reply on the morning of the new year left her with her mother  she had four days for consideration and they went past her by no means easily  could she have been alone with her mother the struggle would not have been so painful but there was the necessity that she should talk to isabella holmes and the necessity also that she should not neglect the coverdales  nothing could have been kinder than bella  she did not speak on the subject till the morning of the last day and then only in a very few words bessy she said as you are great be merciful  but i am not great and it would not be mercy  as to that said bella he has surely a right to his own opinion  on that evening she was sitting alone in her room when her mother came to her and her eyes were red with weeping  pen and paper were before her as though she were resolved to write but hitherto no word had been written  well bessy said her mother sitting down close beside her is the deed done  what deed mamma  who says that i am to do it  the deed is not the writing but the resolution to write  five words will be sufficientif only those five words may be written  it is for ones whole life mamma  for his life as well as my own  true bessythat is quite true  but equally true whether you bid him come or allow him to remain away  that task of making up ones mind for life must at last be done in some special moment of that life  mamma mamma tell me what i should do  but this mrs garrow would not do  i will write the words for you if you like she said but it is you who must resolve that they shall be written  i cannot bid my darling go away and leave me for another homei can only say that in my heart i do believe that home would be a happy one  it was morning before the note was written but when the morning came bessy had written it and brought it to her mother  you must take it to papa she said  then she went and hid herself from all eyes till the noon had passed  dear godfrey the letter ran papa says that you will return on wednesday if i write to ask you  do come back to usif you wish it  yours always bessy  it is as good as though she had filled the sheet said the major but in sending it to godfrey holmes he did not omit a few accompanying remarks of his own  an answer came from godfrey by return of post and on the afternoon of the sixth of january frank garrow drove over to the station at penrith to meet him  on their way back to thwaite hall there grew up a very close confidence between the two future brothersinlaw and frank explained with great perspicuity a little plan which he had arranged himself  as soon as it is dark so that she wont see it harry will hang it up in the diningroom he said and mind you go in there before you go anywhere else  i am very glad you have come back godfrey said the major meeting him in the hall  god bless you dear godfrey said mrs garrow you will find bessy in the diningroom she whispered but in so whispering she was quite unconscious of the mistletoe bough  and so also was bessy nor do i think that she was much more conscious when that introduction was over  godfrey had made all manner of promises to frank but when the moment arrived he had found the moment too important for any special reference to the little bough above his head  not so however patty coverdale its a shame said she bursting out of the room and if id known what you had done nothing on earth should have induced me to go in  i wont enter the room till i know that you have taken it out  nevertheless her sister kate was bold enough to solve the mystery before the evening was over
