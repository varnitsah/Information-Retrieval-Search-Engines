56985393	an humble proposal   to the   people of england   for the increase of their   trade   and encouragement of their   manufactures   whether   the present uncertainty of affairs   issues in   peace or war     by the author of the complete tradesman     london    printed for charles rivington at the bible and   crown in st pauls churchyard 1729    price one shilling     preface to the people of england   it deserves some notice that just at or soon after writing these sheets we have an old dispute warmly revived among us upon the question of our trade being declined or not declined i have nothing to do with the parties nor with the reason of their strife upon that subject i think they are wrong on both sides and yet it is hardly worth while to set them to rights their quarrel being quite of another nature and the good of our trade little or nothing concerned in it  nor do they seem to desire to be set right but rather to want an occasion to keep up a strife which perhaps serves some other of their wicked purposes better than peace would do and indeed those who seek to quarrel who can reconcile  i meddle not with the question i say whether trade be declined or not but i may easily show the people of england that if they please to concern themselves a little for its prosperity it will prosper and on the contrary if they will sink it and discourage it it is evidently in their power and it will sink and decline accordingly  you have here some popular mistakes with respect to our woollen manufacture fairly stated our national indolence in that very particular reproved and the consequence laid before you if you will not make use of the hints here given the fault is nobodys but your own  never had any nation the power of improving their trade and of advancing their own manufactures so entirely in their own hands as we have at this time and have had for many years past without troubling the legislature about it at all and though it is of the last importance to the whole nation and i may say to almost every individual in it nay and that it is evident you all know it to be so yet how next to impossible is it to persuade any one person to set a foot forward towards so great and so good a work and how much labour has been spent in vain to rouse us up to it  the following sheets are as one alarm more given to the lethargic age if possible to open their eyes to their own prosperity the author sums up his introduction to it in this short positive assertion which he is ready to make good viz that if the trade of england is not in a flourishing and thriving condition the fault and only occasion of it is all our own and is wholly in our own power to mend whenever we please     seasonable proposal c   as by my title i profess to be addressing myself to englishmen i think i need not tell them that they live by trade that their commerce has raised them from what they were to what they are and may if cultivated and improved raise them yet further to what they never were and this in few words is an index of my present work  it is worth an englishmans remark that we were esteemed as a growing thriving nation in trade as far back as in the reigns of the two last henries manufactures were planted navigation increased the people began to apply and trade bringing in wealth they were greatly encouraged yet in king henry viiis reign and even towards the latter end of it too we find several acts of parliament passed for regulating the price of provisions and particularly that beef and pork should not be sold in the market for more than a halfpenny per pound avoirdupoise and mutton and veal at three farthings  as the trading men to whom i write may make some estimate of things by calculating one thing by another so this leads them to other heads of trade to calculate from as first the value of money which bore some proportion though i think not a full and just equality to the provisions as followssilver was at 2s 4d per ounce and gold at 2l 5s to 2l 10s per ounce something less in the silver and more in the gold than half of the present value  as for the rate of lands and houses they bore a yet greater distance in value from what they produce now so that indeed it bears no proportion for we find the rent of lands so raised and their value so improved that there are many examples where the lands valued even in queen elizabeths days at 20l to 25l per annum are now worth from 200l to 300l per annum and in some places much more  it is true this advance is to be accounted for by the improvement made of the soil by manuring cultivating and enclosing by stocks of cattle by labour and by the arts of husbandry which are also improved and so this part is not so immediately within my present design it is a large subject and merits to be spoken of at large by itself because as the improvement of land has been extraordinary great and the landed interest is prodigiously increased by it so it is capable of much more and greater improvement than has been made for above a hundred years past but this i say is not my present design it is too great an article to be couched in a few words  yet it requires this notice here viz that trade has been a principal agent even in the improvement of our land as it has furnished the money to the husbandman to stock his land and to employ servants and labourers in the working part and as it has found him a market for the consumption of the produce of his land and at an advanced price too by which he has received a good return to enable him to go on  the short inference from these premises is this as by trade the whole kingdom is thus advanced in wealth and the value of lands and of the produce of lands and of labour is so remarkably increased why should we not go on with vigour and spirit in trade and by all proper and possible methods and endeavours increase and cultivate our commerce that we may still increase and improve in wealth in value of lands in stock and in all the arts of trade such as manufactures navigation fishery husbandry and in short study an improvement of trade in all its branches  no doubt it would be our wisdom to do thus and nothing of the kind can be more surprising than that it should not be our practice and thus i am brought down to the case before me  if it should be objected that the remark is needless that we are an industrious and laborious people that we are the best manufacturers in the world thoroughly versed in all the methods and arts for that purpose and that our trade is improved to the utmost in all places and all cases possible if it should i say be thus argued for i know some have such a taint of our national vanity that they do talk at this rate  my answer is short and direct in the negative and i do affirm that we are not that industrious applying improving people that we pretend to be and that we ought to be and might be that we are the best manufacturers i deny and yet at the same time i grant that we make the best manufactures in the world but the reason of that is greatly owing not to our own skill exceeding others so much as to our being furnished from the bounty of heaven with the best materials and best conveniencies for the work of any nation in the world of which i shall take notice in its place  but not to dwell upon our capacities for improving in trade i might clear all that part without giving up the least article of my complaint for it is not our capacity to improve that i call in question but our application to the right methods nay i must add that while i call upon your diligence and press you to application i am supposed to grant your capacities otherwise i was calling upon you to no purpose and pressing you to do what at the same time i allowed you had no power to perform  without complimenting your national vanity therefore i am to grant you have not only the means of improvement in your hands but the capacity of improving also and on this account i must add are the more inexcusable if the thing is not in practice  indeed it is something wonderful and not easy to be accounted for that a whole nation should as if they were in a lethargic dream shut their eyes to the apparent advantages of their commerce and this just now when their circumstances seem so evidently to stand in need of encouragement and that they are more than ordinarily at a kind of stop in their usual progression of trade  it is debated much among men of business whether trade is at this time in a prosperous and thriving condition or in a languishing and declining state or in a word whether we are going backwards or forward i shall not meddle with that debate here having no occasion to take up the little space allowed me in anything remote from my design but i will propose it as i really believe it to be namely that we are rather in a state of balance between both a middle between the extremes i hope we are not much declined and i fear we are not much advanced but i must add that if we do not immediately set about some new methods for altering this depending condition we shall soon decline and on the contrary if we should exert ourselves we have before us infinite advantages of improving and advancing our commerce and that to a great degree  this is stating it to the meanest understanding there is no mystery at all in the thing if you will apply you will rise if you will remain indolent and inactive you will sink and starve trade in england at this time is like a ship at sea that has sprung a leak in sight of the shore or within a few days sail of it if the crew will ply their pump and work hard they may not only keep her above water but will bring her safe into port whereas if they neglect the pump or do not exert their strength the water grows upon them and they are in apparent danger of sinking before they reach the shore  or if you will have a coarser comparison take the pump room in the rasphouse or house of correction at amsterdam where the slothful person is put into a good dry and wholesome room with a pump at one side and a spring or waterpipe at the other if he pleases to work he may live and keep the water down but if he sleeps he drowns  the moral is exactly the same in both cases and suits with the present circumstances of our trade in england most exactly only with this difference to the advantage of the latter namely that the application which i call upon the people of england to exert themselves in is not a mere labour of the hand i do not tax the poor with mere sloth and negligence idly lying still when they should work that is not our grievance at present for though there may be too much of that sort too among a few of the drunken loitering part of mankind and they suffer for it sufficiently in their poverty yet that i say is not the point idleness is not here a national crime the english are not naturally a slothful indolent or lazy people  but it is an application proper to the method of business which is wanting among us and in this we shall find room for reproof on one hand and direction on the other and our reader i dare say will acknowledge there is reason for both  it must in the first place be acknowledged that england has indeed the greatest encouragement for their industry of any nation in europe and as therefore their want of improving those advantages and encouragements lays them more open to our just reproof than other nations would be or can be who want them so it moves me with the more importunity to press home the argument which reason and the nature of the thing furnishes to persuade them reason dictates that no occasion should be let slip by which england above all nations in the world should improve the advantages they have in their hands not only because they have them but because their people so universally depend upon them the manufactures are their bread the life the comfort of their poor and the soul of their trade nature dictates that as they are given them to improve and that by industry and application they are capable of being improved so they ought to starve if they do not improve them to the utmost  let us see in a few words what nature and providence has done for us nay what they have done for us exclusive of the rest of the world the bounty of heaven has stored us with the principles of commerce fruitful of a vast variety of things essential to trade and which call upon us as it were in the voice of nature bidding us work and with annexed encouragement to do so from the visible apparent success of industry here the voice of the world is plain like the answer of an oracle thus dig and find plough and reap fish and take spin and live in a word trade and thrive and this with such extraordinary circumstances that it is as if there was a bar upon the neighbouring nations and it had been spoken from heaven thus these are for you only and not for any other nation you my favourites of england you singled out to be great opulent powerful above all your neighbours and to be made so by your own industry and my bounty  to explain this allow me a small digression to run over the detail of heavens bounty and see what god and nature has done for us beyond what it has done for other nations nature as i have said will dictate to us what heaven expects from us for the improving the blessings bestowed and for making ourselves that rich and powerful people which he has determined us to be  our country is furnished i say with the principles of commerce in a very extraordinary manner that is to say so as no other country in europe or perhaps in the world is supplied with  i with the product of the earth this is of two kinds 1 that of the inside or bowels of the earth the same of which as above the voice of heaven to us is dig and find under which article is principally our lead and tincoal i name these only because of these this island seems to have an exclusive grant there being none or but very small quantities of them found in any other nation and it is upon exclusive benefits that i am chiefly speaking 2 we have besides these iron copper lapis calaminaris vulgarly called callamy with several other minerals which may be said to be in common to us and the rest of the world of which the particulars at large and the places where they are found may be fully seen in a late tract of which i shall have frequently occasion to speak in this work entitled a plan of the commerce of great britain to which i refer as indeed to a general index of the trade and produce of this whole island  ii the product of the surface which i include in that part plough and reap and though this is not indeed an exclusive product yet i may observe that the extraordinary increase which our lands under an excellent cultivation generally yield as well in corn and cattle is an uncommon argument for the industry of the husbandmen and i might enter into a comparison with advantage against almost any countries in europe by comparing the quantity produced on both sides with the quantity of land which produce those quantities  you may find some calculations of the produce of our own country in the book above mentioned viz the plan of the commerce of great britain where the consumption of malt in england is calculated by the value of the duties of excise and where it appears that there is annually consumed in england besides what is exported to foreign countries forty millions of bushels of malt besides also all the barley the meal of which is made into bread which is a very great quantity most of the northern counties in england feeding very much upon barley bread and besides all the barley either exported or used at home in the corn unmalted all which put together i am assured amounts to no less than ten millions of bushels more  the quantity of barley only is so exceeding great that i am told it bears in proportion to the land it grows on an equality to as much land in france as all the sowed land in the whole kingdom of england or take it thus that fifty millions of bushels of barley growing in france would take up as much ground as all the lands which are at any time sowed in england with any corn whether barley oats or wheat  n b i do not say all the arable lands of england because we know there are a very great number of acres of land which every year lie fallow though in tillage and unsowed according to the usage of our husbandry so they cannot be reckoned to produce any corn at all otherwise the quantity might be much greater  this is a testimony of the fertility of our soil and on the other hand the fertility is a testimony of the diligence and application of our people and the success which attends that diligence  we are told that in some parts of england especially in the counties of essex hertford cambridge bedford bucks oxford northampton lincoln and nottingham it is very frequent to have the lands produce from seven to ten quarters of barley upon an acre which is a produce not heard of in the most fruitful of all those we call corn countries abroad much less in france on the contrary if they have a great produce of corn it is because they have a vast extent of land for it to grow upon and which land they either have no other use for or it may be is fit for no other use whereas our corn grounds are far from being the richest or the best of our lands the prime of our land being laid up as the ploughmen call it to feed upon that is to keep dairies of cows as in essex suffolk and the fens or for grazing grounds for fatting the large mutton and beef for which england is so particularly famed these grazing countries are chiefly in sussex and in the marshes of romney and other parts in kent also in the rich vales of aylesbury and others in bucks and berkshire the isle of ely the bank of trent the counties of lincoln leicester and stafford warwick and chester as also in the county of somerset lancaster north riding of yorkshire and bank of tees in the bishoprick of durham  when this product of england is considered the diligence and success of our husbandry in england will be found to be beyond that of the most industrious people in europe but i must not dwell here my view lies another way nor do the people of england want so much to be called upon to improve in husbandry as they do in manufactures and other things not but that even in this the lands not yet cultivated do call aloud upon us too but i say it is not the present case  i come in the next article to that yet louder call of the oracle as above namely fish and take indeed this is an improvement not fully preserved or a produce not sufficiently improved the advantages nature offers here cannot be said to be fully accepted of and embraced  this is a large field and much remains to be said and done too in it for the increase of wealth and the employment of our people and though i am not of the opinion which some have carried to an unaccountable length in this case viz that we should set up the fishery by companies and societies which has been often attempted and has proved abortive and illgrounded or that we ought by force or are able by all our advantages to beat out the dutch from it yet we might certainly very much enlarge and increase our own share in it take greater quantities than we do cure and pack them better than we do come sooner to market with them than we do and consume greater quantities at home than we do the consequence of which would be that we should breed up and employ more seamen build and fit out more fishingvessels and ships for merchandise than we do now and which we are unaccountably blameable that we do not  and here i must observe that the increasing the fishery would even contribute to our vending as well as catching a greater quantity of fish and to take off the disadvantage which we now lie under with the dutch by the consequence of trade in the fishery itself the case is this the chief market for white herring which is the fishery i am speaking of is the port of dantzic and konigsberg from which ports the whole kingdom of poland and great duchy of lithuania are supplied with fish by the navigation of the great river of the vistula and the smaller rivers of the pragel and niemen c  the return brought from thence is in canvass oak and spruce plank and timber sturgeon some hemp and flax pot ashes c but chiefly corn  here the dutch have an infinite advantage of us which is never to be surmounted or overcome and for which reason it is impossible for us ever to beat them out of this trade viz the dutch send yearly a very great number of ships to dantzic c to fetch corn some say they send a thousand sail every year and i believe they do send so many ships or those ships going so many times or making so many voyages in the year as amounts to the same number of freights and so is the same thing  all these ships going for corn for the dutch have their chief supply of corn from that country it follows then that their herrings are carried for nothing seeing the ships which carry them must go light if they did not carry the fish whereas on the other hand our fish must pay freight in whatever vessel it may go  when our ships then from scotland for there the fishery chiefly lies and from thence the trade must take its rise i say when they have carried their fish to the ports abovenamed of dantzic and konigsberg how must they come back and with what shall they be loaded  the only answer that can be given is that they must bring back the goods mentioned before or in shorter terms naval stores though indeed not much of naval stores neither except timber and plank for the hemp and tar which are the main articles are fetched further viz from riga revel narva and petersburg but suppose after delivering their fish some of the ships should go to those ports to seek freight and load naval stores there which is the utmost help in the trade that can be expected  the next question is whither shall they carry them and for whose account shall they be loaden to go for scotland would not be an answer for scotland having but a few ships could not take off any quantity proportioned to such a commerce for if we were to push the dutch out of the trade we must be supposed to employ two or three hundred sail of ships at least to carry herrings to dantzic c  to say they might take freight at london and load for england would be no answer neither for besides that even england itself would not take off a quantity of those goods equal to the number of ships which would want freight so if england did yet those ships would still have one dead freight for they would be left to go light home at last to scotland otherwise how shall they be at hand to load next year and even that one dead freight would abate the profit of the voyage and so still the dutch would have the advantage  upon the whole take it how and which way we will it will for ever be true that though our fish were every way equal to the dutch which yet we cannot affirm and though it came as soon to market and carried as good a price there all which i fear must a little fall short yet it would still be true that the dutch would gain and we should lose  there is yet another addition to the advantage of holland viz in the return of money that whereas when our fish shall be sold we shall want to remit back the produce in money that is to say so much of it as cannot be brought back in goods and the difference in the exchange must be against us but it is in favour of the dutch for if they did not send their herrings and other fish to dantzic they must remit money to pay for their corn and even as it is they are obliged to send other goods such as whale oil the produce of their greenland fishery english manufactures and the like whereas the scots merchants having no market for corn and not a demand for a sufficient value in naval stores c viz the product of the country must bring the overplus by exchange to their loss the exchange running the other way  it is true this is a digression but it is needful to show how weak those notions are which prompt us to believe we are able to beat the dutch out of the fishing trade by increasing our number of busses and taking a larger quantity of fish  but this brings me back to the first argument if you can find a way to enlarge your shipping in the fishery and send greater quantities of fish to market and yet sell them to advantage you would by consequence enlarge your demand for naval stores and so be able to bring more ships home loaden from thence that is to say to dispose of more of their freight at home and indeed nothing else can do it  n b this very difference in the trade is the reason why a greater quantity of english manufactures are not sent from hence to dantzic as was formerly done viz not that the consumption of those goods is lessened in poland or that less woollen manufactures are demanded at dantzic or at konigsberg but it is that the dutch carry our manufactures from their own country this they can do to advantage besides their costing nothing freight as above though they are sold to little or no profit because they want the value there to pay for their corn and must otherwise remit money to loss for the payment  as these things are not touched at before in any discourses on this subject but we are daily filled with clamours and complaints at the indolence and negligence of our scots and northern britons for not outworking the dutch in their fishing trade i think it is not foreign to the purpose to have thus stated the case and to have shown that it is not indeed a neglect in our management that the dutch thrive in the fishing trade and we sit still as they call it and look on which really is not so in fact but that the nature of the thing gives the advantage to the dutch and throws the trade into their hands in a manner that no industry or application of ours could or can prevent  having thus vindicated our people where they are really not deserving blame let us look forward from hence and see with the same justice where they are in another case likewise less to blame than is generally imagined namely in the white fishing or the taking of codfish in these northern seas which is also represented as if it was so plentiful of fish that any quantity might be taken and cured and so the french the scots and the portuguese might be supplied from hence much cheaper and more to advantage than by going so long a voyage as to the banks of newfoundland  this also is a mistake and the contrary is evident that there is a good white fishing upon the coast as well of the north part of the british coast as on the east side of scotland is very true the scots to give them their due do cure a tolerable quantity of fish even in or near the frith of edinburgh also there is a good fishery for cod on the west side and among the islands of the leuze and the other parts called the western islands of scotland but the mistake lies in the quantity which is not sufficient to supply the demand in those ports mentioned above nor is it such as makes it by far so easy to load a ship as at newfoundland where it is done in the onefifth part of the time and consequently so much cheaper and the author of this has found this to be so by experience  yet it cannot be said with justice that the scots fishermen are negligent and do not improve this fishing to advantage for that really they do kill and cure as many as can be easily done to make them come within a price and more cannot be done that is to say it would be to no purpose to do it for it will for ever be true in trade that what cannot be done to advantage may be said not to be possible to be done because gain is the end of commerce and the merchant cannot do what he cannot get by  it may be true that in the herring fishery the consumption might be increased at home and in some places also abroad and so far that fishery is not so fully pursued but i do not see that the increase of it can be very considerable there being already a prodigious quantity cured more than ever in ireland on every side of that kingdom and also on the west of england but if it may be increased so much the more will be the advantage of the commerce of which by itself  but from this i come to the main article of the british trade i mean our wool or as it is generally expressed the woollen manufacture and this is what i mean when i said as above spin and live  in this likewise i must take the liberty to say and insist upon it that the english people cannot be said to be idle or slothful or to neglect the advantages which are put into their hands of the greatest manufactures in europe if not in the whole world  on the other hand the people of england have run up their manufactures to such a prodigy of magnitude that though it is extended into almost every part of the known world i mean the world as it is known in trade yet even that whole world is scarce equal to its consumption and is hardly able to take off the quantity the negligence therefore of the english people is not so much liable to reproof in this part as some pretend to tell us the trade of our woollen manufacture being evidently increased within these few years past far beyond what it ever was before  i know abundance of our people talk very dismal things of the decay of our woollen manufacture and that it is declined much they insist upon it being prohibited in many places and countries abroad of their setting up other manufactures of their own in the room of it of their pretending to mimick and imitate it and supply themselves with the produce of their own land and the labour of their own people and indeed france has for many years gone some length in this method of erecting woollen manufactures in the room of ours and making their own productions serve instead of our completely finished manufacture but all these imitations are weak and unperforming and show abundantly how little reason we have to apprehend their endeavours or that they will be able to supplant our manufacture there or any where else for that even in france itself where the imitation of our manufactures is carried on to the utmost perfection yet they are obliged to take off great quantities of our finest and best goods and such is the necessity of their affairs that they to this day run them in that is import them clandestinely at the greatest risk in spite of the strictest prohibition and of the severest penalties death and the galleys excepted a certain token that their imitation of our manufactures is so far from pleasing and supplying other parts of the world that they are not sufficient to supply or good enough to please themselves  i must confess the imitating our manufactures has been carried further in france than in any other part of the world and yet we do not see they have been able so to affect the consumption as to have any visible influence upon our trade or that we abate the quantity which we usually made but that if they have checked the export at all we have still found other channels of trade which have fully carried off our quantity and shall still do so though other nations were able to imitate us to and this is very particularly stated and explained by the author of the book above mentioned called the plan of the english commerce where the extending our manufactures is handled more at large than i have room for in the narrow compass of this tract and therefore i again refer my reader thither as to the fountain head  but i go on to touch the heads of things the french do imitate our manufactures in a better manner and in greater quantity than other nations and why do we not prevent them it is a terrible satire upon our vigilance or upon the method of our customhouse men that we do not prevent it seeing the french themselves will not stick to acknowledge that without a supply of our wool which is evident they have now with very small difficulty from ireland they could do little in it and indeed nothing at all to the purpose  on the other hand it is not so with france in regard to their silk manufactures in which although we have not the principles of the work i mean the silk growing within our dominions but are obliged to bring it from italy yet we have so effectually shut out the french silk manufactures from our market that in a word we have no occasion at all for them nay if you will believe some of our manufacturers the french buy some of our wrought silks and carry them into france but whether the particular be so in fact or no this i can take upon me from good evidence to affirm that whereas we usually imported in the ordinary course of trade at least a million to twelve hundred thousand pounds value a year in wrought silks from france now we import so little as is not worth naming and yet it is allowed that we do not wear less silk or silks of a meaner value than we usually did before so that all the difference is clear gain on the english side in the balance of trade  the contemplation of this very article furnishes a most eminent encouragement to our people to increase and improve their trade and especially to gain upon the rest of europe in making all the most useful manufactures of other nations their own  nor would this increase of our trade be a small article in the balance of business when we come to calculate the improvement we have made in that particular article by encroaching upon our neighbours more than they have been able to make upon us and this also you will find laid down at large in the account of the improvement of our manufactures in general calculated in the piece above mentioned chap v p 164  if then the encroachments of france upon our woollen manufactures are so small as very little to influence our trade or lessen the quantity made here and would be less if due care was taken to keep our wool out of their hands and that at the same time we have encroached upon their trade in the silk manufactures only besides others such as paper glass linen hats c to the value of twelve hundred thousand pounds a year then france has got little by prohibiting the english manufactures and perhaps had much better have let it alone  however i must not omit here what is so natural a consequence from these premises viz that here lies the first branch of our humble proposal to the people of england for increase of their commerce and improvement of their manufactures namely that they would keep their wool at home  i know it will be asked immediately how shall it be done and the answer indeed requires more time and room to debate it than can be allowed me here but the general answer must be given certainly it is practicable to be done and i am sure it is absolutely necessary i shall say more to it presently  but i go on with the discourse of the woollen manufactures in general nothing is more certain than that it is the greatest and most extensive branch of our whole trade and as the piece above mentioned says positively is really the greatest manufacture in the world vide plan chap v p 172 179  nor can the stop of its vent in this or that part of the world greatly affect it if foreign trade abates its demand in one place it increases it in another and it certainly goes on increasing prodigiously every year in direct confutation of the phlegmatic assertions of those who with as much malice as ignorance endeavour to run it down and depreciate its worth as well as credit by their illgrounded calculations  we might call for evidence in this cause the vast increase of our exportation in the woollen manufactures only to portugal which for above twentyfive years past has risen from a very moderate trade to such a magnitude that we now export more woollen goods in particular yearly to portugal than both spain and portugal took off before notwithstanding spain has been represented as so extraordinary a branch of trade the occasion of this increase is fully explained by the said plan of the english commerce to be owing to the increase of the portuguese colonies in the brazils and in the kingdoms of congo and angola on the west side of africa and of melinda and the coast of zanguebar on the east side in all which the portuguese have so civilized the natives and black inhabitants of the country as to bring them where they went even stark naked before to clothe decently and modestly now and to delight to do so in such a degree as they will hardly ever be brought to go unclothed again and all these nations are clothed more or less with our english woollen manufactures and the same in proportion in their east india factories  the like growth and increase of our own colonies is another article to confirm this argument viz that the consumption of our manufactures is increased it is evident that the number of our people inhabitants of those colonies visibly increases every day so must by a natural consequence the consumption of the cloths they wear  and this increase is so great and is so demonstrably growing every day greater that it is more than equal to all the decrease occasioned by the check or prohibitions put upon our manufactures whether by the imitation of the french or any other european nation  i might dwell upon this article and extend the observation to the east indies where a remarkable difference is evident between the present and the past times for whereas a few years past the quantity of european goods whether of english or other manufactures was very small and indeed not worth naming on the contrary now the number of european inhabitants in the several factories of the english dutch and portuguese is so much increased and the people who are subject to them also and who they bring in daily to clothe after the european fashion especially at batavia at fort st george at surat goa and other principal factories that the demand for our manufactures is grown very considerable and daily increasing this also the said plan of the commerce insists much on and explains in a more particular manner  but to proceed not only our english colonies and factories are increased as also the portuguese in the brazils and in the south part of africa not only the factories of the english and dutch in the east indies are increased and the number of europeans there being increased call for a greater quantity of european goods than ever but even the spaniards and their colonies in the west indies i mean in new spain and other dominions of the spaniards in america are increased in people and that not so much the spaniards themselves though they too are more numerous than ever but the civilized free indians as they are called are exceedingly multiplied  these are indians in blood but being native subjects of spain know no other nation nor do they speak any other language than spanish being born and educated among them they are tradesmen handicrafts and bred to all kinds of business and even merchants too as the spaniards are and some of them exceeding rich of these they tell us there are thirty thousand families in the city of lima only and doubtless the numbers of these increase daily  as all these go clothed like spaniards as well themselves as their wives children and servants of which they have likewise a great many so it necessarily follows that they greatly increase the consumption of european goods and that the demand of english manufactures in particular increases in proportion these manufactures being more than twothirds of the ordinary habit or dress of those people as it is also of the furniture of their houses all which they take from their first patrons the spaniards  it will seem a very natural inquiry here how i can pretend to charge the english nation with indolence or negligence in their labouring or working their woollen manufactures when it is apparent they work up all the wool which their whole nation produces that the whole growth and produce of their sheep is wrought up by them and that they buy a prodigious quantity from ireland and scotland and work up all that too and that with this they make such an infinite quantity of goods that they as it were glut and gorge the whole world with their manufactures  my answer is positive and direct viz that notwithstanding all this they are chargeable with an unaccountable unjustifiable and i had almost said a most scandalous indolence and neglect and that in respect to this woollen manufacture in particular a neglect so gross that by it they suffer a manifest injury in trade this neglect consists of three heads  1 they do not work up all the wool which they might come at and which they ought to work up and about which they have still spare hands enough to set to work  2 they with difficulty sell off or consume the quantity of goods they make whereas they might otherwise vend a much greater quantity both abroad and at home  3 they do not sufficiently apply themselves to the improving and enlarging their colonies abroad which as they are already increased and have increased the consumption of the manufactures so they are capable of being much further improved and would thereby still further improve and increase the manufactures by so much as they do not work up the wool by so much they neglect the advantage put into their hands for the wool of great britain and ireland is certainly a singular and exclusive gift from heaven for the advantage of this great and opulent nation if heaven has given the wool and we do not improve the gift by manufacturing it all up so far we are to be reproached with indolence and neglect and no wonder if the wool goes from ireland to france by whole shiploads at a time for what must the poor irish do with their wool if they manufacture it we will not let them trade with those manufactures or export them beyond sea our reasons for that prohibition are indeed very good though too long to debate in this place but no reason can be alleged that can in any sense of the thing be justifiable why we should not either give leave to export the manufactures or take the wool  but to speak of the reason to ourselves for the other is a reason to them i mean the irish the reason to ourselves is this we ought to take the wool ourselves that the french might not have it to erect and imitate our own manufactures in france and so supplant our trade  certainly if we could take the whole quantity of the irish wool off their hands we might with ease prevent it being carried to france for much of it goes that way merely because they cannot get money for it at home  this i charge therefore as a neglect and an evident proof of indolence namely that we do not take effectual care to secure all the wool in ireland give the irish money for it at a reasonable market price and then cause it to be brought to england as to the general market  i know it will be objected that england does already take off as much as they can and as much as they want and to bring over more than they can use will sink the market and be an injury to ourselves but i am prepared to answer this directly and effectually and you shall have a full reply to it immediately  but in the mean time this is a proof of the first proposition namely that we do not work up all our own wool for the irish wool is and ought to be esteemed as our own in the present debate about trade for that it is carried away from our own dominions and is made use of by those that rival our manufactures to the ruin of our own trade  that the irish are prohibited exporting their wool is true but it seems a little severe to prohibit them exporting their wool and their manufactures too and then not to buy the wool of them neither  it is alleged by some that we do take off all the wool they bring us and that we could and would take it all if they would bring it all to this i answer if the irish people do not bring it all to us it is either that it is too far for the poor people who own the wool to bring it to the south and east coast of ireland there being no markets in the west and northwest parts of that island where they could sell it and the farmers and sheepbreeders are no merchants nor have they carriage for so long a journey but either the public ought to appoint proper places whether it shall be carried and where they would receive money for it at a certain rate or erect markets where those who deal in wool might come to buy and where those who have it to sell would find buyers  no doubt but the want of buyers is the reason why so much of the irish wool is carried over to france besides if markets were appointed where the poor farmers could always find buyers at one price or another there would be then no pretence for them to carry it away in the dark and by stealth to the sea side as is now the case and the justice of prohibitions and seizures would be more easily to be defended indeed there would be no excuse for the running it off nor would there want any excuse for seizing it if they attempted to run it off  but i am called upon to answer the objection mentioned above namely that the manufactures in england do indeed already take off a very great quantity of the irish wool as much as they have occasion for nay they condescend so far to the irish as to allow them to manufacture a great deal of that wool which they take off that is to say to spin it into yarn of which yarn so great a quantity is brought into england yearly as they assure us amounts to sixty thousand packs of wool as may be seen by a fair calculation in the book above mentioned called the plan in a word that the english are not in a condition to take off any more now this is that which leads me directly to the question in hand whether the english are able to take off any more of the irish wool and yarn or no i do not affirm that as the trade in england is now carried on they are able perhaps they are not but i insist that if we were thoroughly resolved in england to take such wise measures as we ought to take and as we are well able to do for the improvement and increase of our manufactures we might and should be able to take off and work up the whole growth of the wool of ireland and this i shall presently demonstrate as i think past doubt  but before i come to the scheme for the performance of this give me leave to lay down some particulars of the advantage this would be to our country and to our commerce supposing the thing could be brought to pass and then i shall show how easily it might be brought to pass  1 by taking off this great quantity of wool and yarn supposing one half of the quantity to be spun many thousands of the poor people of ireland who are now in a starving condition for want of employment would be set immediately to work and be put in a condition to get their bread so that it would be a present advantage to the irish themselves and that far greater than it can be now their wool which goes away to france being all carried off unwrought  2 due care being then taken to prevent any exportation of wool to france as i take it for granted might be done with much more ease when the irish had encouragement to sell their wool at home we should soon find a difference in the expense of wool by the french being disabled from imitating our manufactures abroad and the consumption of our own would naturally increase in proportion first they would not be able to thrust their manufactures into foreign markets as they now do by which the sale of our manufactures must necessarily be abated and secondly they would want supplies at home and consequently our manufactures would be more called for even in france itself and that in spite of penalties and prohibitions  thus by our taking off the irish wool we should in time prevent its exportation to france and by preventing its going to france we should disable the french and increase the consumption of our own manufactures in all the ports whither they now send them and even in france itself  i have met with some people who have made calculations of the quantity of wool which is sent annually from ireland to france and they have done it by calculating first how many packs of wool the whole kingdom of ireland may produce and this they do again from the number of sheep which they say are fed in ireland in the whole how right this calculation may be i will not determine  first they tell us there are fed in ireland thirty millions of sheep and as all these sheep are supposed be sheared once every year they must produce exactly thirty millions of fleeces allowing the fell wool in proportion to the number of sheep killed  it is observable by a very critical account of the wool produced annually in romney marsh in the county of kent and published in the said plan of the english commerce that the fleeces of wool of those large sheep generally weigh above four pounds and a half each it is computed thus first he tells us that romney marsh contains 47110 acres of land that they feed 141330 sheep whose wool being shorn makes up 2523 packs of wool the sum of which is that every acre feeds three sheep every sheep yields one fleece and 56 fleeces make one pack of wool all which comes out to 2523 packs of wool twentythree fleeces over every pack weighing two hundred and forty pounds of wool vide plan c p 259  i need not observe here that the sheep in ireland are not near so large as the sheep in romney marsh these last being generally the largest breed of sheep in england except a few on the bank of the river tees in the bishoprick of durham now if these large sheep yield fleeces of four pounds and a half of wool we may be supposed to allow the irish sheep take them one with another to yield three pounds of wool to a fleece or to a sheep out of which must be deducted the fell wool most of which is of a shorter growth and therefore cannot be reckoned so much by at least a pound to a sheep begin then to account for the wool and we may make some calculation from thence of the number of sheep  1 if of the romney marsh fleeces weighing four pounds and a half each fiftysix fleeces make one pack of wool then seventy fleeces irish wool weighing three pounds each fleece make a pack  2 if we import from ireland one hundred thousand packs of wool as well in the fleece as in the yarn then we import the wool of seven millions of sheep fed in ireland every year  come we next to the gross quantity of wool as the irish make all their own manufactures that is to say all the woollen manufactures needful for their own use such as for wearing apparel house furniture c we cannot suppose but that they use much more than the quantity exported to england besides that it is too well known that notwithstanding the prohibition of exportation they do daily ship off great quantities of woollen goods not only to the west indies but also to france to spain and italy and we have had frequent complaints of our merchants from lisbon and oporto of the great quantity of irish woollen manufactures that are brought thither as well broadcloth as serges druggets duroys frieze longells and all the other sorts of goods which are usually exported from england add these clandestine exportations to the necessary clothing furniture and equipages of that whole nation in which are reckoned two millions and a half of people and we cannot suppose they make use of less than two hundred thousand packs of wool yearly among themselves which is the wool of fourteen millions of sheep more  we must then allow all the rest of the wool to be run or smuggled call it what you please to france which must be at least a hundred to a hundred and twenty thousand packs more for it seems the irish tell us that they feed thirty millions of sheep in the whole kingdom of ireland  if then they run over to france a hundred thousand packs of wool yearly which i take to be the least all this amounts to twentyeight millions of fleeces together the other two millions of fleeces may justly be deducted for the difference between the quantity of wool taken from the sheep that are killed which we call fell wool and the fleece wool shorn  upon the foot of this calculation there are a hundred thousand packs of wool produced in ireland every year which we ought to take off and which for want of our taking it off is carried away to france where it is wholly employed to mimick our manufactures and abuse our trade lessening thereby the demand of our own goods abroad and even in france itself this therefore is a just reproach to our nation and they are certainly guilty of a great neglect in not taking off that wool and more effectually preventing it being carried away to france  it must be confessed that unless we do find some way to take off this wool from the irish we cannot so reasonably blame them for selling it to the french or to anybody else that will buy for what else can they do with it seeing you shut up all their ports against the manufacturers at least you shut them up as far as you are able and if you will neither let them manufacture it for not letting them transport the manufacture when made is in effect forbidding to make them i say if you will neither let them manufacture their wool nor take it off their hands what must they do with it  but i come next to the grand objection namely that we cannot take it off that we do take off as much as we can use and a very great quantity it is too that we are not able to take more that is to say we know not what to do with it if we take it that we cannot manufacture it or if we do we cannot sell the goods and so according to the known rule in trade that what cannot be done with profit or without loss we may say of it that it cannot be done so in the sense of trade we cannot take their wool off and if they must run it over to france they must we cannot help it  this i say is a very great mistake and i do affirm that as we ought to take off the whole quantity of the irish wool so we may and are able to do it that our manufacture is capable of being so increased and the consumption of it increased also as well at home as abroad that it would in the ordinary course of trade call for all the wool of ireland if it were much more than it is and employ it profitably besides employing many thousands of poor people more than are now employed and who indeed want employment  upon this foundation and to bring this to be true as i shall presently make appear i must add that a just reproach lies upon us for indolence and an unaccountable neglect of our national interests in not sufficiently exerting ourselves to improve our trade and increase our manufactures which is the title as it is the true design of this whole work  the affirming as above that we are able to increase our manufacture and by that increase to take off more wool may perhaps be thought an arrogance too great to be justified and would be a begging the question in an egregious manner if i were not in a condition to prove what i say i shall therefore apply myself directly to evidence and to put it out of doubt  by increasing our manufacture i am content to be understood to mean the increasing the consumption otherwise to increase quantity only would be to ruin the manufacturers not improve the trade this increasing the consumption is to be considered under two generals    1 the consumption at home   2 the exportation or consumption abroad  i begin with the last namely the consumption abroad this is too wide a field to enter upon in particular here i refer it to be treated at large by itself but as far as it serves to prove what i have affirmed above namely that the consumption of our manufactures may be improved abroad so far it is needful to speak of it here i shall confine it to the english colonies and factories abroad  it is evident that by the increase of our colonies the consumption of our manufactures has been exceedingly increased not only experience proves it but the nature of the thing makes it impossible to be otherwise the island of st christopher is a demonstration beyond all argument that island is increased in its product and people by the french giving it up to us at the treaty of utrecht its product of sugar is almost equal to that of barbadoes and will in a very few years exceed it the exports from hence to that island are increased in proportion why then do we not increase our possessions plant new colonies and better people our old ones both might be done to infinite advantage as might be made out had we room for it past contradiction  we talk of and expect a war with spain were the advantages which new settlements in the abandoned countries of america as well the island as the continent considered we should all wish for such a war that the english might by their superiority at sea get and maintain a firm footing as well on the continent as the islands of america there the spainards like the fable of the dog in the manger neither improve it themselves nor will admit others to improve i mean in all the south continent of america from buenos ayres to port st julien a country fruitful a climate healthful able to maintain plentifully any numbers even to millions of people with an uninterrupted communication within the land as far as to the golden mountain of the andes or cordilleras where the chilians unsubdued by any european power a docible civilized people but abhorring the spaniards would not fail to establish a commerce infinitely profitable exchanging gold for all your english manufactures to an inexpressible advantage  among the islands why should not we as well as the french plant upon the fruitful countries of cuba and hispaniola as rich and capable of raising sugars cocoa ginger pimento indigo cotton and all the other productions usual in that latitude as either the barbadoes or jamaica  our factories for they cannot yet be called colonies on the coast of africa offer us the like advantages why are they not turned into populous and powerful colonies as they might be why not encouraged from hence and why is not their trade espoused and protected as our other colonies and factories but left to be ravaged by the naked and contemptible negroes plundered and their trade ravished by the more unjust and more merciless interlopers who instead of thieves for they are no better would be called separate traders only though they break in by violence and fraud upon the property of an established company and rob them of their commerce even under the protection of their own forts and castles which these paid nothing towards the cost of  why does not england enlarge and encourage the commerce of the coast of guinea plant and fortify and establish such possessions there as other nations the portuguese for example in the opposite coast on the same latitude is it not all owing to the most unaccountable indolence and neglect what hinders but that we might ere now have had strong towns and an inhabited district round them and a hundred thousand christians dwelling at large in that country as the portuguese have now at melinda in the same latitude on the eastern coast  and what hinders but that same indolence and neglect that they have not there growing at this time the coffee of mocha as the dutch have at batavia the tea of china the cocoa of the caraccas the spices of the moluccas and all the other productions of the remotest indies which grow now in the same latitude and which cost us so much treasure yearly to purchase and which as has been tried would prosper here as well as in the countries from which we fetch them  what a consumption of english manufacture would follow such a plantation and what an increase of trade would necessarily attend an increase of people there  i have not room to enlarge here upon these heads they are fully stated in the said plan of english commerce and in several other tracts of trade lately published by the same author and to that i refer see the plan chap iii page 335 and chap v page 363  i come next to the consumption at home and here indeed the proof lies heavy upon ourselves nothing but an unaccountable supreme negligence of our own apparent advantages can be the cause of the whole grievance such a negligence as i think no nation but the english are or can be guilty of i mean no nation that has the like advantage of a manufacture and that has a hundred thousand packs of wool every year unwrought up and a million of people unemployed  n b all our manufactures whether of wool silk or thread and all other wares hard or soft though we have a very great variety yet do not employ all our people by a great many nay we have some whole counties into which the woollen or silk or linen manufacture may be said never to have set their feet i mean as to the working part or so little as not to be worth naming such in particular as cambridge huntingdon hertford bedford the first three are of late indeed come into the spinning part a little but it is but very little the like may be said of the counties of cheshire stafford derby and lincoln in all which very little if any manufactures are carried on neither are the counties of kent sussex surry or hampshire employed in any of the woollen manufactures worth mentioning the last indeed on the side about alton and alresford may be said to do a little and the first just at canterbury and cranbrook but what is all they do compared to the extent of four counties so populous that it is thought there are near a million of people in them  seeing then i say there are yet so many people want employ and so much wool unwrought up and which for want of being thus wrought up is carried away by a clandestine smuggling pernicious trade to employ our enemies in trade the french and to endanger our manufactures at foreign markets how great is our negligence and how much to the reproach of our country is it that we do not improve this trade and increase the consumption of the manufactures as we ought to do i mean the consumption at home for of the foreign consumption i have spoken already  it seems to follow here as a natural inquiry after what has been said that we should ask how is this to be done and by what method can the people of england increase the home consumption of their woollen manufactures  i cannot give a more direct answer to this question or introduce what follows in a better manner than in the very words of the author of the book so often mentioned above as follows speaking of this very thing thus  the next branch of complaint says this author is that the consumption of our woollen manufacture is lessened at home  this indeed continues he though least regarded has the most truth and reason in it and merits to be more particularly inquired into but supposing the fact to be true let me ask the complainer this question viz why do we not mend it and that without laws without teazing the parliament and our sovereign for what they find difficult enough to effect even by law the remedy is our own and in our own power i say why do not the people of great britain by general custom and by universal consent increase the consumption of their own manufacture by rejecting the trifles and toys of foreigners  why do we not appear dressed in the growth of our own country and made fine by the labour of our own hands vide plan of the english commerce p 252  and again p 254 we must turn the complaints of the people upon themselves and entreat them to encourage the manufactures of england by a more general use and wearing of them this alone would increase the consumption as that alone would increase the manufacture itself  i cannot put this into a plainer or better way of arguing or in words more intelligible to every capacity  did ever any nation but ours complain of the declining of their trade and at the same time discourage it among themselves complain that foreigners prohibit our manufactures and at the same time prohibit it themselves for refusing to wear it is the worst and severest way of prohibiting it  we do indeed put a prohibition upon our trade when we stop up the stream and dam up the channel of its consumption by putting a slight upon the wearing it and as it were voting it out of fashion for if you once vote your goods out of wear you vote them out of the market and you had as good vote them contraband  with what an impetuous gust of the fancy did we run into the product of the east indies for some years ago how did we patiently look on and see the looms empty the workmen fled the wives and children starve and beg the parishes loaded and the poors rates rise to a surprising height while the ladies flourished in fine massulapatam chints indian damasks china atlasses and an innumerable number of rich silks the product of the coast of malabar coromandel and the bay of bengal and the poorer sort with calicoes and with what infinite difficulty was a remedy obtained and with what regret did the ladies part with that foreign pageantry and stoop to wear the richest silks of their own manufacture though these were the life of their countrys prosperity and those the ruin of it  when this was the case how fared our trade the state of it was thus in a few words  the poor as above wanted bread the wool lay on hand sunk in price and wanted a market the manufacturers wanted orders and when they made goods knew not where to sell them all was melancholy and dismal on that side nothing but the east india trade could be said to thrive their ships went out full of money and came home full of poison for it was all poison to our trade the immense sums of ready money that went abroad to india impoverished our trade and indeed bid fair to starve it and in a word to beggar the nation  at home we were so far from working up the whole quantity or growth of our wool that three or four years growth lay on hand in the poor tenants houses for want of which they could not pay their rent  the wool from scotland which comes all to us now went another way viz to france for the union was not then made and yet we had too much at home nor was the quantity brought from ireland half so much as it is now  was all this difference from our own wearing or not wearing the produce of our own manufacture how unaccountably stupid then are we to run still retrograde to the public good of our country and ruin our own commerce by rejecting our own manufacture setting our people to furnish other nations with cloths and recommending the manufacture to other countries and rejecting them ourselves  if the difference was small and the clothing of our own people was a thing of small moment that it made no impression on the commerce or the manufacture in general it might be said to be too little to take notice of  if our consumption at home is thus considerable and the clothing of our own people does consume the wool of many millions of sheep if the silk trade employs many thousands of families if there is an absolute necessity of working up if possible all the growth of our wool as well of ireland as of england or that else it would be run over to france to the encouragement of rival manufactures and the ruin of our own in a word if our own people falling into a general use of our own manufacture would effectually do this and their continuing to neglect it would effectually throw our manufacture into convulsions and stagnate the whole trade of the kingdom if our wearing foreign silk manufactures did annually carry out 1200000l sterling per annum for silks to france and italy and above 600000l per annum for the like to india all in spices to the impoverishing our trade by emptying us of all our ready money as well as starving our poor for want of employment  again if these grievances were very much abated and indeed almost remedied by the several acts of parliament first to prohibit east india silks then to lay high duties equal to prohibition upon french silks and in the last place an act to prohibit the use and wearing of printed calicoes i say if these acts have gone so far in the retrieving the dying condition of our woollen manufacture and encouraging the silk manufacture that in the first we have wrought up all the english growth of wool and that of scotland too which was never done before and in the last have improved so remarkably in the silk manufacture that all that vast sum of 1800000l per annum expended before in french and indian silks is now turned into the pockets of our own poor and kept all at home and the silks become a mere english manufacture as was before a foreign  if all this is true as it is most certainly what witchcraft must it be that has seized upon the fancy of this nation what spirit of blindness and infatuation must have possessed us that we are in all haste running back into the old stupid and dull unthinking state and growing fond of anything nay of everything that is injurious to our own commerce and be it as ruinous as it will to our own poor and to our own manufactures nay though we see our trade sick and languishing and our poor starving before our eyes and know that we ourselves are the only cause of it are yet so obstinately and unalterable averse to our own manufacture and fond of novelties and trifles that we will not wear our own goods but will at any hazard make use of things foreign to us the labour and advantage of strangers pagans negroes or any kind of people rather than our own  unhappy temper unknown in any nation but ours the wiser pagans and mahometans natives of india persia china japan siam pegu act otherwise wherever we find any people in these parts we find them clothed with their own manufacture whether of silk cotton herba or of whatever other materials they were made nor to this day have our nicest or finest manufactures though perfectly new to them and novelties we see take with us to a frenzy and distraction touched their fancies or so much as tempted them to wear them all our endeavours to persuade them have been in vain but with us any new fancy any farfetched novelty however antick however extravagant in price nay the dearer the more prevailing presently touches our wandering fancy and makes us cast off our finest and most agreeable produce the fruit of our own industry and the labour of our own poor making a mode of the foreign gewgaw let it be as wild and barbarous as it will  but i meet with an objection in my way here which is insisted upon with the utmost warmth namely  objection you seem to acknowledge that the prohibition of india silks and the duties upon french silks have effectually answered the end as to silks and that the late act against the use and wearing of printed or painted calicoes has likewise had its effect on the woollen manufacture there is nothing now left to support your complaint but the printed linen which though it is become a general wear yet is our own product and growth and the labour of our own poor for the scots and irish by whom the linen is manufactured are our own subjects and ought as much to be in our concern as any of the rest and that linen is as much our own manufacture as the silk and the wool  nothing could in my opinion be more surprising of its kind than to hear with what warmth this very argument was urged to the parliament and to the public by not the scots and irish only but even by some of our own people possessed and persuaded by the other at the time the act against the printed calicoes was depending before the parliament as if an upstart and in itself trifling manufacture however increased by the corruption of our peoples humour and fancy could be an equivalent to the grand manufacture of wool in england which is the fund of our whole commerce and has been the spring and fountain of our wealth and prosperity for above three hundred years a manufacture which employs millions of our people which has raised the wealth of the whole nation from what it then was to what it now is a manufacture that has made us the greatest trading nation in the world and upon which all our wealth and commerce still depends  i insist upon it that no novelty is to be encouraged among us to the prejudice of this chief and main support of our country let it be of what kind it will nor is it at all to the purpose to say such or such a novelty is made at home and is the work of our own people it is to say nothing at all for we ought no more to set up particular manufactures to the prejudice of the woollen trade in general which is the grand product of the whole nation and on which our whole prosperity depends than we would spread an universal infection among us on pretence that the vegetable or plant from whence the destructive effluvia proceeded was the growth of our own land or than we should publish the alcoran and the most heretical blasphemous or immodest books to taint the morals and principles of the people on pretence that the paper and print were our own manufactures  i am for encouraging all manufactures that can be invented and set up among us and that may tend to the employment of the poor and improvement of our produce such things having a national tendency to raising the rent of our lands assisting the consumption of our growth and in a word increasing trade in general i say i am for encouraging new manufactures of all sorts with this one exception only namely that they do not interfere with and tend to the prejudice of the woollen manufacture which is the main and essential manufacture of england  but the woollen manufacture is the life and blood of the whole nation the soul of our trade the top of all manufactures and nothing can be erected that either rivals it or any way lessens it or interferes with it without wounding us in the more noble and vital part and in effect endangering the whole  to set up a manufacture of painted linen which touching the particular pride and gay humour of the ordinary sort of people intercepts the woollen manufacture which they would otherwise be clothed with is so far wounding and supplanting the woollen manufacture for a paltry trifle and though it is indeed in itself but a trifle yet as the poorer sort of people the servants and the wives and children of the farmers and country people and of the labouring poor who wear this new fangle are a vast multitude the wound strikes deeper into the quantity than most people imagine makes a large abatement of the consumption of wool lessening the labour of the poor manufacturers very considerably and on this account i say it ought not to be encouraged though it be our own manufacture  do we not from this very principle prohibit the planting tobacco in england though our own land would produce it do we not know there are coals in blackheath muzzlehill and other places but that we must not work them that we may not hurt the navigation the reason is exactly the same here  this consideration is so pungent in itself and so naturally touches every englishman that has the good of his country at heart that one would think there should be no occasion for an act of parliament to oblige them to it but they should be moved by a mere concern of mind and generous endeavour for the public prosperity not to fall in with or encourage any new project any new custom or fashion without first inquiring particularly whether it would not be injurious to the prosperity of the main and grand article of the english commerce the woollen manufacture  were this public spirit among us we need fear no upstart manufacture breaking in upon us whether printed linen or anything else for no people of sense having the good of their country at heart would touch it much less make it a general fashion but as the plan of english commerce observes our people the ladies especially have such a passion for the fashion that they have been the greatest enemies to our woollen manufacture and i must add that this passion for the fashion of printed linens at this time is a greater blow to the woollen manufacture of england than all the prohibitions in germany and italy of which we may have formed such frightful ideas in our minds or even than all the imitation of our manufactures abroad whether in france or any other part of europe  and yet to conclude all  how easy how very easy is it for us to prevent it which by the way deserves a whole book by itself   finis
