in naples    rollo in rome   illustration the mosaic shop see page 73     rollo in rome     chapter i  the diligence office   rollo went to rome in company with his uncle george from naples they went by the diligence which is a species of stage coach there are different kinds of public coaches that ply on the great thoroughfares in italy to take passengers for hire but the most common kind is the diligence  the diligences in france are very large and are divided into different compartments with a different price for each there are usually three compartments below and one above in the italian diligences however or at least in the one in which mr george and rollo travelled to rome there were only three first there was the interior or the body of the coach proper directly before this was a compartment with a glass front containing one seat only which looked forward there were of course places for three persons on this seat this front compartment is called the coupé1 it is considered the best in the diligence  footnote 1 pronounced coupay  there is also a seat up above the coupé in a sort of second story as it were and this was the seat which mr george and rollo usually preferred because it was up high where they could see better but for the present journey mr george thought the high seat which is called the banquette would not be quite safe for though it was covered above with a sort of chaise top still it was open in front and thus more exposed to the night air in ordinary cases he would not have been at all afraid of the night air but the country between naples and rome and indeed the country all about rome in every direction is very unhealthy so unhealthy is it in fact that in certain seasons of the year it is almost uninhabitable and it is in all seasons considered unsafe for strangers to pass through in the night unless they are well protected  there is in particular one tract called the pontine marshes where the road with a sluggish canal by the side of it runs in a straight line and on a dead level for about twenty miles it so happened that in going to rome by the diligence it would be necessary to cross these marshes in the night and this was an additional reason why mr george thought it better that he and rollo should take seats inside  the whole business of travelling by diligence in europe is managed in a very different way from stage coach travelling in america you must engage your place several days beforehand and when you engage it you have a printed receipt given you specifying the particular seats which you have taken and also containing on the back of it all the rules and regulations of the service the different seats in the several compartments of the coach are numbered and the prices of them are different rollo went so early to engage the passage for himself and mr george that he had his choice of all the seats he took nos 1 and 2 of the coupé he paid the money and took the receipt when he got home he sat down by the window while mr george was finishing his breakfast and amused himself by studying out the rules and regulations printed on the back of his ticket of course they were in italian but rollo found that he could understand them very well  if we are not there at the time when the diligence starts we lose our money uncle george said he it says here that they wont pay it back again  that is reasonable said mr george it will be our fault if we are not there  or our misfortune said rollo something might happen to us  true said mr george but the happening whatever it might be would be our misfortune and not theirs and so we ought to bear the loss of it  if the baggage weighs more than thirty rotolos we must pay extra for it continued rollo how much is a rotolo uncle george  i dont know said mr george but we have so little baggage that i am sure we cannot exceed the allowance  the baggage must be at the office two hours before the time for the diligence to set out continued rollo passing to the next regulation on his paper  what is that for asked mr george  so that they may have time to load it on the carriage they say said rollo  very well said mr george you can take it to the office the night before  they dont take the risk of the baggage said rollo or at least they dont guarantee it they say against unavoidable accidents or superior force what does that mean  why in case the diligence is struck by lightning and our trunk is burned up replied mr george or in case it is attacked by robbers and carried away they dont undertake to pay the damage  and in case of smarrimento continued rollo they say they wont pay damages to the amount of more than nine dollars and so forth what is a smarrimento uncle george  i dont know said mr george  it may mean a smashup said rollo  very likely said mr george  every traveller continued rollo looking again at his paper is responsible personally for all violations of the customhouse regulations or those of the police  thats all right said mr george  and the last regulation is said rollo that the travellers cannot smoke in the diligence nor take any dogs in  very well said mr george we have no dogs and we dont wish to smoke either in the diligence or any where else  they are very good regulations said rollo and so saying he folded up the paper and put it back into his wallet  on the evening before the day appointed for the journey rollo took the valise which contained the principal portion of his own and his uncles clothes and went with it in a carriage to the office mr george offered to accompany him but rollo said it was not necessary and so he took with him a boy named cyrus whom he had become acquainted with at the hotel  the carriage when it arrived at the diligence station drove in under an archway and entered a spacious court surrounded by lofty buildings there was a piazza with columns all around the court along this piazza on the four sides of the building were the various offices of the different lines of diligences with the diligences themselves standing before the doors  now cyrus said rollo we have got to find out which is our office  but rollo was saved any trouble on this score for the coachman drove the carriage directly to the door of the office for rome rollo had told him that that was his destination before leaving the hotel  there was a man in a sort of uniform at the door of the office rollo pointed to his valise and said in italian for rome tomorrow morning the man said very well and taking the valise out of the carriage he put it in the office then rollo and cyrus got into the carriage again and rode away  the next morning mr george and rollo went down to breakfast before six oclock while they were eating their breakfast the waiter came in with a cold roast chicken upon a plate which he set down upon the table  ah said mr george that is for us to eat on the way  dont the diligence stop somewhere for us to dine asked rollo  yes said mr george i presume it stops for us to dine but as we are going to be out all night i thought perhaps that we might want a supper towards morning besides having a supper will help keep us awake in going across the pontine marshes  must we keep awake asked rollo  so they say replied mr george they say you are more likely to catch the fever while you are asleep than while you are awake  i dont see why we should be said rollo  nor do i said mr george  if mr george really did not know or understand a thing he never pretended to know or understand it  it may be a mere notion said mr george but it is a very prevailing one at any rate so i thought it would be well enough for us to have something to keep us awake  we will take some bread and butter too said rollo  mr george said that that would be an excellent plan so they each of them cut one of the breakfast rolls which were on the table in two and after spreading the inside surfaces well with butter they put the parts together again the waiter brought them a quantity of clean wrapping paper and with this they wrapped up both the chicken and the rolls and rollo put the three parcels into his bag  and now said rollo what are we to do for drink  we might take some oranges suggested mr george  so we will said rollo i will go out into the square and buy some  rollo accordingly went out into the square and for what was equivalent to three cents of american money he bought six oranges he put the oranges into his pockets and returned to the hotel  he found mr george filling a flat bottle with coffee he had poured some coffee out of the coffee pot into the pitcher of hot milk which had still a considerable quantity of hot milk remaining in it and then after putting some sugar into it and waiting for the sugar to dissolve he had commenced pouring it into the flat bottle  illustration preparing for the journey  we may like a little coffee too said mr george as well as the oranges we can drink it out of my drinking cup  rollo put his oranges into mr georges bag for his own bag was now full when all was ready and the hotel bill was paid mr george and rollo got into a carriage which the waiter had sent for to come to the door and set off for the diligence office it was only half past seven when they arrived there rollo saw what time it was by the great clock which was put up on the front of one of the buildings towards the court yard  we are too early by half an hour said rollo  yes said mr george in travelling over new ground we must always plan to be too early or we run great risk of being too late  never mind said rollo i am glad that we are here before the time for now i can go around and see the other diligences getting ready to go off  so rollo began to walk about under the portico or piazza to the various diligences which were getting ready to set out on the different roads there was one where there was a gentleman and two ladies who were quite in trouble i suppose that among the girls who may read this book there may be many who may think that it must necessarily be a very agreeable thing to travel about europe and that if they could only gono matter under what circumstancesthey should experience an almost uninterrupted succession of pleasing sensations but the truth is that travelling in europe like every other earthly source of pleasure is very far from being sufficient of itself to confer happiness indeed under almost all the ordinary circumstances in which parties of travellers are placed the question whether they are to enjoy themselves and be happy on any particular day of their journey or to be discontented and miserable depends so much upon little things which they did not at all take into the account or even foresee at all in planning the journey that it is wholly uncertain when you look upon a party of travellers that you meet on the road whether they are really having a good time or not you cannot tell at all by the outward circumstances  there was a striking illustration of this in the case of the party that attracted rollos attention in the court of the diligence office the gentlemans name was howland one of the ladies was his young wife and the other lady was her sister the sisters name was louise mr howland intended to have taken the whole coupé for his party but when he went to the office the day before to take the places he found that one of the seats of the coupé had been engaged by a gentleman who was travelling alone  how unlucky said mr howland to himself we must have three seats and it wont do for us to be shut up in the interior for there we cannot see the scenery at all  so he went home and asked his wife what it would be best to do we cannot have three seats together said he unless we go up upon the banquette  but the bride said that she could not possibly ride on the banquette she could not climb up to such a high place  now mrs howlands real reason for not being willing to ride on the banquette was not the difficulty of climbing up for at all the diligence offices they have convenient step ladders for the use of the passengers in getting up and down the real reason was she thought it was not genteel to ride there and in fact it is not genteel there is no part of the diligence where people who attach much importance to the fashion of the thing are willing to go except the coupé  and we dont want to ride in the interior said mr howland  no said the bride that is worse than the banquette  nor to wait till another day added mr howland  no said mrs howland we must go tomorrow and we must have the coupé the gentleman who has engaged the third seat will give it up to us i am sure when he knows that it is to oblige a lady you can engage the two seats in the coupé and one more either on the banquette or in the interior and then when the time comes to set out we will get the gentleman to let us have his seat you can pay him the difference  but angelina said mr howland i should not like to ask such a thing of the gentleman he has taken pains to go a day or two beforehand to engage his seat so as to make sure of a good one and i dont think we ought to expect him to give it up to accommodate strangers  o he wont mind said mrs howland he would as lief change as not and if he wont we can arrange it in some way or other  so mr howland engaged the two places in the coupé and one on the banquette when the morning came he brought his two ladies to the diligence station in good season he was very unwilling to ask the gentleman to give up his seat but his wife who was a good deal accustomed to have her own way and who besides being now a bride considered herself specially entitled to indulgences declared that if her husband did not ask the gentleman she would ask him herself  very well said mr howland i will ask him then  so mr howland went to the gentleman and asked him he was standing at the time with his umbrella and walking stick in his hand near one of the pillars of the portico smoking a cigar he looked at mr howland with an expression of some surprise upon his countenance on hearing the proposition took one or two puffs from his cigar before replying and then said quietly that he preferred the seat that he had taken in the coupé  it would be a very great favor to us if you would exchange with us said mrs howland who had come up with her husband and stood near we are three and we want very much to be seated together we will very gladly pay the difference of the fare  the gentleman immediately on being thus addressed by mrs howland took the cigar out of his mouth raised his hat and bowed very politely  are you and this other lady the gentlemans party he asked  yes sir said mrs howland  then i cannot possibly think of giving up my seat in the coupé replied the gentleman i am a russian it is true but i am not a bear as i should very justly be considered if i were to leave a compartment in the coach when two such beautiful ladies as you were coming into it especially under the influence of any such consideration as that of saving the difference in the fare  the gentleman said this in so frank and goodnatured a way that it was impossible to take offence at it though mr howland felt that by making the request and receiving such a reply he had placed himself in a very ridiculous position  i prize my seat more than ever said the russian still addressing the ladies i prize it incalculably and so i cannot think of going up upon the banquette but if the gentleman will go up there i will promise to take the very best care of the ladies possible while they are in the coupé  mrs howland then took louise aside and asked in a whisper whether she should have any objection to ride in the interior in case mr howland could exchange the place on the banquette for one within louise was quite troubled that her sister should make such a proposal she said she should not like very well to go in there among so many strangers and in a place too where she could not see the scenery at all besides louise thought that it would have been more generous in angelina if she thought it necessary for one or the other of them to ride inside to have offered to take a seat there herself instead of putting it off upon her sister especially since it was not so proper she thought for her being a young lady to ride among strangers as for one who was married  mr howland then suggested that they should all ascend to the banquette the persons who had the other two seats there would of course be willing to change for the coupé or at least since the coupé was considered the best place there would be no indelicacy in asking them to do it  but the bride would not listen to this proposal she never could climb up there in the world she said  by this time the coach was ready and the conductor began to call upon the passengers to take their places so that there was no more time for deliberation they were all obliged to take their seats as the conductor called off the names from his way bill the two ladies entered the coupé in company with the russian while mr howland ascended by the step ladder to his seat on the banquette while the passengers were thus getting seated the postilions were putting in the horses and in a moment more the diligence set off  now here were four persons setting out on a pleasant morning in a good carriage to take the drive from naples to romeone of the most charming drives that the whole tour of europe affords and yet not one of them was in a condition to enjoy it every one was dissatisfied out of humor and unhappy the russian gentleman was displeased with mr howland for asking him to give up his seat and he felt uncomfortable and ill at ease in being shut up with two ladies who he knew were displeased with him for not giving it up the bride was vexed with the russian for insisting on his place in the coupé and with her sister for not being willing to go into the interior so that she might ride with her husband miss louise was offended at having been asked to sit in the interior which request she said to herself was only part of a systematic plan which her sister seemed to have adopted for the whole journey to make herself the principal personage in every thing and to treat her louise as if she was of no consequence whatever and last of all mr howland on the banquette above was out of humor with himself for having asked the russian to give up his seat and thus subjected himself to the mortification of a refusal and with his wife for having required him to ask it  thus they were all at heart uncomfortable and unhappy and as the horses trotted swiftly on along the smooth and beautiful road which traverses the rich campagna of naples on the way to capua the splendid scenery was wholly disregarded by every one of them  now it is very often so with parties travelling in europe the external circumstances are all perhaps extremely favorable and they are passing through scenes or visiting places which they have thought of and dreamed of at home with beating hearts for many years and yet now that the time has come and the enjoyment is before them there is some internal source of disquiet some mental vexation or annoyance some secret resentment or heartburning arising out of the circumstances in which they are placed or the relations which they sustain to one another which destroys their peace and quiet of mind and of course incapacitates them for any real happiness so that on the whole judging from what i have seen of tourists in europe i should say that those that travel do not after all in general really pass their time more happily than those who remain at home  i have two reasons for saying these things one is that those of you who have no opportunity to travel may be more contented to remain at home and not imagine that those of your friends who go abroad necessarily pass their time so much more happily than you do the other reason is that when you do travel either in our own country or in foreign lands you should be more reasonable and considerate and pay more regard to the wishes and feelings of others than travellers usually do most of the disquietudes and heartburnings which arise to mar the happiness of parties travelling come from the selfishness of our hearts which seems in some way or other to bring itself out more into view when we are on a long journey together than at any other time in the ordinary intercourse of life this selfishness is covered and concealed by the veil of politeness prescribed by the forms and usages of society this veil is however very thin and it soon disappears entirely in the familiar intercourse which is necessarily produced by the incidents and adventures of a journey in being daily and hourly with each other for a long time people appear just as they really are and unless they are really reasonable considerate and just towards one another they are sure sooner or later to disagree  but though the bridal party were very much out of humor with each other as we have seen mr george and rollo were entirely free from any such uneasiness they both felt very lighthearted and happy they rambled about the court yard till they had seen all that there was there to interest them and then they went to their own diligence they opened the coupé door and looked in  our seats are nos 1 and 2 said rollo  yes said mr george one of them is next the window and the other is in the middle you may get in first and take the seat by the window  no uncle george said rollo you had better have the seat by the window  we will take turns for that seat said mr george and you shall begin  mr george arranged it to have rollo take his turn first because he knew very well that in the beginning of a journey such a boy as rollo was always full of enthusiasm and excitement and that consequently he would enjoy riding at the window much more at first than at a later period so rollo got in and took his seat and mr george followed him in a very few minutes afterwards the postilions came out with the horses  but i have something particular to say about the postilions and the horses and i will say it in the next chapter     chapter ii  the journey   there are a great many curious things to be observed in travelling by the public conveyances on the continent of europe one is the way of driving the horses it is a very common thing to have them driven not by coachmen but by postilions there is a postilion for each pair of horses and he sits upon the nigh horse of the pair thus he rides and drives at the same time  in these cases there is no drivers seat in front of the coach or if there is a seat in front it is occupied by the passengers all the driving is done by the postilions  the postilions dress in a sort of livery which is quite gay in its appearance being trimmed with red the collars and the lapels of their jackets too are ornamented here and there with figures of stage horns and other emblems of their profession they also wear enormously long and stout boots these boots come up above their knees they carry only a short whip for they only have to whip the horse that they are upon and the one which is by the side of him and so they do not have to reach very far when there are four horses there are two postilions and when there are six three  a large diligence with six horses and a gayly dressed postilion mounted on one of the horses of each pair makes a very grand appearance you may depend in coming upon the gallop into the streets of a townthe postilions cracking their whips and making as much noise as they can and all the boys and girls of the street coming to the doors and windows to see  i am glad we are going to have postilions uncle george said rollo as they were getting into the coach  why asked mr george  because i like the looks of them said rollo and then we always go faster too when we have postilions besides when there is a seat for a driver on the coach it blocks up our front windows but now our windows are all clear  those are excellent reasonsall of them said mr george  the postilions did indeed drive very fast when they once got upon the road there was a delay of half an hour at the gate of the city for the examination of the passports during which time the postilions having dismounted from their horses stood talking together and playing off jokes upon each other at length when the passports were ready they sprang into their saddles and set the horses off upon the run  the road on leaving the gates entered a wide and beautiful avenue which was at this time filled with peasants coming into town for that day was market day in naples the people coming in were dressed in the most curious costumes multitudes were on foot others rode crowded together in donkey carts some rode on the backs of donkeys with a load of farming produce before or behind them the women in such cases sat square upon the donkeys back with both their feet hanging down on one side and they banged the donkey with their heels to make him get out of the way so that the diligence could go by  the country was very rich and beautiful and it was cultivated every where like a garden here and there were groves of mulberriesthe tree on which the silk worm feedsand there were vineyards with the vines just bursting into leaf and now and then a little garden of orange trees in the mean time the postilions kept cracking their whips and the horses galloped on at such a speed that rollo had scarcely time to see the objects by the road side they glided so swiftly by  wont the silk worms eat any kind of leaves but mulberry leaves he asked  no said mr george at least the mulberry silk worms will not there are a great many different kinds of silk worms in the world that is there are a great many different kinds of caterpillars that spin a thread and make a ball to wrap up their eggs in and each one lives on a different plant or tree if you watch the caterpillars in a garden you will see that each kind lives on some particular leaf and will not touch any other  yes said rollo we found a big caterpillar once on the caraway in our garden and we shut him up in a box in order to see what sort of a butterfly he would turn into and we gave him different kinds of leaves to eat but he would not eat any but caraway leaves  and what became of him at last asked mr george  o he turned into a butterfly said rollo first he turned into a chrysalis and then he turned into a butterfly  there are a great many different kinds of silk worms said mr george but in order to find one that can be made useful there are several conditions to be fulfilled  what do you mean by conditions to be fulfilled asked rollo  why i mean that there are several things necessary in order that the silk worm should be a good one to make silk from in the first place the fibre of the silk that he spins must be fine and also strong in the next place it must easily unwind from the cocoon then the animal must be a tolerably hardy one so as to be easily raised in great numbers then the plant or tree that it feeds upon must be a thrifty and hardy one and easily cultivated the mulberry silk worm has been found to answer to these conditions better than any hitherto known but there are some others that i believe they are now trying in order to see if they will not be better still they are looking about in all parts of the world to see what they can find  who are looking asked rollo  the society of acclimatation replied mr george that is a society founded in paris and extending to all parts of the world that is employed in finding new plants and new animals that can be made useful to man or finding some that are useful to man in one country and so introducing them into other countries they are trying specially to find new silk worms  there are some kinds of caterpillars in america said rollo that wind their silk up into balls i mean to get some of the balls when i go home and see if i can unwind them  that will be an excellent plan said mr george  if i can only find the end said rollo  there must be some art required to find the end rejoined mr george and then i believe there is some preparation which is necessary to make the cocoons unwind  i wish i knew what it was said rollo  you can inquire of some of the people when we stop to dine replied mr george  but i dont know enough italian for that said rollo  thats a pity said mr george  in the mean time the horses trotted and galloped on until they had gone about ten miles and then at length the postilions brought them up at the door of an inn in a village fresh horses were standing all ready at the door with new postilions the postilions that had been driving took out their horses and led them away and then came themselves to the window of the coupé and held out their caps for their buono mano as they call it that is for a small present  every body in italy who performs any service expects in addition to being paid the price regularly agreed upon for the service to receive a present greater or smaller according to the nature of the case this present is called the buono mano2  footnote 2 pronounced bono mahno  the postilions always expect a buono mano from the passengers in the stage coach especially from those who ride in the coupé  rollo gave them a few coppers each for himself and for mr george and just as he had done so a young man without any hat upon his head but with a white napkin under his arm came out of the hotel and advancing to the window of the coupé asked mr george and rollo in french if they wished to take any thing  no said mr george not any thing  yes uncle george said rollo let us go and see what they have got  he said this of course in english but immediately changing his language into french he asked the waiter what they could have  the waiter said that they could have some hot coffee there would not be time for any thing else  let us have some hot coffee uncle george said rollo eagerly  very well said mr george  so rollo gave the order and the waiter went into the house in a moment he returned with two cups of very nice coffee which he brought on a tray by this time however the fresh horses were almost harnessed so that it was necessary to drink the coffee quick but there was no difficulty in doing this for it was very nice and not too hot rollo had barely time to give back the cups and pay for the coffee before the diligence began to move the postilions started the horses with a strange sort of a cry that they uttered while standing beside them and then leaped into the saddles just as they were beginning to run  the journey was continued much in this way during the whole day the country was delightful the road was hard and smooth as a floor and the horses went very fast in a word rollo had a capital ride  after traversing a comparatively level country for some miles the road entered a mountainous region where there was a long ascent at the foot of this ascent was a post house and here they put on six horses instead of four of course there were now three postilions but although the country was mountainous the ascent was not steep for the road was carried up by means of long windings and zigzags in such a manner that the rise was very regular and gradual all the way the consequence was that the six horses took the diligence on almost as fast up the mountains as the four had done on the level ground  about five oclock in the afternoon the diligence made a good stop in order to allow the passengers to dine  we will go in and take dinner with the rest said mr george and so save the things that we have put up for a moonlight supper on the pontine marshes  yes said rollo i shall like that very much besides i want to go and take dinner with them here for i want to see how they do it  the place where the diligence stopped was a town called mola di gaeta it stood in a very picturesque situation near the sea for though the road in leaving naples had led at first into the interior of the country and had since been winding about among the mountains it had now come down again to the margin of the sea  the entrance to the hotel was under a great archway there were doors to the right and left from this archway leading to staircases and to apartments the passengers from the diligence were conducted through one of these doors into a very ancient looking hall where there was a table set for dinner with plates enough for twenty personsthat being about the number of passengers contained in the various compartments of the diligence  on the opposite side of the arched way was a door leading to another hall where there was a table set for the conductor and the postilions  after waiting a few minutes the company of passengers took their seats at the table besides the plates for the guests there was a row of dishes extending up and down the middle of the table containing apples pears oranges nuts raisins little cakes and bonbons of various kinds there were also in this row two vases containing flowers  excepting these fruits and sweetmeats there was nothing eatable upon the table when the guests sat down it is not customary in european dinners to put any thing upon the table except the dessert  the other dishes are brought round and presented one by one to each guest first came the soup when the soup had been eaten and the soup plates had been removed then there was boiled beef the beef was upon two dishes one for each side of the table it was cut very nicely in slices and each dish had a fork and a spoon in it for the guests to help themselves with the dishes were carried along the sides of the table by the waiters and offered to each guest the guests helping themselves in succession to such pieces as they liked  after the beef had been eaten the plates were all changed and then came a course of fried potatoes then after another change of plates a course of mutton chops then green peas then roast beef then cauliflower with drawn butter then roast chicken with salad and lastly some puddings for each separate article of all this dinner there was a fresh plate furnished to each guest  after the pudding plates were removed small plates for the dessert were furnished and then the fruit and the nuts and the bonbons were served and the dinner was over  for every two guests there was a decanter of wine at least it was what they called wine though in taste it was more like sour cider the people generally used it by pouring a little of it into their water  when the dinner was over the passengers all paid the amount that was charged for it and each gave besides a buono mano to the waiter who had waited upon his side of the table by this time the diligence was ready and they all went and took their seats in it again  the sun was now going down and in the course of an hour the last of its rays were seen gilding the summits of the mountains soon afterwards the evening began to come on  before a great while said mr george we shall begin to draw near to the frontier  yes said rollo the frontier between the kingdom of naples and the dominions of the pope they will examine the baggage there i suppose  no said mr george they will not examine the baggage till we get to rome  i thought they always examined the baggage at the frontier when we came into any new country said rollo  they do said mr george unless the baggage is under the charge of public functionaries and then to save time they often take it into the capital and examine it there i asked one of the passengers at the dinner table and he said that the trunks were not to be opened till we get to rome  they will examine the passports i suppose said rollo  yes replied mr george they will undoubtedly examine the passports at the frontier  you cannot pass from one country in europe to another any where without stopping at the last military station of the country that you leave to have your passport examined and stamped in token of permission given you to go out and also at the first military station of the country which you are about to enter to have them examined and stamped again in token of permission to come in all this as you may suppose is very troublesome besides that there are fees to pay which in the course of a long journey amount to a considerable sum  besides the passport business which was to be attended to there was a grand change of the diligence establishment at the frontier the coach itself which came from naples and also the conductor and postilions were all left at the border and the passengers were transferred to a new turnout which came from rome indeed there was a double change for the roman diligence brought a load of passengers from rome to meet the neapolitan one at the border and thus each company of travellers had to be transferred to the establishment belonging to the country which they were entering  this change was made in a post house in a solitary place near the frontier it caused a detention of nearly an hour there were so many formalities to go through it was late in the evening and the work was done by the light of torches and lanterns the two diligences were backed up against each other and then all the trunks and baggage were transferred from the top of one coach to the top of the other without being taken down at all the baggage in these diligences is always packed upon the top  you would think that this would make the coach top heavy and so it does in some degree but then the body of the coach below is so large and heavy that the extra weight above is well counterpoised and then besides the roads are so smooth and level and withal so hard that there is no danger of an upset  the work of shifting the baggage from one diligence to the other was performed under an archway there was a door leading from this archway into a large office where the two companies of passengers were assembled waiting for the coaches to be ready all these passengers were loaded with carpet bags knapsacks valises bundles of umbrellas and canes and other such light baggage which they had had with them inside the coaches many of them were sitting on chairs and benches around the sides of the room with their baggage near them others were walking about the room changing money with each other that is those that were going from rome to naples were changing the roman money which they had left for neapolitan money the money of one of these countries does not circulate well in the other country in the middle of the room was a great table where the conductors and other officials were at work with papers and accounts rollo could not understand what they were doing  rollo walked about the office looking at the different passengers and observing what was going on while mr george remained near the coaches to watch the transfer of the baggage  i want to be sure said mr george that our trunk is there and that they shift it over to the roman coach  they are changing money inside said rollo have you got any that you want to have changed  no said mr george i did not know that we could change here and i calculated closely and planned it so as not to have any of the naples money left  i have got only two or three pieces said rollo and those i am going to carry home to america for coins  at length the changes were completed and mr george and rollo and also all the other passengers who had come in the diligence from naples began to take their places in the coach for rome while at the same time the other company got into the naples coach which was now going to return the conductor came for his buono mano the new horses were harnessed in the postilions leaped into the saddles and thus both parties set out upon their night ride it was not far from nine oclock  illustration the pontine marshes  and now said mr george before a great while we shall come upon the pontine marshes  the pontine marshes form an immense tract of low and level land which have been known and celebrated in history for nearly two thousand years though called marshes they are so far drained by ancient canals that the land is firm enough for grass to grow upon it and for flocks of sheep and herds of cattle to feed but yet it is so low and so unhealthy that it is utterly uninhabitable by man the extent of these marshes is immense the road traverses them in a direct line and on a perfect level for twentyfive or thirty miles without passing a single habitation except the post houses and in the middle a solitary inn  and yet there is nothing desolate or dreary in the aspect of the pontine marshes on the contrary the view on every side in passing across them is extremely beautiful the road is wide and smooth and level and is bordered on each side with a double row of very ancient and venerable trees which give to it for the whole distance the character of a magnificent avenue think of a broad and handsome avenue running straight as an arrow for twentyfive miles  beyond the trees on one side there is a wide canal this canal runs parallel to the road and you often meet boats coming or going upon it beyond the canal and beyond the trees on the other side there extends as far as the eye can reach one vast expanse of living green as smooth and beautiful as can be imagined this immense tract of meadow is divided here and there by hedges or palings and now and then a pretty grove appears to vary the scene immense flocks of sheep and herds of horses and cattle are seen feeding every where and sometimes herdsmen on horseback galloping to and fro attending to their charge  mr george and rollo had had a fine opportunity to see the scenery of the pontine marshes when they came to naples for then they crossed them by day light now however it was night and there was not much to be seen except the gnarled and venerable trunks of the trees on each side of the road as the light of the diligence lanterns flashed upon them  the postilions drove exceedingly fast all the way over the marshes the stage stopped three times to change horses mr george kept up a continual conversation with rollo all the way in order to prevent him from going to sleep for as i have said before it is considered dangerous to sleep while on the marshes  about midnight rollo proposed that they should eat their supper  no said mr george we will keep our supper for the last thing as long as we can keep awake without it we will  so they went on for two hours longer about one oclock the moon rose and the moonbeams shining in through the windows of the coupé enlivened the interior very much  the moonlight makes it a great deal pleasanter said rollo  yes said mr george and it will make it a great deal more convenient for us to eat our supper  the diligence stopped at a post house to change horses a little before two and immediately after it set out again mr george said that it was time for them to take their supper so rollo opened the two bags and took out from one the chicken and the two rolls and from the other the bottle of coffee and the oranges he placed the things as he took them out in a large pocket before him in the front of the coupé mr george took two newspapers out of his knapsack one for rollo and one for himself to spread in their laps while they were eating then with a sharp blade of his pocket knife he began to carve the chicken  the chicken was very tender and the rolls were very nice and as moreover both the travellers were quite hungry they found the supper in all respects excellent for drink they had the juice of the oranges to drink this juice they cut a round hole in one end of the orange and then run the blade of the knife in in all directions so as to break up the pulp they could then drink out the juice very conveniently  at the close of the supper they drank the coffee the coffee was cold it is true but it was very good and it made an excellent ending to the meal  they made the supper last as long as possible in order to occupy the time it was three oclock before it was finished and the papers cleared away at half past three rollo in looking out at the window saw a sort of bank by the side of the road and on observing attentively he perceived that there was a curve in the road itself before them  uncle george said he we have got off the marshes  i verily believe we have said mr george  so now we may go to sleep said rollo  yes said mr george ill lay my head over into the corner and you may lie against my shoulder  so mr george and rollo placed themselves in as comfortable a position as possible and composed themselves to sleep they slept several hours waking up or rather half waking up once during the interval while the diligence stopped for the purpose of changing horses when they finally awoke the sun was up high and was shining in quite bright through the coupé windows     chapter iii  the arrival at rome   when mr george and rollo awoke from their sleep they found that they were coming into the environs of rome the country was green and beautiful but it seemed almost uninhabited and in every direction were to be seen immense ruins of tombs and aqueducts and other such structures now gone to decay there was an ancient road leading out of rome in this direction called the appian way it was by this road that the apostle paul travelled in making his celebrated journey to rome after appealing from the jewish jurisdiction to that of cæsar indeed the appii forum and the three taverns places mentioned in the account of this journey contained in the acts were on the very road that mr george and rollo had been travelling in their journey from naples to rome  the remains of the appian way are still to be traced for many miles south of rome the road was paved in ancient times with very large blocks of an exceedingly hard kind of stone these stones were of various shapes but they were fitted together and flattened on the top and thus they made a very smooth and at the same time a very solid pavement in many places along the appian way this old pavement still remains and is as good as ever  at length the diligence arrived at the gate of the city it passed through an arched gateway leading through an ancient and very venerable wall and then stopped at the door of a sort of office just within there were two soldiers walking to and fro before the office  what are we stopping for here asked rollo  for the passports i suppose said mr george  the conductor of the diligence came to the door of the coupé and asked for the passports mr george gave him his and rollos and the conductor carried them together with those which he had obtained from the other passengers into the office he then ordered the postilions to drive on  how shall we get our passports again asked rollo  we must send for them to the police office i suppose said mr george  it is very customary in the great capitals of europe for the police to take the passports of travellers on their arrival at the gates of the city and direct them to send for them at the central police office on the following day  after passing the gate the diligence went on a long way through a great many narrow streets leading into the heart of the city there was nothing in these streets to denote the ancient grandeur of rome excepting now and then an old and venerable ruin standing neglected among the other buildings  rollo however in looking out at the windows of the coupé saw a great many curious sights as the diligence drove along among these one of the most remarkable was a procession of people dressed in a most fantastic manner and wearing masks which entirely concealed their faces there were two round holes in the masks for the eyes mr george told rollo that these were men doing penance they had been condemned to walk through the streets in this way as a punishment for some of their sins  why they treat them just as if they were children said rollo  they are children said mr george in every thing but years  illustration doing penance  not long after this rollo saw a very magnificent carriage coming along it was perfectly resplendent with crimson and gold the horses too and the coachman and the footmen were gorgeously caparisoned and apparelled in the same manner  rollo pointed it out to mr george mr george said it was a cardinals carriage  i wish the cardinal was in it said rollo i would like to have seen him  i presume he would have looked very much like any other man replied mr george  yes but he would have been dressed differently wouldnt he  perhaps so said mr george  perhaps he would have had his red hat on said rollo i should like to see a cardinal wearing his red hat  the badge of the cardinals office is a hat and dress of a red color  at length the diligence passed under an archway which led into a large open court similar to the one in naples where the journey had been commenced the passengers got out the horses were unharnessed and the baggage was taken down the trunks were all taken into an office pertaining to the custom house to be examined by the officers there in order to see whether there were any contraband goods in them  mr george unlocked his trunk and lifted up the lid an officer came up to the place and patting with his hand upon the top of the clothes as if to prevent mr george from lifting them up to show what was below he said  very well very well it is sufficient  so saying he shut down the top of the trunk again and marked it passed he then touched his hat and asked mr george if he would make some small present for the benefit of the custom house officers  that is to say he evaded the performance of his duty as an officer of the customs in expectation that the traveller would pay him for his delinquency most travellers are very willing to pay in such cases they have various articles in their trunks which they have bought in other countries and which strictly speaking are subject to duty in entering rome and they are willing to pay a fee rather than to have their trunks overhauled others of more sturdy morality refuse to pay these fees they consider them as of the nature of bribes so they say to the officers  examine the baggage as much as you please and if you find any duties due i will pay them but i will not pay any bribes  now rollo said mr george when he had got possession of his trunk we want a carriage to take us and the baggage to the hotel you may go and see if you can find one and i will stay here and look after the baggage engage the carriage by the hour  so rollo went out of the court and soon found a carriage before he got into it he said to the coachman  per hora  this means by the hour  at the same time rollo held up his watch to the coachman in order to let him see what oclock it was  si signore said the coachman  si signore is the italian for yes sir  rollo could not say in italian where he wished the coachman to go and so he stood up in the carriage and pointed following his indications the coachman drove in through the archway to the court of the post office where he found mr george waiting the trunk and the bags were put upon the carriage in front and mr george got in with rollo  hotel damerique said mr george to the coachman  si signore said the coachman and immediately he began to drive away  the hotel damerique was the one where mr george had concluded to go he had found the name and a description of this hotel in his guide book  why did you want me to take the carriage by the hour asked rollo  because it is very probable said mr george that we shall not get in at the hotel damerique and in that case we shall have to go to other hotels and unless we take him by the hour he would charge a course for every hotel that we go to and the charge even for two courses is more than for an hour  the event showed that mr george was right in his calculations the hotel damerique was full the waiter who came out as soon as he saw the carriage stop at the door told mr george this in french  then please tell our coachman said mr george to drive us to any other principal hotel that is near here and if that is full to another and so on until he finds a good place where they can take us in  mr george said this of course in french the waiter delivered the message to the coachman in italian  yes said the coachman to himself that ill do but i shall take good care that you dont find any place where you can get in this two hours if i can help it  the reason why the coachman did not wish that his travellers should find a hotel soon was of course because he wished to earn as much money as possible by driving them about  he immediately began to think what hotels would be most likely to be full and drove first to those the first of all was a hotel situated quite near one of the gates of the city the one where the principal entrance is for all travellers coming from the north it is called the gate of the peopleor in italian porto del popolo the gate opens into a large triangular space which is called the piazza del popolo piazza3 in italian means a public square  footnote 3 pronounced piatza  this piazza del popolo is one of the most celebrated places in rome there are three streets that radiate from it directly through the heart of the town between the centre and the two side streets at the corners where they come out upon the square are two churches exactly alike they are called sometimes the twin churches on this account  the piazza del popolo is a great place for public parades on one side is a high ascent with a broad expanse of gardens upon the top and zigzag roads handsomely walled up and ornamented with statues and fountains and with marble seats placed here and there for foot passengers to rest themselves upon when ascending  every year at the end of what they call holy week they have a great celebration of fireworks from the side of this hill and from the terrace above and then all the people assemble in the piazza below to witness them  but i must go back to mr george and rollo the coachman stopped at a large hotel fronting upon this square on inquiring at the bureau on the continent of europe they call an office a bureau mr george found that all the rooms were occupied except one large apartment of four rooms this was of course more than mr george wanted  at the next hotel where the coachman stopped there were no rooms at all vacant and at the next only one small room with a single narrow bed in it  if we cant find any other said rollo we will come back and take this and i will sleep on the floor  o no said mr george  why uncle george said rollo i can make it very comfortable on the floor by rolling up two coats or cloaks into two long rolls and wedging them in under me one on one side of me and the other on the other and then putting a carpet bag under my head for a pillow it feels just as if you were in a good bed  mr george smiled and got into the carriage again and the coachman drove on  after a while he stopped at the door of a hotel which stood in rather a retired place among narrow streets though there was an open space in front of it mr george inquired for rooms here and the waiter said that they had one left  are there two beds in it asked mr george  no sir said the waiter but we can put two beds in would you like to go and see it sir  no said mr george i will take it without going to see it it is the best that we can do  so the porter of the hotel took off the baggage while mr george paid the coachman for an hour and a half of time mr george and rollo then followed the porter to their room in order to reach it they had to ascend several stories up massive staircases of stone and then to go out to the extreme end of a long corridor the room when they came to it proved to be quite small and there was but one bed in it there was however room for another and the waiter who had followed them up said that he would cause another one to be put in without any delay     chapter iv  a ramble   and now uncle george said rollo well get ready and then the first thing that we will do will be to go down into the dining room and get some breakfast  why we have had our breakfast already said mr george we had it at two oclock this morning on the pontine marshes  o no said rollo that was our supper for last night  very well said mr george we will have some breakfast you may go down and order it as soon as you are ready i will come down by the time that it is on the table  what shall i order asked rollo  whatever you please said mr george  accordingly rollo as soon as he was ready went down stairs and looking about in the entrance hall he saw a door with the words table dhÔte in gilt letters over it  ah said he to himself this is the place  he opened the door and found himself in a long narrow room which seemed however more like a passage way than like a room there was a sort of rack on one side of it for hats and coats there were several pictures in this room with prices marked upon them as if they were for sale and also a number of very pretty specimens of marble and inlaid paper weights and models of columns temples and ruins of various kinds and other such curiosities as are kept every where in rome to sell to visitors rollo looked at all these things as he passed through the room considering as he examined them whether his uncle george would probably wish to buy any of them  one of them was a model of a column with a spiral line of sculptures extending from the base to the summit these sculptures represented figures of men and horses sometimes in battle sometimes crossing bridges and sometimes in grand processions entering a town  this must be a model of some old column in rome i suppose said rollo to himself perhaps i shall find it some time or other when i am rambling about the streets but now i must go and see about breakfast  so saying rollo passed on to the end of the passage way where there was a door with curtains hanging before it he pushed these curtains aside opened the door and went in he found himself ushered into a dining room with a long table extending up and down the centre of it there was a row of massive columns on each side of the table which supported the vaultings of the ceiling above in different parts of this table there were small parties of gentlemen and ladies engaged in taking late breakfasts  rollo walked down on one side of the table there was on that side a party consisting of a lady and gentleman with two children a girl and a boyall dressed in such a manner as to give them a foreign air the gentleman was speaking to the waiter in french when rollo passed by the party the boy was sitting next to one of the great pillars these pillars were so near the table that each one of them took the place of a seat  rollo walked on and took his seat next beyond the pillar of course the pillar was between him and the boy  in a few minutes a waiter came to ask what rollo would have for breakfast he asked in french rollo gave an order for breakfast for two he said that his uncle would be down in a few minutes  very well sir said the waiter  as soon as the waiter had gone rollo looked round the other way and he saw that the other boy was peeping at him from behind the pillar the boy laughed when he caught rollos eye and rollo laughed too the boy seemed to be about nine years old  a moment afterwards the boy began to peep at rollo from behind the pillar on the back side and then again on the front side thus playing a sort of bopeep in this way in a few minutes the two boys began to feel quite acquainted with each other without however having spoken a word they would perhaps have continued this game longer but just at this moment the breakfast for the party came in and the boy set himself at work eating a warm roll buttered and drinking his coffee  can you speak french asked rolloof course speaking french himself in asking the question  yes said the boy but not very well  then said rollo to himself he cannot be a french boy perhaps he is an italian boy  italian asked rollo  no said the boy not at all all i know of italian is grazia4  footnote 4 pronounced gratzia  what does that mean asked rollo  it means thank you said the boy  he must be a german boy i think said rollo to himself  after pausing a moment rollo ventured to ask the boy what his name was  charles beekman said the boy he pronounced the name in so english a fashion that rollo perceived at once that he must speak english so he changed from french to english himself and said  so you are an english boy  no said charles im an american boy  rollo here laughed outright to think how much trouble they had both been taking to speak to each other in french each supposing the other to be some outlandish foreigner when after all they were both americans and could talk perfectly well together in their own mother tongue such adventures as these however are very frequently met with in travelling in foreign countries  after finding that they could both speak english the two boys talked with each other like old friends for some minutes and at length finding that the pillar between them was very much in the way charles with his mothers permission moved his seat round to rollos side of it rollo himself moving to the next chair to make room for him mrs beekman readily consented to this having first observed that rollo appeared to be a boy of agreeable and gentlemanly manners and demeanor  when mr george at length came down he was at first quite surprised to find that rollo had thus obtained a companion but before the breakfast was completed he had become quite well acquainted with the beekman family himself towards the end of the breakfast rollo said that he was going out to take a walk and he asked mrs beekman to let charles go with him mr george was going to finish some letters in his room and was then going to the post office and to the bankers where rollo did not particularly wish to go  it will be better for you and me to go out and take a walk by ourselves said he to charles if your mother is willing  yes said mrs beekman i am willing only you must take care and not get lost  o no said rollo ill take care of that besides if we should get lost i know exactly what to do  what would you do asked mr beekman  i would just take a carriage replied rollo and order the coachman to drive right to the hotel  very good said mr beekman that would do very well  accordingly after breakfast mr george went to his room to finish his letters while rollo and charlie set out on their walk to see what they could see of rome  rollos plan of taking a carriage in case of getting lost in a strange city and ordering the coachman to drive to the hotel is a very excellent one but one thing is quite essential to the success of it and that is that the person lost should know the name of his hotel unfortunately rollo was going out without this requisite neither he himself nor mr george had observed the name of the hotel where the coachman whom they had employed on their arrival had finally left them and in going out rollo forgot to observe what it was he did not even take notice of the name of the street he did observe however that the hotel had a small open space like a square before it with a fountain on one side the water from the fountain flowed into a small stone basin with curious figures sculptured on the side of it  let us go and look at this basin said charles and see if it would not be a good place for us to sail little boats  the basin was in a cool and pleasant place being overshadowed by the drooping branches of a great tree rollo however did not wish to stay by it long  let us go now and see the streets of rome said he we can come out and look at this basin at any time  so the two boys walked along paying little attention to the direction in which they were going  we shall find some of the great streets pretty soon said rollo and then we will take an observation  what do you mean by that asked charles  why we will take particular notice of some great building or something else that is remarkable where we come out into the street and by that means we shall be able to find our way back to the hotel  yes said charles that will be an excellent plan  so the boys went on and presently they came out into what seemed to be quite a busy street it was not very wide but it was bordered with gaylooking shops on each side these shops were for the sale of models specimens of marbles etruscan vases mosaics cameos and other such things which are sold to visitors in rome the number of mosaics and cameos was very great they were displayed in little show cases placed outside the shops under the windows and before the doors so that people could examine them as they walked along  o what a quantity of mosaics and cameos exclaimed rollo  what are mosaics and cameos asked charles  as perhaps some of the readers of this book may not know precisely the meaning of these words i will here explain to them as rollo did to charles how mosaics and cameos are made  in the first place in respect to cameos imagine a small flat piece of stone of different colors on the two sides say white and black we will suppose that the white extends half through the thickness of the stone and that the remaining part of the thickness is black stones are often found with such a division of colors not only white and black but of all other hues  now the artist takes such a stone as this and marks out some design upon one side of it say upon the white side perhaps the design may be the figure of a man then he cuts away all the white of the stone except the figure and the result is that he has the figure of the man or whatever else his design may be in white on a black ground and the whole in one piece of stone all solid  besides stone shell is often used for cameos many shells being pink or of some other such color on the inside and white towards the outside in such a case the figures of the design would be pink or whatever else the color of the stone might be on a white ground  the artists of rome are celebrated for making beautiful cameos both in shell and in stone the figures are very nicely drawn and are very beautifully cut and when finished are set as pins bracelets and other ornaments  the mosaics on the other hand are made in a very different way in these the design is represented by different colored stones or bits of glass worked in together with great care in an opening made in the material serving for the groundwork rollo and charlie went into one of the shops and saw a man making one of these mosaics he was working at a table on one side was a small painting on a card which was his model he was copying this painting in mosaic the bits of glass that he was working with were in the form of slender bars not much larger than a stiff bristle they were of all imaginable colorsthe several colors being each kept by itself in the divisions of a box on the table the man took up these bars one by one and broke off small pieces of them of the colors that he wanted with a pair of pincers and set them into the work he put them in perpendicularly and the lower ends went into some soft composition placed there to receive and hold them the upper ends of course came together at the surface of the work  the man who was making the mosaic told rollo that as soon as he had finished placing the pieces for the whole design he should grind off the surface so as to make it smooth and polish it it would then have the appearance of a painted picture  you would think that as the colors of the design are thus represented by separate pieces of glass put in one after the other the result would be a sort of mottled appearance or at least that the gradations of hue would be sharp and harsh in their effect but it is not so the pieces are so small and the different shades succeed each other so regularly that when viewed from the ordinary distance the junctions disappear altogether and the shades mingle and blend together in the softest and most perfect manner  the mosaic which the workman was making in the shop where rollo and charles went in was a small one intended to form part of a bracelet there were however some in the same shop that were quite large they were framed like pictures and were hanging up against the wall indeed there was nothing but the circumstance that they were in a mosaic shop to denote that they were not pictures beautifully painted in oil one was a landscape another was a portrait of a beautiful girl another was a basket of fruit and flowers  in some of the churches of rome there are mosaics of very large size which are exact and beautiful copies of some of the most celebrated paintings in the world strangers coming into the churches and looking at these pictures never imagine them to be mosaics and when they are told that they are so they can scarcely believe the story but on examining them very near or in looking at them through an opera glassfor sometimes you cannot get very near themyou can easily see the demarcations between the little stones  it is a very curious circumstance that the most ancient pictures in the churches of rome and italy are mosaics and not paintings mosaics seem to have come first in the history of art and paintings followed in imitation of them indeed the arranging of different colored stones in a pavement or in a floor so as to represent some ornamental design would naturally be the first attempt at decoration made in the construction of buildings then would follow casing the walls with different colored marbles arranged in pretty ways and finally the representation of men and animals would be attempted this we find from an examination of ancient monuments was the actual course of things and painting in oil came in at the end as an imitation of pictures in stone  rollo and charles were induced to go into the mosaic shop by the invitation of the workman whose table as it happened stood near the door he saw the two boys looking in somewhat wistfully as they went by and he invited them to walk in he saw at once from their appearance that they were visitors that had just arrived in town and though he did not expect that they would buy any of his mosaics themselves he thought that there might be ladies in their party who would come and buy if he treated the boys politely it was on that account that he invited them to come in and when they had looked about the establishment as much as they wished and were ready to go away he gave them each one of his cards and asked them to give the cards to the ladies of their party  but there are no ladies of my party said rollo  who is of your party asked the workman  only a young gentleman said rollo  o very well rejoined the man that will do just as well he will certainly wish to buy mosaics while he is in rome for some of the young ladies of his acquaintance  i think that is very doubtful said rollo but nevertheless i will give him the card  so rollo and charles bade the mosaic man good by and went away  they had been so much interested in what they had seen in the mosaic shop and their attention now that they had left it was so much occupied with looking at the display of mosaics and cameos which they saw in the little show cases along the street that rollo forgot entirely his resolve to take an observation so as not to lose his way the boys walked on together until they came to a long and straight though not very wide street which was so full of animation and bustle and was bordered moreover on each side by so many gay looking shops that rollo said he was satisfied it must be one of the principal streets of the town  it was in fact the principal street in the town the street is called the corso it runs in a straight line from the porto del popolo which i have already described into the very heart of the city it is near the inner end of this street that the great region of ancient ruins begins  rollo and charles began to walk along the corso looking at the shops as they went on they were obliged however to walk in the middle of the street for the sidewalks where there were any were so narrow and irregular as to be of very little service indeed almost all the pedestrians walked in the middle of the street now and then a carriage came along it is true but the people in that case opened to the right and left and let it go by  after going on for some distance charles began to look about him somewhat uneasily  rollo said he are you sure that we can find our way home again  o i forgot about the way home said rollo but never mind i can find it easily enough i can inquire what is the name of the hotel  i dont know said charles  dont know repeated rollo in a tone of surprise dont know the name of the hotel where you are lodging  no said charles we only came last night and i dont know the name of the hotel at all  nor of the street that it is in asked rollo  no said charles  then said rollo in rather a desponding tone i dont know what we shall do  just then a carriage was seen coming along and rollo and charles who had stopped suddenly in the middle of the street in their surprise and alarm were obliged to run quick to get out of the way the carriage was a very elegant one in red and gold and there were two elegantly dressed footmen standing behind  that must be a cardinals carriage said rollo when the carriage had gone by  how do you know asked charles  uncle george told me about them said rollo you see rome and all the country about here is under the government of the pope and the chief officers of his government are the cardinals and uncle george told me that they ride about in elegant carriages in red and gold very splendid and gay we saw one of them too when we were coming into town  charles watched the carriage a minute or two until it had gone some distance away and then turning to rollo again he said  and how about finding our way home again rollo  ah said rollo in regard to that i dont know we shall have to take a carriage when we want to go home so we may as well go on and have our walk out we are lost now and we cant be any more lost go where we will  so the boys walked on presently they came to a large square with an immense column standing in the centre of it this column was so similar to the little model which rollo had seen at the hotel that he exclaimed at once that it was the same it had a spiral line of sculptures winding round and round it from the base to the summit the figures however were very much corroded and worn away as were indeed all the angles and edges of the base and of the capital of the column by the tooth of time the column had been standing there for eighteen or twenty centuries  i saw a model of that very column said rollo in a little room at the hotel it is the column of trajan ill prove it to you  so rollo asked a gentleman who was standing on the sidewalk with a murrays guide book in his hand and who rollo knew by that circumstance was an english or american visitor if that was not the column of trajan  no said the gentleman it is the column of antonine  rollo looked somewhat abashed at receiving this answer which turned his attempt to show off his learning to charles into a ridiculous failure  i thought it was called the column of trajan said he  the gentleman who as it happened was an englishman made no reply to this observation but quietly took out an opera glass from a case which was strapped over his shoulder and began studying the sculptures on the column  so rollo and charles walked away  i believe the name of it is the column of trajan said rollo for i saw the name of it on the model at the hotel that man has just come and he dont know  are you sure it is the same column suggested charles  yes said rollo for it was exactly of that shape and it had the same spiral line of images going round and round it and a statue on the top see how old and venerable it looks it was built almost two thousand years ago  what did they build it for asked charles  why i dont know exactly said rollo looking a little puzzled for ornament i suppose  but i dont see much ornament said charles in a big column standing all by itself and with nothing for it to keep up  but it has something to keep up rejoined rollo dont you see there is a statue on the top of it  if thats what it is to keep up said charles i dont see any sense in making the column so tall as to hold up the statue so high that we cant see it  nor i said rollo but they often made tall columns like these in ancient times  after rambling about a short time longer the boys came to another open space where there was a second column very similar in appearance to the first  ah said rollo perhaps this is the column of trajan  rollo was right this time there are several large columns standing among the ruins of rome and among them are two with spiral lines of sculpture around them which are extremely similar to each other and it is not at all surprising that rollo was at first deceived by the resemblance between them  these columns were built in honor of the victories of great generals and the spiral lines of sculptures were representations of their different exploits the statue upon the top of the column was originally that of the man in whose honor the column was erected but in the case of the roman columns these original statues have been taken down and replaced by bronze images of saints or of the virgin mary  near the column of trajan was a large sunken space in the middle of the square with a railing around it in the bottom of this sunken space was a pavement which looked very old and rising from it were rows of columns with the tops broken off the old pavement was eight or ten feet below the level of the street  this must be some old ruin or other said rollo a temple perhaps  only i do not see said charles why they built their temples down so low  nor do i said rollo  but rollo said charles i think it is time for us to begin to try to find our way home i dont see how you are going to find the way at all  if i only knew the name of the hotel or even the name of the street said rollo i should know at once what to do     chapter v  getting lost   and now said rollo the first thing is to find somebody that can speak french or english for us to inquire of  what good will that do asked charles as long as we dont know what to ask them for  true said rollo thats a real difficulty i wish we just knew the name of the hotel at any rate we will walk along until we find a carriage and i will be thinking what we had better do  the boys walked along together charles kept silence so as not to interrupt rollo in his thinking  all i know said rollo after a short pause is that the long straight street that we came through is the corso i have heard of that street before if we could only find our way to the corso i believe that i could follow it along and at last find the mosaic shop and so get back to our hotel  very well said charles let us try  or we might get into a carriage said rollo and direct the coachman which way to drive by pointing  so we could said charles and i should like that for i am tired of walking so much  then we will get a carriage said rollo we will take the first one that we see you shall get inside and i will mount upon the box with the coachman and show him which way to go  no said charles we will both get inside for we can stand up there and point  so we can said rollo  there are carriages to be found almost every where in the streets of rome especially in the neighborhood of the most interesting ruins it was not long before rollo and charles came in sight of one the coachman was looking toward them and was cracking his whip to attract their attention  rollo and charles walked directly towards the spot and rollo taking out his watch and showing the coachman what oclock it was said  per hora  this was to notify the coachman that he took the carriage by the hour  si signore said the coachman and then rollo and charles got in  the carriage was entirely openthe top being turned backso that it afforded an uninterrupted view in every direction and also by standing up and pointing forward the boys could easily indicate to the coachman which way they wished him to drive rollo however in the first instance directed him in words to drive to the corso  si signore said the coachman and so he drove on  the boys sat in the carriage or stood up to look back at the various objects of interest that attracted them as they passed the scenes through which the driver took them seemed very strange every thing in rome was strange to them and their course now lay through a part of the city which they had not been in before their attention was continually attracted first upon this side of the carriage and then upon the other as they rode along and they pointed out to each other the remarkable objects they were passing  the driver meanwhile upon his seat drove on entirely indifferent to it all the scenes that were so new to the boys were perfectly familiar to him  illustration riding among the ruins  he soon entered a region of dark crooked and winding alleys where rollo said that he and charles could never have found their way if they had undertaken it alone they frequently passed portions of old ruins in some places these ruins consisted of columns standing alone or immense fragments of broken arches that had fallen down and now lay neglected upon the ground in other places the remains of ancient temples stood built in with the houses of the street with market women at their stalls below forming a strange and incongruous spectacle of ancient magnificence and splendor surrounded and overwhelmed with modern poverty and degradation as the carriage drove through these places rollo and charles stood up in it supporting themselves by pressing their knees against the front seat and holding on to each other they stood up thus partly to be enabled to see better and partly so as to be ready to point out the way as soon as they should enter the corso  it was not long before they came to the corso the coachman then looked round as if to inquire of the boys what he was to do next  go right on said rollo and so saying he stood up in the carriage and pointed forward the coachman of course did not understand the words but the gesture was significant enough and so he drove on  now watch charley sharp said rollo and when you see the street that you think is the one where we came into the corso tell me  so the boys drove on through the corso standing up all the time in the middle of the carriage and looking about them in a very eager manner  they went on in this way for some time but they could not identify any of the branch streets as the one by which they had come into the corso  never mind said rollo we will turn off into any of these streets and perhaps we shall come upon the hotel we will take the streets that look most like it and at any rate we shall have a good ride and see the city of rome  rollo accordingly pointed to a side street when he wished the coachman to turn the coachman said si signore and immediately went in that direction as he advanced in the new street the boys looked about on all sides to see if they could recognize any signs of their approach to their hotel  after going on a little way and seeing nothing that looked at all familiar rollo made signs to the coachman to turn down another street which he thought looked promising the coachman did as he was directed wondering a little however at the strange demeanor of the boys and feeling somewhat curious to know where they wanted to go he however felt comparatively little interest in the question after all for as he was paid by the hour it was of no consequence to him where they directed him to drive  rollo now perceived that charles began to be somewhat anxious in respect to the situation they were in and so he tried in every way to encourage him and to amuse his mind  ill tell you what we will do said rollo this street that we are in now seems to be a good long one and we will drive through the whole length of it and you shall look down all the streets that open into it on the right hand and i will on the left and if we see any thing that looks like our hotel we will stop  so they rode on each boy looking out on his side until at length they came to the end of the street where there was a sort of opening and a river there was a bridge across the river and an ancient and venerablelooking castle on the other side of it  ah said rollo here is the river tiber  how do you know that that is the name of it asked charles  because i know it is the tiber that rome is built upon replied rollothe yellow tiber as they call it dont you see how yellow it is  as rollo said this he made signs for the coachman to turn out to the side of the street at the entrance of the bridge and to stop there the coachman did as he was directed and then rollo and charles still standing up in the carriage had a fine view of the bridge and of the river and also of the castle of st angelo beyond the water of the river was quite turbid and was of a yellow color  thats the river said rollo that romulus and remus were floated down on in that little ark  what little ark asked charles  why you see replied rollo when romulus and remus were babies the story is that somebody wanted to have them killed but he did not like to kill them himself with his own hand and therefore he put them into a sort of basket made of bulrushes and set them afloat on this river up above here a little way so they floated down the stream and came along by here  under this bridge asked charles  under where this bridge is now said rollo but of course there was no bridge here then there was no town here thennothing but fields and woods  and what became of the babies asked charles  why they floated down below here a little way said rollo to a place where there is a turn in the river and there the basket went ashore and was upset and the children crawled out on the sand and began to cry pretty soon a wolf who was in the thicket near by heard the crying and came down to see what it was  and did he eat them up asked charles  it was not a he wolf said rollo it was a she wolfan old mother wolf she thought that the children were little wolves and she came to them and lay down by them nursed them and took care of them just as if she had been a cat and they had been her two kittens  o rollo said charles what a story i dont believe it  nor i said rollo indeed i dont think any body nowadays believes it exactly but that is really the story you can read it in the history of rome these two children when they grew up laid the foundations of rome i dont really believe that the story is true but if it is true this is the very place where the basket with the two babies in it must have drifted along  charles gazed for a few minutes in silence on the current of turbid water which was shooting swiftly under the bridge and then said that it was time for them to go  yes said rollo and we will turn round and go back for it is of no use to go over the bridge i am sure that we did not come over the river when we set out from the hotel and so we must keep on this side  rollo concluded however not to go back the same way that he came and so making signs to the coachman for this purpose he turned into another street and as the carriage drove along he and charles looked out in every direction for their hotel but no signs of it were to be seen  after going on for some distance rollos attention was attracted by a sign in english over a shop door as follows   manufacture of roman scarfs english spoken  ah he exclaimed suddenly that is just what i wanted to find and he immediately made a sign for the coachman to stop at the door  what is it asked charles  it is a place where they make roman scarfs said rollo and i want to get one for my cousin lucy she told me to be sure if i came to rome to get her a roman scarf you cant get them in any other place  as rollo said this he descended from the carriage and charles followed him  they speak english here said rollo as he went into the shop and so we shall not have any difficulty  these roman scarfs are very pretty ornaments for the necks and shoulders of ladies they are made of silk and are of various sizes some being large enough to form a good wide mantle and others not much wider than a wide ribbon the central part of the scarf is usually of some uniform hue such as black blue green or brown and the ends are ornamented with stripes of various colors which pass across from side to side  rollo wished to get a small scarf and the ground of it was to be green this was in accordance with the instructions which lucy had given him he found great difficulty however in making the shopman understand what he wanted to all that rollo said the shopman smiled and said only yes sir yes sir and took down continually scarfs and aprons of different kinds and showed them to rollo to see if any of them were what he wanted  at last by pointing to a large one that had a green ground and saying color like that and then to a small one of a different kind and saying small like that the shopman began to understand  yes sir said the shopman yes sir i understand must one makemake see  so saying the shopman opened a door in the back side of the shop and showed rollo and charles the entrance to a room in the rear where the boys had heard before the sound of a continual thumping and where now they saw several silk looms with girls at work at them weaving scarfs  ah yes said rollo you mean that you can make me one that will be a good plan charley he added lucy will like it all the better if i tell her it was made on purpose for her  when can you have it done asked rollo  yes sir said the shopman bowing and smiling yes sir yes sir  when repeated rollo what time  ah yes sir said the shopman the time all time every time yesterday  yesterday repeated rollo puzzled  tomorrow said the man correcting himself he had said yesterday by mistake for tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow he will be readythe scarf  what time tomorrow shall i come asked rollo  yes sir said the shopman bowing again and smiling in a very complacent manner yes sir tomorrow  but what time tomorrow repeated rollo speaking very distinctly and emphasizing very strongly the word time what time  o every time said the man all time you shall have him every time tomorrow because you see he will make begin the work on him this day  very well said rollo then i will come tomorrow about noon  so rollo and charles bade the shopman good by and went out of the shop  is that what they call speaking english asked charles  so it seems said rollo sometimes they speak a great deal worse than that and yet call it speaking english  so rollo and charles got into the carriage again rollo took out his wallet and made a memorandum of the name of the shop where he had engaged the sash and of the street and number the coachman sat quietly upon his seat waiting for rollo to finish his writing and expecting then to receive directions where he was to go  if i could only find a commissioner that speaks french or english said rollo i could tell him what we want and he could tell the coachman and in that way we should soon get home  cant you find one at some hotel asked charles  why yes said rollo why did not i think of that well stop at the very first hotel we come to ill let him drive on till he comes to one no ill tell him to go to the hotel damerique that is the only name of a hotel that i know  so rollo pronounced the words hotel damerique to the coachman and the coachman saying si signore drove on in a short time he drew up before the door of the hotel where mr george had stopped first on arriving in town a waiter came to the door  is there a commissioner here who speaks english or french asked rollo  yes sir said a man who was standing by the side of the door when the carriage stopped and who now came forward i speak english  i want you to help us find our hotel said rollo we dont know the name of it i shall know it when i see it and so i want you to get on the box with the coachman and direct him to drive to one hotel after another till i see which is the right one  very well said the commissioner i will go do you remember any thing about the hotelhow it was situated  there was a small open space before it said rollo and a fountain under a tree by the side of it  it must have been the hotel dangleterre said the commissioner  in going in at the front door we went down one or two steps instead of up said rollo  yes said the commissioner it was the hotel dangleterre then seating himself on the box by the side of the coachman he said to the latter addressing him in italian  lo canda dingleterra which is the italian for hotel dangleterre or as we should express it in our language the english hotel  the coachman drove on and in a few minutes came to the hotel  yes said rollo as soon as he came in sight of it yes this is the very place  if rollo had had any doubts of his being right they would have been dispelled by the sight of mr george who was standing at the hotel door at the time they arrived  so you come home in a carriage said mr george  why we got lost said rollo i did not take notice of the name of our hotel when we went out and so we could not find our way home again  thats of no consequence said mr george i am glad you had sense enough to take a commissioner whenever you get into any difficulty whatever in a european town go right to a commissioner and he will help you out  so rollo paid the coachman and the commissioner and then he and charles went into the hotel     chapter vi  the coliseum   the grandest of all the ruins in rome and perhaps indeed of all the ruins in the world is the coliseum  the coliseum was built as a place for the exhibition of games and spectacles it was of an oval form with seats rising one above another on all sides and a large arena in the centre there was no roof the building was so immensely large that it would have been almost impossible to have made a roof over it  the spectacles which were exhibited in such buildings as these were usually combats either of men with men or of men with wild beasts these were real combats in which either the men or the beasts were actually killed the thousands of people that sat upon the seats all around watched the conflict while it was going on with intense excitement and shouted with ferocious joy at the end of it in honor of the victors  the men that fought in the arena were generally captives taken in battle in distant countries and the wild beasts were lions tigers and bears that were sent home from africa or from the dark forests in the north of europe  the great generals who went out at the head of the roman armies to conquer these distant realms and annex them to the empire sent home these captives and wild beasts they sent them for the express purpose of amusing the roman people with them by making them fight in these great amphitheatres there was such an amphitheatre in or near almost every large town but the greatest or at least the most celebrated of all these structures was this coliseum at rome  mr george and rollo went to the coliseum in a carriage after passing through almost the whole length of the corso they passed successively through several crooked and narrow streets and at length emerged into the great region of the ruins on every side were tall columns broken and decayed and immense arches standing meaningless and alone and mounds of ancient masonry with weeds and flowers waving in the air on the top of them there were no houses or scarcely any in this part of the city but only grassy slopes with old walls appearing here and there among them and in some places enclosed fields and gardens with corn and beans and garden vegetables of every kind growing at the base of the majestic ruins  the carriage stopped at one end of the coliseum where there was a passage way leading through stupendous arches into the interior  they dismissed the carriage rollo having first paid the coachman the fare they then after gazing upward a moment at the vast pile of arches upon arches towering above them advanced towards the openings in order to go in  there was a soldier with a musket in his hands bayonet set walking to and fro at the entrance he however said nothing to mr george and rollo and so passing by him they went in  they passed in under immense arches of the most massive masonry and between the great piers built to sustain the arches until they reached the arena there was a broad gravel walk passing across the arena from end to end and another leading around the circumference of it the rest of the surface was covered with grass smooth and green  the form of the arena was oval as has already been said and on every side there ascended the sloping tiers rising one above another to a vast height on which the seats for the spectators had been placed mr george and rollo advanced along the central walk and looked around them surveying the scenetheir minds filled with emotions of wonder and awe  what a monstrous place it was said rollo  it was indeed said mr george  is it here where the men fought with the lions and the tigers asked rollo pointing around him over the arena  yes said mr george  and up there all around were the seats of the spectators i suppose said rollo  yes said mr george on those slopes  you must know that the scats and all the inside finish of the coliseum were originally of marble and people have stripped it all away and left nothing but the naked masonry and even that is all now going to ruin  what did they strip the marble off for asked rollo  to build their houses and palaces with replied mr george half of the modern palaces of rome are built of stone and marble plundered from the ancient ruins  o uncle george exclaimed rollo  come out here where we can sit down said mr george and ill tell you all about it  illustration looking down from the coliseum  so saying mr george led the way and rollo followed to one side of the arena where they could sit down on a large flat stone which seemed to have been an ancient step they were overshadowed where they sat by piers and arches and by the masses of weeds and shrubbery that were growing on the mouldering summits of them and waving in the wind  in the centre of the arena was a large cross with a sort of platform around it and steps to go up and all around the arena on the sides at equal distances there extended a range of little chapels with crucifixes and other catholic symbols  the arena of the coliseum was kept in very neat order for a wonder there were no beggars to be seen but instead of them there were various parties of welldressed visitors walking about the paths or sitting on the massive stone fragments which lay under the ruined arches  high up above these arches the sloping platforms on which the seats formerly were placed were to be seen rising one above another tier after tier to a great height with the ruins of galleries corridors and vaulted passage ways passing around among them the upper surfaces of all these ruins were covered with grass and shrubbery  what has become of all the seats uncle george said rollo  why the seats i suppose were made of marble replied mr george or some other valuable material and so all the stones have been taken away  presently rollo saw a party of visitors coming into view far up among the upper stories of the ruins  look uncle george look said he there are some people away up there as high as the third or fourth story how do you suppose they got up there couldnt you and i go  i presume so said mr george i suppose that in the way of climbing you and i can go as high as most people  while mr george was saying this rollo was adjusting his opera glass to his eyes in order to take a nearer view of the party among the ruins  there are four of them said he i see a gentleman and two ladies and a little girl they seem to be gathering something  plants perhaps said mr george and flowers  plants said rollo contemptuously i dont believe that any thing grows out of such old stones and mortar but weeds  we call such things weeds said mr george when they grow in the gardens or fields and are in the way but when they grow in wild places where they belong they are plants and flowers  the gentleman is gathering them from high places all around him said rollo and is giving them to the ladies and they are putting them in between the leaves of a book  they are going to carry them away as souvenirs of the coliseum i suppose said mr george  the girl has got a white stone in her hand said rollo  perhaps it is a piece of marble that she has picked up said mr george  now she has thrown down her white stone said rollo and has begun to gather flowers  there is an immense number of plants that grow in and upon the coliseum said mr george a botanist once made a complete collection of them how many species do you think he found  twenty said rollo  guess again said mr george  fifteen said rollo  o you must guess more not less said mr george  thirty said rollo  more said mr george  forty said rollo  add one cipher to it said mr george and then you will be pretty near right  what four hundred exclaimed rollo  yes said mr george a botanist made a catalogue of four hundred and twenty plants all growing on the ruins of this single building  o uncle george said rollo i dont think that can possibly be i mean to see  so saying rollo laid the opera glass down upon the seat where he had been sitting and began to examine the masses of old ruined masonry near him with a view of seeing how many different kinds of plants he could find  must i count every thing uncle george said rollo  yes said mr george every thing that is a plant every different kind of sprig or little weed that you can findmosses lichens and all  rollo began to count he very soon got up to twenty and so he came to the conclusion that the guide bookwhich was the authority on which mr george had stated the number of plants found upon the ruinswas right  while rollo was thus engaged mr george had remained quietly in his seat and had occupied himself with studying the guide book  uncle george said rollo when he came back i give it up i have no doubt that there are hundreds of plants in all growing on these ruins  yes said mr george whatever is stated in this book is very apt to prove true  what else did you read about uncle george said rollo while i was counting the plants  i read said mr george that the coliseum was begun about a d 72 by one of the roman emperors  then it is almost eighteen hundred years old said rollo  yes said mr george and when it was first opened after it was finished they had a sort of inauguration of it with great celebrations that continued one hundred days  that is over three months said rollo  yes said mr george it was a very long celebration during this time about five thousand wild beasts were killed in the combats in the arena  this very arena right before us said rollo  yes said mr george  on hearing this rollo looked upon the arena with renewed interest and pleasure he endeavored to picture to himself the lions and tigers and leopards and other ferocious wild beasts growling snarling and tumbling over each other there in the desperate combats which they waged among themselves or with the men sent in to fight with them  it continued to be used for such fights added mr george for four hundred years and during this time a great many christians were sent in to be devoured by wild beasts for the entertainment of the populace  after a while continued mr george the roman empire became christian and then the government put a stop to all these savage games  and what did they do with the coliseum then asked rollo  they did not know what to do with it for a time said mr george but at last when wars broke out and rome was besieged they tried to turn it into a fortress  i should think it would make an excellent fortress said rollo only there are no portholes for the cannon  ah but they had no cannon in those days said mr george they had only bows and arrows spears javelins and such sort of weapons so that they did not require any portholes the men could shoot their weapons from the top of the wall  in further conversation on the subject of the coliseum mr george explained to rollo how in process of time rome was taken by the barbarians and a great portion of the coliseum was destroyed and then afterwards when peace was restored how the government instead of repairing the building pulled it to pieces still more in order to get marble and hewn stone and sculptured columns to build palaces with and how at a later period there was a plan formed for converting the vast structure into a manufactory and how in connection with this plan immense numbers of shops were fitted up in the arcades and arches belowand how the plan finally failed after having cost the pope who undertook it ever so many thousand roman dollars how after this it remained for many centuries wholly neglected and the stones falling in from above together with the broken bricks and mortar formed on the arena below and all around the walls outside immense heaps of rubbish and finally how about one hundred years ago people began to take an interest in the ruins and to wish to clear away the rubbish and to prop up and preserve what remained of the walls and arches  it was the french that cleared away the rubbish at last said mr george and put the ruins in order  the french repeated rollo how came the french here  i dont know said mr george the french are every where and wherever they go they always take with their armies a corps of philosophers artists and men of science who look up every thing that is curious and put it in order and preserve it if they can  then i am glad they came here said rollo  here mr george shut his book and rose from his seat saying as he did so  the coliseum is so large that it covers six acres of ground  six acres repeated rollo  yes said mr george it is six hundred and twenty feet long that is monstrous for such a building but then the steamship great eastern is about a hundred feet longer  then the great eastern is bigger than the coliseum  she is longer said mr george but she is not so wide nor so high  and which all things considered is the greatest work do you think asked rollo  the coliseum may have cost the most labor said mr george but the great eastern is far above it in my opinion in every element of real greatness the coliseum is a most wonderful structure no doubt but the building of an iron ship like the great eastern to be propelled by steam against all the storms and tempests of the ocean to the remotest corners of the earth with ten thousand tons of merchandise on board or ten thousand men is in my opinion much the greatest exploit  at any rate said rollo the coliseum makes the finest ruin  i am not certain of that even said mr george suppose that the great eastern were to be drawn up upon the shore somewhere near london and be abandoned there and that then the whole world should relapse into barbarism and remain so for a thousand years and afterwards there should come a revival of science and civilization and people should come here to see the ruins of the coliseum and go to london to see those of the great ship i think they would consider the ship the greater wonder of the two  i think they would said rollo if they understood it all as well  they could not be easily made to believe i suppose said mr george that such an immense structure all of iron could have been made and launched and then navigated all over the world just by the power of the maze of iron beams and wheels and machinery which they would see in ruins in the hold  uncle george said rollo what curious bricks the romans used  so saying rollo pointed to the bricks in a mass of masonry near where they were standing these bricks like all those that were used in the construction of the building were very flat they were a great deal longer and a great deal wider than our bricks and were yet not much more than half as thick this gave them a very thin and flat appearance instead of being red too they were of a yellow color  these bricks had not originally been used for outside works but only for filling in the solid parts of the walls and for forming the arches but the stones with which the brick masonry had been covered and concealed having been removed the bricks were of course in many places brought to view  after looking about for some time rollo found a brick with two letters stamped upon it it was evident that the letters had been stamped upon the clay in the making of the brick while it was yet soft the letters were p d  look uncle george said rollo look at those letters what do you suppose they mean  that is very curious said mr george and so saying he proceeded to examine the letters very closely  they were evidently stamped upon the brick he said when it was soft perhaps they are the initials of the makers name  i mean to look and see if all the bricks are stamped so said rollo  so rollo began to examine the other bricks wherever he could find any which had a side exposed to view but though he found some which contained the letters there were many others where no letters were to be seen  perhaps the letters are on the under side said rollo i mean to get a stone and knock up some of the bricks if i can and see  no said mr george that wont do  yes uncle george said rollo i want to see very much and besides i want to get a piece of a brick with the letters on it to carry home as a specimen  a specimen of what asked mr george  a specimen of the coliseum said rollo  no said mr george i dont think that will do they dont want to have the coliseum knocked to pieces and carried off any more  who dont asked rollo  the government said mr george the pope  but its very hard said rollo if the popes after plundering the coliseum themselves for hundreds of years and carrying off all the beautiful marbles and columns and statues to build their palaces with cant let an american boy like me take away a little bit of a brick to put into my museum for a specimen  mr george laughed and walked on rollo who never persisted in desiring to do any thing which his uncle disapproved of quietly followed him  uncle george said rollo how do you suppose we can get up into the upper part among the tiers of seats  i think there must be a staircase somewhere said mr george we will ramble about and see if we do not find one  so they walked on they went sometimes along the margin of the arena and then at other times they turned in under immense openings in masonry and walked along the vaulted corridors which were built in the thickness of the walls there were several of these corridors side by side each going entirely round the arena they were surmounted by stupendous arches which were built to sustain the upper portions of the building which contained the seats for the spectators and the passages on the upper floors leading to them  illustration view of the lower corridor  after rambling on through and among the corridors for some time mr george and rollo on emerging again into the arena came to a wooden gate at the foot of a broad flight of stone steps which seemed to lead up into the higher stories of the ruin  ah exclaimed rollo as soon as he saw this gateway and the flight of steps beyond it this is the gate that leads up to the upper tiers  yes replied mr george only it is shut and locked  rollo went to the gate and took hold of it but found as mr george had said that it was locked  but here comes the custodian said mr george  rollo looked and saw a man coming along the side of the arena with a key in his hand when the man came near he looked at mr george and rollo and also at the door and then asked a question in italian  si signore said mr george  so the man advanced and unlocked the door as soon as he had unlocked it and mr george and rollo had passed through he looked towards them again and asked another question  no signore said mr george  mr george and rollo then began to go up the stairs while the man having locked the door after them went away     chapter vii  the gladiator   how did you know what it was that that man asked you asked rollo  i knew from the circumstances of the case replied mr george the first question i knew must be whether we wished to go up and the second whether we wished him to go with us  what do you suppose they keep the gate locked for asked rollo  so as to make us pay when we come down said mr george  do you suppose they mean to make us pay asked rollo  they will not make us exactly said mr george but they will expect something no doubt there may be another reason however why they keep the gate locked and that is to prevent children and stragglers from going up where they might fall and break their necks at some of the exposed and dangerous places  do you suppose that there are dangerous places up here asked rollo  yes said mr george i suppose there are a great many and i advise you to be very careful where you go  the flight of stairs where mr george and rollo were ascending was very broad and it was formed of the long flat bricks such as rollo had observed below the bricks were placed edgewise  i suppose that these steps were covered with slabs of marble in old times said rollo  probably said mr george either with marble or some other harder stone  after ascending some distance rollo who went forward came out upon the landing which led to a range of corridors in the second story as it were there were several of these corridors running side by side all along the building on one side you could pass through arches and come out to the platforms where the seats had originally been arranged and where you could look down upon the arena the seats themselves were all gone and in their places nothing was left but sloping platforms all gone to ruin and covered now with grass and weeds and tall bramble bushes on the other side you could go out to the outer wall and look down through immense arched openings to the ground below5  footnote 5 see frontispiece  take care rollo said mr george dont go too near  you may go as near as you think it is safe said rollo and i will keep back an inch from where you go  thats right said mr george there is great pleasure and satisfaction in going into dangerous places with such a sensible boy as you  after rambling about among the arches and corridors of the second story for some time mr george and rollo mounted to a story above they found ruins of staircases in great numbers so that there were a great many different places where they could go up mr george allowed rollo to go about wherever he pleased knowing that he would keep at a safe distance from all places where there was danger of falling  from time to time they met other parties of visitors rambling about the ruins if these persons were french or german they generally bowed to rollo and mr george as they passed and greeted them with a pleasant smile as if of recognition if on the other hand they were english they passed directly by looking straight forward as if they did not see them at all  whenever rollo came to a new staircase he wished to ascend it being seemingly desirous of getting up as high as he could mr george made no objection to this indeed he allowed rollo to choose the way and to go where he pleased he himself followed walking slowly in a musing manner filled apparently with wondering admiration and contemplating the stupendous magnitude of the ruin  uncle george said rollo if i had my pressing book here i would gather some of these plants and press them to carry home  mr george did not answer he was standing in an advanced position where he had an uninterrupted survey of the whole interior of the coliseum and he was endeavoring to picture to his imagination the scene which must have been presented to view when the vast amphitheatre was filled with spectators  if i had expected to find so many plants growing on the ruins of a building i should have brought it said rollo  the pressing book which rollo referred to was one made expressly for the purpose of pressing flowers the leaves of it were of blotting paper  rollo was half inclined to ask mr george to put some specimens into the guide book but he did not ask him because he knew that mr george did not like to have dried plants in the guide book such specimens between the leaves of a book interfere very much with the convenience of using it by dropping out when you open the book or impeding the turning of the leaves  but i mean to come again continued rollo and bring my pressing book and then i can get as many specimens as i please wouldnt you uncle george  wouldnt you what said mr george mr george had been paying very little attention to what rollo had been saying  come again some day said rollo and bring my pressing book so as to collect specimens of some of these little plants  yes said mr george that will be an excellent plan and i wish while you are doing it you would gather some for me and if you wish for some now i can let you put them in the guide book  no i thank you said rollo i will wait till i come again  the height of the outer walls of the coliseum is over a hundred and fifty feet which would be the height of a house fifteen stories high there are not many church steeples higher than that  if therefore you conceive of an ovalshaped field six acres in extent with a massive wall one hundred and fifty feet high and divided into four immense stories surrounding it and from the top of this wall ranges of seats with passages between them sloping in towards the centre leaving about an acre of open and level space in the centre for the arena the whole finished in the most magnificent and gorgeous manner with columns statues sculptured ornaments and all the seats and walls and staircases and corridors and vestibules and tribunes and pavilions for musicians and seats for judges designed and arranged in the highest style of architectural beauty and encased and adorned with variegated marbles of the most gorgeous descriptionif i say you can conceive of all this you will have some faint idea of what the coliseum must have been in the days of its glory  mr george and rollo continued to ascend the different staircases which they met with in their wanderings until at length they had reached a great elevation and yet so immense was the extent of the interior of the edifice that they were not at all too high to see the arena to advantage here rollo crept out upon one of the sloping platforms where there had formerly been seats for spectators and calling to mr george to follow him he sat down upon a great square stone which seemed to have formed a part of the ancient foundation of the seats  come uncle george said rollo let us sit down here a few minutes and make believe that the games are going on and that we are the spectators  yes said mr george we will in that way we can get a better idea of what the coliseum was  i wish we could bring it all back again said rollo just as it was in old times by some sort of magic  we must do it by the magic of imagination said mr george  only continued rollo the things that they did down in the arena were so dreadful that we could not bear to look at them  true said mr george the spectacles must have been very dreadful indeed  such as when the lions and tigers came out to tear and devour the poor christians said rollo  yes said mr george but generally i suppose when wild beasts and men were brought out together on the arena it was the beasts that were killed and not the men it was a combat and i suppose that the men were usually victorious it was the spectacle of the fury of the combat and of the bravery which the men displayed and of the terrible danger that they were often exposed to that so excited and pleased the spectators  i should not have thought that they could have found any men that would have been willing to fight the beasts said rollo  perhaps the men were not willing replied mr george but were compelled to fight them indeed i suppose that they were generally prisoners of war or criminals the generals used to bring home a great many prisoners of war from the different countries that they conquered and these men were trained in rome and in other great cities to fight on the arena either with wild beasts or with one another they were called gladiators there is a statue of one wounded and dying somewhere here in rome  i should like to see it said rollo  we shall see it undoubtedly said mr george it is one of the most celebrated statues in the world it is called the dying gladiator i presume the sculptor of it made it from his recollections of the posture and expression of face which were witnessed in the case of real gladiators in the arena when they had been mortally wounded and were sinking down to die  we certainly must see it said rollo  we certainly will rejoined mr george it is celebrated all over the world byron wrote a very fine stanza describing it  what was the stanza asked rollo  i dont remember it all said mr george it was something about his sinking down upon the ground leaning upon his hand and the expression of his face showed though he yielded to death he conquered and triumphed over the pain then there is something about his wife and children far away in dacia his native land where he had been captured in fighting to protect them and brought to rome to fight and die in the coliseum to make amusement for the roman populace  i wish you could remember the lines themselves said rollo  perhaps i can find them in the guide book said mr george  so saying mr george opened the guide book and turned to the index  i believe said he that the statue of the dying gladiator is in the capitol  we have not been there yet have we asked rollo  yes replied mr george we went there the first day to get a view from the cupola on the summit but there is a museum of sculptures and statues there which we have not seen yet you see the capitol hill was in ancient times one of the most important public places in rome and when the city was destroyed immense numbers of statues and inscribed marbles and beautiful sculptured ornaments were buried up there in the rubbish and ruins when finally they were dug out new buildings were erected on the spot and all the objects that were found there were arranged in a museum ah here it is he added i have found the lines  so mr george read the lines as follows he read them in a slow and solemn manner    i see before me the gladiator lie   he leans upon his hand his manly brow   consents to death but conquers agony   and his drooped head sinks gradually low   and through his side the last drops ebbing slow   from the red gash fall heavy one by one   like the first of a thunder shower and now   the arena swims around himhe is gone   ere ceased the inhuman shout which hailed the wretch who won    he heard it but he heeded not his eyes   were with his heart and that was far away   he recked not of the life he lost nor prize   but where his rude hut by the danube lay   there were his young barbarians all at play   there was their dacian motherhe their sire   butchered to make a roman holiday   all this rushed with his blood shall he expire   and unavenged arise ye goths and glut your ire  the goths did arise and glut their ire said mr george after he had finished reciting the lines for they were in great measure the authors of all this ruin and destruction  after sitting nearly half an hour in this place mr george rose and rollo following him went back into the corridors again they rambled along the corridors and mounted the staircases to higher and higher points until they had ascended as far as they could go in these upper regions of the ruin rollo had a good opportunity to procure specimens of marble and of stamped bricks for in various places there he found immense stores of bricks and marble and other rubbish piled up in square heaps under arches or in great recesses among the ruins rollo selected some of the bricks which had stamps upon them and then with a piece of marble for a hammer he contrived to break away all of the brick except the part which contained the stamp and thus procured specimens of a convenient form for carrying these specimens he wrapped separately in pieces of newspaper and put them in his pockets  at length mr george said it was time for them to go home so they began to descend they went down by different passages and staircases from those which they had taken in coming up but they came out at last at the same gateway the custodian was just unlocking the gate when they arrived in order to admit another party mr george gave him a couple of pauls and then he and rollo set out to go home  their way led them over the ancient site of the roman forum which presented to view on every side as they passed broken columns and ruined arches with the mouldering remains of ancient foundations cropping out here and there amid grassy slopes and mounds  uncle george said rollo as they walked along we are going directly by the capitol hill as we go home let us go in now and see the dying gladiator  very well said mr george we will  accordingly when they reached the base of the hill they turned to go up there was a broad and steep paved ascent leading up the hill somewhat like a road only it was too steep for a carriage indeed there were little steps at short intervals with a sloping pavement between them you see this ascent in the engraving it is in the centre of the view there are statues of lions at the foot of it with water spouting from their mouths at the top are larger statues of horses standing on lofty pedestals with men by the side of them holding them by the bridles these are ancient statues they were found buried up in rubbish in an obscure quarter of rome about two hundred years ago beyond you see other groups of colossal statuary raised on lofty pedestals in various parts of the great square which forms the summit of the hill  illustration ascent to the capitol  on the left you see a church standing in a very high position with a still steeper ascent than the one i have been describing leading up to it on the right is a winding road for carriages which leads up by a tolerably gentle ascent to the great square  the great square is surrounded with vast palaces almost all of which are filled with paintings statuary sculptures and other treasures of ancient and modern art mr george and rollo turned to the left after they had ascended into the square and entered a door over which was an inscription denoting that it led to the museum of sculptures and statues after ascending one or two staircases they came to the entrance of a suit of apartments in which the statuary was contained there was a public functionary dressed somewhat like a soldier standing sentinel at the door he however readily allowed mr george and rollo to pass in there were various other parties of visitors going in at the same time  mr george and rollo walked through one long room after another with rows of statues and busts and other works of ancient sculpture on each side these marbles were almost all more or less chipped and broken or otherwise greatly defaced by the hard usage to which they had been subjected  uncle george said rollo as they walked along how came all their ears and noses broken off in this way  why all these things were dug out from heaps of stones and rubbish said mr george a few hundred years ago for nearly a thousand years before that time they were regarded as of no more value than so many old bricks  heres a gentleman coming added mr george interrupting himself who looks as if he could speak french i mean to ask him where the hall of the dying gladiator is  accordingly when the gentleman came up mr george accosting him in french asked him the question and the gentleman replying in french gave the information in a very polite manner it was a little farther on he said  is there a special hall for the dying gladiator asked rollo  no said mr george not for the dying gladiator alone but many of the halls in these museums are named from the most celebrated statue that there is in them and i knew that the room where the dying gladiator is placed was called by that name  so they walked on and presently they came to the room there were a great many large statues in it but among them it was very easy to recognize at once the one which they had come to see both on account of the conspicuous situation in which it was placed and also from its form here is a representation of it  illustration statue of the gladiator  mr george and rollo both looked upon the statue for a few minutes in silence  yes said rollo at length yes i see he is dying he is sinking gradually down  do you see the wound in his side asked mr george  yes replied rollo and the drops of blood coming out  he has dropped his sword said mr george it is lying there near his hand  what a short sword said rollo there are some other things lying on the ground beneath him but i do not know what they are  nor i said mr george one of them seems to be a sort of trumpet people think from that that this man was a herald  but i thought he was a gladiator said rollo  they call him a gladiator replied mr george but nobody really knows what the statue was originally intended for you see it was dug up out of a heap of rubbish just as almost all these statues were and people have to guess what they were intended for this statue was dug up in a gardena garden belonging to an ancient roman villa  what does that cord around his neck mean asked rollo  they think it means that the man was a gaul the gauls used to wear such cords i believe  i thought he was a dacian said rollo  i suppose it is uncertain who he was replied mr george but look at his face see the expression of it it is an expression of mingled suffering and rage and yet he looks as if he were so far gone as to begin to be unconscious of every thing around him  yes said rollo he does not seem to notice us at all  in that said mr george is shown the great skill of the sculptor to express such different and as one would think almost conflicting emotions in the same face at the same time  after looking at the statue some time longer rollo and mr george walked around the room and looked at the other pieces of sculpture that there were there they afterwards came back again to the gladiator in order to take one more view of it before they went away mr george advised rollo to look at it well and impress the image of it strongly on his mind  it is one of the treasures of the world said he and in the course of your life though you may never see it here in the original again you will meet with casts of it and drawings of it without number and you will find descriptions of it and allusions to it continually recurring in the conversation that you hear and the books that you read indeed the image of the dying gladiator forms a part of the mental furnishing of every highlycultivated intellect in the civilized world     chapter viii  the tarpeian rock   one morning while mr george and rollo were taking breakfast together in the dining room of the hotel mr george remarked that he had received some news that morning  is it good news or bad news asked rollo  it is good for me replied mr george but i rather think you will consider it bad for you  tell me what it is said rollo and then i will tell you how i consider it  so mr george informed rollo that the news which he had received was that there had been an arrival from america and that the last nights post had brought the papers to town  and so said mr george i am going to spend the morning at piales6 library reading the papers and you will be left to entertain yourself  footnote 6 pronounced peahlys  o thats no matter said rollo i can get charles beekman to go with me we can take care of ourselves very well  what will you do asked mr george  i want to go and see the tarpeian rock said rollo i read about that rock and about tarpeia in a history in america and i want to see how the rock looks  do you know where it is asked mr george  no said rollo but i can find out  very well said mr george then i leave you to take care of yourself you can get charles to go if his mother will trust him with you  she will i am sure said rollo  why you got lost when you took him the other day said mr george and you had ever so much difficulty in finding your way home again  o no uncle george said rollo we did not have any difficulty at all we only had a little fun  soon after breakfast mr george bade rollo good by and went off to the bookstore and library where he was to see and read the american papers as soon as his uncle had gone rollo went up to mrs beekmans room and knocked at the door a welldressed man servant came to the door it was mr beekmans courier  walk in mr rollo said the courier mrs beekman and charles will come in a minute  so rollo went in the room was a small parlor very beautifully furnished in a few minutes mrs beekman and charles came in followed by charless sister a lively young lady about twelve years of age her name was almira though they usually called her allie  rollo informed mrs beekman when she came into the room that he had come to ask her to allow charles to go and make an excursion with him he was going he said to see the tarpeian rock  o i would not go to see the tarpeian rock said mrs beekman some ladies of my acquaintance went to see it the other day and they said it was nothing at all  ah yes mother said charles in an entreating tone of voice let me go with rollo  why there is nothing at all to see said mrs beekman it is only a small steep face of a rock in a bank on the hudson river railroad you see rocks and precipices forty times as picturesque all along the way  still rollo and charles were very desirous to go the truth was it was not so much what they expected to see at the end of the excursion which made it so alluring to them as the interest and excitement of the various adventures which they thought they would meet with on the way finally mrs beekman said that she had not the least objection in the world to their going to see the rock only she was herself perfectly convinced that they would not find any thing worth seeing  i wish allie could go too said rollo  yes mother said allie clapping her hands  why do you care about seeing the tarpeian rock asked her mother  yes mother said allie i wish to see it very much though i dont know what it is what is it rollo  ill tell you all about it on the way said rollo if you can only go with us  but she cannot walk there said mrs beekman no lady ever walks in rome  i will take a carriage said rollo  i am afraid you dont know how to manage about a carriage said mrs beekman  yes mother replied charles he knows how to manage about a carriage perfectly well i tried him the other day  mrs beekman finally gave a tardy and reluctant consent to the childrens proposal she did not manage the case very wisely she should have considered in the first instance what her decision ought to be and then she should have adhered to it if she was going to consent at all she should have consented cordially and at once for parents first to refuse their childrens request and then allow themselves to be induced to change their determination by the entreaties and persuasions of the children themselves is bad management  allie went into her mothers bed room to get ready and in a few minutes returned her countenance beaming with animation and pleasure  they all went down to the door of the hotel there were several carriages standing in the square the coachmen as soon as they saw the party at the door all began to hold up their whips and to call to rollo some of them began to move their horses towards him  rollo glanced his eyes rapidly at the several coaches and selecting the one which he thought looked the best he beckoned to the coachman of it the coachman immediately drew up to the door he then jumped down from the box and opened the carriage door  before getting in however rollo wished to make his bargain so he said to the coachman  to the capitol two pauls  he spoke these words in the italian language he had learned the italian for two pauls long before and he had looked out the italian name for the capitol in his guide book that morning so as to be all ready the italian name which he found was campidoglio  the coachman hesitated a moment and then said holding up three fingers at the same time  three pauls  of course he spoke in italian  rollo instead of answering him immediately began to turn away and look out towards the other carriages  si signore si said the coachman two pauls let it be  so he held open the carriage door wider than ever and rollo assisted allie to get in he and charles followed and then the coachman drove away  you agreed to give him too much said charles as soon as they were seated a paul and a half is the regular fare  i know it said rollo but i always offer a little more than the regular fare especially when i have a lady with me for then they have not a word to say  but this man had a word to say replied charles he wanted you to give him three pauls  yes said rollo sometimes they try a little to make a dispute but they have no chance at all and they give right up  rollo had ordered the coachman to drive to the capitol because he had found by studying the map and the guide book that the entrance to the enclosure where the tarpeian rock was to be seen was very near there he had examined the map attentively and so he knew exactly which way he must go after being set down at the foot of the capitol stairs  accordingly when the carriage stopped rollo got out first himself and then helped allie and charles out he paid the coachman the price agreed upon and a couple of coppers over for buono mano  now said he to charles and allie follow me  rollo went on a little way along a winding street and then turning to the right began to go up a steep ascent formed of very broad steps which seemed to lead to a higher street as soon as the party began to go up these steps they saw several children running down from above to meet them when these children reached the place where rollo was they began saying something very eagerly in italian scrambling up the steps again at the same time so as to keep up with rollo and his party  what do these children want asked allie  i dont know said rollo i have not the least idea  i suppose they are begging said charles  no said allie if they were begging they would hold out their hands  at the top of the stairs rollo and his party were met by half a dozen more children so that there were now eight or ten in all they ran on before and by the side of rollo and his party all looking very eager and animated talking incessantly and beckoning and pointing forward  ah said rollo i know they want to show us the way to the tarpeian rock  but you said you knew the way said allie  i said i could find it replied rollo and so i can but i am willing to pay one of these children for showing me but not all stop a minute till i choose or rather you may choose allie he added  the party now stopped while allie surveyed the ragged and wretchedlooking group before her  there is not a pretty child among them said allie  you should not look for the best looking one allie said charles you should choose the worst looking one she is likely to need it most pretty looking girls get along well enough  then i choose that poor barefooted girl that looks so pale said allie  yes said rollo she looks as if she had had a fever  so rollo pointed to the girl and showed her a copper which he took for the purpose from his pocket at the same time he made a waving motion with his hand to the rest to denote that he did not wish for their services and that they might go away  the barefooted girl seemed greatly pleased her pale and emaciated face was lighted up with a smile of pleasure she ran along forward beckoning to rollo and his party to follow  the rest of the children though they understood perfectly the signal of dismission that rollo had made to them were determined not to be sent off in that way so they went on gesticulating and clamoring as much as ever  rollo paid no attention to them but walked on with charles and allie at his side presently their guide and all the other children with her stopped at a sort of gateway in a wall by the side of the gateway there was an iron ring hanging by a chain two or three of the children seized this ring together and pulled it by which means a bell was rung inside the other children crowded together on each side of this gate leaving room however for rollo and his party to go through and all held out their hands for money  i am only going to pay the one that i engaged said rollo but poor thing i mean to give her two coppers instead of one she looks so sick and miserable  so i would said allie and here she added putting her hand into her pocket and taking out a roman copper coin i have got a penny here you may give her that too  that is not a penny said charles that is a baioccho  never mind said allie i call it a penny i cant remember the other name besides it is all the same thing  rollo gave the three pieces of money to the poor girl and the rest of the children when they saw how generous he was became more clamorous than ever but rollo paid no heed to them indeed a moment after he had paid his little guide her money the gate opened and the party went in the poor children were all left outside and shut out  it was a small girl about thirteen years old that opened the gate  rollo and his party found themselves ushered into a sort of garden the girl led the way along a narrow path between beds of beans lettuce and other garden vegetables besides these vegetables there were groups of shrubbery here and there among which roses and other flowers were blooming this garden seemed to be in the heart of the city for it was bordered on three sides by buildings and on the fourth by a low wall which appeared to be built on the brow of a hill for the roofs and chimneys of other houses situated on a lower level could be seen over it below  the girl led the way to a place by this wall where by looking over there could be seen at a distance along the hill a small place where the rock which formed the face of it was precipitous the precipice seemed to be about ten or fifteen feet high  is that the tarpeian rock asked rollo  the girl who conducted them did not reply not knowing any language but the italian  ive seen a great deal prettier rocks in america said allie  then are you sorry you came asked rollo  o no said allie i am very glad i came but what is it that makes this rock so famous  why it is the place where in old times a very remarkable thing happened replied rollo i read the story in the history of rome when i was studying history in america there was a girl named tarpeia she lived somewhere near the top of this rock and the wall of the city came somewhere along here and there was a gate the sabines made war against the romans and came to attack the city but they could not get in on account of the walls one day tarpeia was on the wall looking down and she saw some of the sabine soldiers walking about below  why did not they shoot her asked charles  o they had no motive for shooting her replied rollo she was a nice pretty girl i suppose and they liked to look at her and to talk with her besides they had a cunning plan in view they asked her whether they could not induce her to open the gates and let them into the city she said she would do it if they would give her what they wore on their arms she meant their bracelets the soldiers in those days used to adorn themselves with rings and bracelets and other such things but then besides these bracelets they wore their shields and bucklers on their arms these were very heavy things made of iron and covered with hides so they agreed that they would give her what they wore on their arms secretly meaning that they would throw their bucklers upon her but she thought they meant that they would give her their bracelets  so that night continued rollo the soldiers came bringing a great many other soldiers with them and tarpeia opened the gate and let them in the whole troop rushed by her into the town as fast as they could go and as they passed they all threw their bucklers upon poor tarpeia till she was crushed to death and buried up by them it was pretty near this rock where this happened and so forever after they called it the tarpeian rock and that is the reason why so many people come to see it  there was a moments pause after rollo had finished his story during which allie looked quite concerned at length she said in a very earnest tone  i think it was a shame  i think they served her just right said charles  o charles replied alice how can you say so  the girl who had conducted the party through the garden now began to lead the way back again and they all followed her as she walked along the girl began to gather flowers from the beds and borders and finally made quite a pretty bouquet when she got to the gate and was ready to open it she presented this bouquet in a very polite and graceful manner to allie rollo took some money from his pocket and put it into her hand and then she opened the gate and let them all out  how much did you pay her rollo asked charles  i paid her double said rollo because she was so polite as to give allie such a pretty bouquet  allie was now more pleased with her bouquet than before it pleased her extremely to find that rollo took so much interest in her receiving a bouquet as to pay something specially for it  so they all went down the steps which led to the foot of the capitol hill  shall we walk home asked rollo or shall i find a carriage so that we can ride  let us walk replied allie and then we shall be longer on the way  just then rollo looking at the sky saw that there were some rather threatening clouds diffused over it indeed on putting out his hand he plainly felt a sprinkling of rain  it is going to rain said he and so we shall be obliged to ride but we can make it longer by stopping to see something on the way  well said allie lets do it what shall we stop to see  if there is going to be a shower said rollo it would be a good time to stop and see the pantheon  what is the pantheon asked allie  it is an immense round church with a great hole in the roof replied rollo  why dont they mend the hole asked charles  o they made it so on purpose said rollo  made it on purpose repeated allie i never heard of such a thing i should think the rain would come in  it does come in said rollo and that is the reason why i want to go and see the pantheon in the time of a shower it is so curious to see the rain falling down slowly to the pavement you see the church is round and there is a dome over it and in the centre of the dome they left a great round hole  how big asked allie  it is twentyeight feet across said rollo but you would not think it so big when you come to see it it is up so high that it looks very small we know how big it is by the size of the wet spot on the floor  by the time that the party had arrived at this point in the conversation rollo saw a carriage standing in the street at a little distance before him and he made a signal to the coachman to come to him the coachman came rollo made his bargain with him and they all got in the coachman drove immediately to the pantheon and they arrived there just as the shower began to come on  before the church was an immense portico supported by columns the columns and the whole entablature which they supported were darkened by time and cracked and chipped and broken in the most remarkable manner allie and charles stood under the portico and looked around while rollo paid the coachman  illustration interior of the pantheon  there was a large open square before the pantheon with an ancient and very remarkable looking fountain in the centre of it there was a basin around this fountain into which monstrous mouths carved in marble were spouting water when rollo had paid the coachman he led the way into the church allie and charles followed him they found themselves ushered into an immense circular interior with rows of columns all around the sides and chapels and sculptures and paintings and beautiful panels of variegated marbles between them  overhead was an immense dome this dome is nearly a hundred and fifty feet high and the circular opening in the centre of it is about thirty feet across through this opening the rain was descending in a steady but gentle shower it was very curious to look up and see the innumerable drops falling slowly from the bright opening above down to the marble floor this opening is the only window there is no other place as you will see by the engraving where light can come in  the margin of the opening is formed of an immense brass ring such a ring is necessary in a structure like this and it must be of great thickness and strength to resist the pressure of the stones crowding in upon it all around  this pantheon was built by the ancient romans two thousand years ago what it was built for originally nobody now knows in modern times it has been changed into a church it is immensely large being nearly a hundred and fifty feet in diameter and a hundred and fifty feet high if you will inquire and ascertain what is the size of some large building in your vicinity and compare it with these dimensions you will form a clearer idea of the magnitude of this ancient edifice than you can acquire in any other way  rollo and his party rambled about the pantheon looking at the statues and paintings and chapels and observing the groups of pilgrims and of visitors that were continually coming and going for nearly an hour by this time the shower had entirely passed away and the sun having come out bright they all walked home     chapter ix  going to ostia   while rollo was at rome he made the acquaintance of a boy named copley copley was an english boy and he was about a year older than rollo rollo first saw him at the door of the hotel as he copley was dismounting from his horse on his return from a ride which he had been taking into the country he had been attended on his ride by a servant man named thomas thomas dismounted from his horse first and held the bridle of copleys horse while copley dismounted  there said copley walking off with a very grand air and leaving his horse in thomass hands take the horse thomas and never bring me such an animal as that again next time i ride i shall take jessie  but mr william has forbidden me to give you jessie said thomas he says she is not safe  its none of his business said copley he thinks because he is a little older than i am and because he is marriedthough he has not been married much more than a monththat he has a right to order me about just as he pleases and i am determined not to submit to itwould you  these last words were addressed to rollo copley had been advancing towards the door of the hotel while he had been speaking and had now just reached the step where rollo was standing  who is he asked rollo who is william  he is my brother said copley but that has nothing to do with it  are you under his care asked rollo  why i am travelling with him said copley but he has no business on that account to lord it over me i have as good a right to have my way as he has to have his  some further conversation then followed between copley and rollo in which the former said that he had been for several weeks in rome in company with his brother he had an uncle too in town he said at another hotel  but i stay with my brother said copley because he is going to make a longer journey and i want to go with him  where is he going asked rollo  why we have engaged a vetturino replied copley and are going to travel slowly to florence and from florence into the northern part of italy to milan and venice and all those places then afterwards we shall go over by some of the passes of the alps into switzerland i like to travel in that way i have so much fun in seeing the towns and the country besides when we travel with a vetturino i almost always ride on the outside seat with him and he lets me drive sometimes  then your uncle is not going that way said rollo  no replied copley he is going directly home by water he is going down to civita vecchia to take the steamer there for marseilles and i dont want to go that way  copley then asked rollo to go out into the corso with him he said that he saw a shop there as he was coming home which had a great display of whips at the window and he wanted to buy a whip so that when they set out on their journey he could have a whip of his own  the vetturino never will let me have his whip said he the lash is so long that he says i shall get it entangled in the harness thats no reason for he is always getting it entangled himself but thats his excuse and so i am going to have a whip of my own  well said rollo i rather think i will go with you but you must wait here for me a minute or two i must go up to my room first but i will come directly down again  rollo wished to go up to his room to ask his uncles permission to go with copley he made it an invariable rule never to go any where without his uncles permission mr george was always ready to give permission in such cases unless there was some really good and substantial reason for withholding it and whenever mr george withheld his consent from any of rollos proposals rollo always submitted at once without making any difficulty even when he thought that his uncle was wrong and that he might have consented as well as not  it was not altogether principle on the part of rollo that made him pursue this course it was in a great measure policy  i like travelling about the world with uncle george he used to say to himself and in order that i may travel with him a great deal i must make it for his interest to take me that is i must manage so that he will have a better time when i am with him than when he goes alone and in order to do this i must take care never to give him any trouble or concern of any kind on my account i must comply with his wishes in every thing and be satisfied with such pleasures and enjoyments as he fully approves  rollo did not think of this altogether of himself it was his father that put the idea into his mind he did it in a conversation that he had with rollo the day before he set out on the journey  rollo my boy said he in going on this journey into italy with your uncle george there is one danger that you will have to look out for very carefully  getting robbed by the brigands asked rollo  no said mr holiday it is something very different from that and a great deal worse that is to say the evil that you have to fear from it is a great deal worse than any thing that would probably happen to you by being robbed the danger is of your having too much independence or rather a wrong kind of independence what is independence  rollo reflected a moment in order properly to frame his answer to his fathers question he thought he knew very well what the meaning of the word independence was but he did not readily know how to clothe the meaning in language at last he said that he thought independence was doing what you thought was best yourself without regard to what other people thought  very well said his father thats a pretty good definition of it and now do you think it is a good quality or a bad quality  a good quality said rollo that is i suppose it is good he added hesitatingly but i dont know  it depends upon circumstances said mr holiday should you think that firing his gun when he thought best instead of when the captain thought best was a good thing in a soldier on the field of battle  no sir said rollo  and so would the independence of the colonel of a regiment continued mr holiday in marching when he thought best instead of when the general ordered him be a good quality or a bad quality  bad said rollo very bad indeed  independence is an excellent quality in its own right and proper sphere said mr holiday but when it takes the form of disregarding or rebelling against right and proper authority it is a very bad quality it cannot be tolerated if it were allowed generally to prevail among mankind the whole world would be thrown into confusion and nothing could go on this is now the kind of independence that you must guard against you are growing up rapidly and increasing in strength and knowledge every day you are becoming a young man and in a great many of the situations in which you are placed you are fully competent to take care of yourself still you are what the law calls a minor that is you have not arrived at an age when you can safely be your own master and support and take care of yourself consequently the law makes it your fathers duty for some years to come to furnish money for your support and to provide for you all necessary protection and the same law makes it your duty to be under my direction to conform your conduct to my judgment or in other words to do not as you think best but as i or whomsoever i may delegate to act in my stead thinks best this is reasonable as long as a boy depends upon his father for the means of his support it is right that he should act as his fathers judgment dictates it will be time enough for him to expect that he should act according to his own judgment in his conduct when he is able to earn his own living and so release his father from all responsibility on his account in a word the pecuniary responsibility of the father and the moral obligation of the son go together  yes father said rollo i think that is all true  and now continued mr holiday i put you for this journey under your uncle georges care i delegate my parental power over you to him it is your duty therefore to obey him in all things and to comply with all his wishes just as you would if i were in his place  yes father said rollo i will  besides being your duty added mr holiday it is greatly for your interest to do so if you begin to show your independence as it is sometimes called and insist on doing what you think is best instead of what he thinks is best so as to cause him trouble and make him feel anxious and uneasy on your account you will spoil the pleasure of his journey and he will not wish to take you with him again  mr holiday had some further conversation with rollo on the subject and the effect of what he said was to lead rollo to think more than he otherwise would have done on the proper course which a boy ought to pursue when travelling under the charge of his uncle and he resolved that he would in all cases not only obey implicitly his uncles commands but that he would comply readily and cordially with his wishes whenever he could ascertain them  accordingly in this case he would not go even out into the corso without first going up to obtain his uncles permission he opened the door of the room and found his uncle there writing a letter  uncle george said he here is a boy down below who asks me to go out into the corso with him  what boy is it asked mr george  i dont know what his name is said rollo he is an english boy i suppose he just came in from taking a ride on horseback  how long shall you probably be gone said mr george  i dont know said rollo hesitating perhaps about half an hour  very well said mr george you can be gone two hours if you choose if you form any plan that will require more time than that come home first and let me know  so rollo went down stairs again and having joined copley at the door they went together out towards the corso  in the mean time copleys brother william and his wife were waiting in their room for copley to come up they knew at what hour he would return from his ride and they had formed a plan for going in a carriage out upon the appian way to see some ancient ruins there they knew very well that copley would not care any thing about the ruins but he always liked to go with them when they took drives in the environs of rome the special reason why copley was so much interested in going on these excursions was that he was accustomed in such cases to sit on the front seat with the coachman as he did when travelling with the vetturins and sometimes he obtained permission to drive a little by secretly offering the coachman a piece of money mr william had charged his brother to come up to the parlor as soon as he came home from his ride and copley ought to have done so but it was never copleys practice to pay much heed to requests of this kind from his brother  mr william having waited for some time after he had seen the two horses arrive at the door wondering all the time why copley did not come up went down to the door to inquire what had become of him the concierge informed him that copley had gone away with another boy out to the corso so mr william ordered the carriage and he and his wife went away on their excursion alone  rollo and copley had a very pleasant walk along the corso they were obliged however to walk in the middle of the street for the sidewalks were so narrow and so irregular in shape sometimes growing narrower and narrower until at length there was scarcely any thing but the curbstone left that rollo and copley could not walk upon them  at last however they came to the place where copley had seen the whips copley had plenty of money but i do not know how he would have managed to buy one of the whips if rollo had not been with him for the man who had them to sell could only speak french and italian and copley did not know either of these languages he had been studying french it is true for several years in school but he had taken no interest in learning the language and the little knowledge of it which he had acquired was not of such a character as to be of any use to him as to the italian he knew nothing at all of it  accordingly rollo acted as interpreter  i might have brought our courier with us said copley only it is such a bore to have him about and you do just as well  after having bought the whip copley proposed that they should go to the diligence office and see if there were any diligences there about setting out on their journeys the diligence office which copley referred to was not in the corso but in another street at right angles to it when the boys reached the office they found that there were no diligences there so they rambled on without much idea of where they were going until at length they came to the river near one of the bridges leading across it a short distance below the bridge there was a small steamboat coming up the river  ah look there said copley theres a steamer coming where do you suppose that steamer is coming from  it is coming from ostia i suppose said rollo at any rate i know that there is a steamer that goes to ostia  let us go there said copley where is ostia  it is at the mouth of the river said rollo you may know that from the name ostia is the latin word for mouth  i hate latin said copley  the little steamer came rounding up to a pier not far below the bridge copley and rollo leaned over the parapet and looked to see the passengers get out but there were very few passengers to come the boys then went down towards the pier and on inquiring of a gentleman whom they saw there they found that the boat went down the river to ostia every morning and returned every night and copley immediately conceived the idea of going down in her  lets go down tomorrow said he it is just far enough for a pleasant sail  rollos imagination was quite taken with the idea of sailing down to ostia there seems to be something specially attractive to boys in the idea of sailing down to the mouths of rivers it is so pleasant to watch the gradual widening of the stream and to meet vessels coming up and to see the fishermens boats and the nets spread on the land and the little inlets with the tide flowing in and out and other indications of the approach towards the sea besides rollo wished very much to see what sort of a place ostia was  however he would not positively promise to go he said he should like to go very much but that he could not decide the question until he should go home  i must see uncle george first said rollo it is possible that he may have formed some engagement for me tomorrow  o never mind what engagement he has formed said copley tell him that you cant go with him because you have agreed to go down the river with me  no said rollo shaking his head  why what a little fool you are said copley  after remaining some time on the bridge looking at the steamer the boys returned home rollo took care to arrive at the hotel before the two hours were expired mr george had just finished his letter and was folding it up and sealing it  well rollo said mr george have you had a pleasant walk  very pleasant indeed said rollo we walked in the corso till copley had bought his whip and then we went on till we came to the bridge and there we saw a steamboat which goes to ostia and back copley wants me to go down with him in her tomorrow we shall get back about this time i suppose  mr george was at this time just writing the address on the back of his letter he did not say any thing but rollo observed a very slight and almost imperceptible shaking of his head  you dont like the plan very well uncle george said rollo  not very well said mr george i feel a little afraid of it  then it is of no consequence said rollo i dont care a great deal about going  most boys perhaps under these circumstances would have asked why in order that after hearing their uncles objections to their plans they might argue against them but rollo knew very well that this would be very bad policy for him  if uncle george finds that he has a long argument to maintain against me every time that he refuses me any thing said he to himself he will soon get tired of having me under his care  so he acquiesced at once in what he perceived was his uncles opinion and resolved to tell copley when he saw him that he could not go to ostia  copley was to have called that evening at rollos room to obtain his answer but on further reflection he concluded not to do so  indeed he had a secret feeling that neither rollos uncle nor his own brother would approve of the plan of two such boys going alone in such a country on an expedition which was entirely outside of the usual range of tourists and travellers that this expedition was outside the range was evident from the character of the steamboat that the boys had seen which was evidently not intended for the conveyance of ladies and gentlemen but of people of the countryand those moreover of the lowest class  so copley concluded that if he were to go at all to ostia it would be necessary for him to go by stealth and he resolved not to say any thing about his plan to his brother or sister he was very sure too that rollo would fail of obtaining his uncles consent so he concluded to say no more to rollo on the subject but instead of that he proposed the plan to another boy of his acquaintance who lodged with his friends at another hotel  the best way will be said he when he made the proposal for us not to tell any body where we are going  then theyll wonder where we are said the boy and be frightened half to death about us  but we can leave word when we go with the porter of the hotel or the concierge said copley that we have gone down the river in the steamboat and shall not be back till night  good said the other boy thats what well do  accordingly the next morning the two boys left word at their respective hotels where they were going and set forth they stole away very secretly and after running round the corner they crept along close to the wall of the hotel until they thought they were at a safe distance they reached the boat in good season went on board and in due time set sail  about ten oclock when the two boys had been gone about an hour mr william began to miss his brother and to wonder where he had gone so he rang the bell and his courier came into the room  pacifico said mr william do you know where copley is  no sir said pacifico i did not see him from since it was nine oclock  go down below said mr william and inquire of the concierge and the porters if they have seen him or know where he is  mr william followed pacifico as he went out in order to speak a moment to a friend of his who occupied the next apartment as he came back he met pacifico at the head of the stairs and received his answer there the answer was that copley had gone down the river to ostia with another boy  mr william was greatly astonished to hear this he however said nothing to pacifico but after pausing a moment as if reflecting upon what he had heard he went back into his own apartment  maria said he addressing his young wife where do you think copley has gone  i cannot imagine said maria  he has gone down the tiber in the steamer to ostia replied mr william  is it possible exclaimed maria in astonishment  yes said william and i am very glad of it  glad of it repeated maria surprised more and more  yes said mr william for it decides me what to do i shall send him home with his uncle i have been half inclined to do this for some time and this settles the question it destroys all the peace and comfort of our journey to have a boy with us that is determined to have his own way without regard to the inconvenience or anxiety that he occasions me  but how will you manage to get him to go with his uncle said maria he will refuse to go and insist on accompanying us for his uncle is going directly home which is what he does not wish to do  ill manage that said mr william ill take a hint from his own way of proceeding i will go off and leave him  o husband said maria that will never do  youll see how i will manage it said mr william  so saying mr william rang the bell pacifico immediately appeared  i wish to write a letter said mr william bring me some paper and pen and ink  pacifico brought the writing materials and laid them on the table  i have concluded to leave town this afternoon said mr william as he took up the pen and began to make preparations to write i intend to go as far as civita castellana tonight we will set out at two oclock i wish you to go and find our vetturino and direct him to be here half an hour before that time with the carriage to load the baggage he knows that we were going soon and he will be prepared in the mean time you may get our baggage ready copleys trunk however is not to go pack that and send it by a porter over to the hotel damerique i am going to leave him there under the care of his uncle  very well sir said pacifico i shall do it  pacifico retired and mr william proceeded to write his letter when it was finished he read it to his wife as follows it was addressed to his father in england                                                   rome june 20 1858  dear father we are all well and on the whole have enjoyed our residence in rome very much we are now however about ready to leave we set off this afternoon for florence and the north of italy  i have concluded all things considered to let copley return to you with his uncle though a pretty good boy in other respects he does not seem to be quite willing enough to submit to my direction to make it pleasant for me or safe for him that we should travel together i will not say that it is his fault altogether it is perhaps because there is not difference enough in our ages for him to feel that i ought to have any authority over him at any rate he is unwilling to acknowledge my authority and he takes so many liberties that i am kept in a constant state of anxiety on his account besides i do not think that it is safe for him to be so much at his own disposal this country is full of thieves brigands and rogues of the most desperate and reckless character and young men sometimes suffer extremely in falling into their hands copley is not aware of the danger and he thinks that the restraints which i feel compelled to impose upon him are unnecessary and vexatious often he will not submit to them today he has gone down the river on board one of the country steamers without saying any thing to me about it and though i do not suppose he will get into any difficulty in making such an excursion still the fact that he takes the liberty of doing such things keeps me continually uneasy about him and there is danger that sooner or later he will get into some serious trouble  i have accordingly concluded to leave him under uncles charge with a view of having him return with uncle to england by way of the mediterranean uncle will leave here in a few days and you may accordingly expect to see copley at home again in the course of a week after receiving this  with love from maria and myself for all at home i am your dutiful son                                                        william grant  mr william sealed his letter and then took it down to the bureau as the hotel office is called where he left it with the secretary of the hotel to be sent to the post office  he then went out at the front door of the hotel to the public square before it and there taking a carriage he ordered the coachman to drive to the hotel damerique when arrived there he went to his uncles apartment and explained the plan which he had formed and the reason for it his uncle said that he would very readily take copley under his charge mr william then said that he was intending to leave town that day but he should leave thomas at his hotel to wait for copley and bring him over to the hotel damerique as soon as he returned  this arrangement was carried into effect mr william directed thomas to remain in town to take care of copley on his return from ostia and deliver him safely into his uncles hands it occasioned mr william no inconvenience to leave thomas behind for a day since though thomas usually travelled in the same carriage with the family the vetturino himself always drove thomas together with pacifico the courier rode on an outside seat in front while copley sometimes rode inside though more frequently on the drivers seat by the side of the vetturino  thomas said mr grant in giving thomas his instructions i am going to set out on my journey this afternoon but i shall leave you behind to come on tonight by the diligence you will find me at the hotel of the post at civita castellana i wish you to wait here until copley comes home and then tell him that i have gone out of town and shall not be back tonight and that he is going to spend the night at the hotel damerique with his uncle do not tell him where i have gone nor that you are coming after me his uncle will tell him all tomorrow morning  in the mean time while these occurrences had been taking place at the hotel copley and his companion had been sailing down the river on board the little steamboat they had on the whole a pretty pleasant time though they were somewhat disappointed in the scenery on the banks of the river the country was perfectly bare of trees and destitute of all cultivation there were no villages and scarcely a human habitation to be seen the boys however met with no trouble and returned safely home about four oclock  copley found thomas waiting for him at the hotel door  mr copley said thomas as copley advanced towards the door your brother has gone out of town and will not be back tonight and i was to wait here for you and tell you that you were to go and spend the night at your uncles apartment at the hotel damerique  good said copley he felt quite relieved to find that his brother had gone away as he thus escaped the danger of being called to account for his misdemeanor  where has he gone asked copley  i cant say said thomas but perhaps your uncle can tell you  by the phrase i cant say thomas secretly meant that he was not at liberty to say though copley understood him to mean that he did not know  very well said copley i dont care where he has gone it makes no difference to me  copley found that it did make some difference to him when he learned the next morning that his brother had set out on his journey to the north of italy and to switzerland and had left him behind to return home at once with his uncle by sea his uncle did not tell him that night where his brother had gone for fear that copley might make some difficulty by insisting on going on after him in the diligence with thomas accordingly when copley asked the question his uncle only answered vaguely that his brother had gone out somewhere into the environs of rome the next morning however he handed copley a note which his brother had left for him which note copley on opening it found to be as follows                                                      wednesday morning  dear copley i have concluded to set out this afternoon on my journey north i am sorry that you are not here to bid me good by i did not know that you were going down the river  it must be hard for a boy as old as you to be under the command of one who is after all only his brotherand not a great many years older than he is himselffor i am not quite ten years older than you i know you have found this hard and so i have concluded that you had better return home with uncle one of these days when you grow up to manhood you can make a journey into italy again and then you will be your own master and can do as you please without any danger wishing you a very pleasant voyage                   i am your affectionate brother                                                        william grant  copleys indignation and rage at reading this letter seemed at first to know no bounds he was however entirely helpless his brother had gone and he did not even know what road he had taken thomas had gone too so that there was no help for him whatever  in two days after that he went with his uncle to civita vecchia the port of rome on the mediterranean and there embarked on board the steamer for marseilles direct and so returned to england     chapter x  the vatican   on the day when rollo went with charles and allie to see the tarpeian rock the reader will perhaps recollect that mr george was engaged at the reading room in reading the american papers which had that morning arrived when rollo returned from his excursion he found that mr george had not got home and he accordingly concluded to go to the reading room and see if he could find him  this reading room is attached to an english bookstore and library and is a great place of resort for visitors at rome it is situated at the end of the piazza di spagna which is one of the principal and most frequented public squares in rome this square contains several of the chief hotels and a great many shops the bookstore of piale is the general centre of news and intelligence for all english and american visitors here people come to make inquiries for their friends for there is a register kept at the library with the names of all the english and american visitors in rome recorded in it and the addresses of the hotels or private houses where they are lodging here all sorts of notices are posted up such as advertisements of things lost or found of parties forming for excursions of couriers wanting places or families wanting couriers of paintings for sale carriages for sale or for hireand all such things  piales establishment contains a number of different rooms the first that rollo entered on arriving at the place was the bookstore this was a small room there was a desk at one end where a clerk was sitting there were shelves filled with books all around the room and a large table in the centre which was also covered with books arranged in tiers one above the other in a sloping direction there were several doors leading off from this apartment one of which led to a room where a circulating library was kept and another to the reading room  when rollo entered the bookstore he saw several groups of visitors there there were two or three ladies looking over the books on the shelves there was a group of gentlemen standing near the desk talking together with a paper in their hands which seemed to contain a list of names just as rollo entered a carriage drove up to the door and two ladies dismounted from it and came in rollos attention was first attracted to these two ladies one of them on entering accosted the clerk and asked to look at the register the clerk immediately gave the two ladies seats at a side table where there was a large book full of names and addresses the ladies sat down and began to look over the book they had just arrived from naples and they wished to know what friends and acquaintances of theirs there were in town  rollo began to examine the books on the table or counter in the middle of the room and while doing so he happened to pass near the gentlemen that were looking at the paper  we want twelve said one of the gentlemen and we have got only nine  yes said the other we want three more it must be that there are a great many in town who would like to go if we could only find them out  rollos attention was immediately arrested by these words it was obvious that the gentlemen were forming a party to go somewhere or to see something and he felt quite confident that his uncle george would like to join them  at any rate said he to himself i should like to go wherever it is  so rollo summoned courage to accost the persons who were consulting together and to ask them if they wished to find some gentlemen to make up a party  gentlemen or ladies either said one of them no matter which we are making up a party to go and see the statues in the vatican by torch light  when rollo heard the words torch light his interest in the proposed party was greatly increased and he said he had no doubt that his uncle would like to go  i am very sure he would like to go said rollo and to take me  very well said one of the gentlemen that will make two and we only want three where is your uncle  he is in the reading room said rollo wait a moment and ill call him  thats right said the gentleman tell him it will cost us a scudo and a half apiece  so rollo taking out half a paul from his pocketthat being the price of admission to the reading room for a single dayand giving it to the clerk at the desk opened a door by the side of the desk and passed into the reading room instead of being only one reading room however he found that there were two with an open door leading from one to the other there were a great number of very comfortable sofas and arm chairs all about these rooms and great tables in the middle of them covered with newspapers and magazines the walls of both rooms were completely covered with paintings of all sizes most of which had been left there for sale there were a great many gentlemen sitting around the tables and upon the sofas reading among them rollo soon found mr george he had established himself in a comfortable arm chair near a great window that looked out upon the square but he was obliged to keep the curtain down on account of the beggars outside that gave him no peace as long as they could see him  uncle george said rollo here are some gentlemen who want to make up a party to go and see something by torch light and i thought that perhaps you and i would like to join it  where is it that they are going asked mr georgeto the vatican  yes said rollo it is the vatican a scudo and a half apiece  very well said mr george i should like to go where are the gentlemen  they are out here in the bookstore come out and i will show them to you  so mr george laid down his paper and followed rollo out into the bookstore rollo led the way to the place where the gentlemen were standing and then introduced his uncle in a distinct and audible voice thus  this is my uncle gentlemen mr george holiday  the gentlemen greeted mr holiday in a very polite manner and informed him of their plan and that they wanted three more names to make up the necessary number for a party  and here i ought to say in explanation that what is called the vatican is a vast collection of very magnificent and imposing buildingsconsisting of palaces chapels halls galleries and the like almost without numberand it is filled with paintings sculptures manuscripts books jewels gems and other curiosities and treasures of incalculable value it is situated in close proximity to the great church of st petersthe largest and most gorgeous church in the world indeed the church and the palaces form as it were one vast architectural pile which is of almost inconceivable magnificence and grandeur  the various edifices which compose the vatican were several centuries in building and the immense magnitude and extent of the edifice and the exhaustless wealth of the treasures of art deposited there astonish every beholder the buildings are so extensive that they require eight grand staircases and two hundred smaller ones to gain access to the different stories there are twenty open courts and over four thousand different rooms some of these rooms are galleries nearly a quarter of a mile long and are filled on each side with sculptures and statuary or other works of art from end to end the length of these galleries is not however out of proportion to other parts of the structure the church of st peters including the portico is considerably more than a quarter of a mile long  now among the treasures of the vatican are an immense number of ancient statues which were dug up in the middle ages in and around rome and some of these sculptures are the most celebrated works of art in the world they are arranged with great care in a great number of beautiful chambers and halls and are visited during the daytime by thousands of people that have come to rome from every part of the world the picture galleries the collection of ancient curiosities and the library rooms containing the books and manuscripts are also in the same manner thrown open and they are thronged with visitors almost all the time these apartments are so numerous and so extensive that in one day a person can do little else than to walk through them and give one general gaze of bewildering wonder at the whole scene and a very long walk it is i can assure you at one time when i set out from the painting rooms which are far in the interior of the buildings with a party of friends intending to go out in order to go home we walked steadily on at our ordinary pace without stopping or deviating from our way and we found that it took us twenty minutes to get out to our carriage  in addition to these visits made during the day small parties are sometimes formed to visit the galleries of statuary by night it is found that the illumination of a torch by the strong contrasts of light and shade which it produces brings out the expression of the statues in a very striking manner so as to produce sometimes a most wonderful effect  it is however somewhat expensive to exhibit these statues by torch light partly on account of the cost of the torches and partly on account of the attendants that are required the cost is nearly twenty dollars it is accordingly customary to make up a party whenever an evening visit to the vatican is proposed in order to divide the expense the number that can see the statues to advantage in these evening visits is from twelve to fifteen a party of twelve is sufficient to pay the expense at the rate of a scudo and a half for each person7  footnote 7 the scudo is the roman dollar it is worth considerably more than the american dollar  it was such a plan as this that the gentlemen were forming whose party mr george and rollo were now proposing to join  the gentlemen had been much pleased with rollos appearance and demeanor when he accosted them and they were now still more pleased when they saw mr george to find that he was a young gentleman of about their own age and that he was so prepossessing in his countenance and in his air and manner mr george readily agreed to join the party they asked him if he knew of any body else that he thought would like to go he inquired whether there were to be any ladies in the party they said that there were to be several then said mr george i will be responsible for the twelfth place i am quite sure that i can find some person that would like to go  and suppose i find more than one said mr george  that will do no harm replied the gentlemen we can have from twelve to fifteen in the party  then i will take the three places said mr george and i will pay my proportion now which of you gentlemen acts as treasurer  one of the three gentlemen said that he had undertaken to collect and pay over the money but he added that it was not necessary for mr george to pay at that time mr george however preferred to do so and he accordingly took out his purse and paid his four scudi and a half which was the amount due for three persons the gentlemen seemed to be quite pleased to find that their party was thus made up and they told mr george that since he had taken and paid for the three remaining places he might bring with him any number of persons that he pleased so long as he did not make the party more than fifteen in all it was agreed too that the party was to rendezvous that evening at eight oclock at the foot of the grand staircase leading from the portico of st peters up to the principal court of the vatican  mr george as soon as he went home sent rollo to mrs beekmans room to inform her of the proposed party and to ask her if she would like to join it  and may i invite allie too asked rollo  yes said mr george and charles though i dont think they will wish to go for such children generally feel very little interest in statues  it is true that young persons like charles and allie generally feel little interest in sculptures and statuary but on the other hand they feel a very great interest in torch light and both charles and allie were exceedingly eager to join the party it was finally agreed that all three should go it was arranged that mr george and rollo were to call for them at seven oclock mr beekman was engaged to dine that evening with a party of gentlemen and so he was left out of the account altogether  at seven oclock accordingly mr george and rollo called at mrs beekmans rooms and a few minutes afterwards they all went together down to the door of the hotel where mr george beckoned to the coachman of one of the carriages that stood in the square  the whole party entered the carriage after mr george had made his bargain with the coachman and immediately set off they rode for some distance along a pretty straight road and then came to a bridge which was opposite to a great round castle they went over this bridge and then turning to the left under the walls of the castle they went on towards the vatican  we shall arrive there some time before the hour said mr george but i thought it was better to be too early than too late  yes replied mrs beekman we can amuse ourselves half an hour in rambling about the colonnades and porticos of st peters  in front of st peters there is an immense area enclosed on each side by a magnificent semicircular colonnade there are four rows of lofty columns in this colonnade with a carriage way in the centre between them the space enclosed between these colonnades is called the piazzaa and it is adorned with fountains and colossal statues and on days of public festivities and celebrations it is filled with an immense concourse of people it is large enough to contain a great many thousands  8footnote 8 a pronounced piatza  when mr george and his party arrived they dismissed the carriage and began to walk to and fro under the colonnade and about the piazza the time passed away very rapidly and at length a few minutes before eight the other carriages began to come all the persons who belonged to the party were anxious to arrive in time for they were afraid that if they were too late the others would have gone into the vatican where the building being so immense it might be very difficult to find them  accordingly before the clock struck eight all the party were assembled at the entrance door  the entrance opened from a vast covered gallery which formed one of the approaches to st peters between the end of the colonnade and the main front of the building there were several swiss sentinels on guard here they were dressed in what seemed to rollo a very fantastic garb in a few minutes the men who were to accompany the party through the galleries appeared one of them carried a great number of very long candles under his arm another had a long pole with a socket at the top of it and a semicircular screen of tin on one side to screen the light of the candles from the eyes of the visitors and to throw it upon the statues when all was ready these torch bearers moved on and were followed by the whole party up the great staircase which led to the galleries of the vatican  after going upward and onward for some time they came at length to the entrance of one of the long galleries of sculpture here the torch bearers stopped and began to prepare their torches they cut the long candles in two so as to make pieces about eighteen inches long taking six or eight of these pieces they placed them together like a bundle of sticks and tied them and then crowded the ends together into the socket upon the end of the pole this socket was made large enough to receive them they then lighted the wicks and thus they had a large number of candles all burning together as one  the screen which i have already spoken of covered this blaze of light upon one side so as to keep it from shining upon the faces of the company  thus provided the torch bearers went on and the company followed them of course there is only time in the two hours usually appropriated to this exhibition to show a comparatively small number of the statues the torch bearers accordingly selected such as they thought were most important to be seen and they passed rapidly on from one to another of these omitting all the others when they approached a statue which they were going to exhibit they would hold the torch up near the face of it in such a manner as to throw a strong light upon the features and so bring out the expression in a striking manner the screen shielded the eyes of the company from the direct rays of the flame and yet there was sufficient light reflected from the marble walls of the gallery and from the beautiful white surfaces of the statues arranged along them to enable the company to discern each other very distinctly and to see all the objects around them  the company passed in this manner through one of the long galleries stopping here and there to look at the great masterpieces of ancient art and then they entered into a series of comparatively smaller chambers and halls rollo was exceedingly interested in the exhibition and in all the attendant circumstances of it but he could not tell whether allie was pleased or not she seemed bewildered and struck dumb with amazement at the strange aspect of the scenes and spectacles which were continually presented to view the immense extent and the gorgeous magnificence of the galleries and halls the countless multitude of statues and the almost spectral appearance which they assumed when the torch bearers threw the bright light of the torch upon their cold marble faces all impressed her with a solemn awe which seemed so entirely to subdue and silence her that rollo could not tell how she felt or what she thought of the strange spectacle which he had brought her to see  after about an hour the first set of candles that had been put into the socket of the torch pole were burned down and then the torch bearers supplied their places with another set formed by the remaining halves of the candles which they had cut in two these lasted another hour by that time the company had seen all the most striking and celebrated statues in the principal halls and galleries they had been making a sort of circuit through the palace in passing through these rooms and now came out very near the entrance door where they had come in here the torch bearers left them and went away with their apparatus to the part of the building where they belonged while the company descending the grand staircase came out into one of the porticos of the church and issuing from the portico they found carriages in waiting upon the piazza and ready to convey them home mr george and his party reached their hotel about nine oclock all very much pleased with the spectacle which they had witnessed     chapter xi  conclusion   rollo was so much pleased with his torch light visit to the vatican and he found moreover on talking with charles and allie about it the next day so much evidence of their having been greatly pleased with it that he planned a few days afterwards a torch light visit to the coliseum it is very common to make moonlight visits to the coliseum but rollo thought a torch light view of the majestic old ruin would be better on proposing his plan to his uncle mr george said that he had no objection to it if rollo would make all the arrangements he did not know any thing about it himself he said  rollo said he had no doubt that he could arrange it with the help of a commissioner  illustration coliseum by torchlight  so rollo looked out a good commissioner and the commissioner arranged the plan i have not space to describe this visit fully but must pass on to the conclusion of the book i will only say that the torches which were employed on this occasion were different from those employed in the exhibition of the statues in the vatican being more like those used by firemen in america there were also more of them in number the commissioner having provided four with these torch bearers to light their way rollos party explored the coliseum in every part and they found that the grandeur and sublimity of the immense corridors and vast vaulted passages of the ruin were greatly enhanced by the solemnity of the night and by the flickering glare of the torches shining upon the massive piers and into the dark recesses of the ruin  i do not know how many more torch light visits to wonderful places in rome rollo would have planned had not the time arrived when mr george thought it was necessary for them to go back to france  it is getting late in the season said mr george and every body is leaving rome i dont think it is safe for us to remain much longer here ourselves on account of the fever  rome is extremely unhealthy in the summer months and in the environs there is a very wide tract of country which is almost entirely uninhabitable all the year round on account of the prevalence of fever  very well said rollo we will go whenever you please  we must take our places in the steamer and in the diligences several days beforehand said mr george we will go to the steamboat office today  there are several lines of steamers that go from rome to marseilles which is the port of landing for travellers going to france and england some of these steamers go direct across the sea while others coast along the shore sailing at night and stopping during the day at the large towns on the route the first night they go to leghorn the second to genoa and the third to marseilles at first mr george thought that he would take one of these coasting steamers but he finally concluded to go direct  it would be very pleasant said he to rollo for us to stop at those towns and ramble about during the day and then in the evening set sail again provided we could be at liberty to land at our pleasure to ramble about unmolested wherever we wished to go as we can do in america  and cant we do so asked rollo  no said mr george in the first place we must have our passports stamped here for all the places that we wish to visit and that will cause us here a great deal of trouble and not a little expense then to land we must have our passports all examined again and stamped and there will be more money to pay and likely as not we should be detained half the morning in getting through all these formalities and so our time would be passed in fruitless vexation instead of pleasure then when at last we were free and began our rambles we should be beset by beggars every where and have no peace  what a foolish plan it is to plague travellers so much with all these ceremonies about passports said rollo  i am not certain that it is foolish for such governments as these replied mr george you see they are governments of force maintained over the people against their will by means of military power the people at large hate the government and are all the time plotting to destroy it and if the plotters were allowed to go freely to and fro all over the country they would be able to organize their plans and general insurrections would be arranged and the governments might thus be overthrown by allowing nobody to travel without a passport stating who he is and where he came from and where he is going the government keep every thing under their control  but i think the governments ought to be overthrown said rollo and better governments such as the people would like set up in their places  so do i said mr george but it is not surprising that the governors themselves of these countries dont think so they wish to retain their stations and their power whether the people like it or not and the passport system is a very cunning contrivance to help them do it and then besides they have a very good pretext for keeping up the system  what is their pretext asked rollo  they pretend that the object is to assist them in stopping and arresting robbers and murderers and other criminals who attempt to escape from one part of the country to another after committing their crimes and the system is sometimes useful in this way i have no doubt though these criminals can often elude the authorities by procuring false passports  and the plotters against the government too i suppose said rollo  yes said mr george sometimes  this conversation took place while mr george and rollo were walking towards the steamboat office to take their passages to marseilles  they arrived at the office the clerk answered their inquiries in respect to the steamer with great politeness the conversation was in the french language he told them that the steamer started from naples every evening and that it stopped in the morning about eight oclock at civita vecchia9 to take in the passengers from rome it was necessary for the passengers to go from rome to civita vecchia by diligence or by post or with a vetturino  footnote 9 pronounced tchivita vekkia  then there are no carriages from your office said mr george  no sir replied the clerk we take the passengers at civita vecchia they find their own conveyances there  very well said mr george i will take two berths in the steamer for thursday morning can i see a plan of the steamer so as to select the berths  no sir said the clerk we have no plan of the steamer and besides we cannot positively promise you any berths it depends upon how many passengers there are from naples the passengers from rome take the berths that are left vacant they take them in the order in which they take passage here  are there many that have taken passage before us asked mr george  no sir said the clerk only two your numbers are 3 and 4  then if there are more than two berths that are not occupied by the naples passengers we can have them  yes sir said the clerk  and suppose there are not more than two asked rollo what shall we do then  why then you will have sofas or cots said the clerk  o that will do just as well said rollo i would as lief have a sofa or a cot as a berth  so mr george paid the money and took tickets numbers 3 and 4 and then having inquired the way to the diligence office they bade the clerk good morning and went away  and now said mr george we must go directly to the diligence office and secure our places for civita vecchia if we put it off the places might all be taken and then we should lose the passage money we have paid for the steamer  would not they pay us back again asked rollo  i am afraid not said mr george but i think we are in season for it is now tuesday and we do not sail till thursday  on entering the diligence office mr george saw one or two clerks standing behind a counter they seemed busy talking with persons who had come in to engage places and entering their names in great books as soon as one of the clerks was at liberty mr george accosted him saying that he wished to get two places in the diligence for civita vecchia on wednesday  the clerk looked at the book and said that all the places were taken for wednesday except one  thats bad said mr george we shall have to go down on tuesday then and stay a day at civita vecchia are there any places for tuesday  the clerk looked and said that every place for tuesday was engaged  but there is a coach on wednesday night he added that arrives at civita vecchia in the morning in time for the steamer  then turning over to another place in his book he looked at the list of names and then told mr george that there was only one vacant place for wednesday night  dear me rollo said mr george how unfortunate we ought to have attended to this business before  ill tell you what we can do said rollo one of us can go on wednesday morning and the other wait here and come on in the night  that is the only thing that we can do said mr george unless we hire a carriage to ourselves and that would be expensive should you dare to go alone  o yes indeed said rollo  but remember said mr george that all the people will be speaking italian you will have to ride among them like a deaf and dumb boy  never mind that said rollo deaf and dumb boys get along in travelling very well besides i am almost sure that there will be somebody in the diligence that can speak french or english  and which would you rather do asked mr george go in the morning or in the evening if you go in the morning coach you will have to set out very early before it is light and then stay at civita vecchia in a strange hotel alone all night if you go in the evening you can remain here where you are acquainted all day but then you will have to ride alone in the night  i would rather go in the morning coach said rollo  very well said mr george thats what well do  this conversation between mr george and rollo had been carried on in english but now mr george turned to the clerk and said in french that he would take the two places that were left one in the morning coach and one in the evening coach of wednesday the place in the morning coach was upon the banquette the one in the evening coach was in the coupé mr george had scarcely uttered the words by which he engaged the seats before two gentlemen came in in a hurried manner to ask for seats in the diligence for wednesday the clerk told them that the last of them had just been engaged  when wednesday morning came rollo was awakened by the porter of the hotel knocking at his door before it was light he got up and opened the door a little way and took in the candles which the porter handed to him mr george had intended to get up too and go with rollo to the office but rollo particularly desired that he should not do so  i have nothing to carry said he but my little valise and the porter will go with me to take that and to see me safe through the streets so that it is not at all necessary for you to go and i would much rather not have you go  mr george perceived that rollo felt a pride in taking care of himself on this occasion and so he yielded to this request and remained in his bed if he had not been convinced that rollo would be perfectly safe under the porters care he would of course have insisted on going himself rollo was soon dressed and then going to his uncles bedside he shook hands with him and bade him good by  i shall be looking out for you at the diligence office in civita vecchia said he when the diligence arrives tomorrow morning  so saying he took his candle in one hand and his valise in the other and sallied forth into the long corridor of the hotel he had to walk a a great distance along this corridor passing a great many doors with a pair of boots or shoes before each of them before he reached the head of the staircase he descended the staircase and at the bottom of it found the porter waiting for him the porter had another candle which was upon a table in the hall he took rollos candle and also the valise and then unbolted and unlocked the front door a sleepylooking boy was ready to lock it again after rollo and the porter had gone out  so they sallied forth into the cool morning air there were lamps burning in the streets and in one direction where there was an opening among the buildings rollo could see some faint signs of the dawn in the eastern sky  the porter could only speak italian so he and rollo walked along together in silence through the solitary streets they soon arrived at the diligence office where there was a bright light of lanterns and a bustle of people coming and going and of postilions bringing out horses the diligence was all ready before the door the baggage which had been brought for the purpose the night before was all loaded rollo paid the porter and then climbed up to his place on the banquette the horses were soon harnessed in and the diligence set off but there were several stoppages necessary at police stations and passport offices before the journey was fairly commenced so that the sun was rising when rollo took his final leave of rome  he had a very pleasant journey across the country and arrived at civita vecchia about three oclock as he descended from the coach a pleasantlooking man in a sort of official costume accosted him asking him if he was going to leghorn in the steamer that afternoon the man spoke in english though with a foreign accent  no said rollo i am going to marseilles tomorrow morning  ah then you go to the hotel said the man this porter will take your valise and show you the way  so saying the man who was a commissioner of the hotel put rollo under the charge of a porter who conducted him to a large and very substantiallooking hotel near by rollo ascended by a flight of stone stairs into the second story of the hotel and there engaged a room for the night and ordered dinner he had a very good dinner all by himself in a great dining room with long tables in it where there were at the same time several other persons and parties dining after dinner he went out to ramble about the town he was surprised at the massive masonry of the piers and breakwaters and forts that lined the shores and at the number of vessels and steamers in the basin he returned to the hotel in good season and amused himself there till nine oclock observing the different parties of travellers that were continually coming and going  the next morning he watched for the diligence from a piazza on the second story of the hotelthe diligence office being at the next door the diligence arrived at the proper time and rollo called out to his uncle george when he saw him getting out from the coupé this was at seven oclock at eight mr george and rollo embarked with a great many others in a small boat to go on board the steamer and at half past eight the paddles of the steamer began to revolve and to bear them rapidly away from the shores of italy out over the blue waters of the mediterranean on the route to marseilles
