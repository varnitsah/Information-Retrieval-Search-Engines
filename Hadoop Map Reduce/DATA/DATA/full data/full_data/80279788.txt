relation to the writer of the following narratives is such that i must ask the reader to overlook the absence of explanation as to how they came into my possession  withal my knowledge of him is so meager that i should rather not undertake to say if he were himself persuaded of the truth of what he relates certainly such inquiries as i have thought it worth while to set about have not in every instance tended to confirmation of the statements made  yet his style for the most part devoid alike of artifice and art almost baldly simple and direct seems hardly compatible with the disingenuousness of a merely literary intention one would call it the manner of one more concerned for the fruits of research than for the flowers of expression  in transcribing his notes and fortifying their claim to attention by giving them something of an orderly arrangement i have conscientiously refrained from embellishing them with such small ornaments of diction as i may have felt myself able to bestow which would not only have been impertinent even if pleasing but would have given me a somewhat closer relation to the work than i should care to have and to avowa b    present at a hanging    an old man named daniel baker living near lebanon iowa was suspected by his neighbors of having murdered a peddler who had obtained permission to pass the night at his house  this was in 1853 when peddling was more common in the western country than it is now and was attended with considerable danger  the peddler with his pack traversed the country by all manner of lonely roads and was compelled to rely upon the country people for hospitality  this brought him into relation with queer characters some of whom were not altogether scrupulous in their methods of making a living murder being an acceptable means to that end  it occasionally occurred that a peddler with diminished pack and swollen purse would be traced to the lonely dwelling of some rough character and never could be traced beyond  this was so in the case of old man baker as he was always called  such names are given in the western settlements only to elderly persons who are not esteemed to the general disrepute of social unworth is affixed the special reproach of age  a peddler came to his house and none went awaythat is all that anybody knew  seven years later the rev mr cummings a baptist minister well known in that part of the country was driving by bakers farm one night  it was not very dark  there was a bit of moon somewhere above the light veil of mist that lay along the earth  mr cummings who was at all times a cheerful person was whistling a tune which he would occasionally interrupt to speak a word of friendly encouragement to his horse  as he came to a little bridge across a dry ravine he saw the figure of a man standing upon it clearly outlined against the gray background of a misty forest  the man had something strapped on his back and carried a heavy stick obviously an itinerant peddler  his attitude had in it a suggestion of abstraction like that of a sleepwalker  mr cummings reined in his horse when he arrived in front of him gave him a pleasant salutation and invited him to a seat in the vehicleif you are going my way he added  the man raised his head looked him full in the face but neither answered nor made any further movement the minister with goodnatured persistence repeated his invitation  at this the man threw his right hand forward from his side and pointed downward as he stood on the extreme edge of the bridge  mr cummings looked past him over into the ravine saw nothing unusual and withdrew his eyes to address the man again  he had disappeared  the horse which all this time had been uncommonly restless gave at the same moment a snort of terror and started to run away  before he had regained control of the animal the minister was at the crest of the hill a hundred yards along  he looked back and saw the figure again at the same place and in the same attitude as when he had first observed it  then for the first time he was conscious of a sense of the supernatural and drove home as rapidly as his willing horse would go  on arriving at home he related his adventure to his family and early the next morning accompanied by two neighbors john white corwell and abner raiser returned to the spot  they found the body of old man baker hanging by the neck from one of the beams of the bridge immediately beneath the spot where the apparition had stood a thick coating of dust slightly dampened by the mist covered the floor of the bridge but the only footprints were those of mr cummings horse  in taking down the body the men disturbed the loose friable earth of the slope below it disclosing human bones already nearly uncovered by the action of water and frost  they were identified as those of the lost peddler  at the double inquest the coroners jury found that daniel baker died by his own hand while suffering from temporary insanity and that samuel morritz was murdered by some person or persons to the jury unknown    a cold greeting    this is a story told by the late benson foley of san francisco  in the summer of 1881 i met a man named james h conway a resident of franklin tennessee  he was visiting san francisco for his health deluded man and brought me a note of introduction from mr lawrence barting  i had known barting as a captain in the federal army during the civil war  at its close he had settled in franklin and in time became i had reason to think somewhat prominent as a lawyer  barting had always seemed to me an honorable and truthful man and the warm friendship which he expressed in his note for mr conway was to me sufficient evidence that the latter was in every way worthy of my confidence and esteem  at dinner one day conway told me that it had been solemnly agreed between him and barting that the one who died first should if possible communicate with the other from beyond the grave in some unmistakable wayjust how they had left wisely it seemed to me to be decided by the deceased according to the opportunities that his altered circumstances might present  a few weeks after the conversation in which mr conway spoke of this agreement i met him one day walking slowly down montgomery street apparently from his abstracted air in deep thought  he greeted me coldly with merely a movement of the head and passed on leaving me standing on the walk with halfproffered hand surprised and naturally somewhat piqued  the next day i met him again in the office of the palace hotel and seeing him about to repeat the disagreeable performance of the day before intercepted him in a doorway with a friendly salutation and bluntly requested an explanation of his altered manner  he hesitated a moment then looking me frankly in the eyes said  i do not think mr foley that i have any longer a claim to your friendship since mr barting appears to have withdrawn his own from mefor what reason i protest i do not know  if he has not already informed you he probably will do so  but i replied i have not heard from mr barting  heard from him he repeated with apparent surprise  why he is here  i met him yesterday ten minutes before meeting you  i gave you exactly the same greeting that he gave me  i met him again not a quarter of an hour ago and his manner was precisely the same  he merely bowed and passed on  i shall not soon forget your civility to me  good morning oras it may please youfarewell  all this seemed to me singularly considerate and delicate behavior on the part of mr conway  as dramatic situations and literary effects are foreign to my purpose i will explain at once that mr barting was dead  he had died in nashville four days before this conversation  calling on mr conway i apprised him of our friends death showing him the letters announcing it  he was visibly affected in a way that forbade me to entertain a doubt of his sincerity  it seems incredible he said after a period of reflection  i suppose i must have mistaken another man for barting and that mans cold greeting was merely a strangers civil acknowledgment of my own  i remember indeed that he lacked bartings mustache  doubtless it was another man i assented and the subject was never afterward mentioned between us  but i had in my pocket a photograph of barting which had been inclosed in the letter from his widow  it had been taken a week before his death and was without a mustache    a wireless message    in the summer of 1896 mr william holt a wealthy manufacturer of chicago was living temporarily in a little town of central new york the name of which the writers memory has not retained  mr holt had had trouble with his wife from whom he had parted a year before  whether the trouble was anything more serious than incompatibility of temper he is probably the only living person that knows  he is not addicted to the vice of confidences  yet he has related the incident herein set down to at least one person without exacting a pledge of secrecy  he is now living in europe  one evening he had left the house of a brother whom he was visiting for a stroll in the country  it may be assumedwhatever the value of the assumption in connection with what is said to have occurred that his mind was occupied with reflections on his domestic infelicities and the distressing changes that they had wrought in his life  whatever may have been his thoughts they so possessed him that he observed neither the lapse of time nor whither his feet were carrying him he knew only that he had passed far beyond the town limits and was traversing a lonely region by a road that bore no resemblance to the one by which he had left the village  in brief he was lost  realizing his mischance he smiled central new york is not a region of perils nor does one long remain lost in it  he turned about and went back the way that he had come  before he had gone far he observed that the landscape was growing more distinctwas brightening  everything was suffused with a soft red glow in which he saw his shadow projected in the road before him  the moon is rising he said to himself  then he remembered that it was about the time of the new moon and if that tricksy orb was in one of its stages of visibility it had set long before  he stopped and faced about seeking the source of the rapidly broadening light  as he did so his shadow turned and lay along the road in front of him as before  the light still came from behind him  that was surprising he could not understand  again he turned and again facing successively to every point of the horizon  always the shadow was beforealways the light behind a still and awful red  holt was astonisheddumfounded is the word that he used in telling ityet seems to have retained a certain intelligent curiosity  to test the intensity of the light whose nature and cause he could not determine he took out his watch to see if he could make out the figures on the dial  they were plainly visible and the hands indicated the hour of eleven oclock and twentyfive minutes  at that moment the mysterious illumination suddenly flared to an intense an almost blinding splendor flushing the entire sky extinguishing the stars and throwing the monstrous shadow of himself athwart the landscape  in that unearthly illumination he saw near him but apparently in the air at a considerable elevation the figure of his wife clad in her nightclothing and holding to her breast the figure of his child  her eyes were fixed upon his with an expression which he afterward professed himself unable to name or describe further than that it was not of this life  the flare was momentary followed by black darkness in which however the apparition still showed white and motionless then by insensible degrees it faded and vanished like a bright image on the retina after the closing of the eyes  a peculiarity of the apparition hardly noted at the time but afterward recalled was that it showed only the upper half of the womans figure  nothing was seen below the waist  the sudden darkness was comparative not absolute for gradually all objects of his environment became again visible  in the dawn of the morning holt found himself entering the village at a point opposite to that at which he had left it  he soon arrived at the house of his brother who hardly knew him  he was wildeyed haggard and gray as a rat  almost incoherently he related his nights experience  go to bed my poor fellow said his brother andwait  we shall hear more of this  an hour later came the predestined telegram  holts dwelling in one of the suburbs of chicago had been destroyed by fire  her escape cut off by the flames his wife had appeared at an upper window her child in her arms  there she had stood motionless apparently dazed  just as the firemen had arrived with a ladder the floor had given way and she was seen no more  the moment of this culminating horror was eleven oclock and twenty five minutes standard time    an arrest    having murdered his brotherinlaw orrin brower of kentucky was a fugitive from justice  from the county jail where he had been confined to await his trial he had escaped by knocking down his jailer with an iron bar robbing him of his keys and opening the outer door walking out into the night  the jailer being unarmed brower got no weapon with which to defend his recovered liberty  as soon as he was out of the town he had the folly to enter a forest this was many years ago when that region was wilder than it is now  the night was pretty dark with neither moon nor stars visible and as brower had never dwelt thereabout and knew nothing of the lay of the land he was naturally not long in losing himself  he could not have said if he were getting farther away from the town or going back to ita most important matter to orrin brower  he knew that in either case a posse of citizens with a pack of bloodhounds would soon be on his track and his chance of escape was very slender but he did not wish to assist in his own pursuit  even an added hour of freedom was worth having  suddenly he emerged from the forest into an old road and there before him saw indistinctly the figure of a man motionless in the gloom  it was too late to retreat  the fugitive felt that at the first movement back toward the wood he would be as he afterward explained filled with buckshot  so the two stood there like trees brower nearly suffocated by the activity of his own heart the otherthe emotions of the other are not recorded  a moment laterit may have been an hourthe moon sailed into a patch of unclouded sky and the hunted man saw that visible embodiment of law lift an arm and point significantly toward and beyond him  he understood  turning his back to his captor he walked submissively away in the direction indicated looking to neither the right nor the left hardly daring to breathe his head and back actually aching with a prophecy of buckshot  brower was as courageous a criminal as ever lived to be hanged that was shown by the conditions of awful personal peril in which he had coolly killed his brotherinlaw  it is needless to relate them here they came out at his trial and the revelation of his calmness in confronting them came near to saving his neck  but what would you havewhen a brave man is beaten he submits  so they pursued their journey jailward along the old road through the woods  only once did brower venture a turn of the head  just once when he was in deep shadow and he knew that the other was in moonlight he looked backward  his captor was burton duff the jailer as white as death and bearing upon his brow the livid mark of the iron bar  orrin brower had no further curiosity  eventually they entered the town which was all alight but deserted only the women and children remained and they were off the streets  straight toward the jail the criminal held his way straight up to the main entrance he walked laid his hand upon the knob of the heavy iron door pushed it open without command entered and found himself in the presence of a halfdozen armed men  then he turned  nobody else entered  on a table in the corridor lay the dead body of burton duff     soldierfolk     a man with two lives    here is the queer story of david william duck related by himself duck is an old man living in aurora illinois where he is universally respected  he is commonly known however as dead duck  in the autumn of 1866 i was a private soldier of the eighteenth infantry  my company was one of those stationed at fort phil kearney commanded by colonel carrington  the country is more or less familiar with the history of that garrison particularly with the slaughter by the sioux of a detachment of eightyone men and officersnot one escapingthrough disobedience of orders by its commander the brave but reckless captain fetterman  when that occurred i was trying to make my way with important dispatches to fort c f smith on the big horn  as the country swarmed with hostile indians i traveled by night and concealed myself as best i could before daybreak  the better to do so i went afoot armed with a henry rifle and carrying three days rations in my haversack  for my second place of concealment i chose what seemed in the darkness a narrow canon leading through a range of rocky hills  it contained many large bowlders detached from the slopes of the hills  behind one of these in a clump of sagebrush i made my bed for the day and soon fell asleep  it seemed as if i had hardly closed my eyes though in fact it was near midday when i was awakened by the report of a rifle the bullet striking the bowlder just above my body  a band of indians had trailed me and had me nearly surrounded the shot had been fired with an execrable aim by a fellow who had caught sight of me from the hillside above  the smoke of his rifle betrayed him and i was no sooner on my feet than he was off his and rolling down the declivity  then i ran in a stooping posture dodging among the clumps of sagebrush in a storm of bullets from invisible enemies  the rascals did not rise and pursue which i thought rather queer for they must have known by my trail that they had to deal with only one man  the reason for their inaction was soon made clear  i had not gone a hundred yards before i reached the limit of my runthe head of the gulch which i had mistaken for a canon  it terminated in a concave breast of rock nearly vertical and destitute of vegetation  in that culdesac i was caught like a bear in a pen  pursuit was needless they had only to wait  they waited  for two days and nights crouching behind a rock topped with a growth of mesquite and with the cliff at my back suffering agonies of thirst and absolutely hopeless of deliverance i fought the fellows at long range firing occasionally at the smoke of their rifles as they did at that of mine  of course i did not dare to close my eyes at night and lack of sleep was a keen torture  i remember the morning of the third day which i knew was to be my last  i remember rather indistinctly that in my desperation and delirium i sprang out into the open and began firing my repeating rifle without seeing anybody to fire at  and i remember no more of that fight  the next thing that i recollect was my pulling myself out of a river just at nightfall  i had not a rag of clothing and knew nothing of my whereabouts but all that night i traveled cold and footsore toward the north  at daybreak i found myself at fort c f smith my destination but without my dispatches  the first man that i met was a sergeant named william briscoe whom i knew very well  you can fancy his astonishment at seeing me in that condition and my own at his asking who the devil i was  dave duck i answered who should i be  he stared like an owl  you do look it he said and i observed that he drew a little away from me  whats up he added  i told him what had happened to me the day before  he heard me through still staring then he said  my dear fellow if you are dave duck i ought to inform you that i buried you two months ago  i was out with a small scouting party and found your body full of bulletholes and newly scalped somewhat mutilated otherwise too i am sorry to sayright where you say you made your fight  come to my tent and ill show you your clothing and some letters that i took from your person the commandant has your dispatches  he performed that promise  he showed me the clothing which i resolutely put on the letters which i put into my pocket  he made no objection then took me to the commandant who heard my story and coldly ordered briscoe to take me to the guardhouse  on the way i said  bill briscoe did you really and truly bury the dead body that you found in these togs  sure he answeredjust as i told you  it was dave duck all right most of us knew him  and now you damned impostor youd better tell me who you are  id give something to know i said  a week later i escaped from the guardhouse and got out of the country as fast as i could  twice i have been back seeking for that fateful spot in the hills but unable to find it    three and one are one    in the year 1861 barr lassiter a young man of twentytwo lived with his parents and an elder sister near carthage tennessee  the family were in somewhat humble circumstances subsisting by cultivation of a small and not very fertile plantation  owning no slaves they were not rated among the best people of their neighborhood but they were honest persons of good education fairly well mannered and as respectable as any family could be if uncredentialed by personal dominion over the sons and daughters of ham  the elder lassiter had that severity of manner that so frequently affirms an uncompromising devotion to duty and conceals a warm and affectionate disposition  he was of the iron of which martyrs are made but in the heart of the matrix had lurked a nobler metal fusible at a milder heat yet never coloring nor softening the hard exterior  by both heredity and environment something of the mans inflexible character had touched the other members of the family the lassiter home though not devoid of domestic affection was a veritable citadel of duty and dutyah duty is as cruel as death  when the war came on it found in the family as in so many others in that state a divided sentiment the young man was loyal to the union the others savagely hostile  this unhappy division begot an insupportable domestic bitterness and when the offending son and brother left home with the avowed purpose of joining the federal army not a hand was laid in his not a word of farewell was spoken not a good wish followed him out into the world whither he went to meet with such spirit as he might whatever fate awaited him  making his way to nashville already occupied by the army of general buell he enlisted in the first organization that he found a kentucky regiment of cavalry and in due time passed through all the stages of military evolution from raw recruit to experienced trooper  a right good trooper he was too although in his oral narrative from which this tale is made there was no mention of that the fact was learned from his surviving comrades  for barr lassiter has answered here to the sergeant whose name is death  two years after he had joined it his regiment passed through the region whence he had come  the country thereabout had suffered severely from the ravages of war having been occupied alternately and simultaneously by the belligerent forces and a sanguinary struggle had occurred in the immediate vicinity of the lassiter homestead  but of this the young trooper was not aware  finding himself in camp near his home he felt a natural longing to see his parents and sister hoping that in them as in him the unnatural animosities of the period had been softened by time and separation  obtaining a leave of absence he set foot in the late summer afternoon and soon after the rising of the full moon was walking up the gravel path leading to the dwelling in which he had been born  soldiers in war age rapidly and in youth two years are a long time barr lassiter felt himself an old man and had almost expected to find the place a ruin and a desolation  nothing apparently was changed  at the sight of each dear and familiar object he was profoundly affected  his heart beat audibly his emotion nearly suffocated him an ache was in his throat  unconsciously he quickened his pace until he almost ran his long shadow making grotesque efforts to keep its place beside him  the house was unlighted the door open  as he approached and paused to recover control of himself his father came out and stood bare headed in the moonlight  father cried the young man springing forward with outstretched handfather  the elder man looked him sternly in the face stood a moment motionless and without a word withdrew into the house  bitterly disappointed humiliated inexpressibly hurt and altogether unnerved the soldier dropped upon a rustic seat in deep dejection supporting his head upon his trembling hand  but he would not have it so  he was too good a soldier to accept repulse as defeat  he rose and entered the house passing directly to the sittingroom  it was dimly lighted by an uncurtained east window  on a low stool by the hearthside the only article of furniture in the place sat his mother staring into a fireplace strewn with blackened embers and cold ashes  he spoke to hertenderly interrogatively and with hesitation but she neither answered nor moved nor seemed in any way surprised  true there had been time for her husband to apprise her of their guilty sons return  he moved nearer and was about to lay his hand upon her arm when his sister entered from an adjoining room looked him full in the face passed him without a sign of recognition and left the room by a door that was partly behind him  he had turned his head to watch her but when she was gone his eyes again sought his mother  she too had left the place  barr lassiter strode to the door by which he had entered  the moonlight on the lawn was tremulous as if the sward were a rippling sea  the trees and their black shadows shook as in a breeze blended with its borders the gravel walk seemed unsteady and insecure to step on  this young soldier knew the optical illusions produced by tears  he felt them on his cheek and saw them sparkle on the breast of his troopers jacket  he left the house and made his way back to camp  the next day with no very definite intention with no dominant feeling that he could rightly have named he again sought the spot within a halfmile of it he met bushrod albro a former playfellow and schoolmate who greeted him warmly  i am going to visit my home said the soldier  the other looked at him rather sharply but said nothing  i know continued lassiter that my folks have not changed but   there have been changes albro interruptedeverything changes ill go with you if you dont mind  we can talk as we go  but albro did not talk  instead of a house they found only fireblackened foundations of stone enclosing an area of compact ashes pitted by rains  lassiters astonishment was extreme  i could not find the right way to tell you said albro  in the fight a year ago your house was burned by a federal shell  and my familywhere are they  in heaven i hope  all were killed by the shell    a baffled ambuscade    connecting readyville and woodbury was a good hard turnpike nine or ten miles long  readyville was an outpost of the federal army at murfreesboro woodbury had the same relation to the confederate army at tullahoma  for months after the big battle at stone river these outposts were in constant quarrel most of the trouble occurring naturally on the turnpike mentioned between detachments of cavalry  sometimes the infantry and artillery took a hand in the game by way of showing their goodwill  one night a squadron of federal horse commanded by major seidel a gallant and skillful officer moved out from readyville on an uncommonly hazardous enterprise requiring secrecy caution and silence  passing the infantry pickets the detachment soon afterward approached two cavalry videttes staring hard into the darkness ahead  there should have been three  where is your other man said the major  i ordered dunning to be here tonight  he rode forward sir the man replied  there was a little firing afterward but it was a long way to the front  it was against orders and against sense for dunning to do that said the officer obviously vexed  why did he ride forward  dont know sir he seemed mighty restless  guess he was skeered  when this remarkable reasoner and his companion had been absorbed into the expeditionary force it resumed its advance  conversation was forbidden arms and accouterments were denied the right to rattle  the horses tramping was all that could be heard and the movement was slow in order to have as little as possible of that it was after midnight and pretty dark although there was a bit of moon somewhere behind the masses of cloud  two or three miles along the head of the column approached a dense forest of cedars bordering the road on both sides  the major commanded a halt by merely halting and evidently himself a bit skeered rode on alone to reconnoiter  he was followed however by his adjutant and three troopers who remained a little distance behind and unseen by him saw all that occurred  after riding about a hundred yards toward the forest the major suddenly and sharply reined in his horse and sat motionless in the saddle  near the side of the road in a little open space and hardly ten paces away stood the figure of a man dimly visible and as motionless as he  the majors first feeling was that of satisfaction in having left his cavalcade behind if this were an enemy and should escape he would have little to report  the expedition was as yet undetected  some dark object was dimly discernible at the mans feet the officer could not make it out  with the instinct of the true cavalryman and a particular indisposition to the discharge of firearms he drew his saber  the man on foot made no movement in answer to the challenge  the situation was tense and a bit dramatic  suddenly the moon burst through a rift in the clouds and himself in the shadow of a group of great oaks the horseman saw the footman clearly in a patch of white light  it was trooper dunning unarmed and bareheaded  the object at his feet resolved itself into a dead horse and at a right angle across the animals neck lay a dead man face upward in the moonlight  dunning has had the fight of his life thought the major and was about to ride forward  dunning raised his hand motioning him back with a gesture of warning then lowering the arm he pointed to the place where the road lost itself in the blackness of the cedar forest  the major understood and turning his horse rode back to the little group that had followed him and was already moving to the rear in fear of his displeasure and so returned to the head of his command  dunning is just ahead there he said to the captain of his leading company  he has killed his man and will have something to report  right patiently they waited sabers drawn but dunning did not come in an hour the day broke and the whole force moved cautiously forward its commander not altogether satisfied with his faith in private dunning  the expedition had failed but something remained to be done  in the little open space off the road they found the fallen horse at a right angle across the animals neck face upward a bullet in the brain lay the body of trooper dunning stiff as a statue hours dead  examination disclosed abundant evidence that within a halfhour the cedar forest had been occupied by a strong force of confederate infantryan ambuscade    two military executions    in the spring of the year 1862 general buells big army lay in camp licking itself into shape for the campaign which resulted in the victory at shiloh  it was a raw untrained army although some of its fractions had seen hard enough service with a good deal of fighting in the mountains of western virginia and in kentucky the war was young and soldiering a new industry imperfectly understood by the young american of the period who found some features of it not altogether to his liking  chief among these was that essential part of discipline subordination  to one imbued from infancy with the fascinating fallacy that all men are born equal unquestioning submission to authority is not easily mastered and the american volunteer soldier in his green and salad days is among the worst known  that is how it happened that one of buells men private bennett story greene committed the indiscretion of striking his officer  later in the war he would not have done that like sir andrew aguecheek he would have seen him damned first but time for reformation of his military manners was denied him  he was promptly arrested on complaint of the officer tried by court martial and sentenced to be shot  you might have thrashed me and let it go at that said the condemned man to the complaining witness that is what you used to do at school when you were plain will dudley and i was as good as you  nobody saw me strike you discipline would not have suffered much  ben greene i guess you are right about that said the lieutenant will you forgive me  that is what i came to see you about  there was no reply and an officer putting his head in at the door of the guardtent where the conversation had occurred explained that the time allowed for the interview had expired  the next morning when in the presence of the whole brigade private greene was shot to death by a squad of his comrades lieutenant dudley turned his back upon the sorry performance and muttered a prayer for mercy in which himself was included  a few weeks afterward as buells leading division was being ferried over the tennessee river to assist in succoring grants beaten army night was coming on black and stormy  through the wreck of battle the division moved inch by inch in the direction of the enemy who had withdrawn a little to reform his lines  but for the lightning the darkness was absolute  never for a moment did it cease and ever when the thunder did not crack and roar were heard the moans of the wounded among whom the men felt their way with their feet and upon whom they stumbled in the gloom  the dead were there too there were dead aplenty  in the first faint gray of the morning when the swarming advance had paused to resume something of definition as a line of battle and skirmishers had been thrown forward word was passed along to call the roll  the first sergeant of lieutenant dudleys company stepped to the front and began to name the men in alphabetical order  he had no written roll but a good memory  the men answered to their names as he ran down the alphabet to g  gorham  here  grayrock  here  the sergeants good memory was affected by habit  greene  here  the response was clear distinct unmistakable  a sudden movement an agitation of the entire company front as from an electric shock attested the startling character of the incident the sergeant paled and paused  the captain strode quickly to his side and said sharply  call that name again  apparently the society for psychical research is not first in the field of curiosity concerning the unknown  bennett greene  here  all faces turned in the direction of the familiar voice the two men between whom in the order of stature greene had commonly stood in line turned and squarely confronted each other  once more commanded the inexorable investigator and once more camea trifle tremulouslythe name of the dead man  bennett story greene  here  at that instant a single rifleshot was heard away to the front beyond the skirmishline followed almost attended by the savage hiss of an approaching bullet which passing through the line struck audibly punctuating as with a full stop the captains exclamation what the devil does it mean  lieutenant dudley pushed through the ranks from his place in the rear  it means this he said throwing open his coat and displaying a visibly broadening stain of crimson on his breast  his knees gave way he fell awkwardly and lay dead  a little later the regiment was ordered out of line to relieve the congested front and through some misplay in the game of battle was not again under fire  nor did bennett greene expert in military executions ever again signify his presence at one     some haunted houses     the isle of pines    for many years there lived near the town of gallipolis ohio an old man named herman deluse  very little was known of his history for he would neither speak of it himself nor suffer others  it was a common belief among his neighbors that he had been a pirateif upon any better evidence than his collection of boarding pikes cutlasses and ancient flintlock pistols no one knew  he lived entirely alone in a small house of four rooms falling rapidly into decay and never repaired further than was required by the weather it stood on a slight elevation in the midst of a large stony field overgrown with brambles and cultivated in patches and only in the most primitive way  it was his only visible property but could hardly have yielded him a living simple and few as were his wants he seemed always to have ready money and paid cash for all his purchases at the village stores roundabout seldom buying more than two or three times at the same place until after the lapse of a considerable time  he got no commendation however for this equitable distribution of his patronage people were disposed to regard it as an ineffectual attempt to conceal his possession of so much money  that he had great hoards of illgotten gold buried somewhere about his tumbledown dwelling was not reasonably to be doubted by any honest soul conversant with the facts of local tradition and gifted with a sense of the fitness of things  on the 9th of november 1867 the old man died at least his dead body was discovered on the 10th and physicians testified that death had occurred about twentyfour hours previouslyprecisely how they were unable to say for the postmortem examination showed every organ to be absolutely healthy with no indication of disorder or violence  according to them death must have taken place about noonday yet the body was found in bed  the verdict of the coroners jury was that he came to his death by a visitation of god  the body was buried and the public administrator took charge of the estate  a rigorous search disclosed nothing more than was already known about the dead man and much patient excavation here and there about the premises by thoughtful and thrifty neighbors went unrewarded the administrator locked up the house against the time when the property real and personal should be sold by law with a view to defraying partly the expenses of the sale  the night of november 20 was boisterous  a furious gale stormed across the country scourging it with desolating drifts of sleet great trees were torn from the earth and hurled across the roads so wild a night had never been known in all that region but toward morning the storm had blown itself out of breath and day dawned bright and clear  at about eight oclock that morning the rev henry galbraith a wellknown and highly esteemed lutheran minister arrived on foot at his house a mile and a half from the deluse place  mr galbraith had been for a month in cincinnati  he had come up the river in a steamboat and landing at gallipolis the previous evening had immediately obtained a horse and buggy and set out for home  the violence of the storm had delayed him over night and in the morning the fallen trees had compelled him to abandon his conveyance and continue his journey afoot  but where did you pass the night inquired his wife after he had briefly related his adventure  with old deluse at the isle of pines 1 was the laughing reply and a glum enough time i had of it  he made no objection to my remaining but not a word could i get out of him  fortunately for the interests of truth there was present at this conversation mr robert mosely maren a lawyer and litterateur of columbus the same who wrote the delightful mellowcraft papers noting but apparently not sharing the astonishment caused by mr galbraiths answer this readywitted person checked by a gesture the exclamations that would naturally have followed and tranquilly inquired  how came you to go in there  this is mr marens version of mr galbraiths reply  i saw a light moving about the house and being nearly blinded by the sleet and half frozen besides drove in at the gate and put up my horse in the old rail stable where it is now  i then rapped at the door and getting no invitation went in without one  the room was dark but having matches i found a candle and lit it  i tried to enter the adjoining room but the door was fast and although i heard the old mans heavy footsteps in there he made no response to my calls  there was no fire on the hearth so i made one and laying sic down before it with my overcoat under my head prepared myself for sleep  pretty soon the door that i had tried silently opened and the old man came in carrying a candle  i spoke to him pleasantly apologizing for my intrusion but he took no notice of me  he seemed to be searching for something though his eyes were unmoved in their sockets  i wonder if he ever walks in his sleep he took a circuit a part of the way round the room and went out the same way he had come in  twice more before i slept he came back into the room acting precisely the same way and departing as at first  in the intervals i heard him tramping all over the house his footsteps distinctly audible in the pauses of the storm  when i woke in the morning he had already gone out  mr maren attempted some further questioning but was unable longer to restrain the familys tongues the story of deluses death and burial came out greatly to the good ministers astonishment  the explanation of your adventure is very simple said mr maren i dont believe old deluse walks in his sleepnot in his present one but you evidently dream in yours  and to this view of the matter mr galbraith was compelled reluctantly to assent  nevertheless a late hour of the next night found these two gentlemen accompanied by a son of the minister in the road in front of the old deluse house  there was a light inside it appeared now at one window and now at another  the three men advanced to the door  just as they reached it there came from the interior a confusion of the most appalling soundsthe clash of weapons steel against steel sharp explosions as of firearms shrieks of women groans and the curses of men in combat  the investigators stood a moment irresolute frightened  then mr galbraith tried the door  it was fast  but the minister was a man of courage a man moreover of herculean strength  he retired a pace or two and rushed against the door striking it with his right shoulder and bursting it from the frame with a loud crash  in a moment the three were inside  darkness and silence  the only sound was the beating of their hearts  mr maren had provided himself with matches and a candle  with some difficulty begotten of his excitement he made a light and they proceeded to explore the place passing from room to room everything was in orderly arrangement as it had been left by the sheriff nothing had been disturbed  a light coating of dust was everywhere  a back door was partly open as if by neglect and their first thought was that the authors of the awful revelry might have escaped  the door was opened and the light of the candle shone through upon the ground  the expiring effort of the previous nights storm had been a light fall of snow there were no footprints the white surface was unbroken  they closed the door and entered the last room of the four that the house containedthat farthest from the road in an angle of the building  here the candle in mr marens hand was suddenly extinguished as by a draught of air  almost immediately followed the sound of a heavy fall when the candle had been hastily relighted young mr galbraith was seen prostrate on the floor at a little distance from the others he was dead  in one hand the body grasped a heavy sack of coins which later examination showed to be all of old spanish mintage directly over the body as it lay a board had been torn from its fastenings in the wall and from the cavity so disclosed it was evident that the bag had been taken  another inquest was held  another postmortem examination failed to reveal a probable cause of death  another verdict of the visitation of god left all at liberty to form their own conclusions  mr maren contended that the young man died of excitement    a fruitless assignment    henry saylor who was killed in covington in a quarrel with antonio finch was a reporter on the cincinnati commercial  in the year 1859 a vacant dwelling in vine street in cincinnati became the center of a local excitement because of the strange sights and sounds said to be observed in it nightly  according to the testimony of many reputable residents of the vicinity these were inconsistent with any other hypothesis than that the house was haunted  figures with something singularly unfamiliar about them were seen by crowds on the sidewalk to pass in and out  no one could say just where they appeared upon the open lawn on their way to the front door by which they entered nor at exactly what point they vanished as they came out or rather while each spectator was positive enough about these matters no two agreed  they were all similarly at variance in their descriptions of the figures themselves  some of the bolder of the curious throng ventured on several evenings to stand upon the doorsteps to intercept them or failing in this get a nearer look at them  these courageous men it was said were unable to force the door by their united strength and always were hurled from the steps by some invisible agency and severely injured the door immediately afterward opening apparently of its own volition to admit or free some ghostly guest  the dwelling was known as the roscoe house a family of that name having lived there for some years and then one by one disappeared the last to leave being an old woman  stories of foul play and successive murders had always been rife but never were authenticated  one day during the prevalence of the excitement saylor presented himself at the office of the commercial for orders  he received a note from the city editor which read as follows  go and pass the night alone in the haunted house in vine street and if anything occurs worth while make two columns  saylor obeyed his superior he could not afford to lose his position on the paper  apprising the police of his intention he effected an entrance through a rear window before dark walked through the deserted rooms bare of furniture dusty and desolate and seating himself at last in the parlor on an old sofa which he had dragged in from another room watched the deepening of the gloom as night came on before it was altogether dark the curious crowd had collected in the street silent as a rule and expectant with here and there a scoffer uttering his incredulity and courage with scornful remarks or ribald cries  none knew of the anxious watcher inside  he feared to make a light the uncurtained windows would have betrayed his presence subjecting him to insult possibly to injury moreover he was too conscientious to do anything to enfeeble his impressions and unwilling to alter any of the customary conditions under which the manifestations were said to occur  it was now dark outside but light from the street faintly illuminated the part of the room that he was in  he had set open every door in the whole interior above and below but all the outer ones were locked and bolted  sudden exclamations from the crowd caused him to spring to the window and look out  he saw the figure of a man moving rapidly across the lawn toward the buildingsaw it ascend the steps then a projection of the wall concealed it  there was a noise as of the opening and closing of the hall door he heard quick heavy footsteps along the passageheard them ascend the stairsheard them on the uncarpeted floor of the chamber immediately overhead  saylor promptly drew his pistol and groping his way up the stairs entered the chamber dimly lighted from the street  no one was there  he heard footsteps in an adjoining room and entered that it was dark and silent  he struck his foot against some object on the floor knelt by it passed his hand over it  it was a human headthat of a woman  lifting it by the hair this ironnerved man returned to the halflighted room below carried it near the window and attentively examined it  while so engaged he was half conscious of the rapid opening and closing of the outer door of footfalls sounding all about him  he raised his eyes from the ghastly object of his attention and saw himself the center of a crowd of men and women dimly seen the room was thronged with them  he thought the people had broken in  ladies and gentlemen he said coolly you see me under suspicious circumstances buthis voice was drowned in peals of laughtersuch laughter as is heard in asylums for the insane  the persons about him pointed at the object in his hand and their merriment increased as he dropped it and it went rolling among their feet  they danced about it with gestures grotesque and attitudes obscene and indescribable  they struck it with their feet urging it about the room from wall to wall pushed and overthrew one another in their struggles to kick it cursed and screamed and sang snatches of ribald songs as the battered head bounded about the room as if in terror and trying to escape  at last it shot out of the door into the hall followed by all with tumultuous haste  that moment the door closed with a sharp concussion  saylor was alone in dead silence  carefully putting away his pistol which all the time he had held in his hand he went to a window and looked out  the street was deserted and silent the lamps were extinguished the roofs and chimneys of the houses were sharply outlined against the dawnlight in the east  he left the house the door yielding easily to his hand and walked to the commercial office  the city editor was still in his officeasleep  saylor waked him and said  i have been at the haunted house  the editor stared blankly as if not wholly awake  good god he cried are you saylor  yeswhy not  the editor made no answer but continued staring  i passed the night thereit seems said saylor  they say that things were uncommonly quiet out there the editor said trifling with a paperweight upon which he had dropped his eyes did anything occur  nothing whatever    a vine on a house    about three miles from the little town of norton in missouri on the road leading to maysville stands an old house that was last occupied by a family named harding  since 1886 no one has lived in it nor is anyone likely to live in it again  time and the disfavor of persons dwelling thereabout are converting it into a rather picturesque ruin  an observer unacquainted with its history would hardly put it into the category of haunted houses yet in all the region round such is its evil reputation  its windows are without glass its doorways without doors there are wide breaches in the shingle roof and for lack of paint the weatherboarding is a dun gray  but these unfailing signs of the supernatural are partly concealed and greatly softened by the abundant foliage of a large vine overrunning the entire structure  this vineof a species which no botanist has ever been able to namehas an important part in the story of the house  the harding family consisted of robert harding his wife matilda miss julia went who was her sister and two young children  robert harding was a silent coldmannered man who made no friends in the neighborhood and apparently cared to make none  he was about forty years old frugal and industrious and made a living from the little farm which is now overgrown with brush and brambles  he and his sisterinlaw were rather tabooed by their neighbors who seemed to think that they were seen too frequently togethernot entirely their fault for at these times they evidently did not challenge observation  the moral code of rural missouri is stern and exacting  mrs harding was a gentle sadeyed woman lacking a left foot  at some time in 1884 it became known that she had gone to visit her mother in iowa  that was what her husband said in reply to inquiries and his manner of saying it did not encourage further questioning  she never came back and two years later without selling his farm or anything that was his or appointing an agent to look after his interests or removing his household goods harding with the rest of the family left the country  nobody knew whither he went nobody at that time cared  naturally whatever was movable about the place soon disappeared and the deserted house became haunted in the manner of its kind  one summer evening four or five years later the rev j gruber of norton and a maysville attorney named hyatt met on horseback in front of the harding place  having business matters to discuss they hitched their animals and going to the house sat on the porch to talk  some humorous reference to the somber reputation of the place was made and forgotten as soon as uttered and they talked of their business affairs until it grew almost dark  the evening was oppressively warm the air stagnant  presently both men started from their seats in surprise  a long vine that covered half the front of the house and dangled its branches from the edge of the porch above them was visibly and audibly agitated shaking violently in every stem and leaf  we shall have a storm hyatt exclaimed  gruber said nothing but silently directed the others attention to the foliage of adjacent trees which showed no movement even the delicate tips of the boughs silhouetted against the clear sky were motionless  they hastily passed down the steps to what had been a lawn and looked upward at the vine whose entire length was now visible  it continued in violent agitation yet they could discern no disturbing cause  let us leave said the minister  and leave they did  forgetting that they had been traveling in opposite directions they rode away together  they went to norton where they related their strange experience to several discreet friends  the next evening at about the same hour accompanied by two others whose names are not recalled they were again on the porch of the harding house and again the mysterious phenomenon occurred  the vine was violently agitated while under the closest scrutiny from root to tip nor did their combined strength applied to the trunk serve to still it  after an hours observation they retreated no less wise it is thought than when they had come  no great time was required for these singular facts to rouse the curiosity of the entire neighborhood  by day and by night crowds of persons assembled at the harding house seeking a sign  it does not appear that any found it yet so credible were the witnesses mentioned that none doubted the reality of the manifestations to which they testified  by either a happy inspiration or some destructive design it was one day proposednobody appeared to know from whom the suggestion came to dig up the vine and after a good deal of debate this was done nothing was found but the root yet nothing could have been more strange  for five or six feet from the trunk which had at the surface of the ground a diameter of several inches it ran downward single and straight into a loose friable earth then it divided and subdivided into rootlets fibers and filaments most curiously interwoven  when carefully freed from soil they showed a singular formation  in their ramifications and doublings back upon themselves they made a compact network having in size and shape an amazing resemblance to the human figure  head trunk and limbs were there even the fingers and toes were distinctly defined and many professed to see in the distribution and arrangement of the fibers in the globular mass representing the head a grotesque suggestion of a face  the figure was horizontal the smaller roots had begun to unite at the breast  in point of resemblance to the human form this image was imperfect at about ten inches from one of the knees the cilia forming that leg had abruptly doubled backward and inward upon their course of growth  the figure lacked the left foot  there was but one inferencethe obvious one but in the ensuing excitement as many courses of action were proposed as there were incapable counselors  the matter was settled by the sheriff of the county who as the lawful custodian of the abandoned estate ordered the root replaced and the excavation filled with the earth that had been removed  later inquiry brought out only one fact of relevancy and significance  mrs harding had never visited her relatives in iowa nor did they know that she was supposed to have done so  of robert harding and the rest of his family nothing is known  the house retains its evil reputation but the replanted vine is as orderly and wellbehaved a vegetable as a nervous person could wish to sit under of a pleasant night when the katydids grate out their immemorial revelation and the distant whippoorwill signifies his notion of what ought to be done about it    at old man eckerts    philip eckert lived for many years in an old weatherstained wooden house about three miles from the little town of marion in vermont there must be quite a number of persons living who remember him not unkindly i trust and know something of the story that i am about to tell  old man eckert as he was always called was not of a sociable disposition and lived alone  as he was never known to speak of his own affairs nobody thereabout knew anything of his past nor of his relatives if he had any  without being particularly ungracious or repellent in manner or speech he managed somehow to be immune to impertinent curiosity yet exempt from the evil repute with which it commonly revenges itself when baffled so far as i know mr eckerts renown as a reformed assassin or a retired pirate of the spanish main had not reached any ear in marion  he got his living cultivating a small and not very fertile farm  one day he disappeared and a prolonged search by his neighbors failed to turn him up or throw any light upon his whereabouts or whyabouts  nothing indicated preparation to leave  all was as he might have left it to go to the spring for a bucket of water  for a few weeks little else was talked of in that region then old man eckert became a village tale for the ear of the stranger  i do not know what was done regarding his propertythe correct legal thing doubtless  the house was standing still vacant and conspicuously unfit when i last heard of it some twenty years afterward  of course it came to be considered haunted and the customary tales were told of moving lights dolorous sounds and startling apparitions  at one time about five years after the disappearance these stories of the supernatural became so rife or through some attesting circumstances seemed so important that some of marions most serious citizens deemed it well to investigate and to that end arranged for a night session on the premises  the parties to this undertaking were john holcomb an apothecary wilson merle a lawyer and andrus c palmer the teacher of the public school all men of consequence and repute  they were to meet at holcombs house at eight oclock in the evening of the appointed day and go together to the scene of their vigil where certain arrangements for their comfort a provision of fuel and the like for the season was winter had been already made  palmer did not keep the engagement and after waiting a halfhour for him the others went to the eckert house without him  they established themselves in the principal room before a glowing fire and without other light than it gave awaited events  it had been agreed to speak as little as possible  they did not even renew the exchange of views regarding the defection of palmer which had occupied their minds on the way  probably an hour had passed without incident when they heard not without emotion doubtless the sound of an opening door in the rear of the house followed by footfalls in the room adjoining that in which they sat  the watchers rose to their feet but stood firm prepared for whatever might ensue  a long silence followedhow long neither would afterward undertake to say  then the door between the two rooms opened and a man entered  it was palmer  he was pale as if from excitementas pale as the others felt themselves to be  his manner too was singularly distrait  he neither responded to their salutations nor so much as looked at them but walked slowly across the room in the light of the failing fire and opening the front door passed out into the darkness  it seems to have been the first thought of both men that palmer was suffering from frightthat something seen heard or imagined in the back room had deprived him of his senses  acting on the same friendly impulse both ran after him through the open door  but neither they nor anyone ever again saw or heard of andrus palmer  this much was ascertained the next morning  during the session of messrs holcomb and merle at the haunted house a new snow had fallen to a depth of several inches upon the old  in this snow palmers trail from his lodging in the village to the back door of the eckert house was conspicuous  but there it ended  from the front door nothing led away but the tracks of the two men who swore that he preceded them  palmers disappearance was as complete as that of old man eckert himselfwhom indeed the editor of the local paper somewhat graphically accused of having reached out and pulled him in    the spook house    on the road leading north from manchester in eastern kentucky to booneville twenty miles away stood in 1862 a wooden plantation house of a somewhat better quality than most of the dwellings in that region  the house was destroyed by fire in the year following probably by some stragglers from the retreating column of general george w morgan when he was driven from cumberland gap to the ohio river by general kirby smith  at the time of its destruction it had for four or five years been vacant  the fields about it were overgrown with brambles the fences gone even the few negro quarters and outhouses generally fallen partly into ruin by neglect and pillage for the negroes and poor whites of the vicinity found in the building and fences an abundant supply of fuel of which they availed themselves without hesitation openly and by daylight  by daylight alone after nightfall no human being except passing strangers ever went near the place  it was known as the spook house  that it was tenanted by evil spirits visible audible and active no one in all that region doubted any more than he doubted what he was told of sundays by the traveling preacher  its owners opinion of the matter was unknown he and his family had disappeared one night and no trace of them had ever been found  they left everythinghousehold goods clothing provisions the horses in the stable the cows in the field the negroes in the quartersall as it stood nothing was missing except a man a woman three girls a boy and a babe  it was not altogether surprising that a plantation where seven human beings could be simultaneously effaced and nobody the wiser should be under some suspicion  one night in june 1859 two citizens of frankfort col j c mcardle a lawyer and judge myron veigh of the state militia were driving from booneville to manchester  their business was so important that they decided to push on despite the darkness and the mutterings of an approaching storm which eventually broke upon them just as they arrived opposite the spook house  the lightning was so incessant that they easily found their way through the gateway and into a shed where they hitched and unharnessed their team they then went to the house through the rain and knocked at all the doors without getting any response  attributing this to the continuous uproar of the thunder they pushed at one of the doors which yielded  they entered without further ceremony and closed the door  that instant they were in darkness and silence  not a gleam of the lightnings unceasing blaze penetrated the windows or crevices not a whisper of the awful tumult without reached them there  it was as if they had suddenly been stricken blind and deaf and mcardle afterward said that for a moment he believed himself to have been killed by a stroke of lightning as he crossed the threshold  the rest of this adventure can as well be related in his own words from the frankfort advocate of august 6 1876  when i had somewhat recovered from the dazing effect of the transition from uproar to silence my first impulse was to reopen the door which i had closed and from the knob of which i was not conscious of having removed my hand i felt it distinctly still in the clasp of my fingers  my notion was to ascertain by stepping again into the storm whether i had been deprived of sight and hearing  i turned the doorknob and pulled open the door  it led into another room  this apartment was suffused with a faint greenish light the source of which i could not determine making everything distinctly visible though nothing was sharply defined  everything i say but in truth the only objects within the blank stone walls of that room were human corpses  in number they were perhaps eight or tenit may well be understood that i did not truly count them  they were of different ages or rather sizes from infancy up and of both sexes  all were prostrate on the floor excepting one apparently a young woman who sat up her back supported by an angle of the wall a babe was clasped in the arms of another and older woman  a half grown lad lay face downward across the legs of a fullbearded man one or two were nearly naked and the hand of a young girl held the fragment of a gown which she had torn open at the breast  the bodies were in various stages of decay all greatly shrunken in face and figure  some were but little more than skeletons  while i stood stupefied with horror by this ghastly spectacle and still holding open the door by some unaccountable perversity my attention was diverted from the shocking scene and concerned itself with trifles and details  perhaps my mind with an instinct of selfpreservation sought relief in matters which would relax its dangerous tension  among other things i observed that the door that i was holding open was of heavy iron plates riveted equidistant from one another and from the top and bottom three strong bolts protruded from the beveled edge  i turned the knob and they were retracted flush with the edge released it and they shot out  it was a spring lock  on the inside there was no knob nor any kind of projectiona smooth surface of iron  while noting these things with an interest and attention which it now astonishes me to recall i felt myself thrust aside and judge veigh whom in the intensity and vicissitudes of my feelings i had altogether forgotten pushed by me into the room  for gods sake i cried do not go in there  let us get out of this dreadful place  he gave no heed to my entreaties but as fearless a gentleman as lived in all the south walked quickly to the center of the room knelt beside one of the bodies for a closer examination and tenderly raised its blackened and shriveled head in his hands  a strong disagreeable odor came through the doorway completely overpowering me  my senses reeled i felt myself falling and in clutching at the edge of the door for support pushed it shut with a sharp click  i remember no more  six weeks later i recovered my reason in a hotel at manchester whither i had been taken by strangers the next day  for all these weeks i had suffered from a nervous fever attended with constant delirium  i had been found lying in the road several miles away from the house but how i had escaped from it to get there i never knew  on recovery or as soon as my physicians permitted me to talk i inquired the fate of judge veigh whom to quiet me as i now know they represented as well and at home  no one believed a word of my story and who can wonder  and who can imagine my grief when arriving at my home in frankfort two months later i learned that judge veigh had never been heard of since that night  i then regretted bitterly the pride which since the first few days after the recovery of my reason had forbidden me to repeat my discredited story and insist upon its truth  with all that afterward occurredthe examination of the house the failure to find any room corresponding to that which i have described the attempt to have me adjudged insane and my triumph over my accusersthe readers of the advocate are familiar  after all these years i am still confident that excavations which i have neither the legal right to undertake nor the wealth to make would disclose the secret of the disappearance of my unhappy friend and possibly of the former occupants and owners of the deserted and now destroyed house  i do not despair of yet bringing about such a search and it is a source of deep grief to me that it has been delayed by the undeserved hostility and unwise incredulity of the family and friends of the late judge veigh  colonel mcardle died in frankfort on the thirteenth day of december in the year 1879    the other lodgers    in order to take that train said colonel levering sitting in the waldorfastoria hotel you will have to remain nearly all night in atlanta  that is a fine city but i advise you not to put up at the breathitt house one of the principal hotels  it is an old wooden building in urgent need of repairs  there are breaches in the walls that you could throw a cat through  the bedrooms have no locks on the doors no furniture but a single chair in each and a bedstead without beddingjust a mattress  even these meager accommodations you cannot be sure that you will have in monopoly you must take your chance of being stowed in with a lot of others  sir it is a most abominable hotel  the night that i passed in it was an uncomfortable night  i got in late and was shown to my room on the ground floor by an apologetic nightclerk with a tallow candle which he considerately left with me  i was worn out by two days and a night of hard railway travel and had not entirely recovered from a gunshot wound in the head received in an altercation  rather than look for better quarters i lay down on the mattress without removing my clothing and fell asleep  along toward morning i awoke  the moon had risen and was shining in at the uncurtained window illuminating the room with a soft bluish light which seemed somehow a bit spooky though i dare say it had no uncommon quality all moonlight is that way if you will observe it  imagine my surprise and indignation when i saw the floor occupied by at least a dozen other lodgers  i sat up earnestly damning the management of that unthinkable hotel and was about to spring from the bed to go and make trouble for the night clerkhim of the apologetic manner and the tallow candlewhen something in the situation affected me with a strange indisposition to move  i suppose i was what a storywriter might call frozen with terror  for those men were obviously all dead  they lay on their backs disposed orderly along three sides of the room their feet to the wallsagainst the other wall farthest from the door stood my bed and the chair  all the faces were covered but under their white cloths the features of the two bodies that lay in the square patch of moonlight near the window showed in sharp profile as to nose and chin  i thought this a bad dream and tried to cry out as one does in a nightmare but could make no sound  at last with a desperate effort i threw my feet to the floor and passing between the two rows of clouted faces and the two bodies that lay nearest the door i escaped from the infernal place and ran to the office  the night clerk was there behind the desk sitting in the dim light of another tallow candlejust sitting and staring  he did not rise my abrupt entrance produced no effect upon him though i must have looked a veritable corpse myself  it occurred to me then that i had not before really observed the fellow  he was a little chap with a colorless face and the whitest blankest eyes i ever saw  he had no more expression than the back of my hand  his clothing was a dirty gray  damn you i said what do you mean  just the same i was shaking like a leaf in the wind and did not recognize my own voice  the nightclerk rose bowed apologetically andwell he was no longer there and at that moment i felt a hand laid upon my shoulder from behind  just fancy that if you can  unspeakably frightened i turned and saw a portly kindfaced gentleman who asked  what is the matter my friend  i was not long in telling him but before i made an end of it he went pale himself  see here he said are you telling the truth  i had now got myself in hand and terror had given place to indignation  if you dare to doubt it i said ill hammer the life out of you  no he replied dont do that just sit down till i tell you this is not a hotel  it used to be afterward it was a hospital now it is unoccupied awaiting a tenant  the room that you mention was the deadroomthere were always plenty of dead  the fellow that you call the nightclerk used to be that but later he booked the patients as they were brought in  i dont understand his being here  he has been dead a few weeks  and who are you i blurted out  oh i look after the premises  i happened to be passing just now and seeing a light in here came in to investigate  let us have a look into that room he added lifting the sputtering candle from the desk  ill see you at the devil first said i bolting out of the door into the street  sir that breathitt house in atlanta is a beastly place  dont you stop there  god forbid  your account of it certainly does not suggest comfort by the way colonel when did all that occur  in september 1864shortly after the siege    the thing at nolan    to the south of where the road between leesville and hardy in the state of missouri crosses the east fork of may creek stands an abandoned house  nobody has lived in it since the summer of 1879 and it is fast going to pieces  for some three years before the date mentioned above it was occupied by the family of charles may from one of whose ancestors the creek near which it stands took its name  mr mays family consisted of a wife an adult son and two young girls  the sons name was johnthe names of the daughters are unknown to the writer of this sketch  john may was of a morose and surly disposition not easily moved to anger but having an uncommon gift of sullen implacable hate  his father was quite otherwise of a sunny jovial disposition but with a quick temper like a sudden flame kindled in a wisp of straw which consumes it in a flash and is no more  he cherished no resentments and his anger gone was quick to make overtures for reconciliation he had a brother living near by who was unlike him in respect of all this and it was a current witticism in the neighborhood that john had inherited his disposition from his uncle  one day a misunderstanding arose between father and son harsh words ensued and the father struck the son full in the face with his fist  john quietly wiped away the blood that followed the blow fixed his eyes upon the already penitent offender and said with cold composure you will die for that  the words were overheard by two brothers named jackson who were approaching the men at the moment but seeing them engaged in a quarrel they retired apparently unobserved  charles may afterward related the unfortunate occurrence to his wife and explained that he had apologized to the son for the hasty blow but without avail the young man not only rejected his overtures but refused to withdraw his terrible threat  nevertheless there was no open rupture of relations  john continued living with the family and things went on very much as before  one sunday morning in june 1879 about two weeks after what has been related may senior left the house immediately after breakfast taking a spade  he said he was going to make an excavation at a certain spring in a wood about a mile away so that the cattle could obtain water  john remained in the house for some hours variously occupied in shaving himself writing letters and reading a newspaper  his manner was very nearly what it usually was perhaps he was a trifle more sullen and surly  at two oclock he left the house  at five he returned  for some reason not connected with any interest in his movements and which is not now recalled the time of his departure and that of his return were noted by his mother and sisters as was attested at his trial for murder  it was observed that his clothing was wet in spots as if so the prosecution afterward pointed out he had been removing bloodstains from it  his manner was strange his look wild  he complained of illness and going to his room took to his bed  may senior did not return  later that evening the nearest neighbors were aroused and during that night and the following day a search was prosecuted through the wood where the spring was  it resulted in little but the discovery of both mens footprints in the clay about the spring  john may in the meantime had grown rapidly worse with what the local physician called brain fever and in his delirium raved of murder but did not say whom he conceived to have been murdered nor whom he imagined to have done the deed  but his threat was recalled by the brothers jackson and he was arrested on suspicion and a deputy sheriff put in charge of him at his home public opinion ran strongly against him and but for his illness he would probably have been hanged by a mob  as it was a meeting of the neighbors was held on tuesday and a committee appointed to watch the case and take such action at any time as circumstances might seem to warrant  on wednesday all was changed  from the town of nolan eight miles away came a story which put a quite different light on the matter nolan consisted of a school house a blacksmiths shop a store and a halfdozen dwellings  the store was kept by one henry odell a cousin of the elder may  on the afternoon of the sunday of mays disappearance mr odell and four of his neighbors men of credibility were sitting in the store smoking and talking  it was a warm day and both the front and the back door were open  at about three oclock charles may who was well known to three of them entered at the front door and passed out at the rear  he was without hat or coat  he did not look at them nor return their greeting a circumstance which did not surprise for he was evidently seriously hurt  above the left eyebrow was a wounda deep gash from which the blood flowed covering the whole left side of the face and neck and saturating his lightgray shirt  oddly enough the thought uppermost in the minds of all was that he had been fighting and was going to the brook directly at the back of the store to wash himself  perhaps there was a feeling of delicacya backwoods etiquette which restrained them from following him to offer assistance the court records from which mainly this narrative is drawn are silent as to anything but the fact  they waited for him to return but he did not return  bordering the brook behind the store is a forest extending for six miles back to the medicine lodge hills  as soon as it became known in the neighborhood of the missing mans dwelling that he had been seen in nolan there was a marked alteration in public sentiment and feeling  the vigilance committee went out of existence without the formality of a resolution  search along the wooded bottom lands of may creek was stopped and nearly the entire male population of the region took to beating the bush about nolan and in the medicine lodge hills  but of the missing man no trace was found  one of the strangest circumstances of this strange case is the formal indictment and trial of a man for murder of one whose body no human being professed to have seenone not known to be dead  we are all more or less familiar with the vagaries and eccentricities of frontier law but this instance it is thought is unique however that may be it is of record that on recovering from his illness john may was indicted for the murder of his missing father counsel for the defense appears not to have demurred and the case was tried on its merits  the prosecution was spiritless and perfunctory the defense easily establishedwith regard to the deceasedan alibi  if during the time in which john may must have killed charles may if he killed him at all charles may was miles away from where john may must have been it is plain that the deceased must have come to his death at the hands of someone else  john may was acquitted immediately left the country and has never been heard of from that day  shortly afterward his mother and sisters removed to st louis  the farm having passed into the possession of a man who owns the land adjoining and has a dwelling of his own the may house has ever since been vacant and has the somber reputation of being haunted  one day after the may family had left the country some boys playing in the woods along may creek found concealed under a mass of dead leaves but partly exposed by the rooting of hogs a spade nearly new and bright except for a spot on one edge which was rusted and stained with blood  the implement had the initials c m cut into the handle  this discovery renewed in some degree the public excitement of a few months before  the earth near the spot where the spade was found was carefully examined and the result was the finding of the dead body of a man  it had been buried under two or three feet of soil and the spot covered with a layer of dead leaves and twigs there was but little decomposition a fact attributed to some preservative property in the mineralbearing soil  above the left eyebrow was a wounda deep gash from which blood had flowed covering the whole left side of the face and neck and saturating the lightgray shirt  the skull had been cut through by the blow  the body was that of charles may  but what was it that passed through mr odells store at nolan     mysterious disappearances     the difficulty of crossing a field    one morning in july 1854 a planter named williamson living six miles from selma alabama was sitting with his wife and a child on the veranda of his dwelling  immediately in front of the house was a lawn perhaps fifty yards in extent between the house and public road or as it was called the pike  beyond this road lay a closecropped pasture of some ten acres level and without a tree rock or any natural or artificial object on its surface  at the time there was not even a domestic animal in the field  in another field beyond the pasture a dozen slaves were at work under an overseer  throwing away the stump of a cigar the planter rose saying  i forgot to tell andrew about those horses  andrew was the overseer  williamson strolled leisurely down the gravel walk plucking a flower as he went passed across the road and into the pasture pausing a moment as he closed the gate leading into it to greet a passing neighbor armour wren who lived on an adjoining plantation mr wren was in an open carriage with his son james a lad of thirteen  when he had driven some two hundred yards from the point of meeting mr wren said to his son  i forgot to tell mr williamson about those horses  mr wren had sold to mr williamson some horses which were to have been sent for that day but for some reason not now remembered it would be inconvenient to deliver them until the morrow  the coachman was directed to drive back and as the vehicle turned williamson was seen by all three walking leisurely across the pasture  at that moment one of the coach horses stumbled and came near falling  it had no more than fairly recovered itself when james wren cried  why father what has become of mr williamson  it is not the purpose of this narrative to answer that question  mr wrens strange account of the matter given under oath in the course of legal proceedings relating to the williamson estate here follows  my sons exclamation caused me to look toward the spot where i had seen the deceased sic an instant before but he was not there nor was he anywhere visible  i cannot say that at the moment i was greatly startled or realized the gravity of the occurrence though i thought it singular  my son however was greatly astonished and kept repeating his question in different forms until we arrived at the gate  my black boy sam was similarly affected even in a greater degree but i reckon more by my sons manner than by anything he had himself observed  this sentence in the testimony was stricken out  as we got out of the carriage at the gate of the field and while sam was hanging sic the team to the fence mrs williamson with her child in her arms and followed by several servants came running down the walk in great excitement crying he is gone he is gone  o god what an awful thing and many other such exclamations which i do not distinctly recollect  i got from them the impression that they related to something morethan the mere disappearance of her husband even if that had occurred before her eyes  her manner was wild but not more so i think than was natural under the circumstances  i have no reason to think she had at that time lost her mind  i have never since seen nor heard of mr williamson  this testimony as might have been expected was corroborated in almost every particular by the only other eyewitness if that is a proper termthe lad james  mrs williamson had lost her reason and the servants were of course not competent to testify  the boy james wren had declared at first that he saw the disappearance but there is nothing of this in his testimony given in court  none of the field hands working in the field to which williamson was going had seen him at all and the most rigorous search of the entire plantation and adjoining country failed to supply a clew  the most monstrous and grotesque fictions originating with the blacks were current in that part of the state for many years and probably are to this day but what has been here related is all that is certainly known of the matter  the courts decided that williamson was dead and his estate was distributed according to law    an unfinished race    james burne worson was a shoemaker who lived in leamington warwickshire england  he had a little shop in one of the byways leading off the road to warwick  in his humble sphere he was esteemed an honest man although like many of his class in english towns he was somewhat addicted to drink  when in liquor he would make foolish wagers  on one of these too frequent occasions he was boasting of his prowess as a pedestrian and athlete and the outcome was a match against nature  for a stake of one sovereign he undertook to run all the way to coventry and back a distance of something more than forty miles  this was on the 3d day of september in 1873  he set out at once the man with whom he had made the betwhose name is not rememberedaccompanied by barham wise a linen draper and hamerson burns a photographer i think following in a light cart or wagon  for several miles worson went on very well at an easy gait without apparent fatigue for he had really great powers of endurance and was not sufficiently intoxicated to enfeeble them  the three men in the wagon kept a short distance in the rear giving him occasional friendly chaff or encouragement as the spirit moved them suddenlyin the very middle of the roadway not a dozen yards from them and with their eyes full upon himthe man seemed to stumble pitched headlong forward uttered a terrible cry and vanished  he did not fall to the earthhe vanished before touching it  no trace of him was ever discovered  after remaining at and about the spot for some time with aimless irresolution the three men returned to leamington told their astonishing story and were afterward taken into custody  but they were of good standing had always been considered truthful were sober at the time of the occurrence and nothing ever transpired to discredit their sworn account of their extraordinary adventure concerning the truth of which nevertheless public opinion was divided throughout the united kingdom  if they had something to conceal their choice of means is certainly one of the most amazing ever made by sane human beings    charles ashmores trail    the family of christian ashmore consisted of his wife his mother two grown daughters and a son of sixteen years  they lived in troy new york were welltodo respectable persons and had many friends some of whom reading these lines will doubtless learn for the first time the extraordinary fate of the young man  from troy the ashmores moved in 1871 or 1872 to richmond indiana and a year or two later to the vicinity of quincy illinois where mr ashmore bought a farm and lived on it  at some little distance from the farmhouse was a spring with a constant flow of clear cold water whence the family derived its supply for domestic use at all seasons  on the evening of the 9th of november in 1878 at about nine oclock young charles ashmore left the family circle about the hearth took a tin bucket and started toward the spring  as he did not return the family became uneasy and going to the door by which he had left the house his father called without receiving an answer  he then lighted a lantern and with the eldest daughter martha who insisted on accompanying him went in search  a light snow had fallen obliterating the path but making the young mans trail conspicuous each footprint was plainly defined  after going a little more than halfwayperhaps seventyfive yardsthe father who was in advance halted and elevating his lantern stood peering intently into the darkness ahead  what is the matter father the girl asked  this was the matter  the trail of the young man had abruptly ended and all beyond was smooth unbroken snow  the last footprints were as conspicuous as any in the line the very nailmarks were distinctly visible  mr ashmore looked upward shading his eyes with his hat held between them and the lantern  the stars were shining there was not a cloud in the sky he was denied the explanation which had suggested itself doubtful as it would have beena new snowfall with a limit so plainly defined  taking a wide circuit round the ultimate tracks so as to leave them undisturbed for further examination the man proceeded to the spring the girl following weak and terrified  neither had spoken a word of what both had observed  the spring was covered with ice hours old  returning to the house they noted the appearance of the snow on both sides of the trail its entire length  no tracks led away from it  the morning light showed nothing more  smooth spotless unbroken the shallow snow lay everywhere  four days later the griefstricken mother herself went to the spring for water  she came back and related that in passing the spot where the footprints had ended she had heard the voice of her son and had been eagerly calling to him wandering about the place as she had fancied the voice to be now in one direction now in another until she was exhausted with fatigue and emotion  questioned as to what the voice had said she was unable to tell yet averred that the words were perfectly distinct  in a moment the entire family was at the place but nothing was heard and the voice was believed to be an hallucination caused by the mothers great anxiety and her disordered nerves  but for months afterward at irregular intervals of a few days the voice was heard by the several members of the family and by others  all declared it unmistakably the voice of charles ashmore all agreed that it seemed to come from a great distance faintly yet with entire distinctness of articulation yet none could determine its direction nor repeat its words  the intervals of silence grew longer and longer the voice fainter and farther and by midsummer it was heard no more  if anybody knows the fate of charles ashmore it is probably his mother  she is dead    science to the front    in connection with this subject of mysterious disappearanceof which every memory is stored with abundant exampleit is pertinent to note the belief of dr hem of leipsic not by way of explanation unless the reader may choose to take it so but because of its intrinsic interest as a singular speculation  this distinguished scientist has expounded his views in a book entitled verschwinden und seine theorie which has attracted some attention particularly says one writer among the followers of hegel and mathematicians who hold to the actual existence of a so called noneuclidean spacethat is to say of space which has more dimensions than length breadth and thicknessspace in which it would be possible to tie a knot in an endless cord and to turn a rubber ball inside out without a solution of its continuity or in other words without breaking or cracking it  dr hem believes that in the visible world there are void places vacua and something moreholes as it were through which animate and inanimate objects may fall into the invisible world and be seen and heard no more  the theory is something like this  space is pervaded by luminiferous ether which is a material thingas much a substance as air or water though almost infinitely more attenuated all force all forms of energy must be propagated in this every process must take place in it which takes place at all  but let us suppose that cavities exist in this otherwise universal medium as caverns exist in the earth or cells in a swiss cheese  in such a cavity there would be absolutely nothing  it would be such a vacuum as cannot be artificially produced for if we pump the air from a receiver there remains the luminiferous ether  through one of these cavities light could not pass for there would be nothing to bear it  sound could not come from it nothing could be felt in it  it would not have a single one of the conditions necessary to the action of any of our senses  in such a void in short nothing whatever could occur  now in the words of the writer before quotedthe learned doctor himself nowhere puts it so concisely  a man inclosed in such a closet could neither see nor be seen neither hear nor be heard neither feel nor be felt neither live nor die for both life and death are processes which can take place only where there is force and in empty space no force could exist  are these the awful conditions some will ask under which the friends of the lost are to think of them as existing and doomed forever to exist  baldly and imperfectly as here stated dr hems theory in so far as it professes to be an adequate explanation of mysterious disappearances is open to many obvious objections to fewer as he states it himself in the spacious volubility of his book  but even as expounded by its author it does not explain and in truth is incompatible with some incidents of the occurrences related in these memoranda  for example the sound of charles ashmores voice it is not my duty to indue facts and theories with affinity  ab    footnotes  1  the isle of pines was once a famous
